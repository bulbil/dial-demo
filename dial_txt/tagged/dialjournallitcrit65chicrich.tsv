		Si JF artmff & tty Journal of Criticism and SDtecusgton of Eitt rature anH TOe SLtt & The War Within the War Because human beings have a happy faculty of lightening the heaviest ills with the hope and fantasy of blessings to come , we are almost unanimous today in the belief that the sufferings of war are the birth pains of a world-wide social rebirth .

		As governments have been forced , by the very nature of modern war , to become if they are to be effective belligerents more autocratic with every passing month of war , we have written more and more buoyantly about the golden age of freedom that lurks around the corner of our tragedy .

		As the needs of finance and personnel have driven governments more and more into the administrative hands of `` successful '' and therefore of conserva - tive men , we have looked forward cheer - fully to a world purged and renewed under the auspices of liberal statesmen .

		And whatever discouragements the actual course of the war 's progress may bring , we console ourselves with the lullaby of the new social order that peace is trusted to bring .

		Let us understand it well : if this mountain of hope begets nothing but dis - illusion it will be because those who fear social reconstruction have been more alert than those who so confidently preach it and give it welcome .

		Hope , like doubt , is a starting point and not a goal ; con - clusions and realizations must be paid for in energy and action .

		While we fill halls and pages with our prophecies of a better world and then go home to our tea the men who desire the extension of that system under which , in time oi peace , they seized supremacy are now , in time of war , actively setting in motion the forces of obstruction , actively proceeding with their efforts to secure full control over state and federal governments , actively enlarging their power over the media of public information .

		And of course they will continue to preach and prophesy optimistically when this serves to deepen the slumber of the innocent who believe the new world a consummation fully assured .

		But just as capitalism became robust and international while the well - intentioned talked of its `` inevitable '' suicide -LRB- by a kind of Hegelian hara-kiri -RRB- , so this war which we ennoble with our ideals can end with reaction enthroned unless the lovers of a more decent world unite action with words .

		Consider the possibilities .

		Already the internationalization of financial monopo - lies has cut across political and patriotic frontiers .

		The intelligence of the men who possess financial control has given them a combined power which it behooves us to contemplate .

		For financial control has countless pseudopodia , reaching subtly everywhere , and with infinite variation .

		Consider that power in the advertisements , the editorials , and the headlines of the daily press : here is such power to mould human purpose and if need be to corrupt it as poor Gutenberg never dreamed of ; and at times one wonders whether or not democracy is doomed to drown in a sea of poisoned ink .

		Print is king , and the film is heir apparent ; soon every screen will preach reaction in seven reels .

		With this power to determine public opinion , and with this control over lending and investment , the gods of the status quo can threaten an overliberal government with almost irresistible assault .

		And the new world which President
Wilson	PERSON	would bring to birth may die silently struggling in the womb of unconcerted effort .

		With such control and such publicity , who knows but that a gullible majority may yet be made to clamor for a Japanese invasion of
Russia	LOCATION	, for coolie and conscript labor , for
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 20	DATE	universal service and militarization of the mind , and for any Prussian abnomination whatever that can be invoked in the name of those very ideals to further which the war is being fought ?

		Add to this the ex - penditure of countless millions on the support of reactionary candidates in
1918	DATE	and
1920	DATE	, and the well financed attempt to use both patriotism and pacifism against a liberal President , and we have a situa - tion which requires to be faced not with easy hopefulness but with laborious and particularizing thought .

		What kind of thinking does reconstruc - tion need ?

		We are still Germans in philosophy and incline to look on thought rather as a refuge than as a weapon , rather as a way of retreat from a recalcitrant reality into a kindlier world to be had for the imagining , than as a means of control for the realization of an imagined world .

		And as
Kant	PERSON	and his followers conceived a `` transcendental world '' in which the paraphernalia of pre-Enlightenment phil - osophy would still operate and console , while diligent lords steered back the state into the feudalism from which ^ Napoleon so nearly snatched it , so one is tempted today to shirk the shock which reality brings to the hardened categories of a senile thought and to take ^ refuge in the past or the future , in memories or Utopias , regrets or prophecies .

		The new social or - der is coming , and that is all there is to it .

		We suffer not only from the old diffi - culty of uniting a readiness for action with a capacity for analytic thought , but also from the old habit of conceiving thought as an instrument of understanding merely , rather than as an organ for the resynthesis of analyzed experience into effective response to a novel and fluent situation .

		We have taken it as our task to see things clearly and report them , to break up the indigestible wholes of social experience into manageable parts .

		But we have left to others the remunera - tive risks of action .

		We have diagnosed and gone away without prescribing .

		Bolder ones have prescribed and walked off with the fee .

		That the function of intelligence is to remake the world as well as to perceive and understand it this , which is as old an idea as almost any in philosophy , seems to be known only to those subtle gentlemen whose notion of remaking the world is essentially a notion of transferring its wealth into their cof - fers by magic manipulations .

		Another unhappy element in the situa - tion lies in this , that most men of the active type are as conservative by temper as most men of thought are liberal .

		Intelligence is liberal , because liberalism connotes the foresight that directively co - operates with necessary change ; most active people are conservative , because action fears a flux and fares best where the situation changes least .

		Active people are conservative , again , because `` success '' comes chiefly to active men and brings con - servatism with it ; whereas a large propor - tion of our thinkers are men who lack the qualities of action all thought being of the nature of hesitation .

		And always , it seems , this quality of hesitancy clings to thought and is its price ; so that men who are liberals because they think , and think because they are capable of doubt , are lost when the call to action sounds .

		Clearly the haters of the new are en - trenched in a position which can be successfully attacked only after the reso - lute abandonment of generalities for a study of details .

		This does not mean unmitigated specialism : thought may be precise and practical , yet richly rooted in philosophic breadth ; indeed , it must be so rooted if its precision and practicality are not to issue in self-cancelling futility .

		Liberal thinking must leave the vague or - bit of hopeful imagery and find the foci of specific mental effort .

		Already we see the control of a large section of the press , once edited by men of character and independence , passing into the hands of men who are continually sacrificing the vitality and coherence of our society to their instincts of mastery and acquisition .

		Can this evil be lessened or counteracted ?

		and just specifically how ?

		Can liberal journals be persuaded to undertake a concerted and running exposure of the misrepresentations indulged in by these elements of the press , each such journal conducting a department , so to speak , for

		Why should not these journals organize a bureau the function of which would be to inquire into all dubious statements of fact con - tained in reactionary propaganda -LRB- as , for example , in the campaign for Japanese intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	-RRB- and to serve these journals with verifiable material for ex - posure and rectification ?

		As another , and even more disturbing , example we have
Samuel Gompers	PERSON	and an autocratic polit - ical machine of the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	attempting to lay down the moral law to British and French and Italian labor -LRB- who , after all , have four years of fighting behind them -RRB- , presuming to tell
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	just when and under what conditions Allied labor will `` con - verse '' with German labor .

		Can nothing be done to people like Mr.

England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	to unite with American labor for a common front against the enemy ?

		Can we only ask people like this to bring themselves up to date ?

		Perhaps we critics are too gentle , and overhesitant in the use of hard words to hard hearts and adamantine heads ; we need a little more honest pepper in our English .

		And as a last example , there is
George Creel	PERSON	, suddenly made the vicarious target of pages of editorial ooze : are we , despite his too frequent lack of good sense , standing by him as we should , sedulously nailing the lies , puncturing the absurdities , undraping the motives of the cowardly assault ?

		Surely the last hope of Ameri - can journalism , in these decisive days when we have come so suddenly upon a fork in the road of our national development , lies in the resistance which critical period - icals can offer to the predatory plutocracy which too often hides behind the anonym - ity of the daily press .

		These are not counsels of perfection , nor yet quite unillustrated by achievement .

		The generous plans on foot in
New York	LOCATION	for the establishment of an unfettered institute for political research and prepara - tion constitute an exhilarating example of progressive thought that dares come down from the clouds of criticism into the peril - ous maze of specific effort and actual cir - cumstance .

		Here is a brave beginning ; why should there not
spring	DATE	from it some forces directive of nation-wide research into all the vital phases of the social prob - lem , and even some mechanism for the dissemination of results ?

		For it will not suffice that students and publicists should harness their thinking to specific needs ; every man and woman in the country must be given an opportunity to feel the in - vigoration that comes of knowledge won and used .

		A democracy uninformed is a democracy chloroformed a dream demo - cracy , sham surface of an oligarchic core .

		Only a fund of facts and a power to think can preserve the voter from the avalanche of paid suggestion that falls upon him , from platform and periodical , at election - tide ; without these safeguards votes fol - low the line of greatest gold , and triumph - ant plutocracy smiles Mephistopheleanly .

		Against the forces that operate to becloud the voter 's judgment and betray his inter - est the forces of reconstruction will have to utilize such instrumentalities of infor - mation as may be found available and amenable to this purpose -LRB- the
Congress of Forums	ORGANIZATION	is an opportunity beckoning to liberals -RRB- , and will have to organize fur - ther mechanisms for the same result .

		To make such arrangements for re - search and enlightenment , to devise some concert of purpose and method among liberal journals and moulders of public opinion , to work out through all these ways some programme of pertinent prin - ciples and specific aims these are matters to which intelligence must turn without waiting for the war to end .

		For even now the enemy within our gates , the forces that wish to procure the abortion of the nascent social order , are generous with time and thought and countless gold against us ; and only superior knowledge and decision can defeat them .

		The tasks of peace must be begun while the war is on , and they will be directed and controlled by those who heard the call of the future even while the cannon roared their iron argument .

		On and on The thick air beats in rhythms , measuring One minute gone , one minute gone , one minute gone , Of time that yet moves not , nor will , Until its pulse is maddening And I start up and shake the lethargy Off of my shoulders , shrug My weakness from me like a close , grey shawl , Travel the floor , setting my feet mechanically Between the round , blue roses on the rug ... There are blue roses , too , upon the wall Thin , flat , blue roses ... My thoughts are like those roses on the wall , They make a blue design Unstirred By any wind of speech A bright , hard scrawl Of dizzy leaves and dizzy flowers that twine And writhe , sunblurred , And each Repeating endlessly flat bud and vine And twisting line Unto that biggest , bluest splash of all An aimless , changeless scrawl Of thin , blue roses ... `` Hot fighting at the front .

		The lamplight made a sickly gloom Over the rug 's gay garden plot .

		Blasted by too much light , The withered garden aches along my sight Until all forms and sounds become a pain And drive my senses back To weave their devious old track Again Round and around those blue wall-paper roses .

		They become A thousand faces Blue , evil , little faces , Smirking and sneering at me from their places While I sit dumb , `` You lied !

		And then again , `` You lied ! ''

		But I knew he would see The little , telltale sleeve , Take it , man-clumsily , Look at me And believe I heard the lamp purr , and a droning fly .

		A hot , swift fear Snatched at the minutes that were hours , And when he answered I could hear My youth go by Turn from the room And pass out through the garden , down the walks Bordered by red begonia and pale stalks Of touch-me-nots and gilly flowers And white syringa bloom So into silence .

		The baby dress still clung To his big hand .

		`` Shall our son call Me coward , then ? ''

		was all He said , and I made no reply For all words turned to sand upon my tongue .

ELOISE ROBINSON	PERSON	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL The Poetic Drama of
Paul Claude	PERSON	I There is a certain majesty , a certain lofty serenity , in the picture of
Paul Clau	PERSON	- del at work .

		For nearly thirty years sometimes in the
Far East	LOCATION	, occasionally in
France	LOCATION	, and for a period of time in
America	LOCATION	this solitary genius has gone his lonely way , worshiping his muse with a fidelity of devotion and a beautiful union of verb and idea that have placed him apart from any other living poet .

		It would be futile to attempt a critical estimate of his work as presented in translation , no matter how apparently successful the trans - lator 's result .

		For
Paul Claudel	PERSON	, perhaps more than any other writer , has embodied his philosophy and enshrined his poetry in a language that all but seals the pro- fundity of the one and the distinguished beauty of the other from those who can - not avail themselves of the original presentation .

		He has created an art poetique founded upon two essentially primitive elements : the metaphor and the natural , respiratory rhythm .

		The vulgar metaphor , as we know it , is the artificial union of two terms which resemble each other .

		The metaphor of
Claudel	PERSON	however is the new word , the `` notation of novelty , '' that operation which results from the single instant when two utterly unrelated objects are in har - mony .

		To make a metaphor is to express the encounter of two beings whose paths never again shall cross .

		And by
Claudel	PERSON	's adherence to this unique aesthetic formula we discover that our immediate reaction to his works is our perception of the sensuous , exotic aura which enwraps them .

		Long before we become aware of the purity of his thought , long before we are brought to a realization of his sure instinct , of the relentless , inevitable fashioning of man 's relation to nature and to God , we per - ceive with all our senses the glow , the ring , the consistence , the very surging of this chain of imagery that wraps us about .

		To illustrate this effect by quotation from his dramas is quite impossible .

		Just as each play is a verse in the poem of life and can not be understood apart from the others , so is the beauty of every line , crepuscular in tone , dimmed in another setting .

		The first words of the Peasant in the `` Electra '' of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	's Euripides have something of the primitive quality of
Claudel	PERSON	's metaphor : Old gleam on the face of the world , I give thee hail ,
River of Argos	LOCATION	land ... And it is interesting to note that after a reading of
Claudel	PERSON	one is incessantly re - minded of him by any unusually beautiful use of the metaphor by another poet .

		Into the mouth of Coeuvre -LRB- In `` La Ville , '' second version -RRB-
Claudel	PERSON	has put the words that explain his use of the natural , the respiratory rhythm : O mon fils !

		lorsque j' etais un poete entre les hommes , J'inventai ce vers qui n'avait ni rime ni metre , Et je le definissais dans le secret de mon coeur cette fonction double et reciproque Par laquelle 1 ` homme absorbe la vie , et restitue dans 1 ` acte supreme de 1 ` expiration , Une parole intelligible .

		; \ This verse is the most essential move - ment in the human being .

		By its length and by its measure it manifests the pro- found state of him who pronounces it ; for as the amplitude of the respiratory rhythm varies with the quality of the emotion , it dilates and contracts , line by line , follow - ing the contour of intimate thought .

		That most intelligent and sympathetic of Clau - del 's critics ,
Jacques Riviere	PERSON	, has published a number of quotations from the poet 's work which serve admirably to illustrate the forceful quality of this rhythm .

		What wretchedness , remarks
M. Riviere	PERSON	, in the first words of Cebes -LRB- `` Tete-d'Or , '' second version -RRB- : Me void ,
Imbecile	LOCATION	, ignorant , Homme nouveau devant les choses inconnues , Et je tourne ma face vers 1 ` Annee et 1 ` arche pleuvieuse , j' ai plein mon coeur d'ennui !

		How the verses rise and fall with de - *
The Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	has published the following works of
Paul Claudel	PERSON	in a uniform edition at
$ 1.50	MONEY	each : `` The East I Know , '' `` The Tidings Brought to
Mary	PERSON	, '' and `` The Hostage . ''

		The translations are excellent , particularly that of the beautiful `` Tidings Brought to
Mary	PERSON	. ''

		The publishers hope ultimately to bring out
Claudel	PERSON	's dramatic works , excepting only one or two plays not properly repre - sentative of his genius an enterprise of importance equaled in recent years only by Mr.
Teixeira de Mattos	PERSON	's uniform edition of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		Car la grande Montagne , comme un joyau , dans le pli de son cou , recele 1 ` asile de paix .


Claudel	PERSON	has understood the interpenetra - tion of the soul and the body , and his verse responds to the profound oscillation of the whole being , spiritual and corporeal .

		His rhythm is the most natural , the most es - sential possible ; it rises and falls with the breast as the breath reproduces these inte - rior pulsations .

		It is not without a certain significance that the first volume of collected plays by
Paul Claudel	PERSON	was entitled `` L'Arbre . ''

		I have said that each play is a verse in the poem of life .

		Not alone are his plays interrelated but his entire doctrine is one of interrelation .

		The world is for him an harmonic whole of infinite complexity whose every note is mutually , simultane - ously evoked and counterbalanced .

		He has written : `` Nous ne pouvons definir une chose ; elle n'existe en soi que par les traits en qui elle differe de toutes les autres . ''

		There exists a concordance of all things , a cooperation , a constant relation between the movements and actions of the world which are prolonged , developed , and prop - agated by time .

		And time is `` le sens de la vie . ''

		It is the movement of the world , and as such it is twofold .

		There is a time which is inscribed in celestial signs and on our terrestrial clocks ; that is uniform .

		There is also a time which is the progress of living beings and the continuous modi - fication of their relations ; this time is real and qualitative .

		Each being has his pre - scribed task , his space of time to testify .

		Time is a cooperation of all beings ; that is to say , a drama , an immense work to which we all are yoked .

		`` Nous ne naissons pas seul .

		Naitre pour tout , c'est co-naitre .

		Tout naissance est un co-naissance '' -LRB- `` Traite de la Co - naissance au monde et de soi-meme '' -RRB- .

		All objects have a common essence which is movement .

		`` Tout est mouvement . ''

		Spirit , as well as matter , is movement .

		That movement which has created an object en - counters other movements which resist it ; it is forced to recoil upon itself at the con - tact with neighboring beings ; and as it can not cease , it becomes vibration .

		`` La vibration , c'est le mouvement prisonnier de la forme . ''

		And the particular forms in their aggregate constitute this complex and unified design which is the general form of the universe .

		Thus there is no inertia in the world .

		All beings are engaged in a common endeavor ; they are in perpetual effort .

		Each being has to construct and maintain its form , and each leans upon the others for support ; they buttress one an - other to construct and maintain the form of the whole .

		The animal ceaselsssly creates his form , renews it continually , in consuming the nutrition that he assimilates .

		But man has more and better work to do .

		Whereas the former is endowed only with a sensu - ous knowledge or apprehension which in - forms him only about particular objects , telling him whether they are to him useful or not , man `` a ete fabrique pour s ` arran - ger avec tout . ''

		Thanks to his intellect , he is able to discern the elements essential to his development and extract from them his needs .

		`` Chaque homme a ete cree pour etre le temoin et 1 ` acteur d'un certain spectacle pour en determiner en lui le sens. '' He ought then to guard scrupulously his place in the evolution of the chorus .

		His pres - ence in the path , which is indicated by his instinct and his temperament , is essential to the perfection of the drama .

		The great - est crime , the only crime which he can commit is to stray from it , to depart from his personality , to force his tastes and his tendencies , to refuse his role .

		And it is in
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 a drama which is in many aspects his mas - terpiece , in `` L'Echange , '' that
Claudel	PERSON	has so eloquently elaborated this credo .


Louis Laine	PERSON	and
Thomas Pollock	PERSON	dared to scorn the profound ties which bound them to their partners ; they tried to ex - change wives .

		It was
Lechy Elbernon	PERSON	who inspired the crime Lechy , `` la mu - tation personifiee , '' the symbol of incon - stance , of disorder , of unruliness , of deser - tion , of divorce ; an actress of multiple faces , of error and seduction : Et je m ` en vais de lieu en lieu , et je ne suis pas une seule femme , mais plusieurs , prestige , vivante dans une histoire inventee .

		The poison of Lechy corrupts
Louis Laine	PERSON	; he awakens to the old instinct of liberty , of disobedience to life , which sleeps in the hearts of all men .

		Thereupon he sells his wife to
Thomas Pollock	PERSON	for a handful of dollars , his wife ,
Marthe	PERSON	, Bitter-Sweet , she who was destined to follow him every - where , to weigh heavily upon his arm all the length of his route and his journey ; she who was to ask back of him the soul which `` sa mere lui a donnee . ''

		Marthe supplicates him with indignation , showing him that to each man a woman is given for his eternal companion , to embrace , to aug - ment , and to partake of his sadness : Et 1 ` homme n ' a point d'autre epouse , et celle-la lui a etc donnee , et il est bien qu'il 1 'em brasse avec des larmes et des baisers .

		For them to separate is to disturb the order of life ; it is to shatter the measure of the chorus .

		And all exchange , all di - vorce , is punished .

		Marthe knows it well when she implores the justice of the uni - verse .

		Laine understands it at the end ; and he runs , haggard , in search of the place he has lost , and unable to find it : Malheur a moi parceque je suis dans le grand monde comme un homme egare et perdu .

		He has put himself without the law ; he must disappear ; life resumes its impassive regularity .

		Without violence , without check , with the slow certainty of inevitable labors , it disperses the weak , human effort .

		Tout est vain contre la vie , humble , ignorante , obstinee .

		The exchange is the essential crime ; but it is also the impossible crime , for it can not subsist .

		The vow must be obeyed , the part maintained , the route followed , the journey accomplished .

		In `` L'Annonce faite a Marie , '' rewrit - ten from `` La Jeune Fille Violaine , '' we are in the presence of the same relentless adjustment at nature 's immutable hands .

		Violaine accepts her martyrdom in a spirit of beautiful calm , and she forgoes her terrestrial happiness without one pitying , backward glance .

		In another direction , we find her sister Mara effecting her crime with an equal , though terrible , confidence , knowing that the way of her life is with
Jacques Hury	PERSON	, the betrothed of Violaine .


Jacques Hury	PERSON	, deceived by
Mara	ORGANIZATION	, turned by her from
Violaine	PERSON	, unites bitterly his path and her own , knowing that he has done his duty in passing his life by the side of this woman .

		What is important is not the happiness of his love but the exact accomplishment of his role , his signifi - cance , his voice in the total chant , in the universal harmony .

		And who can de - scribe the beautiful , ineffable sadness which bathes like a scented mist this won - derful picture of medieval
France	LOCATION	?

		What is the end of all these dramas ?

		Where is the inevitable single theme of `` La Ville , '' of `` Le Repos du
Septieme Jour	PERSON	, '' of `` Tete-d'Or , '' of `` L'Otage '' ?

		It lies , as has now frequently been iter - ated , in man 's fidelity to himself , to his role .

		Peace , the true peace , is dispensed at the supreme moment to those who were the faithful and scrupulous actors of the drama .

		It is refused to those who would divest themselves of their mission and strip themselves of their personality .

		Not a single act is an indifferent one ; each has its value in the ensemble and weighs upon the rest .

		The world has need that all the beings composing it cooperate liberally for its development and work unceasingly to erect it .

		The end of the world , which is also its origin , is God .

		Such , in brief , is the thesis and the life - drama of
Paul Claudel	PERSON	.

		It is accurately and sympathetically summarized in
M. Jacques Riviere	PERSON	's `` Etudes '' and wholly , simply , and beautifully presented in
M. Claudel	PERSON	's `` Art Poetique '' and in his `` Abrege de toute la doctrine chretienne . ''

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 20	DATE	Our
London	LOCATION	Letter A friend warns me that I should not make poetry the whole staple of the argument in these letters .

		Of course , it is nearly always in verse that the literary tendency of any age reveals itself most acutely ; and , besides this , the revival of interest in verse is one of the salient features of the moment .

		Yet it is true there are other kinds of literature which flourish .

		Another friend whose warning I take less kindly complains that , not only in these letters but elsewhere , I discover a new masterpiece every month or so and that if my judgments had any weight or value the halls of fame would be by now as crowded as a Tube station on a raid night .

		These suggestions combine to shake me out of my groove .

		I am compelled to look round and inquire just how we stand at this moment where it is that everything is taking us .

		This is the easier because literature , unlike the one recal - citrant sheep in the story , is standing still for the moment and allows itself to be counted .

		To a professional author the present state of literature generally means , first of all , the state of the market .

		A consideration far removed from the ideal , no doubt !

		But after all , as one of our most distinguished novelists is fond of remarking , when the thing is written it is cheese ; and so long as we do not look on it as cheese before or during the act of composition , the greatest danger is avoided .

		Moreover , our cynicism is the fault of
Providence	LOCATION	or the public , who can easily pre - vent us from being mercenary by giving us a little money .

		I have heard it said that the author 's greed for gold exceeds in intensity that of any other human being except the actor .

		Very possibly this is true , as it is true that starving men are hungrier than others ; but at the same time , the author 's saturation point is low .

		It is getting next to nothing which makes him so grasping .

		My own opinion is that the inevitable strain of war is making a large section of the community more serious .

		Now , the novel is not necessarily less serious than anything else ; but the commer - cial article was produced for readers who wanted nothing serious and , very often , by writers to whom it was not congenial and to whom there - fore it could not be serious .

		But the minds of many persons have been sufficiently exercised by the private and public problems of the war to feel an appetite for the best work of , say , an essayist instead of the forced second-rate work which was all he could give them in the form of the novel .

		This however is only a suggestion ; and the real explanation may perhaps be found in our old friend , the spread of popular education .

		Whatever the explanation , the fact remains .

		There is a wide growth of intellectual interests by no means confined to the scientific topics , which , it was once prophesied , were shortly to beat literature out of the field .

		This has even spread to our Old Public Schools , which are not commonly hotbeds of intellectual activity .

		Rep - ton , hitherto chiefly famous for having nurtured the great cricketer Mr.
C. B. Foy	PERSON	, has produced an astonishing magazine , called `` A Public School Looks at the World , '' in which all manner of serious questions are discussed in a serious and competent way .

		Eton has very surprisingly fol - lowed this example with a review which shows some leaning towards the labor view of things in general .

		It is a curious world which
Repton	ORGANIZATION	is regarding and helping to create .

		But there it is , and we are undeniably moving .

		But , of course , the war is having other effects than proving that literature was a business like selling calico , except that one got much less per yard .

		Very few authors in
England	LOCATION	taking into consideration only those with some reputation can make a living out of writing books .

		Books are written chiefly because they insist on being written sometimes as advertisements which may bring in to the authors more work for the peri - odicals .

		Books can not be printed on the backs of puffs of pills , but periodicals can .

		So writing is here , at any rate , the devil 's own job , from a financial point of view ; and authors may be excused if , being called from their own work to the contemplation of literature in general , they think first of the chances of extracting a few more pence from that surly parent , the public .

		This is all very sordid , but I am working by a detour to a train of thought that will better please the idealists .

		For the answer to the ques - tion whether , literature shows signs of flourishing financially is in the affirmative ; and the reason for that astonishing answer is not that lunatics have taken to buying two copies of a novel where one served before , but that the public intelligence is developing .

		This means that the man of letters in general is beginning to have a show and that that hit-or-miss specialist , the writer of novels , is no longer the only person for whom the public clamors .

		It is now possible to write , print , and sell books of parodies , essays , satires , poems , and
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	knows what .

		This is a great relief for the man who in former days would have
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 13 pleased neither himself nor the public by the fic - tion that the public demanded of him .

		And the reason ?

		One turns inevitably now to the war to explain any difficult new social phenomenon .

		Mr.
Charles Marriott	PERSON	produced the same explanation long before
1914	DATE	in his novel `` Sub-Soil '' when he alleged that our South African campaign improved the taste of English readers .

		Apparently this war is not injuring literature by killing off the young writer .

		Our losses in that way have really been extraordinarily small , the simple reason being that a very large percentage of young writers have turned out to be physically unfit for combatant service .

		This does not imply that they are all weaklings ; but most of them seem to have ruined their sight either over proofs or over their own handwriting .

		However , I said `` apparently '' with intention .

		We are losing principally in the very young men who had not begun to write or had achieved only quite immature work , and whose loss is therefore passed over as of no significance from the literary point of view .

		But what significance the casualty lists may contain for literature we can , of course , never really know .

		The one thing certain is that here , as in the other professions and arts , a gap will become discernible five or ten or fifteen years after the war is done ; and this gap may well be terrible and desolating .

		A more easily measurable factor in the situa - tion is created by the employment of nearly every author of military age on some sort of national service , generally in government offices .

		The few that are not so employed are generally to be found grinding their lives out in the attempt to do the work of two men on the more mechanical side of their calling .

		The meaning of this is fairly obvious .

		Imaginative writers , many of them at the most fertile period of their careers , are being prevented from expressing the inspira - tions that nevertheless come to them just as usual .

		This is not a matter of complaint , except against fate ; and I am not complaining .

		I merely state the position , which seems to me to be of impor - tance .

		There is no doubt whatever in my mind that we must inevitably lose a number of valuable works of the imagination , which will be long past dealing with when leisure comes at last to those who might have been their authors .

		Any writer knows that a subject retained too long in the mind or , worse still , attempted and aban - doned for want of time , often loses its freshness and sometimes becomes impossible .

		And we can - not overlook the fact that this frustration may well in certain cases have its disastrous reaction on the talent of the authors concerned .

		A grievance of literature analogous to this is caused by shortage of paper and cost of produc - tion .

		Costs of production have risen out of sight , and it has been found more difficult to raise the price of books than the price of almost any other commodity .

		But the publisher does not only pay an enormous price for the essential ingredient of paper ; he is also severely rationed in the quantity he may use .

		Before rationing became oppressive , high prices made him chary of locking up costly paper in books whose slow sale would bring in the expected profits only over a , term of years , when paper would have become cheaper ; and this tended to discourage the publication of solid works in favor of those which might be reckoned to attract public favor immediately .

		And now that the publisher has only a little paper to dis - pose of he can hardly use it for books that may not pay for themselves , and speculative publishing -LRB- the worthiest form of speculation known -RRB- has practically ceased .

		This means that new authors and those whose reputations are not yet made are excluded from the arena for that heartbreak - ingly indefinite period , `` the duration , '' and the effect of this is discouragement and embitterment .

		Though not amounting to a catastrophe to letters , this is a matter for thought .

		Indeed , the trouble is beginning to extend to established authors , and the opinion has been expressed that it is a little hard that the paper which can be found in pro- fusion for government forms and the reports of inane government committees should be denied to valuable works of literature .

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	was moved to observe at a meeting of the Authors ' Society the other day that the rationing of paper was `` under the control of people popu - larly described as practical business men , '' and that the class seemed to contain `` totally illiterate people , quite unconscious of the intellectual life of the community , and ready to sacrifice educa - tion or literature for the immediate purposes of the .

		war . ''

		The reflection that this provokes in me is that the business man who has gone off with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's paper is like a man who should inadvertently carry off a hornets ' nest ; and , if they really have been interfering with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's paper , he will find some somewhere on which to make this incautious person a public laughing stock .

		But it is not likely that more paper will be made available , and my prophetic soul grows dizzy at the thought of the literary market and 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 20	DATE	the state of mind of reviewers when the war is over and the belated masterpieces begin to appear .

		So that is how we stand ; and our temporary discomforts seem to me to be more than counter - balanced by the undoubted stirrings of intellectual interests in the country .

		Yet and here the casualty lists appear again the reading public of after the war , the young public of readers between eighteen and forty , by which most writers are chiefly stimulated , will be to an alto - gether unprecedented degree composed of women ; and though I do not look forward to this with positive dread , I look forward to it with consid - erable uncertainty .

		Undoubtedly much of our present intellectual `` liveliness '' is feminine ; women have accounted for a great deal of the extraordinary success of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's post - humous volumes .

		This is an unknown factor in the shaping of the future , and it may easily over - turn the most careful and reasonable prophecies .

		I am back again now , Moored in my home-port , The place where I first lifted anchor , And vowed never to return .

		I am home-sick for the thousand places I have seen , Each lovelier than the place that went before .

		A Series of Lectures delivered by Members of the Faculty of the

		This volume , in spite of its bulk -LRB- 425 pages -RRB- , is far from constituting a systematic introduc - tion to the study of comparative religion .

		There is nowhere given a clear formulation of the essen - tial nature and of the secondary ramifications of the concept `` religion , '' nor is there any attempt made to cover all of the historically important religions known to us .

		Thus not a word is devoted to the two great indigenous religions of
China	LOCATION	, Confucianism and
Taoism	LOCATION	; while even the third religious system of the great republic , Buddhism , is treated not in terms of its present distribution and significance but almost entirely from the standpoint of its Hindu canonical litera - ture .

		Nor do we learn of the Shinto of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		We have a lecture on the religion of the ancient Teutons -LRB- really a summary , for the most part , of the cosmology of the early Scandinavians as revealed in the Older Edda -RRB- but nothing is said of the beliefs of the heathen Celts or Slavs .

		Of the tremendous variety of religious belief and ceremonial covered , or rather disguised , by the meaningless term `` primitive religions '' we get hardly an inkling .

		This is rather a pity , as we have stored up in the ethnological literature far more adequate presentations of the religious sys - tems of a number of tribes than it seems possible to obtain of those of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		While the Orphic and Eleusinian mysteries can only be viewed as through a glass , darkly , we are in a position to appreciate , directly and vividly , some - thing of the nature of the ecstatic or Dionysian note of religion in the accounts that ethnologists have given us of the so-called `` secret societies '' of the
West Coast Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		The general public might also have profited from a fairly explicit account of the complexity and impressiveness of the ritual systems prevailing among such tribes as the Aranda of
Australia	LOCATION	or the Hopi and
Nav	ORGANIZATION	- aho of the desert
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Instead of a live utilization of the stores of valuable data which the field ethnologists have gathered for us , we have to content ourselves with a purely schematic chewing the cud of generalities on animism , to - temism , fetishism , taboo , and the rest generali - ties that have become exceedingly tiresome to ethnologists and laymen alike .

		This is not nec - essarily to find fault with the lecturer on `` Primi -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 tive Religion , '' who has done about as well as might have been expected with a thankless and essentially impossible task .

		A sympathetic treat - ment of two or three specific tribal religions , or even of one , would have been at once more illuminating and less tedious .

		But it is in connection with the `` religions of the present '' that we have most reason to be disappointed .

		Indeed , aside from the treatment of
Hinduism	LOCATION	and sundry incidental remarks on modern Zoroastrianism and
Mohammedanism	PERSON	, the volume takes a `` snakes in
Ireland	LOCATION	'' attitude towards this part of its theme .

		Not the least alluring implication of the title of the volume is a promise of insight into the development and psychology of modern and recent religious move - ments .

		As it is , we get no nearer to the Protestant revolt and to the long series of indi - vidualistic , anti-institutional manifestations of the religious impulse that make up the history of nonconformism and revivalism than a lecture on medieval Christianity .

		Even this is little more than a sketch of the institutional aspects of medieval Roman Catholicism ; we are not so much as told of the existence of an
Eastern Chris	ORGANIZATION	- tian tradition .

		Judaism is represented solely by a chapter on the 6arly Hebrew religion , the fiercely tribal cult , the local monotheism , of Yahwe .

		Of the petrifaction of the Jewish re - ligion in medieval and modern times into the mechanical routine of prayer and dull ritual we are hardly informed , nor do we learn of the lightening of the burden of orthodoxy that goes by the name of Jewish Reform .

		It would have been of the greatest psychological interest to have had pointed out to us and analyzed two of the recent drifts that attest spiritual dissatisfaction with current religious forms , standardized and desiccated .

		On the one hand , such phenomena as the rise and spread of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	and the amazing popularity of
Billy Sunday	PERSON	seem symptomatic of a yearning for the emotional intensification of religious experience , of a revolt against ethical self-satisfaction and lukewarm acceptance of the minimal requirements of reli - gion .

		On the other hand , a mystical or occult - istic craving is curiously apparent in the vogue of
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	, theosophy , and other pseudo - philosophical cults , a craving which implies dis - satisfaction with the tepid rationalizations of orthodox Protestantism no less than fear of the bleak certainties and ignorances of scientific faith .

		In brief , what generally happens when a sym - posium , a series of talks on selected subjects , is reduced to book form and provided with a title in lieu of inner coherence , has happened here .

		The editor has tried to forestall criticism with the remark that `` it was left to each man to set forth his subject according to his own ideas of matter and proportion the result is the bracing individuality of each chapter , and the spontane - ity of the whole . ''

		It is only fair to the univer - sity lecturers to remark that as soon as we adopt the standpoint of judging each lecture as a de - tached essay on a selected topic of religious his - tory , we get a far more favorable impression of the whole .

		As might have been expected from a series that seems to have been but little planned with reference to a central conception , the lec - turers lay very different stresses on the varying aspects of their theme .

		The historical back - ground is treated with needless fulness in the disproportionately long study on the religion of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		In the chapter on Buddhism it is the ethical correlates of religious belief that chiefly engage our attention .

		Ritual is considerably to the fore in the chapter on Roman religion ; myth - ological conceptions would seem to have been the chief religious stock in trade of the Teutons ; while the functions of the gods appear to be mat - ters of prime importance in
Babylon	LOCATION	and in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The most successful expository chapters in the book are probably the three devoted to the reli - gions of
India	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Franklin Edgerton	PERSON	has in these succeeded particularly well in placing reli - gious belief , ritual , and morality in their proper social setting ; the historical perspective is clearly presented , yet without undue emphasis ; and most gratifying of all , a discriminating sympathy is accorded modern
Hinduism	LOCATION	, too often dismissed in disparaging terms .

		Prof.
Morris Jastrow	PERSON	gives us scholarly resumes of doctrine and cult in
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	and of the spread of Islam .

		These two lectures , however , like perhaps the greater part of the volume , are informed by that cool , academic spirit of objectivity that often makes one wonder why the study of religion makes an appeal to the scholarly mind at all .

		It is only in two of the chapters that one feels , or almost feels , that such a study is animated by a genuine religious responsiveness , that to the subject of religion may be brought an emotional interest differing somewhat from the orderly scientific curiosity which it is customary to expend on paleoliths or the orbits of comets .

		Both Dr. 16
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 20 Montgomery	DATE	in his lecture on the Hebrew reli - gion and Dr.
W. R. Newbold	PERSON	in his treatment of early Christianity do , for a few moments , take us out of the arid wastes of dogma and cult into the fresher atmosphere of intense spiritual experi - ence .

		Only out of their pages does the psy - chology of religion curtsey , somewhat timidly , to the reader .

		When we have laid by the book and allowed the whole phantasmagoria of gods , spirits , ethical abstractions , mystic dogmas , ritual observances , sacrifices , prayers , heavens , and hells to recede into the recesses out of which the
University	ORGANIZATION	faculty had once again summoned them for the troubling of our peace of mind , we face a stub - born query .

		Why has religion survived ?

		Why , more than a hundred years after the onslaughts of the French Enlightenment , does it still , in one form or another , kick a vigorous pair of heels ?

		Why do even the most radical of us , who foresee the doom of capitalism , the disap - pearance of the political-economic state , the dis - integration of the family , know in our heart of hearts that when in a light-hearted burst of scornful laughter we turn our back on religion , its ghost , smiling with an irony tempered by more than a touch of dogged good humor , is destined to meet us again at some crossroads ages hence ?

		The persistence of religion can not be altogether explained by the forces of cultural inertia , by the fetters of social tradition and institution , for its life has never been continuous .

		It has had as many rebirths as deaths .

		The glamor of ritual , the easy rationalization of the riddles of existence , the craving for an absolute sanction of an ethical code that would otherwise hang in the void these and a hundred other contributing factors there are .

		We shall have to dig deeper for a securer base , into the dark soil of the psychology of the unconscious .

		As long as man is the prey of an indifferent cosmos and the prisoner con - fined within the walls of his own powerlessness , certain temperaments , rising in the might of their own generous resentment , will build themselves a splendid compensation and transform the ecstasy of despair into an austere passion of religious faith .

		These are the strong , less strong than those who can be happy in their despair .

		As for the rest , they are indifferent with the profound indifference of preoccupation .

		Or , in a burst of envy and fear , they ape those that have conquered des P ain

		Chateaubriand in
America	LOCATION	L'ExorisME AMERICAIN DANS L'CEuvRE DE CHA - TEAUBRIAND .

		By
Gilbert Chinard	PERSON	.


Hachette	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	; 4 f .

		What makes this book important is that it deals with a contribution which the
America	LOCATION	of the colonial period made to French literature .

		For more than a century the freedom of Ameri - can life and nature was the lure of European idealism .

		It was in vain that Baudelaire sought to temper the enthusiasm with the words : O le pauvre amoureux des pays chimeriques !

		Faut-il le mettre aux fers , le jeter a la mer , Ce matelot ivrogne , inventeur d'Ameriques Dont le mirage rend le gouffre plus amer ?

		Down to the present , despite definite and often cruel proofs to the contrary ,
America	LOCATION	has remained to the European mind what it was to the youthful Chateaubriand a `` New Eden . ''

		How and under what circumstances Chateau - briand visited the
United States	LOCATION	, how although disappointed at first he pushed his journey into the `` wilderness , '' and how with what he himself saw , imagined , and borrowed from other travel - ers he then returned home to write his works , all more or less tinged with American exotism , is the story of
M. Chinard	ORGANIZATION	's book .


M. Chinard	PERSON	comes to his task well prepared .

		In two earlier volumes he has traced the growth in
Europe	LOCATION	of the fantastic ideal of the `` noble savage '' as he was thought to exist in the
Ameri	LOCATION	- cas .

		It was out of such stuff that the spirit of expansionism or as it is called in literary par - lance romanticism was partly made ; and
Cha	PERSON	- teaubriand was one of its chief builders .

		`` Etre Chateaubriand ou rien '' was
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's lofty but youthful ambition .

		But , as
M. Chinard	ORGANIZATION	shows , we must not assume that Chateaubriand 's visit to
America	LOCATION	rests en - tirely on literary motives .

		Doubtless Ossian , Werther , and
Rousseau	PERSON	were factors in making the temperamental Breton long for the primitive and uncontaminated .

		The `` restless '' sea was no stranger to him , brought up as he had been on its shores .

		He knew its `` melancholy '' as well as
Loti	PERSON	did generations later .

		At the same time , Chateaubriand himself alleges that his voyage had a scientific aim : Une idee me dominait , 1 ` idee de passer aux Etats - Unis : il fall ait un but utile a mon voyage ; je me proposais de decouvrir -LRB- ainsi que je 1 ` ai dit dans ces `` Memoires '' et dans plusieurs de notes ouvrages -RRB- le passage au nord-ouest de 1 ` Amerique .

		And in fact
M. Chinard	ORGANIZATION	shows him consulting
M. de Malherbes	PERSON	-LRB- the friend of our own Gou -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 17 verneur
Morris	PERSON	-RRB- in
Paris	LOCATION	, poring over maps , studying the flora and fauna of the Jardin des Plantes , and reading every conceivable book on the
Northwest Passage	ORGANIZATION	.

		When we realize how ill fitted Chateaubriand was for any such ambi - tious plan , how foolish the plan itself was in any case , and how grotesque it becomes inasmuch as Chateaubriand never went beyond
Niagara	LOCATION	and possibly the lower waters of the
Ohio	LOCATION	, we get the full measure of the man .


M. Chinard	PERSON	, who dwells on these details , might have stressed their significance more .

		Better than anything else , they show that `` illusion '' was the keynote of Chateaubriand 's life as well as his works .

		This , of course , is typically romantic ; wherein Chateau - briand 's romanticism differs from that of others is on its expressive side in the glowing and reverberant imagery in which he clothed his illusions .

		And here
America	LOCATION	furnished the back - ground .

		Chateaubriand passed five months in `` the land of the free . ''

		As documents found by
M. Ghi	PERSON	- nard show , he landed in
Baltimore	LOCATION	on
July 10 , 1791	DATE	.

		In the hope of seeing General Washing - ton he at once hurried to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and there suffered his first great disillusionment : Our papers at home , he says , speak to us of the Romans of
Boston	LOCATION	and the tyrants of
London	LOCATION	.

		Moved by the same ardor , I asked ... to see one of these famous Quakers , virtuous descendants of
William Penn.	PERSON	.

		Imagine my surprise when they told me that if I wished to be cheated all I had to do was to enter the shop of a Friend , and that if I was anxious to know to what extremes immorality and mercantilism could go they would show me the spectacle of one
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	cheating another ... Thus , he concludes , each new day saw one of my fancies after the other vanish , et cela me faisait grant mal .

		Fortunately not all of his experiences were so bitter .

		He himself was apparently treated wi.th all honesty and consideration ; and while the government never lent an attentive ear to his project of discovery , still he was received by
Washington	LOCATION	and let off with a gracious , `` Well , well , young man '' which was as much as he deserved .

		Chateaubriand went into the `` wilderness '' via
Albany	LOCATION	, the valley of the
Mohawk	LOCATION	, and the Gene - see River .

		His guide , a Dutchman who spoke several Indian dialects , led him as far as
Niagara	LOCATION	.

		From here on his wanderings for it is clear that gradually his journey lost its appointed aim become vague and uncertain .

		In pages remark - able both for their penetration and their common sense ,
M. Chinard	PERSON	shows how tenuous is the claim of the traveler that he saw the
Mississippi	LOCATION	either along its southern course or at the spot -LRB- described by Chateaubriand -RRB- where it is joined by the
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		In the latter case Chateaubriand took his landscape almost word for word from the American geographer
Imlay	PERSON	-LRB- `` A Topograph - ical Description of the Western Territory of
North America	LOCATION	'' -RRB- ; and as for the descent of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, this is absolutely precluded by the difficulties of the enterprise at that early date , granting even that Chateaubriand had the time -LRB- which he had not -RRB- to undertake it .

		The most that we can assume is that our `` discoverer '' on leaving Niagara went south as far as
Pittsburg	LOCATION	, but that for his further descriptions he relied on written and oral sources , the greater part of which , thanks to the efforts of
M. Bedier	PERSON	, Mr.
Stathers	PERSON	, and
M. Chinard	PERSON	to mention only the more important names are known .

		In dealing with American exotism as revealed in
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	's literary work ,
M. Chinard	PERSON	's task is to make definite and precise what has long been recognized as a fact .

		Here again , and quite properly ,
M. Chinard	PERSON	is scholarly rather than literary : the reader is given detail rather than a complete picture .

		In general , the exotic appears : first , in certain of Chateaubriand 's characters ; second , in the `` local color '' or background ; and third , in the author 's own imagery so obviously enriched by his memories of our landscape .

		Sainte-Beuve called Chateaubriand an epicurean with a Catholic imagination .

		He himself once said : `` Where Mme. de Stael sees perfectibility , I see Jesus . ''

		In any case he saw and felt far more than he reflected .

		And it needed but his return to
Europe	LOCATION	to make him convert his Ameri - can impressions into sonorous phrase and gorgeous color , while the poet and the dreamer in him combined to create the quixotic types of Chactas ,
Atala	PERSON	, and
Rene	PERSON	the last of whom is the stand - ard bearer of the mal de siecle .

		In spite of his voyage of discovery , this `` sachem of romanti - cism '' knew and depicted the real American Indian about as well as did Voltaire or Mar - montel , or , indeed ,
Cooper	PERSON	!

		But and with this capital point of
Chinard	ORGANIZATION	's we may conclude it would be wrong to measure Chateaubriand by realistic standards .

		However romantic , he is never vague or formless ; quite the contrary .

		Not unlike
Keats	PERSON	, though in a different medium , he is primarily an artist ; and Chateau - briand the artist constantly sought precision and concreteness of detail .

		It may be true that his descriptions are not always true to locality : we know that `` crocodiles sailing on floating islands , '' `` blue herons , '' and `` pink flamingos '' were never 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 20	DATE	found on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	; but in the sufficiency of our greater knowledge let us not forget that Chateaubriand found just such details in the authors he consulted , and that his descriptions not only fit but illuminate his theme .

		The inter - esting thing is , to translate
Chinard	ORGANIZATION	's own words : ' In order that American exotism should produce its masterpiece , after the slow incubation of three cen - turies , it was necessary ... that
Rene	PERSON	should dis - cover the New World .

		WILLIAM A > NlTZE < A Coward You Can Believe In DRIFT .

		By
Mary Aldis	PERSON	.

		Duffield ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.


Eileen Picardy	PERSON	, the main figure in this thor - oughly interesting novel , is not a heroine I can promise you will like .

		But you are , I think , likely to pay her this more substantial tribute of worrying about her , of feeling irritated with her , of wishing you might have had a hand in bringing her up , to the extent at least of inter - vening here or there and telling her a thing or two .

		And after you have read the last bitterly ironic paragraph and have caught the last glimpse of her that Mrs.
Aldis	PERSON	vouchsafes burning the letter of farewell to her husband and creeping back into a soft and comfortable bed , to a pillow wet with unavailing tears , the small pistol with its handle of mother of pearl replaced unused in the desk drawer you will go on , for a while , thinking about her , trying to diagnose her case .

		An indication , it seems to me , that as a portrait this book has more than atmosphere and texture , has some really solid drawing .

		She was a coward , of course , and of the most despicable sort that it is possible for a woman to be : she was afraid of love , of its pains and penalties .

		She had a baby accidentally , one as - sumes having spent the whole period of her pregnancy dreading her approaching travail .

		The child was born dead , and rather than risk the ordeal again she terminated her marital intimacy with her husband .

		She was recreant to her fundamental obligation therefore , false at the core , worthless .

		But she is too real to be dis - missed like that .

		The sense persists that she had capacities , even for courage ; that with a little better luck she might have come through victoriously .

		The energy was there , the intelli - gence , the charm .

		Only , the main
spring	DATE	was never released .

		The mechanism , as they say of machine guns , jammed .

		She is introduced to us a pleasing young or - phan of nineteen , her mother having died giving birth to her , and her father a few years later in
Brazil	LOCATION	or some such far off place .

		Her de facto parent is a Victorian grandaunt , a tradi - tional old gentlewoman with a house on the north side of
Washington Square	LOCATION	.

		She brought up , also ,
Eileen	PERSON	's mother and has regretful and puzzled memories of the two unhappy years of that lady 's married life .

		This is a subject
Eileen	PERSON	is given to uneasy speculation about and one upon which her aunt does not enlighten her .

		`` He overwhelmed her a little , perhaps he ex - pected too much of her ... asked her to be more than she was , and she just could n't be . ''

		Eileen rebelled at the insipidities of her first `` season '' and , having decided that settlements must be interesting , went to be a resident at
Helena House	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the month she spent there she got a shock .

		She was in charge one evening , alone , when a young girl came to her in extremis , the pangs of childbirth already upon her ; she told
Eileen	PERSON	her story -LRB- she had been seduced by her stepfather and turned out of the house by her jealous mother , who nevertheless pretended to believe her husband 's lying denials -RRB- , and
Eileen	PERSON	went with her to the hospital saw her through , according to a promise , to the end .

		`` Just get me out of this , '' the girl had screamed , `` and I 'll never let any man get at me again , s ` help me Gawd ! ''

		That was the aspect of the thing that
Eileen	PERSON	never forgot .

		Her spirit was , you may say , branded with it .

		She gave up the settlement and went back to her aunt .

		She traveled abroad .

		She nearly fell in love with
Robert Thorne	PERSON	, a breezy young Californian .

		Only she could n't be sure she was sure of her feelings ; she was afraid .

		So when it came to a question of telling him her decision by telegram , she could only wire , `` Terribly sorry , '' and lost him .

		She tried studying art but soon abandoned that .

		She tried another love affair , and this one she allowed to carry her through into matrimony largely because one runs the risk of doing a certain amount of injus - tice in a rough summarization like this largely because her new lover was not very passionate ; `` considerate , '' rather .

		She made a half-hearted and wholly unsuccessful attempt to articulate herself into her husband 's life his business and so on .

		She made a tragic futile venture into maternity .

		After that her impulses fluttered faster and weaker , like a febrile pulse .

		She made a great social success , but this was rendered nugatory by a sense of frustration , by an abiding self-contempt .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 19 When
Robert Thome	PERSON	turned up again and , seeing her unhappy , again made love to her , she thought she loved him ; but the inhibition of fear settled upon her again and she lost him once more .

		A little later she came to the brink in another affair less creditable this time , shabby , with a painter who was doing a portrait of her came to the brink and went pelting back in a revulsion of panic and disgust ... And all the while , there in the background , was her `` con - siderate '' husband , friendly , consolatory in times of trouble , but mostly unregarded .

		Such is the situation when , within thirty pages of the end of the book , the drama which it is written up to begins .

		I do n't disparage Mrs.
Aldis	PERSON	's presentation of Eileen by calling it well done .

		It is better than a clever performance , or even than an honest performance though it 's both .

		Eileen has for me both real and romantic validity .

		I feel I know her at first hand , through what she says and does and thinks , rather than through what her author says about her .

		She 's fresh and vivid and charming .

		I 'm concerned for her , distressed that her life should come to so grievous a col - lapse .

		I attribute that collapse more than Mrs.
Aldis	PERSON	seems to to
John Templeton	PERSON	, the hus - band .

		I do n't like him .

		I do n't believe in him .

		I 'm not convinced about his violin-playing , nor about the ancestral silk mills for which he gave it up .

		I disbelieve utterly in his
Margaret	PERSON	.

		This is not because Mrs.
Aldis `	PERSON	ca n't characterize a man .

		She has done it vividly in the cases of some of the minor characters in this book .

		But she has sacrificed
John Templeton	PERSON	to that last thirty pages of drama .

		That last thirty pages is , precisely it seems to me , a clever performance .

		What the book ends with is a curtain , a clever curtain , a little - theatre curtain .

		Eileen slides down the ways truly into this dramatic situation .

		In that re - spect Mrs.
Aldis	PERSON	has managed better than Mere - dith , attempting the same thing in `` Diana of the Crossways . ''

		But poor
John !	PERSON

		I like the way the story is told , the manners of it , the clear ring it has .

		I like the deliberate way in which the subsidiary story of
Helen	PERSON	and her love is carried along .

		I like the minor char - acters : Aunt
Emma	PERSON	, the Medways ,
Spencer Crockett	PERSON	, and
Clara	LOCATION	.

		And
Eileen	PERSON	I shall not for - get .

		I wonder what she did after that rather tricky curtain came down .

		I wonder what she 's doing now .

		Earth the Unconquerable TOPOGRAPHY AND STRATEGY IN THE WAR .

		By
Douglas Wilson Johnson	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		It goes without saying that one who would understand the great war must know one 's maps , and know them thoroughly ; and while political geography is important , physical geography and topography are even more so .

		It might be sup - posed by the layman that in these days when guns hurl high explosive shells with marvelous accuracy over lofty mountain ridges and across the widest river valleys , warfare has ceased to be greatly affected by the element of terrain .

		But this is by no means the case .

		Diligent and scien - tific study of the matter has , indeed , brought at least one of our foremost physiographers , Profes - sor
Johnson	PERSON	, to the conclusion that the role played by land forms `` in plans of campaign and movements of armies is no less important today than in the past . ''

		In the scholarly treatise under review Profes - sor
Johnson	PERSON	undertakes to explain with the pre - cision of the scientist , yet in untechnical language , the effects of topography upon the campaigns in all the principal theatres of war , from the inva - sion of
Belgium	LOCATION	to the conquest of
Rumania	LOCATION	.

		Taking the great areas of combat one by one , he first portrays , with the aid of numerous draw - ings and pictures , the topographic features that would be likely to affect either offensive or defen - sive military operations , and follows with a run - ning account of the campaigns that actually took place , carefully interpreted with reference to the land forms described .

		The descriptions are mod - els of vivid presentation , and the narratives make up a summary of military operations which has value quite apart from the purpose which the author has primarily in view .

		In the chapters on the western theatre of war topographic reasons for the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	are made perfectly clear .

		It is shown that while the terrain of eastern and northeastern
France	LOCATION	offers four great routes from
Germany	LOCATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	, three of these were impracticable under the con - ditions existing in
August , 1914	DATE	.


Germany	LOCATION	found herself simultaneously at war with three leading powers
Russia	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Great Britain	LOCATION	and , as every one knows , the plan of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's strategists was that the German legions should drive swiftly to the heart of
France	LOCATION	and bring that country to its knees before Rus - sia should have time to mobilize and become a pressing danger on the east .

		The route from the 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 20	DATE	middle Rhine country westward through the
Belfort	LOCATION	gateway , that along the Moselle trench by way of
Luxemburg	LOCATION	, and that from
Cologne	LOCATION	around the Ardennes past Aix-la-Chapelle were alike impossible , because they could not be trav - ersed with the requisite speed .

		The sole reason why they could not be so traversed lay in topo - graphic conditions , or in French fortifications which these conditions had made possible .

		Only the route by way of the open Belgian plain although it was longer than any of the others could be made to yield the desired result ; and the decision was to take it , in defiance of Belgian rights , the sacredness of treaties , and the sentiment of an outraged world .

		Hence it is literally true that `` the violation of Belgian neu - trality was predetermined by events which took place several million years ago '' ; that is , by the geological process which gave the rock layers of northeastern
France	LOCATION	their uniform downward slope toward the west , and left the Belgian terri - tories flat and depressed almost to the level of the sea .

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	's incisive discussion brings the reader to the opinion which manifestly was held by the German General Staff in
1914	DATE	; namely , that it was a question of either invading
France	LOCATION	through
Belgium	LOCATION	or of not successfully invading
France	LOCATION	at all .

		In the east as in the west , the fortunes of com - bat closely followed terrain .

		When the Russians pushed their armies into the lake country of
East Prussia	LOCATION	they lost topographic advantage and suf - fered disaster , but when they fell back to the line of the Bobr and
Narew	ORGANIZATION	marshes the pur - suing Germans were summarily halted .

		Taking the eastern campaigns as a whole , however , the treachery which left great Russian armies , and eventually the whole of the Rumanian forces , without ammunition and other supplies was of more ultimate weight in determining the course of events than topography or anything else .

		How topographic advantages saved Servia from Austrian subjugation until the situation was changed by
Bulgaria	LOCATION	's entrance into the war , is clearly brought out by Professor
Johnson	PERSON	, as also the balance of topographic forces in the region of Saloniki which has so long precluded decisive action by either group of belligerents in that quarter .

		Better known but not less interesting is the topography of the Trentine and
Isonzo	PERSON	' fronts , described by the author in such a man - ner as to make the great Italian retreat of
1917	DATE	easily intelligible .

		There has been much need of such a book as Professor
Johnson	PERSON	has written , and no author better qualified for the task could have been found .

		Professional physiographers may regret the treatise 's brevity and its essentially popular nature .

		But scientific accuracy has at no point been sacrificed , and a longer , more technical work would fail utterly to serve the intelligent read - ing public as the present volume will serve it .

		It is becoming increasingly difficult for an advertiser to misrepresent his goods .


Samuel Hopkins Adams	PERSON	and his energetic confreres on the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune '' have started a crusade that is forcing newspapers , boards of trade , rotary organizations , and chambers of commerce to make the laws concerning the marketing of merchandise more and more drastic .

		It is a statutory offense today to label a package `` Pepper '' that is fifty per cent , sand , to shortweight a householder on a can of
Early June	DATE	Peas , to swindle the least experienced purchaser in the matter of a box of dried prunes .

		Honesty in such matters has become not merely a policy but a legal necessity ; one finds the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth on the wrappers containing candy , silver polish , hair tonic , cough drops , of every - thing in fact except books .

		Why the publishers of books are allowed to indulge in deceptive labels that would never be permitted a manufacturer of soap is something I can never understand .

		I have often passed from any store 's grocery department to its book section and have been flabbergasted by the abrupt con - trast ; I have been amazed at the sudden and shameless change from scrupulous statements to fantastic exaggerations , from the carefully candid to the frankly fraudulent .

		I am not now con - cerned with the psychological reaction in the mind of the critic , the revulsion that always fol - lows a plethora of superlatives .

		I speak simply of the way in which the casual and trusting reader is brazenly enticed , deceived , tempted , mis - informed , and hornswoggled .

		Take the first of this quintet .

		On the modest
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 21 gray jacket of Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	's volume appears this far from modest summary : The best poems of one of our leading modern poets .

		... These lyrics , exquisite in style and fine in feeling , are a notable contribution to literature .

		They interpret the life of our own time .

		This patent misstatement can scarcely be excused on the ground of a publisher 's enthusiasm .

		It requires something more than a flight of imagina - tion to consider Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	`` one of our leading poets , '' even though some of the indi - vidual lyrics , while saturated with the old poetic rhetoric , are indisputably `` fine in feeling . ''

		Not even the most elastic stretch of fancy could induce one to believe that `` they interpret the life of our own time . ''

		A person looking for verse that really does interpret our age , and buying this volume on the guarantee of its cover , would feel that he had actually been cheated .

		If it is a crime to put benzoate of soda and cochineal into canned goods and cordials without so specifying , is it less of an offense to coax a none too critical public into the belief that it is buying a genuine `` interpretation of our times '' when it is actually getting a merely pretty estimate of a time that has gone ?

		What we receive here is really no in - terpretation at all , but the breath of a resuscitated poetry .

		from an almost forgotten past .

		It rises delicately out of lyrics like `` Pierrot , '' `` Roundels of the Year , '' `` Dominion , '' ``
January	DATE	Dusk . ''

		Or , at rare intervals , it attempts an older and ruder note , as in `` The Feckenham Men '' and `` Wed , '' which begins : I married him on Christmas morn , Ah woe betide , ah woe betide ,
Folk	ORGANIZATION	said I was a comely bride , Ah me forlorn .

		All braided was my golden hair , And heavy then , and shining then , My limbs were sweet to madden men , O cunning snare .

		My beauty was a thing they say Of large renown , O dread renown , Its rumor travelled through the town , Alas the day ... When the first copy of the short-lived venture `` New Numbers '' came from
Gloucester	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, early in
1914	DATE	, it was evident that something new was being attempted in a cooperative magazine .

		The war soon stopped it .

		But it did not need the war to reveal the incongruity of the quartet of poets that composed it .

		And
John Drink	ORGANIZATION	- water 's water-color verses seemed doubly incon - gruous when they appeared sandwiched among the best work of
Lascelles Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	,
W. W. Gibson	PERSON	, and
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here is a typical lyric : Lord of the host of deep desires That spare no sting , yet are to me Sole echo of the silver choirs Whose swelling is eternity , With all save thee my soul is pressed In high dispute from day to day , But , Love , at thy most high behest I make no answer , and obey .

		This is all of
Drinkwater	ORGANIZATION	in substance .

		A suave grace , a well executed turn , a decent atten - tion to-form and finish , an oratorical gesture , and a pleasant musical vagueness : these are his .

		To suggest that these possessions make this young Englishman a whit better poet than a dozen con - temporary Americans would be no more than foolish .

		But to maintain that they make him `` one of our leading poets '' and `` interpret the life of our own time '' is too much like a bad joke .

		So with Mrs.
Wilcox	PERSON	's volume .

		Those who know what to expect of the daily
Ella Wheeler	PERSON	will not be disappointed .

		But those of the younger generation who , prowling about a book - store for information , light upon the cover of her recent collection will be surprised to learn that it is not only `` the finest thing Mrs.
Wilcox	PERSON	has ever done '' but that `` it is not unworthy to stand beside the most famous sonnet sequence in all literature . ''

		After such a confident verdict it would be ungracious to enter critically on ground so holy , even though the cover expressly invites us with the assurance that `` unlike so intensely an emotional poem , it stands the test of searching criticism . ''

		Here is an octave : You were so wonderful with quiet faith ; Only the Saints and martyrs of the earth Held such unalterable high thoughts of death , As those which filled you from your hour of birth .

		And when we were together , many a time , We felt the Presences of Unseen Guests : And you saw visions , mystical , sublime , When forth your spirit went on astral quests ... The problem here is not to rate the present collection , but to decide with which of the famous sonnet sequences it should be placed .

		It brings up the pretty question of which is really `` the most famous sonnet sequence in all litera - ture ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ?

		Sidney 's ?

		Spenser 's ?

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's ?

		Rossetti 's ?

		Meredith 's ?

		Well , no matter .

		Whichever one it is , Mrs.
Wilcox	PERSON	's must be -LRB- and the author of her cover ought to know -RRB- not unworthy to stand beside it .

		The man who planned the paper jacket of Mr.
Rice	PERSON	's volume is more cautious .

		It was not he but the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	`` Times '' that said : `` He -LSB-
Gale Young Rice	PERSON	-RSB- is one of the supreme lyrists and one of the few remaining lovers of beauty 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 20	DATE	who write it . ''

		And yet the use of this honest superlative seems a bit injudicious .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	is an undoubtedly able craftsman ; he can fashion a lyric as well as
Drinkwater	PERSON	, a sonnet almost as classic as Mrs.
Wilcox	PERSON	's .

		His medium is almost always under his control .

		But when one is con - fronted with the statement that he is one of `` the supreme lyrists , '' one is likely to approach Mr.
Rice	PERSON	's most likable lyrics with an unusual suspicion .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	's own preface rouses sim - ilar misgivings .

		In spite of his evidently secure position , he devotes several pages to a rather ill - natured attack on the `` rhythmless , free-verse realism , '' on the `` petty poetry magazines '' in general and Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	and the much abused
W. S. Braithwaite	PERSON	in particular .

		He attacks , with impartial inclusiveness , the `` new movements '' ; but this does not deter him from trying to imitate them .

		Witness , for instance , `` Insulation , '' with its strange blend of the Im - agists and
Edgar Lee	PERSON	Masters : The telephone lines , Etched by the lightning 's needle On the
night	TIME	plate of her window , Seemed but as strands of a dream 's phosphorescence Flashed rippling to her out of the drench of the dark - ness .

		Yet one of them was bearing , Past her , thro the wet shimmer of the shower , The sinuous words her husband 's to his mistress `` Tonight , my passion-flower ! ''

		Miss
Underwood	PERSON	's cover delicately intimates that her volume should be popular , as `` Hafiz was not known merely to the literary classes , but was and is the poet of the people and his songs may justly be called ` popular ' poetry .

		This version has been prepared in a special effort to preserve the flavor and character of the original Per - sian . ''

		I am not versed in either the flavor or the character of Persian poetry in the original , but I suspect that it is not altogether like : Bring back to my heart once more , though I Gather the gossiping world 's grudges thereby .

		Bring Joy 's fire back , which once should wild beasts know , The mighty forests would be leveled low .

		Alone it frees from coil of change and time , And for me opens the tent door divine .

		Nor do I believe that it is a characteristic of Hafiz to use rhymes as haphazard as the English `` thing doubling , '' `` me grandly , '' `` come sun , '' `` be safely , '' `` cruelly surely , '' `` thrown comb . ''

		As for the book itself , it reads like a humorless parody of the `` Rubaiyat '' as if some - one had translated
Fitzgerald	ORGANIZATION	's version into Jap - anese and then had it rendered back into English by a poet of the
Richard Badger	PERSON	school .

		Mr.
Lieberman	PERSON	wins us if with nothing else than with his cover , which is of a waxed and transparent nature .

		That being virginal of ink , one is compelled to read the book to see what it is about .

		And it is something of a disappoint - ment to learn that it concerns itself so little with its promising title .

		Instead of genuine re - flections from the alleys , avenues , or `` paved streets , '' we have the kind of glib rhyming that rises infrequently to more hazardously sustained eloquence .

		For the greater part , the volume alternates between consciously occasional verses and lighter measures that are scarcely as nimble as their obvious models .

		The dexterity of Frank -
lin P. Adams	PERSON	is years beyond Mr.
Lieberman	PERSON	; he has still to achieve the far lower levels of
Caro	PERSON	-
lyn Wells	PERSON	,
Thomas R. Ybarra	PERSON	, and
Arthur Guiterman	PERSON	.

		The volume , in spite of its amia - bility and good intentions , is full of weak , mere - tricious , and even maudlin spots .

		But the cover , at least , is spotless .

		Passionate Puppets NOCTURNE .

		By
Frank Swinnerton	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	.

		In his pleasant introduction to this new novel by his friend
Frank Swinnerton	PERSON	,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	points out that here we encounter an art dif - ferent in kind from his own .

		`` It bores me to look at things unless there is also the idea of doing something with them . ''

		But
Swinnerton	PERSON	`` has no underlying motive .

		He sees and tells .

		His aim is the attainment of that beauty which comes with exquisite presentation . ''

		In other words , dealing though it does with rarely Cock - ney Londoners of the lower middle class , `` Noc - turne '' has no purpose other than to give us that pleasure which can always be got from sheer beauty , that beauty which St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	defined as `` id cuius ipsa apprehensio placet . ''

		What is more , Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	succeeds in his aim , and criticism has left only to essay with clumsy fingers to turn the eye to details and harmonies not wholly obvious .

		Yes , and in this book 's case , to give expression and so some easement , however vain , to those emotions which so tragic a masterpiece must inevitably evoke .

		The genius of the author bites his subject hard and shakes it with so exhaustive an inten - sity that in these short 250 pages we feel that every nook and corner of its life has been searched out , and that after
Jenny	PERSON	's last cry , `` Keith oh Keith !

		... '' one more
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 23 shake would be rhetoric .

		The style has the invisibility of perfect glass , and unaware of it we see only the figures of these passionate pup - pets , outlined so deathly black against the crude gray of an unconscious universe .

		The events of the story take place all in one night .

		A good part of the book is given to painting the doldrums of life in
Kennington Park	LOCATION	, a rather poor district of
London	LOCATION	.

		There the two sisters ,
Jenny	PERSON	working the day in a milliner 's , Emmy doing the housework at home , companion their
Pa Blanchard	PERSON	, a half imbecile wreck .

		A touch is given to the stagnant atmos - phere by mention of
Pa	ORGANIZATION	's pension , which empha - sizes the impersonal and unadventurous quality of this too assured existence .


Alf Rylett	PERSON	, whose hair is `` of a common but unnamed colour , be - tween brown and grey , '' aspires to keeping company with
Jenny	PERSON	, the more vivid and less hobbled sister .

		A little whiff of air seems about to blow when
Pa	ORGANIZATION	elicits from
Alf	PERSON	news of a ten thousand dollar fire , only to evaporate at the knowledge that `` the insurance companies are too wide to stand all the risk themselves ... It 's a mere flea-bite to them . ''

		Thus a hopeful bigamy pans out at only `` ten pound three and fourpence '' and in the `` train smash ... nobody killed . ''

		In order that fate , however abetted by indus - trial civilization , may alone take the responsibility , thus making the tragedy unavoidable and there - fore more capable of beauty as well as easier to be endured , all the characters are made to par - take , though some of them frugally , of our pity - ing love .

		The three men , each in his own way quite shamelessly self-seeking , are yet not to be blamed by us .

		Pa in his second childhood is too obviously down to admit of any judgment upon him ;
Keith	PERSON	,
Jenny	PERSON	's sailor-lover , has weathered too many evil strokes ; and even the calculating
Alf	PERSON	will not desert his landlady , `` because if anybody asked me if he should go there , I could n't honestly recommend him to ... and I should n't like to leave her in the lurch . ''

		When the drudge Emmy has been fobbed off upon the disgruntled Alf and those remarkable lovers have left for the theatre , when
Pa	ORGANIZATION	has been put to bed ,
Jenny	PERSON	sits alone staring at the clock . '

		` Wound up to go all day ! '

		she thought , comparing the clock with herself . ''

		Here we have the final touch to that mechanistic horror which so completely involves all the characters depicted .

		Then comes the unexpected ring at the door , the apparent shattering of the hated web , the hours of bitter love upon the yacht , and then the ride home with its realization of the `` sequel to endure . ''

		The very word `` sequel '' is poignantly ironic .

		This is not be - cause of the body of
Pa	ORGANIZATION	stretched unconscious across the kitchen floor , still less because of pos - sible repentance .

		The irony is that even in this passionate adventure our poor heroine was but a cog in the all-embracing mechanism , that there are in life such things as sequels cogwheels that turn with cogwheels .

		Whether or not
Jenny	PERSON	be lacerated , anyhow she is enslaved .

		In a world such as this we can only regard conscious exist - ence with awe , and marvel at the ridiculous gallantry of living .

		This essential bitterness in life is seldom so clear as in the portrait of
Jenny Blanchard	PERSON	.

		It is not only her eyes that flash and glitter in `` the paltry gaslight . ''

		If to under - stand her position is to suffer for this fine and fiery soul , to think of her even by herself gives us pain : she is so keen that merely to conceive her character , as to grasp something that is all cutting edge , hurts our mind .

		When alone in her room , in the anguish of self-reproach for
Pa	ORGANIZATION	's misfortune and in the more lancinating anguish of her doubts of
Keith	PERSON	's love and in the merciless knowledge that at any rate she has irretrievably consigned to him her free - dom , she gently calls upon her lover , her voice is `` barely audible '' audible , God knows , to us , but unheard , we fear unimagined , of
Keith	PERSON	.

		How frail and expressive is this human cry in the huge mechanism of
London	LOCATION	.

		Outside the unlit chamber we fancy the dead revolving moon , so hideously alien to the human heart , so hideously at one with the unmeaning revolutions of the city 's life in death .

		With
Jenny	PERSON	, in her last broken grasp at the old way of seeing things , we too say , `` What a life !

		Golly what a life ! ''

		But with another crunch the machinery takes her , and to annihilate Distance ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	, and Fate she throws herself upon the bed and buries her face in the pillow , there without the mocking audi - bility of her former cry , with its tragic suggestion of measure and so of inadequacy , to repeat again `` Keith ... oh Keith ! ''

		We also are pathetic figures ; for in anguish of heart and vainly , O ludicrously , we see only this crumpled child and children ourselves , we strain our arms into and through the thin text seeking to embrace and cherish this unhappy girl to give her such small comfort as it might be to her to know we com - prehend and that , between her and `` they , '' only she matters , and that a world in which she is not `` right '' is not itself `` right '' for any man with heart and head .

		By

		Sherman , French ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In this book the principles of Biblical criticism have run amuck .

		According to the authors ,
Christ	ORGANIZATION	is Simon Bar Gi'ora , Jewish patriot , whose historical record is written in

		The New Testament is all cryptic , and properly understood , gives a graphic account of this Jewish war lord , led in triumph to
Rome	LOCATION	by Titus .

		In the gospel story of the triumph
Jerusalem	LOCATION	has been cryptically substituted for
Rome	LOCATION	.

		There is no regular system of cryptograms , but linguis - tic gyrations , translations , and substitutions all the familiar methods utilized without a co - ordinating plan .

		The book is to be listed in the limbo of critical oddities with

		RAEMAEKERS ' CARTOON HISTORY OF THE WAR .

		Vol .

		I. Century ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In
America	LOCATION	we have had , until recently , noth - ing beyond the labeled cartoon which consisted of certain pictorial forms eked out by a liberal use of explanatory texts , all mixed up with the drawing .

		This apology for drawing is more like a partly hieroglyphic language than a pictorial art .

		Strictly speaking there were in
1914	DATE	not ten cartoonists worthy of the name in the whole ` country .

		Then came the war and the influx of European cartoons .

		A little later came
Rae	PERSON	- maekers , and ' with him an amusing paradox .

		Though the supercartoonist of the day , he is not really a cartoonist ; he is an artist .

		All the critics have dissected his art in praise and quar - reled over the master qualities .

		He has appeared in
Basque	LOCATION	and Arabic , and the prices of various editions of his works range from
$ 100	MONEY	.

		to
four cents	MONEY	.

		In view of all this , criticism seems alto - gether gratuitous .

		We may say that like any other great artist ,
Raemaekers	ORGANIZATION	's greatest asset is personality .

		It is his personality that chooses unerringly the subject matter , picks the pictorial forms to illustrate it , compresses the whole into an excellent composition , delights the cognoscenti with fine draftsmanship , avoids the stirring sub - ject that is not pictorial , and brings these quali - ties in right proportion into all his works .

		Let us cite briefly an example .

		In a cartoon entitled `` The Prisoners , '' Raemaekers has chosen a com - mon subject ; yet from the millions of possible forms , he has taken but three to illustrate it .

		He has filled his page with three men three types to stand for the thousands of others .

		The men are huddled together in a common misery of mind and body , and
Raemaekers	ORGANIZATION	has huddled his pencil strokes in such a manner that this message is supreme .

		His forceful draftsmanship does not stop with lifelike representation .

		In the varied poses of the three heads we can easily read three different reactions to confinement .

		And lastly he has refrained from calling it `` Thinking of Home . ''

		It is this escape from the obvious which gives us the final pleasure and assures his power for all time .

		Other men have used only a part of their personality on these points and have filled the gaps with an imitative substitute .

		Other men have made cartoons : Raemaekers has made history .

		HOPE TRUEBLOOD .

		By
Patience Worth	ORGANIZATION	.

		Communicated through Mrs.
John H. Cur	PERSON	- ran .

		Holt ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` Patience Worth '' has become a voluminous author .

		She has dropped her pseudo-Elizabethan mannerisms and is now writing a `` mid - Victorian novel by a pre-Victorian writer , '' as the editor assures us .

		Viewed as literature and by not too rigid a standard , this novel like former works from the same `` pen '' is not without interest and not without merit .

		Like the others it is a rather spontaneously mechanical , a fluently uninspired performance .

		Considered in terms of the man - ner of its composition , as a labored kind of auto - matic writing , it is a formidable effort .

		Just why the passion for writing , which in this case is genuine and justified by ability , should utilize a planchette or an automatic pencil rather than a stenographer and typewriter , is not an easy matter to decide .

		It is a mode of setting apart one 's writing self from one 's other , normally liv - ing and communicating self .

		Only Mrs.
Curran	PERSON	can solve the mystery , and she is as Sphinx-like now as on her first appearance in the literary field .

		The disguise is thin ; and any attempt to pose the product as a defiance of the laws of mental composition is misleading .

		Psychology admits the rare proportions of the undertaking , but finds no need to revise its sturdy principles by reason of Mrs.
Curran	PERSON	's literary technique .

		If `` Patience Worth '' were disposed to write her literary confessions with absolute frankness , the illumination would be welcome and most in - teresting .

		MODERN MAN AND His FORERUNNERS : A Short Study of the Human Species , Living and Extinct .

		By
H. G. F. Spurrell	PERSON	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		Dr.
Spurrell	PERSON	has nothing whatsoever to say and says it indifferently .

		Nearly half of his book is devoted to an exposition of man 's zoological position , racial classification , and prehistoric cul - ture .

		This section is avowedly sketchy T but even the merest outline should be without some of the misleading statements in which the author freely indulges .

		For example , since the best
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 25 authorities hold that the reindeer was domesti - cated about the time of the birth of Christ it is rather surprising to find the species represented as `` according to some authorities '' domesticated not less than seventy or a hundred thousand years ago -LRB- page 50 -RRB- !

		Likewise the bland assumption that `` various sections of the human species undoubtedly lost and rediscovered the horse repeatedly during the passage of ages '' -LRB- page 55 -RRB- utterly disregards the difficulty of breeding animals in captivity .

		Cheap speculation also char - acterizes Dr.
Spurrell	PERSON	's attempts to limn the origins of society .

		All this however is merely the preamble to a lugubrious , dreary tirade about the decay of civilization .

		The author finds `` no reason for claiming greater permanence for the present civilization ... than has been shown by any of the great civilizations of the past '' ; but lest we perish in a slough of despondency he closes with the consolatory affirmation that on the subject matter of his book he is not pessimistic , but merely agnostic , and has not even a guess to offer .

		As might be expected , we encounter cheap and time-honored phrases about fundamental problems of the age .

		The socialistic masses are described as longing for `` ease without effort , and the abasement of all of whom they are jealous . ''

		Democracy altogether is a failure .

		Abandonment of the national religion is `` an attempt to gain freedom from moral restraints '' ; and the devout nonconformist is as much a symptom of decadence as the infidel .

		In short , the essay is simply the work of an ignorant and unintelligent apostle of reaction .

		THE DIVINE COMEDY OF DANTE ALI - GHIERI .

		Translated by
Courtney Langdon	PERSON	.

		Vol .

		1 .

		The Inferno .


Harvard Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Press ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The homage of translation has been offered to
Dante	LOCATION	at least twice this year .

		Professor
Lang	PERSON	- don holds that verse is a more satisfactory medium than prose for retaining something of the fire and passion of the original , and that blank verse alone permits fidelity to letter and accent .

		The success of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's version and the rich promise of the present one would seem to justify the claim .

		The rather haughty tone of the preface may prejudice some readers ; many will decline to accept Professor
Langdon	PERSON	's stric - tures on his great predecessor .

		Why should `` every new translation ... call for a word of justification '' or itself imply `` a criticism whether expressed or not , of competitors already in the field '' ?

		And why competitors at all ?

		The translation of any great master must always be an Italiam fugientem which will never cease to fascinate , but who shall claim to have reached the goal and thereby to have rendered further attempts idle ?

		Dante lovers will welcome every new tribute born of years of communion with the master , and all will agree that this new version maintains a high level of excellence throughout .

		It is sufficiently faithful to the word , although less literal than
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		At times it is more happy ; at others , less ; and occasionally it adapts
Longfellow	LOCATION	's lines with little or no change .

		Only impertinence will say this is better than the earlier , as a whole .

		The following passage , chosen because of its familiarity , may serve to show Professor
Langdon	PERSON	's manner : And she to me : `` There is no greater pain than to remember happy days in days of misery ; and this thy Leader knows .

		But if to know the first root of our love so yearning a desire possesses thee , I 'll do as one who weepeth while he speaks .

		One day , for pastime merely , we were reading of
Lancelot	LOCATION	, and how love o'erpowered him ; * alone we were , and free from all misgiving .

		Oft did that reading cause our eyes to meet , and often take the color from our faces ; and yet one passage only overcame us . ''

		Professor
Langdon	PERSON	has placed the Italian text on the opposite page on guard , as he puts it .

		Brief notes provide necessary explanation and point the significance of the poem for our time .

		The con - venience of the general reader would perhaps have been better served had these notes been printed with the separate cantos instead of together at the beginning .

		THE EARTHQUAKE .

		By
Arthur Train	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In this novel prosperous
America	LOCATION	is shown taking the war with a self-appreciatory heroism that should destroy any lurking proletarian skep - ticism .

		Wives enduring with noble fortitude the shrinking of the family income from forty thou - sand to twenty-five thousand a year , husbands facing the incredible hardships of building their own fires , rollicking college boys turned into serious and responsible officers anxious about the immortal souls of themselves and their men , debutantes turning to the study of stenography a world transformed , and acutely conscious of the nobility of that transformation .

		We were in a bad way , Mr. Train tells us , going in
1914	DATE	the historic corrupt way of the Roman Empire with our sexual irregularity and our wasteful - ness and our luxurious materialism .

		But now the war has changed all that. , Eloquent chapters on the redemption of the garbage pail and on the salvation of the rich from the locust swarms of servants whom their fortunes were maintaining in idleness preach a lesson that make the book not only a chronicle but an evangel .

		Lyric heights are touched in the picture of the disap - pearance of classes and of the supremacy of wealth .

		We are all brothers now , and after 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 20	DATE	military life under our beneficent government the discontented classes will feturn with small patience for those agitators who took advantage of the undernourished condition of the poor to preach socialism and economic reform .

		Food and discipline will have made men out of proletarians .

		In contrast to those liberal hopes which see the return of the soldier as the beginning of a new progressive social reconstruction , Mr. Train is convinced that the American at least will come back with a new respect for conservative law and order , for the disciplined state , for the unified valor that makes nations powerful .

		That the prosperous will continue to lead the new day is shown in Mr.
Train	PERSON	's na'ive picture of the process by which his broker-hero and lawyer and capital - ist friends take over to themselves the conduct of the war .

		The note of sacrifice is thus rather vitiated .

		The men who pass from a desk in
New York	LOCATION	to a military-official desk in
Washington	LOCATION	, the idle women who suddenly burst into war work are exhibited in the act of having far too good a time .

		Mr.
Train	PERSON	, as interpreter of the significant classes , can not repress a subdued ex - ultation at this new lease of life .

		Theirs is now again not only the power but the glory .

		War which destroys so many evil things has rubbed away their gathering tarnish .

		And if we are to believe Mr. Train , none know better than they the full moral effulgence of that result .

		PROFIT SHARING .

		By
Edwin F. Gay	PERSON	,
Arthur W. Burritt	PERSON	,
Henry S. Dennison	PERSON	,
Ralph E. Heilman	PERSON	, and
Henry P. Kendall	PERSON	.

		Harper ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The present wage system , especially that of time wages , is recognized by many as a poor makeshift at its best .

		The average man is as lazy as he dares to be and frequently his chief aim seems to be to do the least amount of work necessary to keep from being discharged or being reduced in pay .

		In a small plant the superin - tendent can look after the men ; but as the plant grows and the number of men increases , it is increasingly difficult to gauge accurately the value of the various workmen .

		Guesswork or favorit - ism fixes the wages too many times .

		The piece - rate system which fixes wages according to output , when it can be applied , works out more justly ; but there is an inevitable friction because the employer feels that he is paying too much and the employee that he is getting too little .

		This is especially true of industries that have not been thoroughly standardized and developed .

		The case becomes worse when the measurement of individual efficiency is impracticable .

		One way of overcoming these difficulties and promoting a direct interest on the part of the workman is that of profit sharing , which is described in this book by two college professors arid three experienced business men .

		The essential feature of profit sharing is an agreement between an employer and his work - people under which the latter receive in addition to their wages a share , fixed beforehand , in the profits of the undertaking .

		In other words , the special payment received by employees is directly contingent upon the profits for a specified time , and varies directly with these profits , upon a pre - arranged basis .

		A bonus or a deferred wage pay - ment , the amount of which has no direct relation to the profits earned , is not real profit sharing .

		To be successful , profit sharing must start with pay - ing the full market rate of wages to participants ; efficiency and cooperation can not be obtained otherwise .

		Likewise the payments must be sub - stantial , the plan should be definite , and the nature of the plan must vary with its purpose .

		The effect of profit sharing , as shown , is the elimination of waste , the promotion of stability of labor , and the elimination of strife .

		Organized labor seems to be opposed to profit sharing , but as a matter of fact it might be expected to operate more effectively in a unionized establishment than in any other ; for the union scale practically standardizes wages and therefore , if profits are distributed in proportion to wages , there is prac - tical equality both in wages and in participation in profits , so that envy and jealousy is dimin - ished .

		Profit sharing is also effective in promoting efficiency among branch managers and has been tried with success in chain stores .

		The conclu - sion reached is that the effectiveness of profit sharing as an instrument for profit making is greatest among the higher group of employees and small groups of the rank and file .

		The book is an interesting and balanced presentation of one method of making the conventional distribution of profits more just and democratic .

		ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE UNSEEN .

		By
William F. Barrett	PERSON	.

		Introduction by
James H. Hyslop	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Is it accidental that the three distinguished English sponsors for unseen forces should be physicists , and thus not in their professional ele - ment in dealing with the evasive phenomena of abnormal mentality ?

		Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	, Sir
Wil	PERSON	-
liam Crookes	PERSON	, and Sir
William Barrett	PERSON	have con - ferred the scientific prestige of their notable achievements upon a cause that more than any other has contributed to the obscurantism of latter days .

		It may be that in conceiving the forces of the mind too much after the manner of physical radiations escaping our sense , but none the less real , they were ready to assume the unreal because they were convinced of the reality of the effect .

		What they too lightly considered was the sub - tlety and complexity of the mechanism by which
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 27 the apparent reality assumed the plausibility of evidence .

		When the phenomena approached the physical , like the table-lifting of
Paladino	LOCATION	, they were nearer to their specialty but none the less inept , because physical apparatus does not cheat .

		It is true that Sir
William	PERSON	cites
Paladino	PERSON	with a cer - tain disgust , because he will have no converse with paid mediums ; but he seriously cites all the evidence of distinguished names who added to their distinction that of not discovering her pal - pable fraud , and he utterly ignores the character of her detection .

		He presents her as a medium , morally low , who cheated when she was detected and gave genuine spiritual messages when she was not .

		For it is not so much the irrelevancy of his speculations as his amazing blindness to the most elementary principles of evidence , his insensibility to the attitude that a scientific sense supposedly creates , which in an other - wise able mind paralyzes the reader .

		By the time the apologist presents the evidence for survival after death , even those who might approach this hypothesis with a favorable dis - position must be so deeply impressed with the uncritical handling of the topic that they reach the threshold with shaken faith .

		After thirty years for Sir
William	PERSON	was one of the founders of the Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	in
1882	DATE	despite the many evidences of fraud and the prog - ress of psychology , the same ground is covered in the same manner , with the same selection of obscure favorable cases , and no attempt is made to gain an insight into the realm as a whole .

		That is the logical tragedy of the volume .

		CREDIT OF THE NATIONS .

		By
J. Laurence Laughlin	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		This is one of the most important books on the war published this year .

		Of course , no single volume could adequately discuss the workings of credit in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	since
1914	DATE	, and Mr.
Laughlin	PERSON	does not pretend to have furnished a definitive analy - sis .

		But within the limits of his exposition the facts are presented clearly and illuminatingly .

		Charts and diagrams are frequently employed , and the exact methods of comparative statistics remove any possible vagueness from the gener - alizations .

		The lessons of French and British experience stand forth sharply for our own ben - efit and example in the arrangement of our war finance .

		And why not the experience of Ger - many ?

		Because if one conclusion emerges unmis - takably from Mr.
Laughlin	PERSON	's study , it is that
Germany	LOCATION	, financially speaking , is bankrupt .

		Not merely is she now borrowing to pay off interest on earlier war indebtedness , but the so-called `` pyramiding '' of credit has reached such a point that without large indemnities it would seem that the conclusion of the war will send the whole fragile structure tumbling to ruins .

		So obvious is the reduction in the production of goods that he who runs can read the inevitable effect upon the basis of credit .

		It is impossible that the great mass of assets behind the demand liabilities should be liquid .

		Yet with steadily lessening produc - tion , the volume of demand liabilities is increasing .

		If the assets are not now liquid , then the solvency of credit has already gone ... So long as appearances are kept up by trading with a depreciated currency , the solvency of credit exists only on paper ; economi - cally , so far as a basis of exchangeable goods is concerned , the credit is not solvent even now .

		What will
Germany	LOCATION	do when the day of account - ing comes and five sixths of the present paper useless so far as the needs of currency are con - cerned has to be retired ?

		How , if in the period before the war the German people staggered under a tax of
$ 800,000,000	MONEY	a year , will they be able to meet a
$ 2,000,000,000	MONEY	a year tax to pay off the interest alone of their militaristic adventure ?

		The plain answer is that a peace `` without victory '' for
Germany	LOCATION	means financial ruin .

		Perhaps unconsciously , but none the less convincingly , Mr.
Laughlin	PERSON	has supported the contention of those who say that the present eco - nomic and financial whip of the Allies over Ger - many provided , of course , they employ it is a unit of strength constitutes a weapon against which any temporary military advantage becomes trivial .

		THE HAPPIEST TIME OF THEIR LIVES .

		By
Alice Duer Miller	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	.

		Such a title should prepare one for insipidity in a novel .

		In this case , however , the suggestion seems inadequate .

		In her obvious moralizing about the materialism of
New York	LOCATION	's smart set , the author is unable to conceal a kind of nai 've self-adulation in the presence of her own char - acters .

		She is clearly a bit fascinated by the evils she has set herself to punish and reform .

		And her treatment seldom goes beyond the bald - est of exposition .

		She is limited by the tawdry externals which she would seem to deprecate .

		The characters are mainly figureheads with a few stock traits for purposes of differentiation .

		There is
Matilde	LOCATION	, the round-eyed young heroine , who finds all things `` marvelous '' and `` wonder - ful '' ; the vampirish young mother of
Matilde	PERSON	, who gloats over being subdued by her black-eyed , stern-lipped husband ; the well-tailored grand - father , struggling to keep from being old-fash - ioned ; and the colorless young hero , who origin - ates all of the complication by falling in love with
Matilde	PERSON	and arousing snobbish family ob - jections which , after a deal of commonplace wrangling , are precipitately removed in the last chapters .

		The book has not even the tang of cleverness to relieve its banality .

		28 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 20	DATE	NOTES ox NEW WAR BOOKS If you have good wind , you will find it worth while to read consecutively three books by French officers which have recently been translated and published in this country .

		They are , in the order in which their perusal will give the most interesting effect , `` Covered with Mud and Glory '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , by Sergeant - Major
Georges Lafond	PERSON	, `` A Crusader of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , by Captain
Ferdinand Bel	PERSON	- mont , and `` Campaigns and Intervals '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , by Lieutenant
Jean Girau	PERSON	- doux .

		`` Covered with Mud and Glory '' is a remark - ably pure example of straight narrative of actual occurrences .

		Indeed so direct is the relation of the incidents chosen and so really Attic -LRB- or shall we not say French ? -RRB-

		the sobriety of style that perhaps from a literary point of view this is , if not the best , at any rate the most interesting of the three books .

		Sergeant - Major
Lafond	PERSON	was assigned as intelligence officer to a machine-gun section and served through several of the most important engagements of the war .

		These chap - ers , as could be guessed from the headings , which include `` The Search for my Company , '' `` A Reconnaissance in the Fog , '' `` Days in
Canton	LOCATION	- ment , '' are each a complete picture of some one of the ordinary experiences of life at the front .

		Although the style is always matter-of-fact and the events for the most part decidedly so , yet there are in this book one or two incidents of a pathos so authentic that one may perhaps be for - given the use of what Sergeant-Major
Lafond	PERSON	never allows himself , a somewhat fanciful simile .

		In the bare skies of this narrative , there do burst , if gravely and with measure , starshells of a truly poignant emotion .

		`` A Crusader of
France	LOCATION	'' is of interest only as presenting an illustration in phychology .

		These letters , which
Henry Bordeaux	ORGANIZATION	has pref - aced with a characteristic essay in which his religious enthusiasm obscures the arguments , were written to the author 's family and were pub - lished only after his death .

		We should not there - fore cavil at the fatiguing repetitions , common - places , and lack of clarity .

		Yet even in this matter of style we have the right in an English translation to require at least English .

		`` We are like others are elsewhere . ''

		`` The village ... has little suffered . ''

		These are two from a hundred such barbarisms .

		The author , despite the fact that his lack of imagination has made him a good deal of a prig and a snob , was a very conscientious and religious young man .

		The appalling aspect of his psychology is the manner in which he envisages war .

		He reminds us that `` victories do not cost dear '' to God , that in His `` hands war is a docile instrument , '' and `` that war is one of God 's great means of teaching a lesson . ''

		It is hard to understand why Captain Belmont , feeling so keenly the value of war and also per - ceiving so clearly as he did that this war was brought about by
Germany	LOCATION	, should not have fought in the ranks of those to whose initiative mankind owes a blessing so immense .

		`` The word ` little '' is the only antidote that chaplains have been able to discover against the war .

		They say ` the little shell , ' ` the little Crown Prince ' '' this paragraph from Lieutenant
Giraudoux	PERSON	's `` Campaigns and Intervals '' grate - fully clears the atmosphere .

		Here is a book which even in translation retains the delicate aroma of Gallic wit and fancy .

		If we find the Intervals , in particular those exquisite `` Portuguese Days , '' even finer than the Campaigns , well , so much the worse for war .

		The personality of the author dominates every sentence , the grim as well as the gay , and having read this book we understand still better why
France	LOCATION	must not die and indeed how absurd it is to fear that such a people as the French ever could die .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's `` The Old Front Line '' -LRB- Mac - millan ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		written several months ago , has since become for us an even more tragic book than when first published .

		For the Front Line in question is that of the Allies before the Battle of the Somme and of that battle Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	says , `` It first gave the enemy the knowledge that he was beaten . ''

		Today , however , we see the Germans have , for the moment , caught from their English cousins the provoking malady of ignorance as to that very fact .

		Despite the terrible significance of these trenches which , cut as they are in chalky soil and flanked with bleached sandbags , gash like festering wounds the ruined countryside , yet a more considerable genius than that of Mr.
Mase	PERSON	- field would be required sufficiently to diversify so complete and non-selective an account of scenes not obviously dissimilar .

		Not only does our interest now and then flag , but also our attention , despite the best will in the world , wanders .

		There are pages which read too much like a Baedaeker of our own flatter states .

		The author was quite aware of this and , speaking of the Front Line , himself says , `` It is a difficult thing to describe without monotony , for it varies so little . ''

		Yes , and in those places which even to describe is monotonous , the soldier 's life must indeed be maddeningly desiccated .

		As breeding - grounds of insanity these trenches must outdo what we have hitherto been taught to regard as the very worst of environments , those isolated farms of our own
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		What a strange and to us peculiarly pathetic contrast between the hideous dugouts of our Allies and the order and comfort and luxury of those subterranean apartments which after that victory on the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 29 Somme were laid open to our sight .

		Wainscot - ing and cretonne curtains sound like a bit of `` The Arabian Nights '' in this monstrous desert land .

		It is good to know that the masters of this thaumaturgy were there proven not invinci - ble .

		As in the three French books , so here too , we are surprised to find how much of the tactics of trench warfare the French and English had to learn from their adversaries .

		Thanks to the Battle of the Somme we know that lesson was well learned .

		When the subject-matter gives Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	an opportunity for the exercise of his remarkable talent for vivid and poetical description , he does not disappoint us .

		He thus describes the crater of a mine sprung by the English on the first morning of the Battle of the Somme : It is like the crater of a volcano , vast , ragged , and irregular , about one hundred and fifty yards long , one hundred yards across , and twenty-five yards deep .

		It is crusted and scabbed with yellowish tetter , like sul - phur or the rancid fat on meat .

		The inside has rather the look of meat , for it is reddish and all streaked and scabbed with this pox and with discoloured chalk .

		A lot of it trickles and oozes like sores discharging pus , and this liquid gathers in holes near the bottom , and is greenish and foul and has the look of dead eyes looking upward .

		We who read Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's ``
August 1914	DATE	, '' probably the most profoundly beautiful poem this war has occasioned , reading these prose descrip - tions can not but wish that he had devoted the time such a book as this must have absorbed requiring as it did so minute an examination of the terrain and so painstaking an alignment of dead facts to the evocation in verse of the essential reality of No Man 's Land .

		That would indeed have been an awful pendent to the
Berk	PERSON	- shire downs of ``
August 1914	DATE	. ''

		Yet perhaps our poet knows himself not adapted to so different an undertaking .

		For Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	is too Eng - lish not to be more at home among the warm material habitants of a Berkshire down than among the bleak geometrical nudities of the modern battle-field .

		Some things must be left for our Cubist poets .

		Something of the dreamlike strangeness of the moving of ten thousand men through the wastes of
East Africa	LOCATION	Captain
Francis Brett Young	PERSON	has set down in his narrative `` Marching on Tanga '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Harried though he must have been as officer-doctor , dealing for the most part with native troops , confronted with brutal toiling in heat and dust , with fever , and sudden death of man and beast , he has yet subjected his experience to the literary Man 's joy of detached observation .

		He has moments which might have emanated from the consciousness of a
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	, mirroring the `` country without a soul '' through which the British forces passed , with all its desolation of strangely calling birds and dread - ful thirst .

		Throughout , too , there remains dis - tinct a picture of the tactical movement of the campaign down the poisonous
Pangani	LOCATION	river valley and of the dominance of the seldom seen
General Smuts	ORGANIZATION	.

		Certain chapters , as of his flight through the bush for a night and a day with fifteen of his men , most of them wounded , from pursuing German askaris , are fleet and terse in narration .

		Emphatically the book is not preten - tiously `` literary . ''

		Captain Young smelled blood and iodine and says so .

		But neither has profes - sional soldiering in him submerged the thinking and observing man .

		In retrospect
Constantinople	LOCATION	stands as the supreme blunder , the great `` what might have been '' of the war .

		If the Dardanelles expedition had been carried to success and the Allied line thrown as a barrier across the entrance to the
Balkans	LOCATION	, history would have assumed a far differ - ent aspect .

		Dr.
Stuermer	PERSON	, who was the German correspondent of the `` Kolnischer Zeitung '' in
Constantinople	LOCATION	in
1915-6	DATE	, and Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	, who was the special agent at the
American Embassy	ORGANIZATION	in
Constantinople	LOCATION	in
1915	DATE	, enlighten us in their two books , `` Two War Years in
Constantinople	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- and `` Inside Constantinople '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , as to the methods used in spreading German control .

		Dr.
Stuermer	PERSON	, who had served with the German army in the first campaign against
Russia	LOCATION	, was converted by what he saw in
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		He has definitely renounced his allegiance to
Germany	LOCATION	and cast his lot with those nations that have some respect for the sanctity of human and national relations .

		He blames
Germany	LOCATION	in detail for the Armenian massacres , and for every variety of cruelty and debauched intrigue that was Turkish in execution and Teutonic in responsibility .

		The editors of the English ``
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' at present reported to be ogling
Turkey	LOCATION	, might read these two books with profit .

		The combination of Oriental despotism and low-grade looting and blackmail with the deliberate terrorism of the military cliques , as here revealed , out-Belgiums
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Einstein	PERSON	's narrative is in the form of a diary from
April	DATE	to
September 1915	DATE	, and by that fact acquires an authenticity that shows the reactions of the moment .

		The knowledge of Teutonic duplicity is explicit from the start ; and if the account of
Wagenheim	LOCATION	, the German Ambassador , to
Garroni	PERSON	, his Italian colleague , of what went on in
Potsdam	LOCATION	in early
July , 1914	DATE	had actually been reported at the time , it is barely possible that the spark would have shown where the explosion was to take place in time to prepare for the catastrophe .

		The diary is simple and convincing , likewise intimate enough to convey the impression of what goes on behind the scenes .

		Lying is the commonest and the least of the mechanisms of Oriental diplomacy .

		There is 30
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 20	DATE	nothing very complex about a moral code that would ensure a decent life ; the actual code of intrigue and treachery is far more complex , and doubtless to those that like it more exciting .

		To anyone interested in the psychology of deceit -LRB- no less than of the barbarism which in this instance was its issue -RRB- the account of war days in Con - stantinople is an indispensable document .

		The story appears in both the books .

		Mr.
Gerard	PERSON	brought to his opportunities for observation a homely American attitude .

		In `` Face to Face with Kaiserism '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		he continues his story , begun in his earlier book , down to the time of his coming home , including a comment upon the German propaganda in this country .

		Yet apart from the records of his inti - mate contact with the
Kaiser	PERSON	and the powers behind the throne , there is really little in the volume that adds to what we already know any further understanding of
Germany	LOCATION	's attitude upon and after
America	LOCATION	's entry into the war .

		Common knowledge is , so to speak , underscored and put in the easy vernacular .

		All is fish for his net , from the detailed method of partridge and rabbit shooting on the preserves which the American Ambassador leased near
Berlin	LOCATION	and the personal characteristics of the all highest and next of kin , to the discovery of
Bloch	ORGANIZATION	's famous predictions , already long familiar to the most casual students of European militarism .

		There is a rather charming quality of intellectual nai - vete in the volume a quality which will make it a friendly book to our public .

		Mr.
Gerard	PERSON	's compilation includes a portion of the
Ambassa	PERSON	- dor 's diary during the eventful days of
1916	DATE	.

		Also , of course , an account of the effect of Mr.
Gerard	PERSON	's earlier revelations in
Germany	LOCATION	and of the denial of the authenticity of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's tele - gram to President
Wilson	PERSON	, followed by Ger - many 's lame explanation .

		It is perhaps thankless to observe that a more profound student of diplo - macy and statecraft would have made far more of his opportunities and would have written a more significant contribution to the interpretation of our relations with
Germany	LOCATION	.

		For the merit of Mr.
Gerard	PERSON	's book is its innocence and fresh - ness of point of view , its straight-from-the-shoul - der Americanism .

		There is in it none of the frock-coat European tradition .

		The
Dawson	PERSON	family constitutes a singularly satisfactory literary partnership .

		The son , gone to war , writes letters home which are duly pub - lished as a message of `` Carry On '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ !	MONEY

		. -RRB-

		The father , at the suggestion of his son , writes out how it feels to be `` The Father of a Sol - dier '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ !	MONEY

		. -RRB-

		The son , wounded and home for convalescence , follows the suggestion of his father and writes `` The Glory of the Trenches '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, or how it feels to be a soldier .

		The father writes a preface to his son 's book , and the son allows a letter of his to be printed as the preface of his father 's message .

		From the latter book we learn a great deal about Lieut.
Coningsby	PERSON	and the rest of the family , and from the lieutenant 's book we get intimate per - sonal touches of the father .

		In fact the reader becomes so fascinated in following the reciprocal literary influences that the matter of the books is almost ignored .

		It is enough to say that in general this material is what has got to be said to produce the effect of `` comfort and cheer , '' and be `` vital and inspiring '' on the sub - ject of war .

		If such reactions did not exist trembling on the edge of the
Dawson	PERSON	pen , they would have to be invented .

		The son , with the man who `` previous to the war had cramped his soul with littleness and was chased by the bayonet of duty into the bloodstained largeness of the trenches , '' has learned to say `` thank God for this war . ''

		The father has `` ceased to be acutely conscious of its horror , '' and has `` be - come more conscious of the spiritual grandeur of War . ''

		His son returns from the horror , `` com - pletely normal '' with an `` absolute tranquillity of spirit . ''

		`` His happiness sprang from within , from the deep fountain of a hidden peace . ''

		For such minds , of course , nothing can be done .

		It is not a question of their sincerity .

		The chief value of such books lies in their illustration of the pro- found adjustability of the human spirit to the manipulation , of events .

		Provided the ex - perience is fashionable enough , there seems to be no ultimate into which justification and con - solation can not penetrate .

		To compare the smooth complacency of the Dawsons with the actuality of the wholesale slaughter and ruin to which they are reacting is merely to feel anew the marvel of human flexibility .

		One longs for a world where heroism should mean the ability not to endure .

		Abbe
Felix Klein	PERSON	is one of those whose God never betrays them .

		In his service as chaplain of the American Ambulance he saw broken bodies and held converse with tortured spirits .

		The first part of his book `` Les Douleurs Qui Es - perent '' -LRB-
Perrin	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- is in sort a model of solace .

		The letters he wrote to widows and orphans , to mothers who had lost their sons , his communion with dying men , lit with ritual and prayer , he tells about in a number of short sketches designed to hearten those on whom the war has brought similar sorrow and trial .

		In these pages there are moments when the great passions of the Bible become identic with those of sufferers in war hospitals and of bereaved people .

		But they are moments only , in which myths and doctrines are used to transcend human suffering .

		In the second part of the book , devoted to reflections ,
Abbe Klein	PERSON	rises from the case to the theorem .

		He theologizes
1918	DATE	-RSB- and as he does so stands revealed as a type of churchly mind , one which dared not disbelieve in the hereafter because present sacrifice would then be too vain , which dares not disbelieve in God because the world would be too inhospitable without His superhuman justice .

		The logic of
Abbe Klein	PERSON	's faith is familiar doctrine .

		We find the well worn Catholic insistence on the im - mutable laws of morality which demand large families to the ultimate end that the state may be powerful .

		There is glorification of sacrifice and suffering .

		His logic and reasoning may comfort believers .

		But the general reader will find Abbe
Klein	PERSON	most sympathetic in the letters he reprints and in the account of his human re - lations , in which he explores with some del - icacy the dark and hideous suffering that arises .

		As
Arthur Guy Empey	PERSON	suggests it may , his book `` First Call '' -LRB- Putnam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- seems a `` Hungarian goulash of information '' and bears the marks of hasty writing during his lecture tours .

		It wanders from a chapter of comfort for mothers to cautions for the raw recruit , chapters of advice which a seasoned veteran might pass on to a new comrade , instructions as to gas masks , machine guns , trench raids , and many of the tricks of living in war .

		Occasionally there is a vivid illustrative incident told with the fidelity to detail which helped to give Mr.
Empey	PERSON	's first book its vogue .

		Especially poignant is the story of the Canadian , dying in a cot next to the author 's , waking after ether to the horrible discovery that he has been blinded .

		It is the best of a number of stories in a chapter called `` Smokes , '' which show men wounded and dying , asking first of all for the solace of a cigarette .

		Another well done bit is the unspoken soliloquy of a soldier on a trench raid , up to the time stretcher bearers hear his moans and come to get him .

		To many readers much of the informa - tion in this volume will seem superfluous , but the greater portion is devoted to hints for the casual and unlearned soldier who can benefit only by clearly phrased advice from a man to whom war and soldiering have been a business to be learned like any other .

		For the sake of this businesslike quality one can forgive some of Mr.
Empey	PERSON	's excursions into exhortation .

		The post of healer in this war may be as dif - ficult and as dangerous as the post of fighter .

		It certainly affords great opportunity for insight into the lives of the fighters , and for as under - standing and as sympathetic an author as
Madame Huard	PERSON	who has now written her sec - ond war book , `` My Home in the Field of Mercy '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- the situation is full of all the subtle elements that make life and the French what they are .


Madame Huard	PERSON	lost no time after the German retreat in converting her chateau near
Soissons	LOCATION	into a much needed hospital , where she herself , nine orderlies , one doctor , and her friend
Madame Guix	ORGANIZATION	at one time cared for one hundred and twenty typhoid patients .


Madame Huard	PERSON	, without coveting sen - sation , has the spirit of a true adventurer ; she is a hard worker , and an artist as well .

		Her book is not a unit , but a chapter that her expe - rience is constantly supplementing .

		In spite of its fragmentary character it forms , perhaps , one of the few pieces of literature that have so far proceeded from the war .

		`` Over Periscope Pond , '' by
Esther Sayles	PERSON	Root and
Marjorie Crocker	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mif	ORGANIZATION	- flin ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , reflects the less serious side of war as it was seen in
Paris	LOCATION	by two American civil - ian relief workers .

		The fact is that although the authors realized quite as keenly as anyone the serious side of the business with which their work dealt , the letters of which the book is com - posed probably offered a welcome way of es - cape from the daily round .

		It is not quite fair to them or to the other Americans who are doing hard work in
Paris	LOCATION	to have reflected here only the off-hours and vacations of the pair .

		Take this into account , and you will get a fair amount of amusement from these informal and very charming letters .

		Dr.
Malcolm C. Grow	PERSON	, author of `` Surgeon Grow '' -LRB- Stokes ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , was one of the first American doctors in
Russia	LOCATION	; he was on the east - ern front during the gruelling months of the shortage of ammunition ; he was there during BrusilofFs great drive ; and he returned there from a brief visit to
America	LOCATION	after the revolu - tion had been accomplished .

		Some of his pic - tures of the Russian nights filled with noise and slaughter and unceasing work for the surgeons , of the simple kindly soldiers , of that bull-voiced old Colonel of the artillery who kept his victrola going beside his guns and had his two cows fol - low the batteries because he liked milk in his tea these help his volume to emerge above the general mass of war books .

		The incidents of his two years in
Russia	LOCATION	are told with simplicity and without self-consciousness .

		More , he has some - thing to tell .

		The second edition of
Mabel T. Boardman	PERSON	's `` Under the Red Cross Flag '' -LRB-
Lippincott	LOCATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- synchronizes with the publication throughout the country of the achievements of the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	during
America	LOCATION	's first year of war .

		Here is the history of the growing move - ment in war relief work from the wars of the Hebrews up .

		And although the field from the time of Homer to the time of
Florence Nightin	LOCATION	- gale is covered in one chapter , the story of the precursors of our Red Cross nurses is as inter - esting as the diversified accounts of recent work with which we are more familiar .

		It is a very comprehensive and orderly volume .

		They state : first , that as women now have an established place in college affairs , the sorority 's original function of facilitating unified action among the women of the college is obso - lete ; second , that qualification for entrance is entirely artificial and undefined ; third , that the `` rushing '' system is unwholesome , pernicious , and undemocratic ; fourth , that the great expenditure of money on trivialities is unwarranted , especially at such a time as this ; fifth , that the women of the university , both sorority and non-sorority , would have a broader scope of friendship and a freer opportunity for development if social Greek - letter societies were abolished ; and finally , that a caste system is projected from college out into the alumnae population of the country which is detrimental to those who are not fraternity women , and which is distasteful to the true American spirit .

		These reasons , of course , are not the whole of the argument , but they do present an exceptionally strong case .

		Nor have these independent young women ignored the problem of what is to take the sorority 's place .

		They urge dormitories for the first two years in college , and voluntary groups , with less control than is necessary under the fraternity scheme , for Juniors and Seniors .

		It is the beginning of a probably nation-wide movement .

		RUSSIA-BAITING , THE FAVORITE SPORT Now - adays of polite newspapers and polite society , has been extended to include even Russian liter - ature .

		Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, who has distinguished himself by his uninspired studies of the classics , recently con - tributed to the gaiety of nations by an address to the
American Medico-Psychological Associ	ORGANIZATION	- ation in the course of which he brought forth these intellectual brilliants : ``
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, if not in - sane , has been a prolific cause of insanity in others '' ; when
Jane Addams	PERSON	,
Justice Brandeis	ORGANIZATION	,
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	,
Max Eastman	PERSON	, or
Rebecca West	PERSON	misapply the texts of
Euripides	LOCATION	, `` they are not renewing their Greek studies but merely hoisting their flag '' -LRB- need we explain that Pro- fessor
Shorey	PERSON	refers to the flag of Bolshevikism ? -RRB-

		; the study of Russian literature is already `` im - pairing the sanity of American literary criticism , the sobriety of American opinion . ''

		We agree that whatever study Professor
Shorey	PERSON	has vouchsafed to Russian literature has certainly `` impaired '' his power of literary criticism .

		And we might add that to identify Justice Brandeis as a Bol - shevik indicates a serious impairment of Profes - sor
Shorey	PERSON	's `` sobriety of opinion . ''

		The fact is of course that this ill-tempered and silly attack on Russian literature is nothing but a by-product of the disappointment caused by
Russia	LOCATION	's with - drawal from the war .

		It is a case of nerves exactly as , upon the outbreak of the war , the German professors ' sudden discovery of the base - ness and lack of imagination and taste in English and French literature was a case of nerves .

		It is unpleasant to watch certain American profes - sors naively and unconsciously imitating their former German colleagues .

		For the psycholog - ical process is identical .

		If
Italy	LOCATION	should abandon the cause of the Allies , one can picture the speedy attacks on the later decadent poets of
Florence	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Or if
Russia	LOCATION	should return strong and self-confident to the struggle , one can already see Professor
Shorey	PERSON	discovering the sturdy lit - erary virtues of
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	and Artzibashef .

		NOTHING COULD BE MORE DISASTROUS FOR that mutual understanding between associated peoples which is imperative if we are to win the war and organize the fruits of victory into an enduring peace , than the attempts of
Samuel Gompers	PERSON	to make the members of the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	at the
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	convention believe that the conflict of opinion between American and British labor regarding `` conversations '' with the laborites of
Germany	LOCATION	is nothing but a question of loyalty .

		This , it seems to us , is a downright insult to British , French , and Italian labor , who for three long and exhausting years before we entered the war fought for us and died for us .

		After all , does it lie in our mouth to presume to dictate to them on the subject of what constitutes loyalty to the Allied cause to give them lessons in patriotism ?

		This is a question which has no relation what - ever to the merits or demerits of the specific pro- posal ; it is a question of our fairness in reporting the attitude of a large and highly organized sec - tion of our cobelligerents .

		Let us reverse the sit - uation .

		Let us suppose that we had fought for three years , suffering all things and enduring all things howi should we then consider it if we should be told by a group , which had so far done little except to profit by our sufferings , that we were succumbing to the insidious propaganda of the enemy ?

		But it is precisely this and nothing else that the misguided press of this country seems to be trying to make American public opinion believe with respect to Allied labor , and we shall be fortunate if this misrepresentation does not
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 33 create a gulf of resentment between the two sections of the Allied world that can least of all afford to quarrel .


Arthur Henderson	PERSON	is seriously represented as something akin to a pro-German .

		Even more incredible is the fact that the programme of the British Labor party , the most uncompromising programme based on victory ever written or proposed , is soberly and deliberately called `` pacific . ''

		It would seem that misrepresentation or misunderstanding could go no further .

		And unpleasant as it is to write , the serious danger to our cause makes it our duty to record the plain truth that the delegates of the
American Labor Mission	ORGANIZATION	abroad , espe - cially in
France	LOCATION	, did not make a wholly satis - factory impression .

		After all , if the policy of the French Socialists and trade unionists was in favor of `` conversations '' with German laborites following the programme announced by the British Labor party ordinary courtesy should have indicated that the most graceful thing our delegates could do would be to hear the pro- posal and quietly to disagree not to read a moral lecture to those from whom we should learn with deep humility .

		We can not afford , by this kind of ill considered blundering , to alienate the French or Italian or English working classes , or even small sections of them , from our pur - poses in this war .

		Yet already the press of the French labor parties is commenting with won - der and disappointment on the naivete of the American delegates and on their extreme `` bit - ter-end '' speeches .

		`` The People '' asks : `` If American trade unionists are so militarist and jusqu'auboutiste as this , what must the others be ? ''

		The more sophisticated and intellectually more alert French trade unionists did not fail to observe that in ideas and policy the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can delegates were about forty years behind the times `` about where English and French trade unionists were in
1880	DATE	, '' as an observer in
Paris	LOCATION	recently wrote us ; and although it is expressed tactfully and courteously , the French trade unionists did not wholly relish the `` official '' char - acter of the delegation and its mechanical , cut - and-dried programme , which bore all the appear - ance of having been arranged in advance .

		The only purpose in referring to these rather unflattering facts is to assist in bringing about that unity of political aim among the Allies and ourselves without which the task of defeat - ing
Germany	LOCATION	's political objects in this war will be made unnecessarily difficult .

		That unity is certain to come in time , but its approach is slow and is constantly being blocked by just the type of misunderstanding and misrepresentation of which this conflict of opinion over the advisa - bility of `` conversing '' with German labor is an excellent example .

		Surely at this late day it ought not to be necessary to point out that the only object of French , Italian , and British labor in the proposed conference is educative .

		Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	's two objections are trivial .

		The first is that the conference would be dominated by the shrewder German delegates which is prac - tically saying that they could out-argue and out - strategy the Allied delegates .

		We think more highly of the ability of Allied labor than Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	does .

		It is much more likely that Ger - man labor would be forced to acknowledge the justice of their opponents ' position .

		The second objection is even less worthy of consideration : all questions of war and peace should be left to governments and to official bodies .

		But in that case , why did Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	send a delega - tion to Allied labor at all ?

		Why did he not argue that our
State Department	ORGANIZATION	and the state departments of our cobelligerents should settle all details for effective waging of the war them - selves ?

		Furthermore , there is no intention , in the proposal , to usurp the functions of govern - ment .

		In fact it is largely because Allied labor is optimistic enough to think that German labor might bring pressure on its government that the conference is proposed .

		It has never been a ques - tion of negotiations , but of `` conversations '' merely .

		Allied labor feels that German labor does not know what the war aims of the workers in the enemy countries are , and that if it did , it would force its own government to practical agreement in other words , help us win the war by capitalizing discontent in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		When we consider the proposal seriously we know that only one of two things could happen : first , either Al - lied labor would convert German labor , in which case we should be so much to the good ; or sec - ond , German labor would prove itself stubborn and irreconcilable , in which case Allied labor could return and most assuredly would return and with a clear conscience support the respec - tive Allied governments in their more effective waging of the war , an eventuality which would also be so much to the good .

		It really is difficult to see just where the danger or the `` trap '' lies .

		Behind the proposal may of course be a mistaken or foolishly optimistic idea , but it seems the height of folly to characterize it as being in any sense `` pacific . ''

		It is just because Allied laborites intend to fight forever rather than submit to an imperialistic peace that they desire this confer - ence .

		They want to tell German labor precisely that .

		They feel it would bring results .

		We are inexperienced and naive in inter - national politics ; we are likely to offend when we do not mean to do so .

		With the best intentions , yet with the deepest ignorance , the autocratic leaders of the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	are pursuing a course which tends to disrupt and disintegrate the world of Allied labor .

		If per - sisted in it will seriously hamper President
Wil	PERSON	- son in his attempts to put through a liberal in - ternational programme .

		34 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 20	DATE	BRIEFER MENTION In `` The Experience of God in Modern Life '' -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-


Eugene W. Lyman	PERSON	ably comes to the rescue of God and camouflages him as `` Eter - nal Creative Good Will . ''

		The three great needs of modern life development of personality , social progress , and cosmic evolution are met in this experience of God .

		The consciousness of co - working with an
Eternal Creative Good Will	ORGANIZATION	is the modern equivalent of the prophetic and filial consciousness of Christ , and the author rightly assumes it to have social value in an evolutional and democratic age .

		Incidentally , this book , with its thoughtful use of modern scientific method , perspicaciously unravels Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's fibrous deity .

		A Scottish parson became a chaplain and felt the thrill of helpful contact with real men .

		This experience made him wonder why the average mass of humanity , called the common people and personified by him as `` Tommy , '' does not take kindly to the church .

		The Rev.
A. H. Gray	PERSON	, in `` As Tommy Sees Us '' -LRB- Longmans , Green ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, speculates as to whether it is the minister , the church , or the hymns ; he half accuses , half jus - tifies the first two and jumps hard on the last .

		It seems to him , near the end of the book , that the conflict between God and Mammon has been patched up in some corners of the ecclesiastical world .

		At this point he touches the real situation the social problem .

		A deeper study of this problem would probably help him to understand why
Tommy	PERSON	gives the cloth a wide berth .

		Mr.
H. Gordon Selfridge	PERSON	, the American mer - chant of
London	LOCATION	, has magnified his calling and given to the world in his `` The Romance of Com - merce '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 3	MONEY	. -RRB-

		an interesting and striking account of the development of commerce from the earliest times .

		Commerce and civilization have developed together , for men do not exchange goods merely .

		The ship that carries out wares brings back not only material things but new ideas , cus - toms , languages , and even religions .

		The story of
Venice	LOCATION	,
Genoa	LOCATION	, and
Florence	LOCATION	, the Fuggers of Augs - burg , early English commerce and the guilds , the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	, the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	, of such merchants as Child ,
Patterson	PERSON	, and Peel all is vividly told .

		The close relation between trade and the English aristocracy is clearly revealed in the citation of the many founders of noted families who were originally merchants .

		Numerous curious facts concerning commercial life and usage in the past , and concerning individual merchants , have been gathered together , and where they were doubtful have been presented for what they were worth in throwing some light on a personage or period .

		In the final chapter there is an exposition of the management and scientific arrangement of a modern store .

		Primarily valuable to the student of economic history , the book has authentic general interest .

		Teachers of economics often find that their stu - dents have exceedingly vague notions concerning the actual industrial and business world in which they live .

		Dr.
Henry C. Adams	PERSON	in his `` Description of Industry '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- has attempted to provide an adequate historical and descriptive background for the beginner .

		It is really curious however that Dr.
Adams	PERSON	has found it necessary to employ so much economic theory in his task of exposition .

		Yet economics is a science and not a branch of polite literature in fact the student in the univer - sity who has had a smattering of economics in the high school is usually the poorest student in the class .

		Is this not sometimes the result of science 's being so simplified as to make impossible any under - standing of the difficulties ?

		Dr.
Adams	PERSON	has avoided this danger .

		The general theory of value includes , for example , the value of money which can not be explained in a paragraph .

		The author has avoided the twin difficulties of presenting too many sub - jects and thus producing a treatise , and of present - ing too few and thus becoming superficial .

		Espe - cially clear and helpful are the chapters on the classification of industries and the legal framework of industry .

		`` Illustrations of Chaucer 's
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Long - mans ,
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- proves to be a collection of extracts from English chronicles and other documents , chiefly of the fourteenth century .

		The materials have been chosen and edited by Miss
Dorothy Hughes	PERSON	under the supervision , apparently , of Pro- fessor
A. F. Pollard	PERSON	of
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purpose of the work -LRB- and of the series which this volume inaugurates -RRB- is to remove some of the difficulties that beset the student who wishes to form a closer acquaintance with the historical sources of a given period .

		The editor has done her work with care and discrimination , and stu - dents of medieval English literature and the social sciences are sure to find her volume very helpful .

		The reader looking for a guide to fortune out of a few acres of land will find little encourage - ment from `` The New Business of Farming , '' by
Julian A. Dimock	PERSON	-LRB-
Stokes	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		.

		Sound sense is the pervading temper of the various chapters , which treat of such subjects as the capital necessary for profitable farming , rotation of crops , prices , and live stock .

		The law of diminishing returns is well brought out in connection with the differences between large crops and normal crops .

		The ex - perience of the author as a practical farmer gives point and value to the subjects treated .

		Although
Hugh Findlay	PERSON	seems in his opening chapters a little doubtful as to just what audience he is addressing in his `` Practical Gardening '' -LRB- Ap - pleton ;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, he recovers as soon as he has decided to talk to the `` back yard '' gardener and produces a very practical handbook .

		It includes many tables and illustrations of value to the amateur who is anxious to make the most out of a limited space , and an interesting chapter on the possibilities of community gardening .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have issued a revision of their `` Notes for the Guidance of Authors '' -LRB- paper , 30 cts . -RRB-

		, compiled with the aid of their various depart - ment heads .

		The book is something more than a series of hints to authors seeking the
Macmillan	PERSON	imprint , for half of it is devoted to exposition of matters of style .

		The usage here followed is up - to-date and makes a sensible compromise between tradition and innovation , avoiding both the old - fashioned and the queer .

October 5 , 1918	DATE	, THE DIAL will begin weekly publication .

		This step is being taken in order to consider more comprehensively the shifting forces which are now making for a new social order .

		The new editorial policy will in no sense be a break with the previous policy .

		It will discuss the problems of internationalism and the reorganiza - tion of industrial and educational institutions necessary to meet the demands of that democracy for which the war is being fought .

		It will bring to this discussion the same liberal spirit of constructive criticism which has hitherto distinguished its literary policy .

		THE DIAL will not contain routine comment on matters of only transient political interest .

		It will occupy itself with the discussion of principles and fundamental readjustments .

		The literary policy and book review service , which have made THE DIAL so invaluable for those seeking authoritative and timely information , will be continued .

		Articles reflecting modern tendencies in art , music , and the theatre will also be regular features .

		The editorial co-operation of those recognized as the most effective think - ers in their particular fields has been secured .

		/ - ^ f THE DIAL ft fortnightly Journal of Criticism and Discussion of Literature ana Cfte Hrts The War and Higher Learning The modern state of the industrial arts has got its growth and holds its footing by force of an effectual disregard of national demarkations .

		Not only is it true that this body of industrial knowledge , which makes the material foundation of modern civil - ization , is of an international character and that it has been brought into bearing , and continues to be held , as a common stock , common to all the civilized nations ; but it is also to be kept in mind that this modern technology always and necessarily draws on the world 's resources at large for the means and materials of its work , regard - less of national frontiers in so far as the politicians do not deliberately put obstacles in the way of a free movement of these means and materials .

		In the realm of in - dustry it is obvious that national frontiers serve no better purpose than a more or less effectual hindrance to the efficient working of the industrial system .

		Yet in this in - dustrial realm men still argue that is to say , short-sighted statesmen and interested business men are able to argue that the nation 's industrial interest may best be served by hindering the nation 's industry from taking advantage of that freedom of intercourse which the modern industrial system presupposes as an indispensable condition to its best work .

		So far are men still bound in the ancient web of interna - tional jealousy and patriotic animosity .

		On the other hand , in the adjacent field of scientific knowledge it is recognized without reservation that political bounda - ries have no place and , indeed , no substan - tial meaning .

		It is taken as a matter of course that science and its pursuit must be free of all restraints of this character ; that it is a matter of `` the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men , '' not merely among the citizens or subjects within the nation .

		That such is the case , that no politician comes forward to advocate an embargo on knowledge at the national frontier , or a protective customs barrier to serve as a fence against an undue infiltra - tion of enlightenment from abroad that the national statesmen fail to make mis - chief at this point is apparently due to the fact that no vested business interest has seen its advantage in taking measures to that end .

		There is also the difficulty that the international diffusion of knowledge proceeds by such subtle and intangible ways as to make its confinement by statute a per - plexing matter .

		It is true , something may be done by indirection at least and the nationally minded statesmen have perhaps done what was possible to hinder the free passage of knowledge over the national frontiers .

		They have , for instance , taken thought to impose a restrictive tariff on books and other apparatus made use of in scientific and scholarly pursuits or in the art of teaching ; and there are also , now and again , certain restrictive measures taken to hinder aliens from imparting knowledge of any kind to the youth of the land .

		In all these cases of petty obstruction it will be seen , if one looks into the matter , that there is some vested interest of a business - like sort which seeks to be benefited by these measures of restraint .

		But when all is told , these and the like endeavors of retardation are , after all , trifling and nuga - tory in comparison with that voluminous and many-sided restraint of industrial in - tercourse that appears to be the chief ma - terial use of the national frontiers .

		Happily , there is no need of argument among civilized men to gain assent to the proposition that the pursuit and diffusion of knowledge is a matter of joint and un - divided interest among all the civilized na - tions ; that it runs on neutral ground , irre - spective of national intrigue and ambition ; and that no nation has anything to lose in 46 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 18	DATE	this respect through unguarded coopera - tion with its neighbors .

		In respect to this joint interest all are gainers by the gain of any one .

		Happily , again , this joint interest in the pursuit and diffusion of knowledge is the one end of endeavor which all men and all nations are agreed in rating as the only end of human endeavor that is worth while for its own sake .

		It may seem a singular state of things , but it will scarcely be ques - tioned on reflection , that this intangible body of knowledge which is in no man 's possession and is held as a common stock by the peoples of civilized mankind is not only the most highly valued asset of the civilized world but is at the same time the one indispensable possession which alone can give any community a valid claim to be rated among the civilized peoples .

		Any substantial loss or defeat on this ground , the ground of what is called the higher learning , would by common consent be ac - counted the most shameful setback which these nations could suffer ; and it is a case where , by common consent , any one 's loss is the loss of all .

		But at the same time , unhappily , because this pursuit of knowledge is , always and necessarily , of the nature of a collective or joint interest , it results that there is no one class or group of interested persons , no vested interest , which is in a position ef - fectually to parley with the politicians in behalf of this higher learning , in which the civilized world 's chief spiritual asset is capitalized .

		The elements of a political bargain are wanting in the case ; and that massive popular sentiment whose pressure can for a time divert the endeavors of the statesmen from the broad and sinuous path of political bargaining is also taken up with other things .

		And just now , under the strain of desperate work to be done , the material needs involved in the prosecution of the great war take precedence of all else , particularly of all things less tangible .

		Yet all the while it remains true and on dispassionate reflection , if such can be had , it will be seen that this joint pursuit of knowledge which centers and finds ex - pression in the higher learning is the most consequential matter involved in the for - tunes of war .

		All of which should clear the vision and determine a course of concerted action for those men who still have the interests of science and scholarship at heart , and whose endeavors are not all engrossed with the conduct of the war or with the give and take of political intrigue .

		The charge which circumstances impose on these keep - ers of the higher learning is simply the keeping of the ways and means of this pur - suit of knowledge well in hand against the time when sober counsels shall again pre - vail .

		Among these keepers of the sacred flame it happens that the hazards of war have thrown the Americans into a position of peculiar responsibility .

		Through no pecu - liar merit of their own they have been elected by the singular play of circum - stance to take the initiative and largely to shape the prospective fortunes of the re - public of learning .

		Their European co - partners have fallen into a state of disor - ganization and depletion , both in their per - sonnel and in their equipment , so serious as to leave them , prospectively , very much in arrears .

		It is perhaps an over-statement to speak of the European world of learn - ing as bankrupt , but it is also to be kept in mind that the misfortunes which make for its undoing are not yet at an end , and will by no means end abruptly with the formal conclusion of the great war .

		For one thing , the European community of sci - ence and scholarship has been divided into halves between which the war has fixed a great gulf , a gulf so deep and implacable that even for some time after the war it will not be bridged .

		And within that half in which , by the fortunes of war , the Amer - icans belong the half which will now have to go into action as a decimated whole within this half of the pre-war complement the channels of communication have been falling into neglect , the coordination of parts has failed , the local units have been depleted , the working capital is exhausted , and the equipment is falling into decay .

		In short , there is at the best a large depre - ciation charge to be written off .

		And all the while there is an indefinite promise of more of the same , and worse .

		To put the case in concrete terms , the German men of learning have been and are going through a very trying experience , to
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 47 choose no harsher expression , and are in such a resulting state of moral dilapidation as should in all likelihood leave them largely incapacitated for sound work in science and scholarship for the term of the passing generation , The visible displace - ment of judgment and aspirations among them has engendered a profound distrust of their working powers among their col - leagues of other nationalities at least all the distrust which they merit .

		They are at the same time not being at all fully re - placed by a new generation of scholars and scientists , since the war is draining off nearly all the men available for such work as will serve the war , which is also perma - nently diverting the energies of nearly all the residue to uses that are alien to the higher learning .

		By force of decimation , diversion , and debauch of scholarly mo - rale coupled with a stubborn distrust of them by the scholars in other lands the learned men and the seminaries of the higher learning in the German-speaking world are presumably , in the main , to be counted among the dead , wounded , and missing in so far as concerns the recon - struction now to be entered on in the af - fairs of the higher learning .

		Something is plainly to be allowed in abatement of any appraisal of so sweeping a nature ; but it is also plain that in the reconstruction now to be undertaken there is no German scholarship to be counted on as a present help , and what is to be counted on in the near future is an indefinite and doubtful quantity .

		In this respect the German - speaking community is plainly the heaviest loser among all the peoples who are losing by the war , and the loss suffered by the German scholarly community is net loss to the republic of learning at large .

		In their degree , though in a less sinister measure than the Germans , the other Europeans are subject to much the same depletion of forces , decay of the spirit , and impoverishment in their material means .

		The Americans , however , have been less exposed to the disorganizing experience of the war , and especially they still command the material means indispensable to the or - ganization and pursuit of scholarly and scientific inquiry under modern conditions .

		So that by the play of circumstances the Americans are placed in a position of trust to turn the means at hand to the best use for the conservation and reconstruction of the world 's joint enterprise in science and scholarship .

		As it is perforce a joint international in - terest that so calls for initiative and wise conduct at the hands of the American men of learning , so it is only by a disinterested joint action on an impartially international plan that the Americans can hope to take care of the work so entrusted to them .

		They have the means , or they can find them , and it is for them at this critical tide in the affairs of learning to turn these means to account unreservedly in that spirit of copartnership and self-effacement which alone can hopefully be counted on for any - thing that shall be worth while in a joint enterprise of such a scope and character .

		As an initial move to this end it should reasonably seem obligatory on all those American schools which claim a rating as seminaries of learning to `` keep open house '' freely , impartially , and as a mat - ter of routine management to accord un - restricted privileges of sanctuary and en - tertainment , gratuitously and irrespective of nationality , to all comers who want an opportunity for work as teachers or stu - dents and who give evidence of fitness in any respect for this pursuit .

		It should be a safe rule , particularly under the condi - tions of bias and inducement now prevail - ing , to leave full scope for self-selection on this head , and to afford full opportunity for all whose inclination leads them to follow after the idols of the higher learning .

		With this as a point of departure there follows a second step , necessitated by the first an inclusive coordination of these American schools , together with a large measure of coalition among them .

		Such a move of coordination and allotment of the work to be done is imperatively called for also on grounds of economy , even apart from the more exacting requirement of economy brought on by such an agreement to keep open house as has been spoken for above .

		As is well known , though it is more or less ingeniously denied from time to time , the American schools that are of col - lege or university grade have hitherto been competitors for the trade in erudition , 48 THE DIAJL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	somewhat after the fashion of rival mer - chandising concerns .

		Indeed , it is just as well to admit frankly that they have been rival concerns , doing a competitive busi - ness in student registrations and in the creation of alumni , as also in scholastic real estate and funded endowments .

		This academic competition has led to an ex - tensive duplication of plant and personnel , and more particularly duplication in the courses of instruction offered by the rival schools , and in the extra-scholastic induce - ments held out by each to attract a clien - tele of unscholarly registrants .

		It is scarcely necessary to insist that this rivalry and duplication have been wasteful , at the same time that it has engendered an undue animus of salesmanship in the place of scholarship .

		All of which may charitably be held as well enough , or at any rate not to be remedied , in time of peace , pros - perity , and universal price-rating .

		But just now , under pressure of the war de - mands and the war-time inflation of prices and costs , the wastefulness of this manner of conducting the schools is becoming fla - grantly evident , at the same time that the schools are already beginning to fall into distress for want of funds to carry on as usual .

		The present should accordingly be a propitious time for a move of coordina - tion and a degree of coalescence , such as is spoken for above , particularly as it will be practicable on this plan for the rival schools now to cover their retreat out of the underbrush of rivalry and intrigue with a decent and unfeigned avowal of de - votion to the greater gain of that learning which they have always professed to culti - vate with a single mind , and to which they doubtless have also quite amiably hoped to turn their best endeavors so soon as the more pressing exigencies of intercollegiate rivalry should leave them free to follow their natural bent .

		If recourse is had to some such measure of cooperation among the schools , they will easily be able to carry ^ any prospective burden of providing for their prospective guests , foreign and do - mestic , as well as the effective volume of their day 's work , which now seems an over - load .

		Such a pooling of scholastic issues would reasonably give rise to something in the way of a central office to serve as a com - mon point of support and coordination , which would at the same time serve as a focus , exchange , and center of diffusion for scholarly pursuits and mutual understand - ing , as well as an unattached academic house of refuge and entertainment for any guests , strays , and wayfaring men of the republic of learning .

		This central would then stand as an impersonal , impartial , communal central for the republic of learn - ing , an open house of resort and recupera - tion through the season of stress and in - firmity which the community of scholars is facing .

		There would be no implied de - gree of unselfishness on the part of the Americans in so placing their resources and their good offices at the service of the world at large .

		They would only be serving their own ends as community partners in the pur - suit of knowledge ; for they can neither in - crease their own holdings in the domain of learning , nor hold fast that which they con - ceive themselves to be possessed of , except in copartnership with these others , who now have fallen on evil days .

		More specifically , and as affording a concrete point of departure for any enter - prise of the kind , provision should be made under the auspices of one or more such centrals for t ^ e reorganization of those channels of communication that have been falling into disuse during the period of the war ; for the maintenance and unbroken continuity of the work and the records of the many learned societies tljat have been falling into abeyance during the same period ; and for the keeping of records and the collation and dissemination of materials and bibliographical information , on which the learned men of all countries are in the habit of depending .

		The details of this work will be volum - inous and diverse , even if it is taken over only as an emergency measure to tide over the period of reconstruction ; and the ade - quate care of it all will call for no small degree of sobriety , insight , and good will , and also for no small expenditure of means .

		But it is hoped that the American scholars are possessed of the requisite large and sober insight -LRB- otherwise there is nothing
1918	DATE	-RSB- 49 to be done about it -RRB- and it is known that , just now , the Americans have the good will of all thoughtful men throughout those countries that come into consideration here .

		It is also known that the Americans com - mand the material means necessary to such an undertaking ; and any degree of reflec - tion will show that the American com - munity runs no chance of material impov - erishment in the further course of the war , quite the contrary in fact .

Mark Twain	PERSON	, a born wit who chose on the whole to be a humorist , a disillusioned thinker who found it possible to let people imagine he was chuckling - or guffawing sympa - thetically with them , while in truth he was laughing sardonically at them .

		Now the usable past of Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's phrase , the only immediate American past which makes an adequate tradition for the creative liberalism of the present , is that richer and more untrammeled past , non - existent in literal history , in which both authors would have been left free to be themselves without the penalty of losing their audience ; in which
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	could have signed as well as published `` What is Man ? ''

		and published as well as written `` The Mysterious Stranger '' ; in which Bierce need not have been driven to jour - nalism , political muck-raking , and various sensational forms of modern knight - errantry to capture the attention of a public which simply ignored `` Ashes of the Bea - con '' and `` In the Midst of Life . ''

		This past , had it existed , might have served both authors as an automatic corrective * The collected works of
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	were published -LRB- 1909-12 -RRB- by the

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	and balance-weight .

		Mark Twain would have been spared the seeming necessity of his enormous self-suppression and the cynicism of his outward contentment the posture of an artist who found himself ap - plauded for what he said , knowing that he would have been hissed if he had said what he meant ;
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	would have been spared the extremity of his bitterness , which became that of a man who shrieks imprecations because no one will listen to his normal utterance .

		And Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	need not have asked , among other like questions , `` Why did
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	go wrong ? ''

		`` Our greatest humorists , including even
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' says Mr.
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	in `` A Book of Prefaces , '' `` have had to take protective coloration , whether wil - lingly or unwillingly , from the prevailing ethical foliage , and so one finds them levelling their darts , not at the stupidities of the Puritan majority , but at the evi - dences of lessening stupidity in the anti- Puritan minority .

		In other words , they have done battle , not against , but for Philistinism . ''

		`` For all our professed de - light in and capacity for jocosity , we have produced so far but one genuine wit Am - brose Bierce and , save to a small circle , he remains unknown to-day . ''

		The gen - uineness of the wit is not more astounding than the smallness of the circle a circle mainly , so far as I can find , of writers and artists , and containing very few members of the class of professional academic cus - todians of the accredited in letters .

		For example , the most elaborate cisatlantic his - tory of the short story , `` The Short Story in English , '' by Professor
Henry Seidel Canby	PERSON	, reaches its hundred-thousandth word and the year
1907	DATE	without so much as the mention of
Bierce	ORGANIZATION	's name , even among the appendixed `` many below the best , '' though there are ten solid pages about
Bret Harte	PERSON	and forty-three index references to him .

		This eminent repre - sentative of the `` Puritan majority '' on its academic side helps prove Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	's case , and justify Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	's rancor , when he says that ``
Bret Harte	PERSON	was cer - tainly not the author of the best English stories of the nineteenth century , but it is a question whether , on the whole , his tales have not been the most widely read . ''

		When acknowledged authority sets out so frankly as this to turn criticism from a search for distinction into the recorded vote of a majority which reads
Harte	PERSON	and is oblivious of
Bierce	LOCATION	, I do not see how we are to revile Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	for naming us `` a commonwealth of peasants and small traders , a paradise of the third-rate , '' and for saying that our national philosophy is `` almost wholly unchecked by the more sophisticated and civilized ideas of an aristocracy . ''

		It is the function of such more civilized ideas that
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	discharges in his generation ; and nearly all of his most salient qualities derive their saliency from the fact that he who exhibited them was the aristocrat half extinguished in the mob , half inflamed by it .

		All that is most grace - ful in his acceptance of life and in his ex - pression of it is a product of his innate aristocracy ; and all that is most graceless , vociferous , exaggerated , and raucous is a product of the inflammation .

		For it is not given to the aristocrat to thrive on opposi - tion .

		It is his business to be a graceful embodiment of a tradition that leaves him free for expression .

		As a malcontent , he does not shine : it is only the revolutionary who gains in dignity when he answers per - secution with ^ articulate protest .

		Even the satiric mode , in which
Bierce	ORGANIZATION	mostly wrought and of which he remains the one great exemplar produced on this continent , is protest which has always depended for its success on the existence of aristocratic qualities such as wit in a shared , so - cialized form ; like
Meredith	PERSON	's `` Comedy , '' satire has flourished only where there was a society , however small , of true distinc - tion , in which ideas were at home and had free circulation .

		But it was
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	's misfortune to be a satirist alone .

		His wit , the one brilliant display of its kind in
America	LOCATION	, and perhaps the most brilliant anywhere since
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, coruscates almost in vacuo ; and his animus against the existence of certain realities which he loathed tends more and more to become 1 converted into animus against the non-existence of everything that he valued .

		Unlike the first
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, he found no sharp social contrast
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 51 to draw ; all he could see in
America	LOCATION	was a perfect homogeneity of smugness ; and therefore , like the second
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, he was forced to create fictitious worlds to be the media for his criticism of the real one , as in `` Ashes of the Beacon '' and `` The Land Beyond the Blow . ''

		The struggle he reproduces is not that of folly against wis - dom or of knavery against rectitude : it is simply that of knavery contending with folly for material spoils , in a world where everything else is crowded to the wall .

		He is the universal cynic .

		Even in some of his best tales of the ghastly and the ghostly , such as `` The Death of
Halpin Frayser	PERSON	, '' `` Killed at Resaca , '' and `` A Baby Tramp , '' he steps out of the path of the story to belabor in - discriminately everything he can reach , in sentences like these : `` Science had as many explanations as there were scientists who knew nothing about it '' ; `` They had a child which they named
Joseph	PERSON	and dearly loved , as was then the fashion among parents in all that region . ''

		In fact the most inartis - tic thing Bierce ever does , as a teller of tales , is to substitute his own plastered-on irony for the inherent irony of the nature of things ; and too often he merely rasps where he would horrify .

		The one thing he seriously and sympathetically believes in is the artist 's disinterested search for beauty ; yet , because he saw this one thing as out - lawed in the
America	LOCATION	he knew , his praise of it is constantly inverted into disgust and rage at its enemies .

		He rejects everything , becomes intellectually the most homeless man of our time .

		In `` Ashes of the Bea - con , '' his satiric history of the decline and fall of
America	LOCATION	, in the form of `` an his - torical monograph written in
4930	DATE	'' by a savant living under a monarchy , he riddles one after another the bases , the customs and institutions , the traditions and the hopes of our Western experiment in democ - racy but he also riddles his own assumed point of view , for the posture of his imag - ined historian is one of bootlicking ser - vility to a king .

		Under `` self-government '' the successful individual is a knave ; under a government by authority imposed , he is a sycophant .

		This is the choice which Am - brose Bierce saw .

		But he did not take his choice : he despised and hated both halves of the alternative and got on as best he could with art and friendship .

		Even of the struggle in which he had served gloriously and shed his own blood , he said in the end : I know what uniform I wore O , that I knew which side I fought for !

		He writes some of the most glorious pic - tures .

		of battle in our language witness the sketch called `` What I Saw of Antie - tam '' and he also writes : ... somewhat lamely the conception runs Of a brass-buttoned Jesus , firing guns .

		He reviles Oscar Wilde ; he writes an ad - mirable defiance of the post-mortem critics of Ingersoll .

		By his mere aversions , you can prove him on the side of the strong against the weak , also on that of the weak against the strong ; for Philistinism , and also against it ; a friend of freedom , and a friend of tyrants .

		For his aversions cover everything .

		His eyes were so untrained and dim All politics , religions , Arts , sciences , appeared to him But modes of plucking pigeons .

		A born fighter , he finds in his generation no hopeful cause clear enough or illustrious enough to claim all his fighting energy .

		Therefore he vents his rage on little things , such as the human liking for dogs , which he loathes as some men do snakes .

		And he comes out of all his lesser battles the per - fect cynic , the complete misanthropist .

		There is the threat of tragic unfulfill - ment in the very composition of the man : a mind of first-rate clarity encompassed by the mediocre and the futile , and achieving a stoic resignation , but mismated with a temperament to which resignation was for - ever impossible .

		Surveying life without illusion , he knew that his fighting was vain ; being himself , he could but fight the harder .

		He was denied a great thing , the hope that his two aristocratic divinities , reason and beauty , could ever prevail with the mass of men .

		But he won , and kept , the greatest thing of all ; for he knew that reason was reason whatever multitude preferred folly , and that beauty was beautiful whoever had no eyes in his head .

		History and his own make-up may partly have thwarted his utility as the social satirist of
Philistia	LOCATION	; but he paid in full the debt to himself .

		It is in the fight for his own identity , and 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	in the aristocratic graces thereby exhibited , that he becomes unsurpassed and , during our time , unequaled .

		We are all part of a regimen which puts its premium on our common qualities arid subtly encourages us to sink our differences .


Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	stood almost alone in holding that our in - dividual non-conformity is the one thing worth expression , because through it alone can we make any contribution to the com - mon stock .

		He fought for his differences ; and the gaiety and gallantry of his onset restore to satire its old heroic kinship with knight-errantry and the personal duel .

		Our coldly intellectual modern charity for everything seemed to him sterile , non - creative ; and if he is in one sense unmodern it is because , with
Lucian	PERSON	and Juvenal ,
Dryden	PERSON	and Pope , Swift and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, he chose to explore the possibilities of hate as a form of creative energy .

		He is a mag - nificent barbarian in whom the joy of bat - tle replaces the joy which other artists have taken in their fellow men .

		His hate is in itself excoriating , terrible , monstrous ; his sense of life is , at its sweetest , bitter-sweet , and at its bitterest more bitter than gall .

		But , after all , the most momentous thing in him , and the most memorable , is an artist 's exultation in his art , in the polish and the unique precision of his weapons , in the lightning gleam of his own sword of wit .

		The fact that he despises life pales before his joy in wreaking himself upon it .

		Even his personal victims seem not so much con - temptible for what they are as admirably accommodating to have been there at all , exposing themselves to him .

		In short ,
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	is primarily and , I think , most permanently a certain quality of wit .

		And his embodiment of that quality is above all a style .

		His per - sonal style has the species of greatness which is felt as much in a phrase as in a volume ; he would have proved himself a great man if he had written nothing more than two or three titles such as `` Cobwebs from an Empty Skull , '' `` Black Beetles in Amber , ' -RSB- and `` Ashes of the Beacon . ''

		The marvel is that he can keep up for whole pages , chapters , essays , volumes this fusion of imagination with accuracy into a homogeneous distillate of sheer wit .

		His precision alone is a constantly recur - ring thrill .

		Literature expresses `` the vir - tues and other vices '' of an age .

		Crime is `` stupiditate of opportunity . ''

		A wind thunders in the chimney `` like the sound of clods upon a coffin . ''

		A trivial utterance at a terrible moment makes the situation more ghastly , `` as the fire of a cigar might light up a tomb . ''

		A certain commander is So brave that if his army got a beating None dared to face him when he was retreating .

		The popular `` godlets '' of fiction are to
Tolstoi	LOCATION	as `` slugs ; their brilliant work is a shine of slime which dulls behind them even as they creep . ''

		And consider , as a final example , what he has to say to these same `` godlets '' `` these little fellows , the so-called realists '' in affirmation of his own non-realistic creed : It is to him of widest knowledge , of deepest feeling , of sharpest observation and insight , that life is most crowded with figures of heroic stature , with spirits of dream , with demons of the pit , with graves that yawn in pathways leading to the light , with existences not of earth , both malign and benign ministers of grace and ministers of doom .

		The truest eye is that which discerns the shadow and the portent , the dead hands reaching , the light that .

		is the heart of the dark - ness , the sky `` with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms . ''

		The truest ear is that which hears Celestial voices to the midnight air , Sole , or responsive each to the other 's note , Singing not `` their great Creator , '' but not a negro melody , either ; no , nor the latest favorite of the drawing - room .

		In short , he to whom life is not picturesque , enchanting , astonishing , terrible , is denied the gift and faculty divine , and being no poet can write no prose .

		This is the very organ-note of wit , whereas his epigrams are but its over-tones ; they have the same relation to the fundamental that his several hundred `` Fantastic Fa - bles '' have to `` The Monk and the Hang - man 's Daughter , '' or to his strange tales of the death which is everywhere in the midst of life .

		He has surface brilliance , but he has also depth ; the gleams shine against a central glow , not against a dark - ness .

		The adequate symbol of all his other distinctions together is this distinction of style .

		Being , by his own definition , a poet , he wrote noble prose .

		It is not his fault if there are few to un - derstand that kind of nobility .

		It is his misfortune and the more serious misfor - tune of those who do not understand .

London	LOCATION	: A
War Nocturne You	ORGANIZATION	are a beautiful idol which hides it - self in the twilight ; you are a queen of faded and tragic splendor , who sits in an armchair in the midst of halls of clamor , watching the darkness descending with a melancholy and plaintive smile .

		Autumn and
spring	DATE	are your seasons ; wet leaves sticking close to gray pavements , moribund branches , crocuses startling the dull brown of old house-fronts with flame - shot disks of gold .

		Under the war-cloud all the races of the earth have come together , t ' o watch beside your altar .

		After the golden sunlight is washed away from pale steeples , bathing them - selves superbly in the mellow glow of haze that floats over the shadowed and bat - tling throngs that swirl about their feet ; after the conflagration of the sunset flick - ers abruptly between rows of blue-black crouching house-fronts ; after the evening star peeps forth faintly , and the movement of rushing traffic , carrying weary slaves out to their suburbs , dies away ; then you waken mysteriously , and your garments stir and rustle under the soft caress of the

		Taxicabs trail softly red tail-lamps ; sombre busses , huge bulks of shadow , glide by ; massive vans , their tops hooded , stalk along bearing high three dim golden lan - terns ; now and then , furtively , the delicate silhouette of a hansom clacks past , like a phantom of dead years .

		Nights also of ashen moonlight you know , when the streets are empty of all but terror , and the barking thunder of great guns goes rolling and throbbing away ; nights of gray pitiless rain , sifting , drift - ing uncertainly into the shadows , while the huddled throng of umbrellas hurl them - selves on the bridges , plashing through muddy puddles that reflect pale lamps ; nights of fog and silence , deserted streets , the beat of feet that dies away in the dis - tance ; nights of loud wind , with flying traf - fic and searchlights swinging against the low-rushing clouds .

		You are as music endless , dancing , in - toxicating , maddening , monotonous music .

		In my heart secretly , unknown to men , I carry with me some of your strange modu - lations : the bitter glare of street-lamps un - der the swish and beat of rain , the babble of voices in the gray fog , the swirl of gulls above the sombre Thames , the waning light that fades away above some dim , empty street , like the plucked treble string of a violin , and a clash of drums and cymbals the opulent traffic that speeds through blue-lit theaterland at evening towards those brass-studded open doors that let out a flood of crimson or golden light , to irradiate , for an instant , the pave -

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 18	DATE	Our
London	LOCATION	Letter It is some time now since any English states - man gave a lift to a good book by a deliberately aimed public or semi-public commendation .

		If I remember rightly , Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	recently puffed the works of some lady novelist or other and drove a number of literary critics into the arms - of the
Opposition	ORGANIZATION	, who did not know what to do with the strange gift .

		He has also made Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	a knight .

		But it was left to Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	to revive the weighty influence of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	.

		In his recent Romanes Lecture , delivered at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, on `` Some Aspects of the Victorian Age '' he quite suddenly and rather unexpectedly remarked on the brilliance of Mr.
Lytton Strachey	PERSON	's `` Eminent Victorians '' -LRB-
Chatto & Windus	ORGANIZATION	; 10/6 -RRB- .

		I say unexpectedly , because one does not expect a somewhat academic Ox - ford statesman , lecturing at
Oxford	LOCATION	, suddenly to deliver a eulogy of a
Cambridge	LOCATION	iconoclast .

		But perhaps I am wrong .

		After Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	's vol - ume of `` Occasional Addresses '' one ought to have known that his taste and Tightness in lit - erature were as indisputable as the soundness and dignity of his statesmanship .

		Certainly in this instance his Tightness is be - yond all doubt .

		Mr.
Lytton Strachey	PERSON	has been for some years the veiled oracle of a small but highly vocal clique who used to announce im - pressively that when the prodigy did at last come out of his retirement he would bring with him a performance of the most astonishing sort .

		One knows , of course , what dull nervous books these veiled oracles do produce when they emerge ; and I can not honestly say that I looked forward to this particular appearance with more than a faint curiosity .

		Nor , I imagine , did any one else outside the clique .

		I am proud to say that when I read the book my attitude was changed with a shock .

		I was at the time much agitated with business and was traveling incessantly ; but I carried that precious volume about with me till I had read it twice , and never noticed the length or the dullness of my journeys .

		Even then it did not occur to me that others would be as much fascinated as I , and I was genuinely surprised genuinely delighted too when I found this treasure was actually the book of the moment .

		Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	, I understand , has been talking about it in private almost ad nauseam ; and this may account for some of the stir it has caused but not for all .

		Sheer merit has had its share in the result .

		The odd thing is that neither Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	nor any of the solemn persons who have sat in judgment on the book have pretended that it throws any particularly illuminating light on the Victorian age .

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	observes that we know too much about that epoch .

		It is , he says , a vast sea from which we can do no more than dredge up a few specimens for examination .

		His book , then , is not to be considered from this point of view .

		It may more profitably be con - sidered in two aspects .

		It is , in the first place , technically a masterpiece of biographical narra - tive , witty , enlightening , penetrating , and con - cise , rivaling the masterpieces of the French writers whom the author envies .

		Biography of this sort has not been written before in English .

		It is , in the second place , the expression of a man whose genius and sympathies , equally with his technical gifts , make his view of human na - ture as displayed in given circumstances defi - nitely a thing of value for the nourishment of the spirit .

		The four figures whom Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	has chosen for treatment are
Cardinal Manning	ORGANIZATION	,
Florence Nightingale	LOCATION	, Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	, and
General Gordon	ORGANIZATION	.

		All these are , with the possible ex - ception of
Manning	PERSON	, persons of whom a definite and somewhat idealized legend exists in the con - ventional English mind .

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	's faults , such as they are , result from an overstrain of the brilliant talents he has used to destroy the con - ventional images .

		Skepticism is the proper frame of mind in which to approach a false convention .

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	has acted with strict propriety and justice in questioning the view that
Florence Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	was a miracle of kind and gentle womanliness .

		He does well in insisting on Gor - don 's mixed motives , megalomania , and furious drinking bouts .

		But his attitude also betrays him into the shallowness of suggesting that
Newman	PERSON	's sacrifice and tragedy were due to the accident of his having gone to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	instead of to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and it tempts him to scoff at the best of
Arnold	LOCATION	's achievement merely because he can see that it led to certain bad results .

		It is difficult in a limited space to give any adequate idea of the virtue of Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	's book ; and the faults which it is necessary to mention may overshadow anything I say in its praise .

		But its qualities are those of lucidity of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 55 view , close accuracy and conciseness of style , and a curiosity about the mainsprings of life and hu - man endeavor which transcends the author 's cynical attitude .

		The point from which he rises into sheer poetic appreciation is in the sense which he has of the variety of life and persons .

		The force with which he conveys this sense would be remarkable in a novelist ; but in a biographer , who is hampered by only partly as - certained fact , it is astonishing .

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	has by this one book given a new turn to the English tradition of biography , and it is for him to carry it on .

		He has come into the open from the ambush of his esoteric reputation , and it will be a great disappointment if in the next few years he does not multiply the studies of character in which he has no conceivable English rival .

		I am sorry to have to incur the suspicion of intemperate enthusiasm twice in one letter , but the fact that Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	's book and Mr. De la Mare 's new collection of verse , `` Motley , and Other Poems '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, have appeared at the same time makes it inevitable .

		I hinted earlier that I , with others , looked forward to this volume with eager impatience .

		I can only say now , with all the calm of which I am capa - ble , that it has exceeded my expectations .

		Mr. De la Mare 's charming `` Peacock Pie '' was a book a little out of the main line of his develop - ment .

		His new book really succeeds `` The List - eners '' and carries immensely further the vein of poetry there begun .

		He is not a poet of the kind that explains God to mart , and his command over the heart is not wide , does not embrace all human activities .

		But to be detestable in meta - phor for the sake of clearness he strikes on a narrow front and breaks through successfully .

		He moves the emotions of wistfulness and long - ing so powerfully as to set the whole heart in a turmoil .

		By some indefinable method he throws us into a state from which we emerge with our spirits exhilarated , purer , more secure .

		He is not a poet of great variety .

		He often achieves perfection of phrasing , though the failure to do so does not perturb him .

		But within his own range he is the truest poet we have ; and since within that range he can produce states of mind so precious , I feel an inability to criticize him or to comment on the ugliness of some of his in - versions or on his vastly improved diction .

		I dare say no more than that this is a volume which produces states of mind worth having .

		I shall not be accused of immoderate partisan - ship for what I have to say of Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's new book , `` Three French Moralists '' -LRB-
Heinemann	LOCATION	; 6s . -RRB-

		.

		The book itself is of small importance , but it reminds one that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is a figure .

		He has written for so many years and with an agreeableness so uniform and so winning that now he can do nothing , or at all events nothing that will not be accused .

		He is certainly capable of extreme intellectual gauch - eries .

		Topical events have led him to remark that `` war is the
Condy	PERSON	's fluid of civilization '' and , on another occasion , that he would never open his Goethe or his
Heine	PERSON	again .

		These ob - servations are irritating to those who do not care to regard war as a remedy to be kept on a shelf , however high up , in every political housewife 's cupboard , and who do not see why any sane man should be deprived of the stock of pleasure and enlightenment that is contained in
Goethe	LOCATION	's works , merely because of the actions of people in whom not a drop of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's own blood runs at least , legitimately .

		But these things are ex - cused to Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, who is the nearest we have yet produced to the genial French critics , to
Lemaitre	LOCATION	,
Brunetiere	PERSON	, and the
Anatole France	LOCATION	of `` La Vie des Lettres . ''

		I should say that when I was comparatively a child Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	was one of the most effective of the influences that led me into the fields of poetry .

		This may not be in itself a very potent recommendation , but I believe that a great many others would say the same .

		A writer who very pleasantly tells one of books one will enjoy is a person for whom one cherishes a warm feeling ; and this probably ac - counts for Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's present position and for the fact that one loves him even when most irri - tated by him .

		I shall be surprised if foreign booksellers in
London	LOCATION	are not during the next few months visited by a number of persons de - manding the works of La Rochefoucauld , La Bruyere , and Vauvenargues ; and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	would rightly regard this as a handsome tribute to his endeavors .

		His attempt to connect the three sententious philosophers with the gallantry shown by the French armies of today is merely another of those amiable eccentricities for which it is so easy to excuse him .

THE DIAL Foreign Comment	ORGANIZATION	on
Robert Dell	ORGANIZATION	's Expulsion THE DIAL , for whom Mr.
Robert Dell	PERSON	was for many months the
Paris	LOCATION	Correspondent , pre - vious to his expulsion from
France	LOCATION	by
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	, may be pardoned for calling atten - tion to certain facts about Mr.
Dell	PERSON	and the in - terpretation of liberal opinion in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	on those facts .

		His expulsion had a much deeper than merely personal significance : it was the last act in a political drama of the greatest importance .

		Furthermore this presenta - tion may well serve as a general answer to the many letters which THE DIAL has received con - cerning Mr.
Dell	PERSON	some of them commendatory , some inquiring , many severely critical , but all based on certain misunderstandings .

		First of all , Mr.
Dell	PERSON	was the accredited political correspondent of the foremost liberal newspaper of the world , the Manchester `` Guar - dian '' of
England	LOCATION	.

		He had lived in
France	LOCATION	over twenty years and was known and respected , even by his political opponents , for his honesty and courage and journalistic enterprise .

		-LRB- See , for example , the article by
M. Maurice de Waleffe	ORGANIZATION	in the `` Action '' of
May 22	DATE	. -RRB-

		He had to such a degree identified his own with the French point of view that he was sometimes accused of think - ing of
France	LOCATION	's interests even before those of his own country ,
England	LOCATION	.

		And it is true that on the outbreak of the war he vehemently advo - cated the intervention of
England	LOCATION	on the side of
France	LOCATION	, even writing on
August	DATE	i ,
1914	DATE	that if
England	LOCATION	did not intervene he would renounce his nationality .

		His daughter is married to a French officer now serving at the front .

		His loyalty to
France	LOCATION	has never been questioned .

		After
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	's revelation of the note of
Emperor Karl	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Dell	PERSON	sent a series of arti - cles to his newspaper giving further facts and putting the whole episode in its larger historical background .

		-LRB- It is important to remember that these facts have never been challenged . -RRB-

		As a result of these revelations in the
Manchester	LOCATION	`` Guardian '' a debate was begun by Mr.
Runci	PERSON	- man in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	on
May 16	DATE	.

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	answered for the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Briefly , the debate resulted in a clear repudia - tion from Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	on behalf of the country and all the Allies , of any demand for the French frontier of
1841	DATE	, or of any sort of claim .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	did not give any detailed account of
Austria	LOCATION	's peace offer , for he really knew nothing about it at first hand , being in
America	LOCATION	at the time it was brought forward .

		But he did state : `` If any representative of any belligerent country desires seriously to lay before us any proposals , we are prepared to listen to them . ''

		On
May 18	DATE	Mr.
Dell	PERSON	was expelled from
Paris	LOCATION	.

		That there was no doubt of its being a purely political expulsion brought about by the embarrassment caused by his revelations is indi - cated in the news dispatch in the
London	LOCATION	`` Tele - graph '' of
May 21	DATE	: `` The present drastic meas - ure -LSB- the expulsion -RSB- has at last been taken in consequence of a recent two-column article in his paper . ''

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's own statement , dated from * Lon - don ,
May 20	DATE	, and printed in the
Manchester	LOCATION	`` Guardian '' for
May 21	DATE	, is as follows : I have had the honour of being expelled from
France	LOCATION	by the French Government that is to say , by
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	.

		It is an honour because of the rea - son of my expulsion .

		For I have been expelled be - cause I am the only English correspondent in
Paris	LOCATION	that has been able to give his paper any information at all about the negotiations arising out of the letter of the Austrian Emperor communicated by
Prince Sixte de Bourbon	ORGANIZATION	to
M. Poincare	PERSON	on
March 31 , 1917	DATE	.

		The Manchester `` Guardian '' is , in fact , the only English paper that has given the English public any information about a matter of the first importance which has been fully dealt with by the Italian , Swiss , and German press .

		I am proud to have been the means of saving the reputation of the English press , and I regard
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	's action in expelling me from
France	LOCATION	as the greatest compliment I have ever received in the course of my journalistic career .

		The editorial comment of his own paper on the event was published on the same day : The overtures of Emperor Karl may have been sincerely meant or they may have been a `` peace - trap '' ; the conditions which he suggested may or may not have gone far enough they went pretty far to afford a basis for further discussion .

		On these mat - ters opinion may legitimately differ .

		It is a question rather of whether people in this country shall have the materials on which to form an adequate and in - structed opinion .

		And here we think that , in this country at least , we shall be held blameless ... We have nothing to regret in these transactions .

		We acted , as we believed , in the public interest , and our correspondent undoubtedly acted from similar mo - tives .

		None of his facts have been challenged , and while we regret that he should have to suffer , we are not without faith that in
France	LOCATION	also public opinion will justify him .

		The editorial comment of the English weekly `` Nation '' on Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's expulsion , published on
May 25	DATE	, is :
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	has retaliated upon the Manchester `` Guardian , '' the only English newspaper which pub - lished the facts about the Austrian overtures of
1917	DATE	, by expelling its correspondent , Mr.
Dell	PERSON	, from
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	has a long and distinguished journalistic record , and this blow dealt to him and the paper he represents can hardly add to
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	's popu -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 larity in
England	LOCATION	.

		The decision is the more re - markable since Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's facts had for the most part appeared freely in the French Socialist Press , and to judge from Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's speech in the debate upon them , they admit of no challenge .


M. Clemenceau	PERSON	himself removed the veil of secrecy from these trans - actions , when he published the Emperor 's first letter .

		His view apparently is that the world ought to know only so much of this episode as he chooses to reveal .

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	and certain of the French Socialist depu - ties thought otherwise .

		Their revelations seemed to the Liberal Front Bench in
England	LOCATION	serious enough for the initiation of a formal debate , and Mr.
Bal	PERSON	- four made his reply without either correcting the facts or censuring their publication .

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	, then , has suffered for supplying material which the whole
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	thought fit to debate .

		Thus the blow is dealt not to Mr.
Dell	PERSON	alone , nor merely to the great newspaper which he serves , but to British public opinion .


M. Clemenceau	PERSON	's action simply keeps it in the dark .

		Even in
America	LOCATION	, where the whole political and diplomatic significance of Emperor
Karl	PERSON	's letter was ignored , Mr.
Dell	PERSON	does not lack liberal defenders .

		In its issue of
May 22	DATE	, the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' made the following edi - torial comment : The expulsion from
France	LOCATION	of
Robert Dell	ORGANIZATION	, long
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent of the Manchester `` Guardian , '' needs a Jot of explaining .

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	can not be ac - cused of hostility to either the French people or the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		A part of a recent letter of his in the
Chicago	LOCATION	DIAL was devoted to a defence of the Premier of
France	LOCATION	against rash charges made by American journalists .

		And in that same correspond - ence Mr.
Dell	PERSON	declared : `` I am neither an American nor a Frenchman , but I have been deeply attached all my life both to
France	LOCATION	and to
America	LOCATION	, and I believe that it is through
France	LOCATION	that
America	LOCATION	can most easily get into touch with
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The cause of his falling into disfavor with the French authori - ties is the information which he sent to his news - paper about the peace negotiations with
Austria	LOCATION	, especially in connection with the now famous letter of the Austrian Emperor to '' Prince Sixtus ... An attentive reading of it -LSB- Mr. '
Dell	ORGANIZATION	's first letter about the negotiations -RSB- will disclose no animosity towards
France	LOCATION	or her rulers .

		Merely , a correspondent of exceptional information and enterprise was explain - ing what had gone on behind the scenes .

		He did no more than French journalists were doing .

		But he , a friendly foreigner , has been made the victim of a '' purely political expulsion on the initiative of the Premier . ''

		Fancy
Clemenceau	PERSON	, the champion and ex - ponent of a free press and of the right of relentless criticism of officials , unable to endure the presence of Mr.
Robert Dell	PERSON	!

		... The decision to expel him , however , seems petty .

		It does not accord with our Idea of the generous attitude of
France	LOCATION	.

		Giving to her own journalists great latitude , why should her Government come down so hard upon an English newspaper correspondent , who had given repeated proofs of his devotion to French interests ?

		In view of these clear statements of three lib - eral organs and it would be possible to quote others THE DIAL feels justified in believing that in
America	LOCATION	, too , public opinion will ulti - mately justify him .

		Wind in the lap of the great waste places , Sweeping the cliffs and the sands , Daring the desert 's hot white spaces , Give me your ghostly hands .

		I would dance with you across the hill tops , Over the depths and heights , Along the crest where the swollen sun drops Scattering rainbow lights .

		I know the touch of the harsh rock fingers , The breath of the oak and pine .

		I know the peaks where the rose light lingers .

		Wind , they are mine , are mine .

		Once where the yellow trail went winding , I heard your whispered call .

		Why are you dumb to me , When will you come to me , Mad with your spirit thrall ?

		The tough hill grasses are gray and golden , The yuccas are white with blooms , The still , hot sunbeams the lizards embolden Around the old Indian tombs .

		The barren mesas are wanly kneeling Under the desert blue .

		High in the hills comes a presence stealing .

		Wind , is it you ?

		Somewhere under the crescent moon 's Eerie glimmer , she caught the runes That the sea cries back to the ghostly dunes .

		Somewhere hither her spirit flew , Out of the safe , warm body it knew , Linked its fire with the fire of you , Flower and wind and dew .

		Softly strange are her glowing eyes , Strange to us are the songs she tries , Wild young laughter and groping tears Lonely fears .

		Beating spirit , the walls are high , The sea moans on and the moon rides by .

		Sad little ghost that can not stay Where the star beams play .

July 18	DATE	Some Morals : From the French of Villon THE POEMS OF FRANCOIS VILLON .

		Biographical and Critical Essay by
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Luce ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		In literary criticism there is always consider - able temptation to educe a moral ; and of the many morals suggested out of hand by the terres - trial career of Francois Villon the most emphatic is that depravity may , in the
third quarter	DATE	of every other blue moon , be eminently praise - worthy .

		A many other notable poets have been deplorable citizens ; hundreds of them have come to physical and spiritual ruin through drunken - ness and debauchery ; yet over these others it is possible to pull a long face , at any event in the classroom , and to assume that their verses would have been infinitely better if only the misguided writers thereof had lived a trifle more decorously .

		But with
Villon	PERSON	no such genteel evasion is per - missible .

		The `` Grand Testament '' is a direct result of the author 's having been , plus genius , a sneak-thief , a pimp , and a cut-throat .

		From personal experience painfully attained in the practice of these several vocations it was that
Villon	PERSON	wove imperishable verses , and he could not have come by this experience in any other way .

		So we have this Testament , this inseparable medley of sneers and beauty and grief and plain nastiness -LRB- wherein each quality bewilderingly be - gets the other three -RRB- , as the reaction of a certain personality to certain experiences .

		We are Tieartily glad to have this Testament ; and upon the whole , we are grateful to Villon for having done whatever was necessary to produce these poems .

		And no sane person will contemn the `` Ballade au Nom de la Fortune , '' the `` Regrets de la Belle Heaulmiere , '' and the `` Ballade des Pendus , '' on the score that their purchase price was severally the necessity of forcing a man ot genius to occupy a jail , a brothel , and a gibbet .

		For our moral prejudices fail to traverse the corridors of time ; and we really can not bother at
this late day	TIME	to regain the point of view of the Capetian police .

		Just here moreover the career of Villon af - fords a subsidiary moral , as to the ultimate fu - tility of being practical .

		Villon stole purses and the constabulary hunted him down , through purely practical motives ; and it is salutary to reflect that both these facts are today of equal un - importance with all the other coeval manifesta - tions of common sense .

		Thus , for example , it was during
Villon	PERSON	's lifetime that
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	drove the English out of
France	LOCATION	and
Louis	LOCATION	XI established the French monarchy in actual power both practical and , as it seemed , really im - portant proceedings , of the sort to which marked prominence is accorded in the history-books .

		Yet the French monarchy is now at one with the pomp of Nimrod ; an English army garrisons the town in which the English burned the
Maid of Domremy	ORGANIZATION	, and today a host of Frenchmen die momently in their endeavor to prevent this army 's eviction ; but the nonsensical emotion with which a vagabond once viewed a loaf of bread in a bakery window survives unchanged .

		And when you reflect upon all the practical persons of Villon 's acquaintance the bishops and lords and princes , the lawyers and long-robed physi - cians , the merchants and grave magistrates and other citizens of unstained repute , who self - respectingly went about important duties and discharged them with credit you can not but marvel that of this vast and complicated polity , which took itself so seriously , nothing should have remained vital save the wail , as of a hurt child , that life should be so `` horrid . ''

		For this is all that survives to us , all that stays really alive , of the
France	LOCATION	of Louis XI .

		Villon , be it repeated , even when he jeers does but transmit to us the woe of an astounded and very dirty child that life should be so `` horrid . ''

		He does not reason about it ; for here , if any - where , was a great poet `` delivered from thought , from the base holiness of intellect , '' and Villon reasons about nothing ; but his grief is peculiarly acute , and in the outcome contagious .

		It is so cruel , he laments , that youth and vigor should be but transient loans , and that even I should have become as bald as a peeled onion ; so cruel that death should be waiting like a tipstaff to hale each of us , even me , into the dark prison of the grave ; and so cruel that the troubling beauty of great queens , and even the prettiness of those adorable girls with whom I used to frolic , should be so soon converted into a wrinkled bag of bones .

		And it is very cruel , too , that because I borrowed a purseful of money when the owner was looking elsewhere , I should be locked in this uncomfortable dungeon ; I had to have some money .

		And it is perfectly pre - posterous that , merely because I lost my temper and knifed a rascal , who was no conceivable loss to anybody , the sheriff should be going to hang me on a filthy gallows , where presently the beak of a bedraggled crow will be pecking at my face like the needle at my old mother 's thimble .

		For I never really meant any harm !

		In short , to
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 59 Villon 's finding , life , not merely as the parish authorities order it , but as the laws of nature constrain it too , is so `` horrid '' that the only way of rendering life endurable is to drink as much wine as one can come by ; and there in little you have
Villon	PERSON	's creed .

		It is not a particularly `` uplifting '' form of faith , save in the sense that it leads toward elevation at a rope 's end , but
Villon	LOCATION	is perfectly sincere in enunciating it , and his very real terror and bewilderment at the trap in which he was born , and his delight in all life 's colorful things , that are doubly endeared by his keen sense of their impermanence , are un - erringly communicated .

		Pity and terror dare one repeat ?

		was what Aristotle demanded in great poetry , and this Villon gives full measure .

		Of the English translation ' by
John Payne	PERSON	, whose version is reproduced in this new edition -LRB- without any mention of the translator -RRB- , the best which can be said is that
Payne	PERSON	self-evidently worked hard to make it , and so deserves praise for his industry .

		For the rest ,
Payne	PERSON	has not infrequently transmuted the obsolete French into a jargon that was never English , and has but too successfully avoided the malpractice of
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	, who `` translated Villon '' by writing upon
Villon	PERSON	's themes some quite new verses , and sometimes rather better poems than he did .

		Payne certainly has done this nowhere .

		And yet
Payne	PERSON	's critical introduction is of genuine interest and value , so that one wonders by what editorial logic it has been omitted from this new edition , to make room for the essay by
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Questionless , the favored paper is a bit of very picturesque and justly famous `` writing '' ; but it is irritatingly the rhetoric of a descendant of
Scotch Covenanters	ORGANIZATION	, of a monstrously clever young Edinburgher who can not ever get quite free of the underthought that
Villon	PERSON	was `` nae vera weel thought of . ''

		And this attitude is in - tolerable when adopted toward a circumstance which Villon himself is reported to have dis - posed of , once for all .

		`` When
Paris	LOCATION	had need of a singer Fate made the man .

		To kings ' courts she lifted him ; to thieves ' hovels she thrust him down ; and past
Lutetia	LOCATION	's palaces and abbeys and taverns and gutters and prisons and its very gal - lows past each in turn the man was dragged , that he might make the Song of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		So the song was made ; and as long as
Paris	LOCATION	endures
Francois Villon	PERSON	will be remembered .

		Villon the singer Fate fashioned as was needful ; and in this fashioning Villon the man was ruined in body and soul .

		And the song was worth it . ''

		JAMES BRANCH
CABELL	PERSON	.

		Lord Acton Idealist CORRESPONDENCE OF LORD
ACTON	LOCATION	.

		Vol .

		I. Long - mans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		Every student of history has cause to be grate - ful for this book .

		Badly edited and ill arranged as it is , it is full of wise comment and acute ob - servation upon some of the central issues of so - cial life .

		The more profoundly the nineteenth century is studied , the more does it become evi - dent that its truest perspective will be found in the analysis of such minds as that of
Acton	LOCATION	.

		His philosophy bears a fruit we have still to gather .

		He was the first great political thinker of our time to see the comparative unimportance of any problem save that of freedom .

		He represents the realization that the negative liberalism of Mill and his school , valuable and instructive as it is , only casts light upon the question of liberty without in fact providing its solution .

		He adds the understanding that , as
T. H. Green	PERSON	so finely saw , no statement of the meaning of freedom is adequate which does not include positive assur - ance not less than negative safeguard .

		Liberty is not less the provision of opportunity than the organization of resistance .

		The central defect of Mill 's outlook was the fact that it depended upon an unreal classification of human disposi - tions .

		It was right where it affirmed and wrong where it denied .

		It was too simple to represent the complex facts it attempted to summarize .

		The great virtue of
Acton	LOCATION	's attitude was the splendid experience upon which it was based .

		It came from a man whose learning was equaled by perhaps .

		only two men in his time .

		No mind has so superbly swept the whole field of organized knowledge as did
Acton 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was not satisfied with the printed books .

		Manuscript sources in library and archives , the vale of some statesman whom old age had rendered garrulous , the tradition some traveler had brought from a distant people , a half-deciphered inscription from a broken Egyptian tomb all were swept into the service of his priceless generalizations .

		Acton - is the ideal cosmopolitan .

		He centered within himself the full intelligence of his age .

		He knew English political life from the inside of those half dozen salons where alone the truth can be uttered .

		He could pass from the drawing - room of
M. Guizot	PERSON	to the study of the great
Dollinger	PERSON	.

		He knew
Favre	PERSON	and
Newman	PERSON	,
Manning	PERSON	and Strossmayer ,
Disraeli	PERSON	and Glad - stone .

		He realized , as few have realized , that when the last word has been said upon the play of the great historic forces , the historian must 60 THE DIAJL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	still examine the play of personality i / he would hope to understand .

		The range of his interests is almost unbelievable .

		He can talk with au - thority upon the budget .

		He grasped the core of the Irish question some thirty years before his age .

		He made the one defence of the Secession - ists of 1 86 1 that is in any degree admissible .

		He had the subtlety of
Newman	PERSON	not less than the solidity of
Dollinger	PERSON	.

		His understanding of for - eign affairs reveals the man accustomed to weigh - ing the most imponderable of forces .

		Though a Catholic , he was the trusted adviser of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	upon the personal problems of the English Church .

		Though an amateur , his analy - sis of the great naval crisis of
1894	DATE	shows the man who realizes the interplay of administration and politics .

		He came into contact with almost all that was worth knowing in his age .

		He was the knight errant of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the prince of scholars , the best publicist of his generation .

		He wrote no book that is not a classic .

		He touched no subject that he did not illuminate .

		And yet , when the last word is said , he still remains the most tragic failure of his time .

		He is a seeming paradox ; yet , in the analysis of his environment , he is a paradox we may not deny .

		He set out to achieve impossible tasks , so that there is a real sense in which he was the
Don Quixote	PERSON	of intelligence .

		A
Roman Catho	PERSON	- lic , with a passionate belief in his church , he set out to convert it to the principles of liberalism .

		His massive learning did not open his eyes to the impossibility of the effort .

		Not the treatment of
Pere Simon	PERSON	, not the treatment of Lamennais , not the treatment of
Dollinger	PERSON	revealed to him the hopelessness of his cause .

		He did not see that to make
Rome	LOCATION	accept the results of the scholarship he so profoundly revered was to destroy for her the ethos which had grown over seven centuries of effort .

		He did not understand that to make
Rome	LOCATION	the mother of freedom would be to make her deny the principles for which she had been willing to betray the civilization of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He believed in freedom as an absolute ; but that is to insist upon the central maxim of the Protestant faith .

		He cuts the root of Catholicism far more deeply than the probabilism of
Newman	PERSON	or the hectic impossibilities of
W. G. Ward	ORGANIZATION	.

		For if the absolute inviolability of conscience is to be maintained as
Acton	LOCATION	would have maintained it , the centralization of the Roman system alike in dogma and in government must be at once re - jected .

		He does not seem to have realized that he was inviting a bureaucracy to suicide .

		He did not see that he was asking the sacrifice of wealth and comfort and efficiency to an idealistic creed which , from its very nobility , can be grasped only by the highest effort .

		The standards by which he judged the acts of men and institutions have too little of that philosophy of the second - best which , as Lord
Morley	PERSON	has told us , alone can be characteristic of the seeker in political paths .

		He was too stern , too unyielding , too closed to the baffling complexity of things , to make the necessary deductions for the limitations of human effort .

		The very
Gladstone	PERSON	whom he so greatly worshiped was a past master in that art of skilful and compromising adjustment against which
Acton	ORGANIZATION	's life was so vehement a protest .

		The eternal principles of the moral law may be , as he saw , the one security of advance in civilization ; but it is necessary to obtain a far greater degree of unanimity upon their content before they can be .

		used as a working criterion of right and wrong .

		Nor did Acton leave more than a fragment of that great history of liberty which it was his dream to write .

		The fragment , indeed , is precious ; and one may well doubt whether , out - side the golden pages of
Tocqueville	LOCATION	, there is so much wisdom so marvelously compressed .

		But upon the scale he planned it the task was an im - possible one .

		The history of the central theme of human endeavor can be mastered only if one keeps to the highroad .

		Acton found a jewel in the head of every toad , be it never so ugly and venomous .

		The great library that is the des - pairing wonder of every scholar , the half dozen references in the letters to Mrs.
Drew	PERSON	, the myriad slips that send out his successors upon endless oceans he alone could have charted , make one realize that , as he conceived it , the plan was beyond the reach of the human mind .

		Many an investigator will leave his bones in the desert over which
Acton	LOCATION	traveled before the field is even surveyed .

		To know freedom as the Greeks un - derstood it is a sufficient adventure for a lifetime .

		A determined isolation could alone explain what was lost when
Rome	LOCATION	became the mistress of the world .

		What the church offered is material for a mighty book .

		The contribution of representa - tive government still remains to be assessed .

		We have as yet but the footnotes to the history ; the very chapters are still beyond our interpretation .

		It is interesting to reflect upon the singular de - fect of
Acton	LOCATION	's equipment .

		The passionate lover of freedom seems , for the most part , to have re - mained uninterested in the economic problems of history .

		There remains , indeed , the emphatic approval of
Harrington	PERSON	's great dictum that po -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 litical power is the handmaid of economic power ; but the perception that it is above all to this sphere that his ethical canons need application seems lacking in all that he did .

		Yet it is at least possible that when the history of liberty comes eventually to be written its fundamental chapter will be the slow evolution of the state into a society where the classification of medieval and modern economic structure has been over - thrown .

		Churches are fleeting things beside the permanence of economic subjections .

		States are meaningless when interpreted in terms of ab - stract moral purpose .

		Here , doubtless ,
Acton	PERSON	only shared the convictions of his time .

		The nineteenth century is preeminently the age in which the triumph of religious tolerance gave the principle of representative government a unique opportunity for the proof of its value .

		It was only when the broad content of religious equality and political democracy had been won that it was seen how much remained behind .

		Those who had earlier grasped this
Thompson	PERSON	,
Hodgskin	LOCATION	,
Owen	PERSON	, Mill do not see.m very greatly to have interested
Acton	LOCATION	.

		Things like trade-unionism and the
International	ORGANIZATION	, men like
Proudhon	PERSON	and
Marx	PERSON	, do not seem to have ar - rested his attention .

		Certain vast insights , in - deed , he had ; as when -LRB- page 189 -RRB- he pointed out that the concentration of power is the real danger of democracy and emphasized the fact that we can still learn much wisdom from the writings of
Calhoun	PERSON	.

		Nor did he neglect , what is unduly neglected in our time , the significance of the
Bill of Rights	ORGANIZATION	.

		He understood that there are certain principles so absolute as necessarily to remain unconditioned .

		The evolution of their safeguards is the great problem of the next age .

		He is at least in a great tradition .

		He be - longs to a small group of thinkers who like
Burke	PERSON	and
John Mill	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, like
Royer	PERSON	-
Collard	ORGANIZATION	and Tocqueville in
France	LOCATION	, like
Hamil	PERSON	- ton in
America	LOCATION	sought out the essence of the state .

		But the real , though unconscious , source of his idealism is the man whom perhaps above all he would have deprecated .

		It is to
Rousseau	PERSON	that his insistence upon the eternal principles of political right goes back .

		It is the fundamental questions asked by that most superb of sciolists that he was endeavoring to answer .

		It may with confidence be predicted that in the coming re - construction of our ideals it will be the response he gave to which men will go in reverence for the splendor of his inspiration .


HAROLD J. LASKI	PERSON	.

		Limited Horizons HORIZONS : A BOOK OF CRITICISM .

		By
Francis Hackett	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		After reading these fifty book reviews I feel quite done up .

		It is as though one had sub - mitted oneself to a fifty round drubbing , a drub - bing not at the hands of a human antagonist but administered by a violently energetic punching - bag .

		For to every book and writer considered there is an appropriate and stinging reaction , yet if we try to discover some method or even mad - ness in these come-backs , we grasp only air .

		The real knockout blow which would floor our already tottering sensibility would be the demand for our reaction to these reactions of Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	.

		From punching-bags , no matter how intelligent and alert they may be , one does not get reactions that one can differentiate and talk about .

		At .

		the moment one meets the hit back as best one can , but the sum of all these maneuvers is not reaction it is exhaustion .

		The first review is devoted to
Stuart P. Sher	PERSON	- man 's recent book of criticism , `` On Contem - porary Literature . ''

		It is always pleasant to read what one critic says about another , especially when their pews are not in the same church .

		Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	is successful in depicting the psy - chology of Victorian criticism in this country , a psychology which is still in full flower .

		After we have read this brilliant essay and recalled cer - tain more or less marmoreal volumes of the past , our fancy gives us a pretty clear picture of Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	seated in
Urbana	LOCATION	, smoothly rocking back and forth over those eternal verities which are the planks of his genteel front stoop ; of Pro- fessor
Babbitt	PERSON	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, astride a smaller and more spirited rocker , which in its forward jerks and backward flings gives a satisfying ex - pression to the fiery soul of him who is to mod - ern literature what Luther was to medieval dogma ; and of -
Paul Elmer	PERSON	More Italianately al fresco , seated in a wicker rocking-chair which with due restraint passes and repasses over a noble mosaic consisting of hunting scenes from the wise Plato .

		Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	, as I said , is not of the same church .

		If however his eyes do not , like those of Mr.
More	PERSON	, regard the crumbly mo - saic of more cultured centuries , he also is occu - pied with ideas , ideas that in his case appear to have been scratched before breakfast in the thin dirt of a suburban street .

		Wild-eyed he hop - scotches among them , with head to one side , as good hop-scotchers are wont , and with an agility 62
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
July 18	DATE	which is eager to employ each one of these marks before the inexorable ice-wagon shall have oblit - erated them all .

		`` If I sympathize with novelties , it is not for the sake of excitation , not for love of black flow - ers and green suns .

		It is because our age is once more a renaissance . ''

		This bit of self-analysis from Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	's introduction to his book we feel to be correct .

		The fact that he seldom judges a book from its immediate aesthetic quality , but rather with his eye rolling over a dozen disparate theories , does after all put him definite - ly outside of unchurched romantic criticism and , however protestingly , in the same steepled yadi - tion with the Shermans , the Babbitts , and the Mores .

		`` The difference between a successful novel of ideas and a successful novel of manners is like the difference between exploding dyna - mite and discharging a rifle . ''

		Here again we see his preoccupation with ideas and theories , a preoccupation which , by the way , goes with his extreme contemporaneity ; for ideas ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	notwithstanding , are the most ephemeral of things .

		It is therefore character - istic of him that his treatment of Wells should be more adequate than his treatment of more personal writers , such as
Bennett	PERSON	.

		This insis - tence on what I suppose
Wells	PERSON	would call `` seri - ous creative thought '' comes out amusingly enough in strictures passed upon one whom we should have thought quite sufficiently a reformer ,
G. B. Shaw	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	accuses him of `` dis - porting rather than exercising his gifts . ''

		So it is a theatre-laugh , not a laugh of corrective comedy , that attends every suggestion of love in `` Misalliance . ''

		A man in love is no more laughable , really , than a man in a gas-mask .

		His appearance may be silly , but the question is , what is creating the appearance ?

		To laugh at the grotesque intensity of him is to behave like a child .

		`` What is creating the appearance ? ''

		is indeed the question of a serious thinker and one who should soon inherit a rocker of his own .

		In the great desert of earnest purpose which is Ameri - can thought , it were well the cap-and-bells should be shaken , however tinny the note they gave .

		It is on that account the greater pity that a man of Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	's wit and talent should assume the pose and don the robes of the desert sheik , especially as neither the manner nor the dress becomes this engagingly human Arab of the streets .

		Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	's bias in favor of ideas rather than aesthetic effects is decidedly to his disad - vantage as a critic of poetry .

		Indeed , here I find his judgments definitely unsatisfactory .

		Compar - ing the rhythms of Vachel Lindsay to those of
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, he finds them `` ruder '' only `` in the sense that orchestra is ruder than solo . ''

		We wonder what orchestra Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	is used to that he should liken it to this amazing mega - phone of the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		Speaking of
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	, Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	says that `` these imagist verses are as good as any of their kind . ''

		We gather that `` imagist verses '' have a shelf to themselves in Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	's store and that there is a nice assortment of the various grades 40 , 50 , 60 , and
80 cents	MONEY	per tin .

		Here , as usually when Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	deals wtih poetry , we feel that he speaks to us not from his own percep - tion , but rather from hearsay .

		In speaking however of Mr.
Sandburg	PERSON	's title-poem , `` Chica - go , '' his feet once again on a firm familiar bot - tom , he plucks up considerable assurance and dif - ferentiates in several particulars his own opinion of that city from the
Chicago	LOCATION	poet 's .

		`` I am not much impressed by his vision of
Chicago	LOCATION	'' re - minds me of an acquaintance from
Schenectady	LOCATION	whom I once met in the
Louvre	LOCATION	and who did not care for
Leonardo	ORGANIZATION	's `` Madonna of the Rocks '' because the face did not express his idea or did he not say ideal ?

		of what the Mother of God should be .

		When out hunting poetry Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	should ride with a tight rein and with his feet well home in the stirrups ; otherwise that piebald
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	which is his own mount may one of these days give him a bad fall .

		Had not an enterprising advertiser informed us of the fact that so very many thousand readers of the journal for which most of these reviews were written ride in
Packards	LOCATION	, we might have inferred as much from Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	's large - print style .

		He writes at high speed for high - speed readers .

		If our eyes are filled with dust and our nostrils with the stench of gasoline , we may anyhow be sure that these things pass below the notice of the ladies and gentlemen who motor by .

		Some of us pedestrian-minded ones however are in the end a trifle shall I say pestered ?

		by these minutiae of the modern life Olympian .

		Meanwhile the poor words get twisted all awry and the sustaining phrase is unrecognizably dis - torted .

		`` To prepare an incident is almost im - possible and to present an incident without pre - paration is to leave out the dimension that makes for reflectiveness . ''

		Those who do not mind this characteristically strained use of a `` dimen - sion '' making for effectiveness will find nothing amiss with Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	's style .

		`` Yawp , '' for so rare a word , appears to be a favorite with our writer .

		The `` yawp barbaric '' is all right , but so intelligent a man as Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	is should be
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 63 aware that a yawp , when intelligent , is a very dreadful thing .

		But how splendidly , how like the
Blue Danube	LOCATION	, this book rolls on and on ; and if turbid and silty and at times sputtering , yet how ob - durately go-ahead it all is !

		There are plenty of good things , too , that glint momently in the onward rush .

		Labor Recorded HISTORY OF LABOR IN THE UNITED STATES .

		By
John R. Commons	PERSON	and collaborators .

		2 vols .

		Macmillan ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		In these two large volumes of more than six hundred pages each , Professor
John R. Commons	PERSON	and six associates have given to the world the fruits of many years of research .

		The work is divided into six unequal parts : `` Colonial and Federal Beginnings '' -LRB- to 1827 -RRB- , by Mr.
Saposs	PERSON	; `` Citizenship '' -LRB- 1827-33 -RRB- , by Miss Sumner ; `` Trade-Unionism '' -LRB- 1833-9 -RRB- , by Mr.
Mittel	PERSON	- man ; `` Humanitarianism '' -LRB- 1840-60 -RRB- , by Mr.
Hoagland	PERSON	; `` Nationalization '' -LRB- 1860-77 -RRB- , by Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	; and `` Upheaval and Reorganiza - tion '' -LRB- since 1876 -RRB- , by Mr.
Perlman	PERSON	.

		Professor Commons contributes an introductory survey set - ting forth the characteristic features of the Amer - ican labor movement and justifying in advance the plan of construction under which his col - leagues have carried out their several assignments .

		The treatment of the several periods , naturally enough , varies .

		Mr.
Saposs	PERSON	is philosophical , somewhat after the fashion of
Marx	ORGANIZATION	,
Bvicher	PERSON	, and the Teutons .

		He endeavors to place the American labor movement at the correct point in the general evolution of human industry and he pours the historical materials of the colonial period into certain economic categories , such as the development of bargaining classes , the mer - chant capitalist , and early trade unions .

		Miss Sumner presents an orderly and readable state - ment of facts about early labor organizations , labor policies , and labor politics brought down to time and localities .

		Mr.
Mittelman	PERSON	gives minute details as to early unions , strikes , labor politics , and premature national unionism .

		Mr.
Hoagland	PERSON	has smooth sailing in relating the story of communism , cooperation , the ten hour movement , and the beginnings of modern union - ism .

		Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	proceeds in logical order from local trade unions to local trade assemblies and then to national unionism and national labor politics .

		Mr.
Perlman	PERSON	arranges , mainly on the chronological principles , a multitude of things from
Greenbackism	LOCATION	,
Kearneyism	PERSON	, and Socialism to the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, closing the intensive narrative approximately at
1898	DATE	.

		The emphasis throughout is mainly on labor conditions , labor philosophies , and labor move - ments to use the language of Mr.
Commons	PERSON	.

		Of these three aspects , the first is treated with the least system .

		That is , the authors do not pretend to amass the available statistical ma - terials on wages and prices , or the documents , narratives , and laws which give us our best in - sight into the actual conditions of labor at the several periods covered by the history .

		They content themselves with an occasional and un - pretentious excursus on hours of labor , wages , and economic distress .

		Their main interest is in the rise and growth of labor organizations and in the changing political interests and economical policies of labor .

		Their chief documentary sources are the labor newspapers , pamphlets , and convention proceedings .

		Their method of treat - ment is objective , fair , scholarly .

		That they have laid all students of American history and all economists under a heavy debt will be the ver - dict of even the most critical reviewer .

		Indeed , the work is a monumental installment of that growing literature which in due time will be made the basis for the reconstruction of Amer - can history .

		Nevertheless many things are left out that seem to belong properly to a work of this sort .

		For example , one looks in vain in Mr.
Saposs	PERSON	's pages on `` Colonial Beginnings '' for a treatment of the nature and sources of labor immigration into the colonies , the extent and character of in - dentured servitude , the kidnaping and trans - portation of mechanics , the judicial condemna - tion of accused felons to labor in
America	LOCATION	, the cruel labor legislation of colonial assemblies , and 64 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 18	DATE	the part of the mechanics in the American revo - lution -LRB- see the writings of Becker and
Schles	PERSON	- inger -RRB- .

		Of course it is easy to criticize an au - thor for what he does not pretend to do , but surely any work that bears the title which Pro- fessor Commons has chosen should not omit such fundamental topics as those just enumerated .

		No amount of ingenious Marxian speculation can make up for such oversight .

		Moreover it is ` difficult to be content with the meager treatment that is given to the history of labor during the
last quarter	DATE	of a century .

		We expect the lazy historian to escape his responsibility for telling us about our own age by flinging out a paltry phrase to the effect that it is impossible for us to know anything about the people whom we have seen face to face ; but frankly we did not expect that a trained and learned economist would neglect our own decade and offer as an apparent justification the plea that the facts of the labor movement since
1898	DATE	`` are so recent that they belong to a discussion of current problems rather than to a record of History '' -LRB- II , page 521 -RRB- .

		Have we not the same documentary materials for this period that were used for the entire his - tory ; namely , the labor newspapers , pamphlets , and convention proceedings ?

		Why are not Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	's activities in the political campaigns of
1908	DATE	and
1912	DATE	as much a part of the history of labor as Mr.
Debs	PERSON	's experience with the injunc - tion at
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		A few years ago the historians were insisting that we could not know any his - tory since
1815	DATE	, that every book pertaining to a later age was mere journalism .

		They have at last been utterly routed , and it is therefore espe - cially distressing to find economists falling into the error that we can not write the history of our own decades because forsooth it is not history at all .

		Furthermore there are matters of perspec - tive which may properly be raised .

		Why should
George Henry Evans	PERSON	have ten pages and the relations of the Socialists and labor organizations between
1888	DATE	and
1896	DATE	only six pages ?

		Why should the great strike of
1877	DATE	receive a fuller treatment than Socialist policy with regard to the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	?

		All of these faults , if they are faults , are how - ever so slight in comparison to the great service rendered by the publication of this history of labor that it would be an ungenerous critic who would long dwell upon them .

		To do so would be like saying to a miner who has found a rich vein , `` Ah , your shaft is not straight and your engine house needs painting . ''

		* In so far as
America	LOCATION	has produced works of permanent value in poetry it has been in one of two extremes , which are best exemplified , on the one hand , in the boisterous sublimity of Whit - man and , on the other , in the exquisite avolations of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The former absorbed life with passion - ate impartiality ; the latter subtilized it in an atmosphere of dream .

		Our prose writers too , though they never attain the magnificent ampli - tude of a Whitman , show the same tendency toward an almost violent acceptation of fact ; or else , like
Henry James	PERSON	, they win their way to over-exquisite elaboration .

		There seems to be something in the shapeless intensity of our life that makes it impossible for a sensitive person to react to it without losing , in one way or another , his sense of values .

		We either gorge ourselves on actuality or turn from the table to seek Elysian fare .

		What I have said of American literature is to a certain extent true also of American painting , though in this field we find a few distinguished intermediate types , such as
George Inness	PERSON	, who assimilated just that modicum of European cul - ture which he could make his own .

		Far more .

		exponential of American character however is
Winslow Homer	PERSON	, who , as realistic as
Courbet	ORGANIZATION	, was even more drastic in his vision and more masterful with his brush .

		Like Whitman , he was wholly self-developed and always self - reliant , and sometimes crude in his expression ; but he attained a greater selective ability than the poet , he saw more deeply and interpreted more adequately the tragedy in things , and in his later works his intrepid attack exposes the ulti - mate significance of the object .

		The merely skilful painters of the sea Mr.
Waugh	PERSON	, for in - stance flatter the eye with surface patterns of foam on crystal greens ; but for Homer the foam had just the same subsidiary meaning that it has for Ocean itself , and his eye sought and his hand rendered the tidal volumes of water , the sinewed ponderosity of the sea .

		The reaction in the direction of the exquisite is most clearly seen in
Whistler	LOCATION	, in his whim - sicality , his preciosity , his anxiety to be forever refined .

		.

		Into these qualities * he injected a goodly dosage of American bluff .

		His celebrated theo -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 65 ries were manufactured to fit his work , to cover its defects and emphasize its merits .

		A master decorator , he almost constantly lauded the deco - rative features of painting ; and because he was never able to draw with a firm and confident line , he employed -LRB- and of course theorized about -RRB- a method which allowed him to make outlines recede or utterly vanish under the beau - tiful tones of his palette .

		In looking at his pictures and in reading the various biographies of the man , one can not help feeling that a deal of his life crept into his work to its detriment , that something of the finical aesthete is apparent in the deliberate arrange - ments , and that to use his own words he failed to `` efface the footsteps of work . ''

		His color is usually beautiful ; his patterns , always ; and some - times , though rarely , he forgets his affectations and paints simply and satisfyingly , as in the `` Little Rose of Lyme Regis . ''

		But it is probable that he will come to be remembered chiefly for his etchings , lithographs , and pastels .

		He could catch , as perhaps no other artist has caught on copper or stone , the breathless beauties of a mo - ment ; and whether his pictures are full of detail or suggest large spaces with the slightest means , they show him always the born engraver sensitive to the limits , as well as to the possibilities , of his medium .

		Most of his biographers have been so partisan that their books have little or no value except for the lover of anecdotes .

		The expression of his spleen , even when it was mere impertinence , has seemed to them the very acme of wit ; and old truths arrayed in paradox have passed for pro- found discoveries .

		Even his writings , with their amateurish alliterations and needless emphasis , have been praised as literature .

		His latest biographer however falls into none of these er - rors .

		Mr.
Duret	PERSON	's `` Whistler '' is nicely bal - anced , adequate , dignified .

		Yet , reading it , one feels that the author belongs essentially to an age that has passed .

		How strange , for instance , does it seem now to hear that with
Whistler	LOCATION	's nocturnes `` painting was carried to its last de - gree of abstraction '' !

		To paint , in the quoted words of
Gustave Geffroy	PERSON	, `` the prodigious por - trait of obscurity , '' is surely not to make an ab - straction ; nor is abstraction obtained , as Mr.
Duret	PERSON	suggests , by leaving `` the motive undeter - mined under a general envelope of atmosphere . ''

		On the contrary , those artists who have come nearest to rendering the abstract have used clear , bold , emphatic line .

		Exception must be taken also to the theory of criticism underlying Mr.
Duret	PERSON	's book , though , to be sure , the same theory underlies almost all so-called criticism of art .

		He speaks of `` a beauty , a charm of color , precious of itself and distinct from the subject '' ; and again , of `` ap - plying his color combinations to definite sub - jects . ''

		Like so many other critics , Mr.
Duret	PERSON	finds it pleasantly easy to analyze a picture and then try to put together the component parts , instead of reliving the experience of the artist and then giving it creative utterance in the me - dium of criticism .

		In a work of art nothing is distinct from the subject : color , drawing , com - position , what-not are all , in the finished picture , indistinguishable from the expression of the whole idea ; and the artist is not , to quote Mr.
Duret	PERSON	again , concerned with `` the beauty of drawing and brushwork apart from the subject represented . ''

		Another and very different type of American is illustrated in the `` Life , Art , and Letters of
George Inness	PERSON	, '' by his son .

		In him we see an absolutely sincere man , impatient of foibles , striving impetuously , reaching with boundless self-confidence after the highest that his mind can conceive , and yet conscious , painfully , of the limitations of his medium and of himself .

		`` Oh , to paint a picture , a sunset , without paint !

		To create without paint ! ''

		he exclaims .

		`` When I 've painted one picture that 's a true expression , I shall be ready to go . ''

		Fortunately that `` one picture '' was painted more than once .

		It was
Inness	PERSON	's distinction that the intensity of his feeling and his imagination enabled him , at his best , to re-create , not a scene only , but a sea - son in a scene as , for instance , in his `` Indian Summer '' or , even more notably , in the `` Autumn Oaks . ''

		Before nature he could make only studies ; or if he attempted to paint in presence of the actual landscape , he would change his pic - ture with each fluctuating hour and eventually , having passed from one motive to another , find for all his labor but an incoherent mass of paint .

		Afterwards , however , the sap of the scene would move within him , exfoliate the non-essential , and bourgeoning rapidly , bring forth the finished fruit .

		The picture then , however powerful the color , would be tonal , since the various elements had already been fused through memory and imagination .

		At such times he would care nothing for method ; he would paint directly , glaze , or paint over the glaze in an effort to reproduce exactly 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	what he saw in his mind .

		Unhappily , his sensi - tiveness was even more acute than his vision ; and he was therefore seldom satisfied for long with what he had accomplished .

		In a picture which he had called , but a day before , his masterpiece he would suddenly find a new inspiration , and then nothing and no one could prevent him from painting over it again and again regardless , by the way , of whether or not it had already been sold .

		This passion for perfection frequently led simply to incoherence ; and many a noble land - scape was spoiled by his restless search for the unattainable .

		His son 's criticism of his work is , naturally enough , often over-lavish in undiscriminating praise ; and the book is marred by some quite irrelevant efforts to be humorous at the expense of contemporary painters , by some inexcusable typographical errors , and by a verbose introduc - tion by Mr.
Elliot Daingerfield	PERSON	.

		Yet taken as a whole it is one of the most fascinating biogra - phies one may read .

		The numerous anecdotes are all illuminative of character , and there is such pleasant intimacy in the narration that one gets a fuller and more distinct impression of a great artist and a great man than may be ob - tained from any other biography of an American painter .

		Inness , as I have pointed out , was conversant with European art ; and what he took from Con - stable and the Barbizon painters was thoroughly assimilated and used advantageously .

		On the other hand ,
William Merritt Chase	PERSON	, with far wider knowledge and more natural facility as a painter , was able to become only the typical representative of the academic ideal , a master of mediocrity .

		The number of influences Ger - man , Spanish , French , Japanese , what-not gave to his work a certain cosmopolitan appearance dearly loved by those Americans who have visited foreign galleries , but they could not give to it the one thing that makes aft of real importance in the life of man , the expression of a great per - sonality greatly in contact with the world about him .

		Many an American wall is pleasanter for the average beholder because of a Chase that hangs upon it ; but those who exact of art some - thing more vital than pretty color prettily ar - ranged with facile brush will prefer the bare spaces of an empty room .

		The `` Life and Art of
William Merritt Chase	PERSON	, '' by Miss Roof , is interesting mainly be - cause of its description of such art circles as there were in
New York	LOCATION	in the seventies and eighties .

		Rather dull and faded they seem today , with their self-conscious effort to be Bohemian without ceasing to be respectable .

		That they were wholly successful at least in the latter half of their effort the author assures us ; and we are content to take her word that `` though some of the artists frequented a saloon , it had a different sort of patronage from the present-day
New York	LOCATION	barroom , '' and that in those halcyon times `` the kind of Bohemianism now characteristic of certain art circles happily did not exist . ''

		The influence of Chase on American art has never been really important , though his influ - ence on American painting is still to be perceived in the academies .

		The influence of
Inness	PERSON	was valuable in helping to free the younger artists from the now notoriously vapid
Hudson River	LOCATION	school , but is today apparent only in mediocre sellers of canvas .

		The influence of
Whistler	LOCATION	dwindled rapidly , and not one painter of distinc - tion traces directly to him .

		On the other hand , the spirit of
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	is still visible in our many sturdy realists .

		Though none of them has approached the tragic austerity and finality of his marines , many of them see with an equally unflinching eye and paint with a similar breadth .

		The most significant painting in
America	LOCATION	, as elsewhere , has today passed beyond realism .

		What it may attain is perhaps best seen in the later works of
Arthur B. Davies	PERSON	.

		Exquisite , but never finical , a dreamer rendering perfectly his treasurable dreams , he painted for twenty years or so , with profound knowledge , in singing line and modulated color , a personal vision of life as it revealed itself in the fairy land of his imagination .

		But today he no longer withdraws into himself ; and if he now departs from actu - ality as men see it , he does so not because the forms of his imagining are lovelier than those of nature , but because he has seen and abstracted the meaning of forms and must remain faithful to that meaning rather than to mere outward semblances .

		In the result we find something different from idealism , something far higher than realism : we have sublimation through imaginative understanding .

		Out of so intense an attitude and in such strong adherence to the truth is the greatest art revealed .

		THE POLITICAL CONDITIONS OF ALLIED SUCCESS : A Plea for the
Protective Union	ORGANIZATION	of the Democra - cies .

		By
Norman Angell	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Never has the need for a liberal American in - ternational policy been greater , and never has a certain section of our public temper been more hostile to it .

		Never have sane counsel and mod - eration in the conduct of our foreign relations been more imperative , and never in our history have our organized press and public opinion been so intolerant and credulous and instinctive as to - day , when of all times we can least afford to let our emotions rule our judgment .

		Just how this state of affairs could paradoxically coexist with an executive head like President
Wilson	PERSON	, ad - mittedly the most liberal of all the statesmen now controlling the destinies of nations , would not really be a difficult question to answer .

		Briefly , we have failed to learn from the three years ' war experience either of our Allies or of our enemy .

		\ Ye are going through almost the same experience of nationalistic myopia only on a somewhat more hysterical level which the other belligerent nations went through the first eighteen months of the war , complicated by the fact that except for
Austria	LOCATION	and perhaps
Russia	LOCATION	we are far less homogeneous than any other of the major nations at war and our morbid fear of domestic disintegration -LRB- not at all justified by the facts , of course -RRB- leads us to extremes of re - pression .

		Because we are panicky about sedition and because our Opposition has heretofore been on merely factitious political grounds rather than on vital economic and social grounds , minority opinion has well-nigh ceased to function .

		All this is a commonplace of liberal discussion in
America	LOCATION	today .

		But it is a commonplace which both the authors of these books have wisely ignored .

		Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	, an
American	ORGANIZATION	, has ignored it because for all his scholarship and brilliance , his sure democratic instinct , his ability to expose only the salient facts and statistics with a grace that gives light and air to a really massive intel - lectual structure , he is nevertheless extraordi - narily naive in the best sense naive , that is , in being unflinching before the truth as he sees it , without `` pragmatic '' preoccupations as to how it can be deflected to immediate ends .

		For I suppose it is naive not to assume a reading pub - lic in conceptual swaddling clothes , not to regard it as recalcitrant chaos with a few stirs of intelli - gence to be led gently from the lower political truths to the higher , most naive of all actually to treat it as a democratic intellectual equal .

		But it is also refreshing , and it requires a certain intriguing audacity .

		`` The End of the War '' is the most courageous book on politics published in
America	LOCATION	since the war began , largely , I be - lieve , because Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	completely ignored the prevalent temper of public opinion .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	, an Englishman , also ignored it in his book .

		He , too , appeals straight over the head of the ranters and howling dervishes to the sober second thought of
America	LOCATION	.

		His reasons , naturally , are slightly different .

		As an Englishman with a desire to explain the need for his programme of political coordination among all the Allies , it would hardly be tactful and certainly not advantageous to call too sharp attention to those very tendencies in our present political life which are likely to make his proposals nugatory .

		He is aware of them no one better but his task is more specifically one of persuasion than is Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	's expository comment .

		And he has accomplished it with con - summate skill and genuine eloquence .

		His wit and lucidity are unequaled .

		Together , these two books make the most impressive explanation of the war 's real meaning , and the most provocative and the soundest appeal for that kind of political common sense which will speedily accomplish our democratic purposes in brief , the most indis - pensable books on the war that American pub - lishers have yet given us .

		The force of superla - tives has been largely lost
today	DATE	because of their abuse ; here for once they are merited .

		These books not only reveal our great chance for a democratic , international victory in the present situation ; they point the way unerringly to its achievement .

		For the quarrel between those who advocate mere violent military coercion over
Germany	LOCATION	and those who advocate the employment of moral advantages as well is , as Mr.
Angell	PERSON	has so acutely pointed out , not a genuinely basic quarrel between opposite points of view .

		It arises from the failure to see a vital , yet easily ignored , distinction the distinction be - tween what is indispensable and what is sufficient .

		If a man is to lead a happy life , it is indispensable that he should have food and clothes , but it is not sufficient .

		If we are to have a better interna - tional organization than existed in
1914	DATE	, it is in - dispensable that there should be a defeat of Ger - many , but it is not sufficient .

		Victory alone will not bring us what the common man is fighting 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	for ; namely , that kind of a world in which wars like the present can not occur again .

		It is not victory so much as the right use of victory after it is attained that counts .

		Plenty of wars have been won on the field of battle only to be lost at the peace table .

		Armies , after all , can merely furnish certain opportunities for the exercise of policy ; if that policy is halting and uncertain , military success can not of itself guarantee us the accomplishment of our purposes .

		So obvious is this that Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	does not hesitate to imply in one passage that , provided there is an agreement among belligerents on a policy honestly looking towards a new international order , a military victory is of itself irrelevant .

		For the one kind of `` compromise peace '' to which democrats can subscribe is that peace in which there is no com - promise of principle .

		And Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	says bluntly : `` The claim is made that the policy of reconciliation has failed .

		But , in truth , it has not failed ; it has not been tried . ''

		Had the na - ture of the Austrian peace proposals of
1917	DATE	been more fully revealed when he wrote his book , he very probably would have cited this as an ex - ample where disunity among the Allies added immeasurably to the unity and morale of the .

		enemy .

		In both the books there is constant emphasis on this disunity among the Allies , this lack of a common political front , just as there was a lack of a common military front until the pressure of the German drive this
spring	DATE	.

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	cites it with irresistible logic to prove its disintegra - tive effect upon our own alliance painfully evi - dent last year , of course , in the defection of Rus - sia and the Italian debacle and its unifying ef - fect upon the enemy .

		Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	cites it rather in a recapitulation of the four great diplomatic mistakes of last year : first , our failure to demand a common democratic minimum of war aims from the Allies before entering the war on their side ; second , the common failure of us all to under - stand the Russian Revolution and thus hold it faithful to us ; third , the lost opportunity to use the Reichstag resolution of
last July	DATE	as a club over the reactionary elements in
Germany	LOCATION	; fourth , the complete lack of insight concerning the moral value to the enemy of refusing to par - ticipate in the
Stockholm	LOCATION	conference .

		Time after time our conventional diplomacy has strength - ened the worst elements of the enemy .

		It is too naive to ask : `` But has President
Wilson	PERSON	's un - conventional diplomacy done any better ?

		Has he not tried all this , seen its futility , and been forced to declare , as less intelligent statesmen always do , that there is no realistic policy except that of crushing
Germany	LOCATION	? ''

		It is not that President
Wilson	PERSON	's diplomacy is futile , but that it is not accepted by all the Allies in the same sense .

		For that acceptance , for that integration of our war aims into a common political front , both authors plead .

		Certainly no half-truth could be more dangerous than the statement that this unity exists today .

		That we are all fight - ing
Germany	LOCATION	at the same time does not neces - sarily mean that we are all fighting her for the same ends .

		Have we a common policy about
Russia	LOCATION	?

		Do we advocate a federated
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	under international guarantees , or the creation of several new nationalistic and self - conscious political units ?

		Do we yet know what our plans are about the African colonies ?

		Are we or are we not prepared to tell the German people that if they revolt and overthrow their present government we shall be glad to treat with them irrespective of the military situation ?

		Do we or do we not believe in a League of Na - tions ?

		If so , is it to be merely a discriminatory league against
Germany	LOCATION	, or is
Germany	LOCATION	to be in - cluded in it ?

		Are we prepared to surrender part of our national sovereignty and accept decisions from an international commission ?

		What shall we do about the allocation of foodstuffs and raw materials in the coming world shortage ?

		When we say we believe in a `` peace between peoples '' instead of a `` peace between governments '' are we prepared to follow that statement up in actual practice and insist that peace shall be discussed , signed , and concluded by representatives elected from the people as well as by diplomats ?

		There is no definite common answer to any of these questions ; both authors stress the danger of going into the peace conference unprepared to answer them .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	puts it this way : Assume that we obtain complete military victory over the Teutonic Powers , but that at the time of com - ing to the
Peace Table	ORGANIZATION	the future foreign policy of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Roumania	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, is all uncertain as it is likely to be so that the future action of any or all is not clearly predetermined but guided by interests dictated by the circumstances of particular international situations as they arise .

		If that is the condition of chaos in in - ternational policies -LRB- as it has been for generations -RRB- ; if there are no general fundamental principles to which states and peoples are pledged , and in which they have come really to believe , as they now believe in their separate `` national destinies '' ; if their com -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 69 mon interest is obscured by secret bargaining and de - liberately nursed national rivalries why ,
Prussia	LOCATION	will realize , as she has realized in the past , that a mili - tary decision in
Europe	LOCATION	is not a permanent decision , since the forces that have carried it into effect are bound sooner or later to split , to `` cancel out '' their power by internecine conflict , and so once more give her an opportunity of profiting by the division of her enemies .

		Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	presents a picture of how the same thing may actually come to pass : Though it is not wise to borrow trouble , it would be folly to disregard possible and not wholly improb - able contingencies , which , if they occur , may rob the peoples of all direct benefit from their sacrifices .

		When we remember how treaties have been made be - fore and when we regard the types of men who are interested in making the same kind of treaty today , it ceases to appear impossible that the stately peace congress may prove to be a farte .

		The representa - tives of three or four strong nations may meet in secret conference and agree upon the essentials ol peace while the delegates are noisily discussing unim - portant questions .

		At the open sessions we may listen to an interminable wrangling over minor details , such as whether the Italian boundary shall run two miles to the east or west of a certain point , or a certain rocky isle shall belong to
Austria	LOCATION	or to
Greece	LOCATION	.

		We may hear inconsequent discussions , frivolous claims , and trivial counterclaims , while the real work of dividing up the world is carried on by unseen gen - tlemen in a quiet room , with telephonic connections with their capitals .

		Under such an arrangement the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	would have the speeches and the fireworks while the manipulators would gain the tangible bene - fits .

		Those familiar with the method in which our American presidential nominating conventions were once handled will easily grasp the significance of a like control of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a discouraging picture , but it is what is only too likely to come to pass unless we strive now to prevent it .

		For given a real political unity of purpose among the Allies , a democratic victory can not be denied us , whatever may be the temporary military situation .

		We hold hos - tages of fate over
Germany	LOCATION	's industrial and com - mercial future .

		She can not trade , she can not grow literally , she can not live without us .

		Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	is too discouraged at the present weakness of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		If
Russia	LOCATION	were articulate she might say , in the words of
Joubert	PERSON	, '' In the strength of many there is weakness , whereas in my weakness there is strength ; the weakness is in the instru - ment . ''

		Coercion of
Russia	LOCATION	has historically been the sure forerunner of defeat .

		Already Ger - many has created for herself in the
Ukraine	LOCATION	, in
Roumania	LOCATION	, in
Finland	LOCATION	, and in the Baltic prov - inces a fund of hatred which , if we do not divert it to ourselves by blundering diplomacy -LRB- and it is in his policy this year towards
Russia	LOCATION	that President
Wilson	PERSON	has shown his greatest wisdom and courage -RRB- , will inevitably prove
Germany	LOCATION	's undoing .

		If we really want a democratic peace , we have nothing to fear .

		In that sense certainly Lord Lansdowne was right when he said , `` We are not going to lose this war . ''

		But we have got honestly to face the implications of a demo ` cratic peace .

		We have got to realize that as in do - mestic politics the executive can not legislate of himself -LRB- laws must be passed only where the minority opinion is allowed its expression -RRB- , so in framing the rules of that reign of law which President
Wilson	PERSON	told us on
July 4	DATE	is our funda - mental object , we can not permit merely the executives that is governments -LRB- mere tem - porary majorities , and in war time often not even that -RRB- to frame the rules for any
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The democratically chosen repre - sentatives of all the peoples at war must have their voice in it if it is to endure .

		Which means , frankly , that we have got to recognize that nationalism is moribund ; that the important alignment is not between nations but between economic and social classes ; that the real danger is the danger of a peace concluded on solely nationalistic grounds , when it ought to be con - cluded between peoples on internationally demo - cratic grounds just as at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	the seeds of this war were laid when the peace there was concluded on dynastic grounds at a time when the rising force in
Europe	LOCATION	was na - tionalistic feeling .

		Shall history repeat itself ?

		It is for
America	LOCATION	to say .

		The European nations are exhausted and cynical ; they will believe in a community of peoples when they see it , not be - fore .

		It is our privilege and our great oppor - tunity to make that community a reality our chance and our duty .

		We may not do it .

		The cynics and skeptics and reactionaries may ulti - mately capture our foreign policy .

		We too may fail .

		We too may ignore the plain challenge of these wisest of books .

		Yet if we do , we ought to realize the grim alternative before us .

		Either we shall get a more decent system of interna - tional relations than existed in
1914	DATE	, or we shall witness the collapse of all freedom and tolerable living in
Western	LOCATION	civilization .

		Either we shall get some
League of Nations and Peoples	ORGANIZATION	under which we can all live with at least a measure of security , or we shall get an era of irresponsible and unscrupulous bureaucracy , tempered only by anarchy and assassination .

		Ideas are like germs : their dissemination is rapid and uncontrollable , and to stamp them out is always difficult , sometimes almost impossible .

		Moreover their vigor is frequently out of all pro- portion to their value .

		Popularity may not neces - sarily brand an idea as worthless , but there is some reason for regarding such an idea with sus - picion .

		It is fruitful to examine in this light the long since tacitly accepted or implied idea that narrative poetry has outlived its usefulness and that the lyric method has properly superseded it .

		Since the time of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	and the Elizabethans there has been , needless to say , a good deal of narrative poetry one thinks of
Keats	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Morris	PERSON	but neverthe - less in the long interval between the middle of the seventeenth century and the present it is fairly obvious that the focus of popular regard has shifted steadily away from narrative verse and towards the lyric .

		Is mental laziness the cause of this ?

		One is told that it is too much trouble to read a long poem .

		It is presumably for this reason that
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	are popularly far more widely known for their lyrics than for their more important work .

		As concerns the relative merits of the two forms the argument is not conclusive .

		The lyric began its career , perhaps , as a lyric movement , or interlude , in a longer work .

		Un - der the impression , partly correct , that the lyric was , after all , the quintessence of the affair , it was then isolated and made to stand alone .

		Up to a certain point its justification was its com - pleteness and perfection as an expression of emo - tion at a moment of intensity .

		But as a substi - tute for all that goes to the creation of narrative poetry its test is severer , for if it is entirely to supersede the narrative or dramatic poem it must usurp , and adequately , the functions of that form .

		And in this regard it may pertinently be asked whether since the days of the Elizabethans the lyric has developed very far .

		In fact it would be no very grave exaggera - tion to say that the lyric method as we have it today is in all fundamental respects of practice the same that we have had since the beginning .

		The conception of what it is that constitutes the lyric scope has , if anything , petrified .

		This is particularly true of the nineteenth century , when despite a rather remarkable development of lyric poetry on its technical side all the way from
Keats	PERSON	to Swinburne the conception of the lyric as a medium for interpretation did not so much broaden as narrow .

		Did
Swinburne	PERSON	really add anything -LRB- not , it is meant , to English poetry to that of course he did richly add but to poetic method -RRB- beyond a perfection of rhetorical im - petus , a sensuous timbre of voice ?

		Did
Tenny	PERSON	- son do more than reset the poetic material of the past to a more skilful , if somewhat too lulling , accompaniment of sound ?

		.

		.

		For any pioneer - ing in the nineteenth century one must turn to
Poe	PERSON	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
James Thomson	PERSON	-LRB- `` B. V. '' -RRB- ,
Meredith	PERSON	; and of these the influ - ence has been small , particularly in
America	LOCATION	, and when felt , felt unintelligently .

		The popular de - mand has been great , as always , for the simplest form of subjective lyric , for the I-love-you , I - am-happy , I-am-sad , I-am-astonished-at-a-rose type of lyric , prettily patterned and naive with a sweet sententiousness .

		And the supply has been , and still is , all too lamentably adequate to the demand .

		It is to this situation that we largely owe the recent renewal of energy in poetry , signalized in
England	LOCATION	by the appearance of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's and Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's poetic narratives , and by the work of the Georgian poets ; in
America	LOCATION	, by the issuance of `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' `` Spoon River Anthology , '' and the anthologies of the Others and Imagist groups .

		Two sorts of work are here represented ; the dichotomy is obvious , but the initial impulse , the discontent with a lyric method which had become practically vestigial , is the same .

		Messrs.
Frost	PERSON	,
Gibson	PERSON	,
Masefield	PERSON	, and Masters seek renewal in the broad and rich ex - panses of realistic and psychological narrative : the lyric poets have sought to refine on sensory perception and delicacy of form .

		The work of such poets as Mr.
Lascelles Abercrombie	PERSON	and Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	falls between and partakes of the characteristics of both .

		The group of books at present under review illustrates admirably this tendency , without how - ever fulfilling very much of its promise .

		Mr.
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL ,
Masefield	PERSON	's new narrative poem , `` Rosas , '' is a disappointing performance , quite the poorest of his narratives .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	has always been dubiously skilful at portraiture ; and
Rosas	PERSON	, a South American outlaw who becomes a cruel dictator , seems hardly to have aroused in his chronicler that minimum of dramatic sympathy without which a portrait is lifeless and unreal .

		Is Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	on the borderline between manner and mannerism ?

		It is a danger for him to guard against .

		His rhetorical tricks are here , his tricks of sentiment too not so overworked as in `` The Daffodil Fields '' to be sure ; but if `` Rosas '' avoids the downright pathos of the mur - der scene in `` The Daffodil Fields , '' it also fails to manifest even fragmentarily the psychological intensity and sensory richness of that poem .

		The verse is fluent but colorless ; the narrative is epi - sodic , bare , and ill unified .

		In short , we read the poem with very little conviction .

		Most artists make sometimes the mistake of choosing themes unsuited to them , and it looks as if `` Rosas '' were the result of such an error .

		One merely records one 's gratitude that Mr.
Mase	PERSON	- field has not yet abandoned narrative poetry .

		Something of the narrative spirit also infuses the work of Mr. -
Robert Nichols	PERSON	, although in the main it purports to be lyric .

		`` Ardours and En - durances , '' indeed , is one of the most remarkable of recent first books of verse perhaps the most remarkable since `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	is young , and one can hardly prophesy of him .

		At present his style is a rather intri - guing blend of Miltonic and new-Georgian strains .

		The shorter war poems are vigorous , blunt , and genuine ; and the `` Faun 's Holiday , '' the longest and finest thing in the book , though it is studiously and enthusiastically in the vein of `` L'Allegro , '' can quite well stand comparison with it .

		One can think of no poet in a decade or so who has come upon us with so richly pre - pared a sensibility , who takes such a gusto in sensation , or who writes of it with such brio .

		At this stage in his development a poet may be said hardly to need a theme : anything is an ex - cuse for writing , and with enthusiasm .

		Whether Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	will develop on the intellectual side and use his instinct for word-magic and sound - magic in the articulation of new tracts of con - sciousness -LRB- and that might be considered a defi - nition of the true poet -RRB- remains to be seen .

		Of the remaining volumes , `` Eidola , '' by
Frederic Manning	PERSON	, is the only one which shows any attempt to change the lyric method , and in his case it is not so much by addition as by re - finement .

		It can not be said however to be very remarkable .

		The work suggests that of Mr.
Aldington	PERSON	, but is more jejunely precise and very much less vivid ... Mr.
Carlin	PERSON	is the latest addition to the American Celtic school ; he writes with a considerable , though somewhat pattern - ish and time-abraded , charm ... Mr.
James Joyce	PERSON	's `` Chamber Music '' is a small book of love-songs singularly unlike his later prose works and rather Elizabethan in quality .

		Neither this nor Mr.
Carlin	PERSON	's book makes any attempt to change the lyric tradition .

		Nor , of course , does one look for any such thing in the `` Posthumous Poems '' of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, which are very much the fragramentary and neutral sort of affair one ex - pected them to be .

		Will no one ever have the courage to burn a poet 's leftovers ?

		If one finds , therefore , indications of change in the work of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	, and Mr.
Manning	PERSON	, one can not say that in any of these cases it has yet gone very far .

		They serve chiefly to bring well before us the question whether we are to have a revival of narrative poetry perhaps more psychological than Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's or a new orientation of the lyric .

		Whether or not narrative poetry is doomed to decay , we must hope for two sorts of develop - ment in the lyric .

		In one direction we should get the sort of thing Mr.
Maxwell Bodenheim	PERSON	, Mr.
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	, and Mr.
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	tentatively indicate for us , a kind of superficially detached colorism , or what cor - responds to absolute music ; and in the other di - rection we should get a development of the dra - matic lyric , the lyric presenting an emotion not singly but in its matrix , beginning with the sit - uation which gives rise to it and concluding with the situation to which it has led .

		Indications of this method are to be found in the work of Mr.
Masters	PERSON	, Mr.
Frost	PERSON	, and Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	... If the lyric is to compete with narrative poetry , or to supplant it , it must certainly develop in the latter of these two manners .

		If it is merely to evolve further on its own base and it is hard to see any excuse for its continuance as a mere bonbon for the lazy-mindedly sentimental it must choose the former .

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 18	DATE	Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	Is Disturbed THE PRETTY LADY .

		By
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.


Arnold Bennett	PERSON	is the last man one would expect to find corroded with a nervous cynicism .

		The inexhaustible master of invention , of the imperturbable flow of healthy spirits , should have been encased against any fraying of the feelings or cosmic doubts .

		His articles on the war seem to have been fairly blithe in tone .

		There was nothing in them to show that he was gravely dis - turbed by events , or that he was not still the same Mr.
Britling	PERSON	of the Five Towns that he has always been , living comfortably on twenty-four hours a day , and convincing us by his competent , buoyant style that the heart and nervous system of
Britain	LOCATION	are still sound .

		But when he turns to an artistic representa - tion of war-time
London	LOCATION	, something less con - scious and determined within him seems to speak and to express a war-weariness which his in - tellectual censor would have suppressed .

		A story , therefore , which seems at first glance a puzzling and casual fragment , comes to appear a revela - tion of a profound attitude towards the present state of the world .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's nerves , as well as his eyes , are at work , and this picture of frayed nerves which he presents comes from a deeply disturbed , though perhaps semi-conscious , state of his own soul .

		The story moves around the persistent figure of
Christine	PERSON	, `` the pretty lady , '' who has learned her profession from her Parisian mother with almost religious conscientiousness .

		Her painful life in
Ostend	LOCATION	with a rich American , and her mad refugee flight to
England	LOCATION	, have not dislodged the calm direction of her soul .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	dilates almost lovingly on the taste of her
London	LOCATION	flat , her kimonos , her musical sensitiveness .

		As the war goes on , throwing
London	LOCATION	into a moral chaos , filling the young women of position and official virtue such as Lady Queenie with a wild dark force of destruction ,
Christine	PERSON	, soft-fleshed and single-minded , lives straight on below the battle , wrapped in her eternal role , concerned only with her flat , her men , her slowly augmenting munici - pal bonds .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's ironic point seems to be that in a war-shattered world this patient so - briety of sensuality is a good , is perhaps the one permanence , the one eternal value left .

		Against this demi-mondaine , the people of the acceptable world loom sinister and detestable : Lady
Queenie	PERSON	, vibrant and perverse , dancing -LRB- in one of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's most brilliant chapters -RRB- to the whir of Zeppelins on a
London	LOCATION	roof , only so to be casually slain ;
G. J. Hoape	PERSON	, the middle-aged bachelor , who plays his Bach fugue before break - fast in his exquisite rooms and goes out dutifully to serve on war committees ; the beautiful Con - cepcion , who loses her newly married husband and who flunks her welfare work in the munition factory .

		It is
Christine	PERSON	's lover that Mr.
Hoape	PERSON	becomes her major but , to his annoyance , not exclusive lover while Lady Queenie and Con - cepcion restlessly try to throw silken chains around him .

		These people drag through the book the cur - rent activities of the smart and important people of their class the myriad interests of `` war work '' busy , fuming .

		Yet through this dreary trail is the note of hopeless futility .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	makes them no less blighted in their serious effort than in their play .

		That bright , smart
London	LOCATION	society of before the war , so culturally and sexu - ally aware , so feverishly straining to live , is shown not at all redeemed by the new devotion to good works , but only all the more surely fray - ing away into a sort of neurotic ennui .

		The one really moving episode is
Christine	PERSON	's adventure with the drunken soldier .

		As a military figure he is curiously shadowy .

		But his inarticulate need , his forlornness , which is met so unhesita - tingly by
Christine	PERSON	's motherly concern , is intense - ly human .

		She packs him off from her very bed to the front in order to save him from dis - grace .

		In her warmth , and in his deep super - stition which bestows on her his grateful gift of an amulet , we are back again at rich , old , healing human values .

		How conscious Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is of all this I do not know .

		The effect is unmistakable how - ever .

		`` The Pretty Lady '' reads less like a tran - script of reality than like one of those quasi - allegories that one writes when powerful but scarcely realized obsessions are dictating one 's interpretation of intensely emotional experience .

		Doubtless Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	does not mean to satirize the significant classes in
England	LOCATION	at war .

		But his note becomes that of a searing skepticism .

		A society emotionally sick , playing with futilities this is the world of the Hoapes and Queenies and Concepcions and their friends as he pictures it .

		Recurringly he shifts from their jumpy , disintegrating souls to
Christine	PERSON	's soft placidity , to the soldier 's drunken superstition and clinging .

		They are the notes of life in a region of moldy death -

Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		This book did not win one of the
Hart	PERSON	,
Schaff	PERSON	- ner & Marx prizes ; it received honorable men - tion in Class A .

		Yet no disappointment would have been felt if the volume had been given a higher titular rank , for it is an instance of the success of these prizes in calling forth competent economic studies .

		Meat and grain ,
Chicago	LOCATION	's most important food businesses , are not dis - cussed .

		Produce means `` fresh fruit and vege - tables , poultry and eggs , butter and cheese . ''

		The enormous business organization necessary to distribute these foods to

		`` This great system we should neither ignorantly despise nor blindly worship , '' lectures Professor
Nourse	PERSON	; but in spite of an over allowance of such sententious twaddle about how fair-minded he tries to be , he really seems to have a balanced appreciation of the merits and defects of the present marketing sys - tem .

		TALES FROM A FAMISHED LAND .

		By
Ed	PERSON	- ward
Eyre Hunt	PERSON	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This little volume of stories is the work of one who was , until our own entrance into the war choked that really gallant enterprise , with
Hoover	PERSON	in
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		In the preface we are told that `` these tales are not strictly truth , but they are not fiction .

		They are both . ''

		Had not Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	definitely stated this , I fancy we should anyhow have guessed the fact .

		For no one who had not lived in
Belgium	LOCATION	these heartbreaking times and had not experienced the emotions as well as the outward life of that hurdled people could so finely have evoked the spirit of his en - vironment and so obviously have given us the sub - stance of truth .

		Nor is the presence of fiction less patent .

		Such an incident as that narrated in `` Figures of the Dance '' is far too rounded and balanced ever to have happened in this topsy - turvy world ; in `` The Saviour of Mont Cesar , '' the conversation of the vellum-faced monk and the word-spitting German lieutenant is too per - fect a moving-picture scenario to have been picked up whole even in that time and land .

		A charming legend of how one Father Guido came to heaven and to complete faith gives us perhaps a keener pleasure than do most of the more timely narratives , but not more than the story of that old woman who piously tends in her own little garden three graves of German soldiers , praying that `` maybe in
Germany	LOCATION	there is some one who will keep the grave of my boy . ''

		In this tale , as in others , the author makes himself a really too conventionally uncomprehending and enquiring Greek Chorus not to irritate the reader .

		THE LYRICAL POEMS OF HUGO VON HOF - MANNSTHAL .

		Translated from the Ger - man , with an introduction , by
Charles Wharton Stork	ORGANIZATION	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Those who have long known the work of
Hugo von Hofmannsthal	PERSON	, and have admired in him the most distinguished poet of the German language writing in this generation , will nat - urally be intrigued by this translation of his lyric poems .

		Their curiosity , however , as to how much of the original elixir can be transferred to new bottles will perhaps be greater than any hope of testing in their own tongue , or of sharing with friends unversed in the German , those delights which have intoxicated them .

		For this Austrian poet shares with
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	a style which is so elaborately elusive and in which , as is of course the case with all unrealistic writers , the sound is so infinitely more important than the sense , that to translate his verses is clearly a work in which scholarship and even real literary ability can not avail much .

		More than ever will the easy sounding word `` translation '' strike one as ironic when `` re-creation '' is so obviously the task set .

		With some hesitation , therefore , we open this English version by
Charles Wharton Stork	PERSON	.

		Turning to perhaps the most striking stanza of one of
Hofmannsthal	ORGANIZATION	's most powerful poems , we read : From the weariness of forgotten peoples Vainly would I liberate mine eyelids , Or would keep my startled soul at distance From the silent fall of far-off planets .

		and to the closing stanza of another character - istic piece : What boots it much to have seen the while we roam ?

		And yet he sayeth much , who `` Evening '' saith .

		A word whence deep and solemn meanings run Like heavy honey from the hollow comb .

		Mr.
Stork	PERSON	here shows himself to be a poet and not unworthy the high task he has essayed .

		Of course all the verses in this book are not equally well rendered , and to those who know the orig - inal there must often be in these tortured Eng - lish words a ridiculous anticlimax .

		But
Hof	PERSON	- mannsthal himself , like Homer , is not without his bare spots and to even so gifted a translator we must pardon some failures .

		The volume contains an introduction by Mr.
Stork	PERSON	, in which he analyzes
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	and 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	his work .

		With a large part of this analysis one is not able to agree .

		For the chief point which Mr.
Stork	PERSON	makes , and which indeed he recurs to again and again , is that
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	is essen - tially a philosophical poet , indeed primarily a philosopher .

		`` His interest in a given idea , scene , or personality is only for the purpose of arriving at some philosophical conclusion . ''

		Mr.
Stork	PERSON	even goes so far as to deny
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	any emotional intensity whatever .

		This theory would make of our poet a mere retailer of what Mr.
Stork	PERSON	calls `` universal truths , '' a retailer whose talent it is to swathe these nude entities in the flowered damask of sensuous charm .

		All this strikes one as the exact opposite of the case .

		If we find philosophical ideas in
Hofmannsthal	LOCATION	as indeed where do we not find them ?

		we per - ceive that he uses them precisely as he does his dolphins and his Tritons ; that is , as tools with which to get an artistic effect .

		Ideas , as they always should be in art , are a means , not an end .

		If we do not get '' the ring of ordinary human feeling , '' that is because , as
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	him - self said to Mr.
Stork	PERSON	, he writes for those very few whom only the intensely refined can satisfy .

		BEYOND ARCHITECTURE .

		By
A. Kingsley Porter	PERSON	.

		Marshall Jones ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		From his preface it appears that Mr.
Porter	PERSON	regards his book as revolutionary likely to lose for him `` even the shred of an orthodox archi - tectural reputation . ''

		But however devastating his radicalism may appear to the effete and aca - demic East , to Western eyes it looks more like conservatism .

		Yet Mr.
Porter	PERSON	possesses the prime requisite for the writing of pointed and inspiriting criticism , conviction .

		His aesthetic creed is firmly held .

		And it is clear that he has transcended the popular concepts on matters aesthetic , although he still clings to his belief in the efficacy of current art education and in the refining influence of art museums upon the pub - lic taste .

		Art education as practiced at present has no relation to the creation of beauty ; while the more art museums multiply , the louder do they proclaim that art is dead .

		The languid interest of about two per cent , of the population in these matters is not likely to affect the other
ninety-eight per cent	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Porter	PERSON	takes Mr.
Cram	PERSON	more seriously than Mr.
Cram	PERSON	takes him - self , for not to call in question the sincerity of this high priest of the medieval mode it is well known that his sense of humor can always save him in a crisis .

		The
Bryn Athyn	LOCATION	experiment was made possible through the whim of a mil - lionaire , and interesting though it is , it con - tributes nothing to an architecture of democracy .

		It is only in the final paragraph of his final chap - ter that Mr.
Porter	PERSON	strikes the note that we should like to have heard earlier and oftener .

		The war of
1914	DATE	may be the spark which will kindle the art-hating Kultur of the nineteenth cen - tury , but the structure was already doomed .

		There had come a tide in the affairs of men , and waters which had been receding for long centuries had even before the war turned and begun to advance .

		It seems certain that they must continue to rise with ever increasing force until the hated materialism , in - dividualism , and Philistinism of the nineteenth cen - tury are forever washed away by a new art which shall be at once nation-wide and intellectual .

		Mr.
Porter	PERSON	's tempered radicalism is both re - fined and refreshing , but it is too overshadowed by the academic elms .

		He should read Mr.
Louis Sullivan	PERSON	's `` Kindergarten Chats '' if he would know what radicalism in architectural criticism is really like .

		THE HOMELY DIARY OF A DIPLOMAT IN THE EAST , 1897-1899 .

		By
Thomas Skel	PERSON	- ton
Harrison	PERSON	.

		Houghton MifHin ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		During the years 1897-9 Colonel
Thomas S. Harrison	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, occupied the post of
United States Consul General	ORGANIZATION	and Diplomatic Agent in the old Khedivial capital of
Cairo	LOCATION	.

		A diary which he faithfully kept has now been put into print .

		It is discursive as a diary probably has a right to be and it so abounds in details of receptions , dinners , balls , shopping , amateur dramatics , and even donkey-rides , that its title fully merits the adjective `` homely . ''

		In a brief introduction the author shows that he knows something of the vast political and economic prob - lems of modern
Egypt	LOCATION	; but throughout the body of his book he makes no pretense of dealing with these fundamental matters .

		Such slender value as the work possesses arises from the sidelights thrown upon the cosmopolitan life of the non - Egyptian residents of the country , and from the intimate portrayal of the daily existence of an average American diplomatic representative in the
East	LOCATION	.

		One may dip into the book for an hour or two with pleasure , but nobody would want to read it through ; and serious students of Egyptian affairs people who know their Cromer and even their
Sidney Low	PERSON	can afford to pass it by .

		THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY .

		By
Joseph Alexander Leighton	PERSON	.


R. G. Adams & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is difficult to be patient with textbooks in philosophy , twice difficult when the textbooks are for `` beginners , '' thrice difficult when history and `` systematic philosophy '' are combined in one small book ranging in altitude from `` primitive thought '' to `` current issues . ''

		Such a book is
Leighton	PERSON	's compilation of lecture notes , com - posed for classes in the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	and now issued in print thirty chapters in four hundred pages .

		One can understand how such notes came to be written , honest effort at honest instruction .

		One can appreciate their usefulness to the students in the author 's classes , as guides 1918J THE DIAL 75 and crams .

		One may willingly concede that they offer suggestions of value to other teachers of philosophy though it would be an uninspired man , in this field , who could adopt another 's method in toto .

		And yet it requires a saintliness to which philosophy is growing unaccustomed to speak generously of such a book .

		The fault is not
Leighton	PERSON	's , or any other author 's ; it is in the nature of their attempt .

		For of all subjects -LRB- unless poetry be the exception -RRB- philosophy suf - fers most from the dehumanization which text - books inflict .

		The passion of the true lover of philosophy is for living thought , and that means , and can only mean , the very words of those who , in the past , have sought truth and whose seeking has been their tuition of their disciples ; or it must mean a present seeking by present philoso - phers whose own puzzle and eagerness shall set the lesson for their pupils .

		There is something unspeakably dismal which the profane recog - nize with ridicule and the initiate with resent - ment in the spectacle of the dessicated members of philosophic minds which your textbook pre - sents , a bony and rattling jargon , flesh and blood and breath and life long dissolved away .

		And why ?

		Is the method one to make philosophers out of `` beginners , '' or to win them to a love of philosophy ?

		Can the incantation of forty isms through an examination period give one idea bet - ter to live by ?

		Who in a lifetime 's study can comprehend the range of human thinking and shall we plumb it into sophomores in a semester ?

		Lovers of poetry know that - poetry is untrans - latable ; teachers of philosophy must learn that philosophy is incompendiable .

		WHAT Is NATIONAL HONOR ?

		By
Leo Perla	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Perla	PERSON	argues that the sources of mili - tarism are psychological rather than economic ; that nations do not wage war `` out of a finely calculated economic heroism , out of intellectual persuasion of the advantages of war '' -LRB- this view `` has been the Achilles ' tendon of all pacifist technique '' -RRB- , but because peoples are moved to irrational action by the sentiment of national honor ; that this sentiment is so varied and gen - erous in its attachments that almost any inter - national difference -LRB- Mr.
Perla	PERSON	cites twice fifty - seven varieties -RRB- may become a casus belli by being entangled in the national honor ; that since the roots of the evil lie in the emotions , intel - lectual remedies through education will not eradicate it ; that efforts must rather be directed to enlarging the scope of patriotic emotions , through a
Court of International Honor	ORGANIZATION	which shall gradually attract to itself the sentiments of pugnacious loyalty now directed diversely to smaller political units .

		The criticism is obvious : first , that the direc - tion and scope of patriotic attachment are mat - ters of education and example ; and second , that the sentiment of national honor is rather an in - strument than the cause of militarism , a means used by statesmen to achieve effective popular unity in support of wars usually brought on by ruling cliques suffering from a goitre of greed and a passion for mastery .

		Mr.
Perla	PERSON	overlooks the omnipresent and omnipotent minority .

		The book is written with energy and some brilliance , and will repay study by all who believe that the peace of the world will always be precarious so long as the sentiment of national honor remains so flexible and vague .

		THREE PLAYS .

		By
David Pinski	PERSON	.

		Trans - lated by
Isaac Goldberg	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Since the days of
Reynolds	PERSON	and Cumberland the Jews have been increasingly the subject of sentimental treatment in the drama .

		It has how - ever remained for our own age to present them at once sympathetically and realistically naught extenuating nor aught setting down in malice as in `` The House Next Door '' or the miscel - laneous revampings from the
Potash	ORGANIZATION	and
Perl	PERSON	- mutter stories .

		Now also has come the next step in the development , the presentation of the Jew , sympathetically and realistically still , it is true , but with a grim gloom and a powerfully mor - bid psychology that bespeaks a photographic mind sensitive to catch all the shadows and none of the lights not even the half-lights of life .

		Con - sider the studies of
David Pinski	PERSON	, especially these three dramas .

		Pinski wants the discrimination to interpret his own negatives .

		He states the question , but he never answers it even though the answer be implicit in the very question .

		``
Isaac Sheftel	PERSON	, '' the first of the trilogy , stands out from the other two by reason of its early composition , although joined to them by oneness of theme .

		It is tyro work , a series of well con - catenated scenes , remarkable for its lack of plot in the Aristotelian sense , for its brutally indi - vidualized characterization , for its blackness of mood , and for its imaginative strangeness of phrase and technique .

		But it belongs , like Gals - worthy 's `` Justice , '' with that brood of literary compositions which deny and abnegate the vir - tue of the human will in its struggle with the forces of environment and heredity .

		Through - out there is the desire , rather than the will , to do .

		Never i & anything really done ... `` The Last Jew '' is the best of the three plays .

		Its subject `` not a pogrom tragedy , but the tragedy of a sole survivor , the tragedy of a moribund religion , of a crumbling world philosophy '' is again the pur - suit of a vision , the world-wide ideal of truth in thought , belief , and actions .

		Although an imme - diate historic value appears in the background of the
Kishinev	LOCATION	massacre , the actual value of the 76
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 18	DATE	play to the Jew , and to the Christian who would understand the Jew , is the struggle of the old and the new , of the simple unquestioning faith and the diverse scientific substitutes of socialism , na - tionalism , and assimilation .

		Here again
Pinski	PERSON	fails .

		He states his problem , but he can not solve it .

		He despairs at the chasm between the old and new generations .

		He has no eyes for the intangi - ble network of transfused ideals and traditions which inevitably bridge the gap ... `` The Dumb Messiah '' has a similar but altered theme in its tale of persecution and frustrated ideals of a return to Palestine .

		For a third time , and with physical torture and insanity as contributing hor - rors , death ends an unfulfilled obsession .

		To the student of literature and lover of good plays ,
Pinski	PERSON	offers rare craftsmanship , subtle characterization , and exotic style .

		So copious , indeed , is his use of intellectual pyrotechnics that he sometimes wearies the brain rather than stimu - lates it .

		Above all , he lacks catharsis .

		To the Jew ,
Pinski	PERSON	presents new and multifarious methods of introspection , gripping statement of racial and national differences , and hypnotic de - lineation of certain aspects of Jewish life .

		To that part of the world at large which is deeply concerned with Jews or Jewish life ,
Pinski	PERSON	shows vivid and vital portraits , which have contempo - raneous significance , even when they are Biblical or historical in inspiration .

		Yet it is question - able here whether the thousands who enjoy Fan -
nie Hurst	PERSON	and
Edna Ferber	PERSON	, and who live hap - pily , wholesomely , and energetically , will realize or give more than a passing thought to the birth - right of the Jewish ghetto and past martyrdom .

		In any case , they will know that
Pinski	PERSON	merely photographs , that he never lets in a chink of light to point the way up and out .

		TRAVELS IN
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		By
Charles Mor	PERSON	- ley .

		Button ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		`` Travels in
London	LOCATION	'' is not of the `` Friendly
France	LOCATION	'' or `` Raging
Russia	LOCATION	'' type of book .

		There is in its eight topics no effort to bring out any definite city psychology .

		It is rather an in - terpretation of the varied associations which have gripped the mind of a writer who was also a London-lover .

		In
America	LOCATION	we should call Mr.
Morley	PERSON	a `` fan '' because , knowing his city to the .

		full , he was still a lover and still able to find new praise for old beauties .

		He succeeded in adding a book to the lengthy bibliography of
London	LOCATION	without overlapping the others or repeating him - self .

		This has been accomplished through a species of portraiture .

		All the studies are pic - tures of his mental backgrounds associated with certain localities .

		These have been well chosen , including a few of the stock monuments along with others comparatively unknown both to Lon - doner and tourist .

		The value of such a scheme is at once apparent : the drawback lies in the fact that backgrounds in
London	LOCATION	are composite .

		The images of a sixteenth-century tavern , built on an old wine-cellar which in turn rests on Roman vaults , are , when superimposed , likely to blur .

		While this blurring of images would be a fault in a classic ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	interpretation , it finds no such place in Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's impressionistic treatment of a romantic subject .

		The handling of the Charterhouse and the Roman Wall is novel and calculated to excite to a peculiar de - gree the recollections of those who have toured and loved
London	LOCATION	.

		The book contains an in - teresting memorial to Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, who was a nephew of Lord
Morley	PERSON	and associated with him on the old `` Pall Mall Gazette . ''

		It is , at the some time , a short history of the rise of the new journalism in
London	LOCATION	under
Morley	PERSON	and Stead .

		RUNAWAY
RUSSIA	LOCATION	.

		By
Florence MacLeod Harper	ORGANIZATION	.

		Century ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		This book is apparently the little revised diary of a very brave but wholly undiscriminating woman .

		She arrived in
Russia	LOCATION	'' during the old regime '' ; she was '' there during the inaugura - tion of the new one . ''

		So much the preface tells us .

		Perhaps the '' old regime '' refers to the Czar , perhaps to Kerensky .

		Incredible as it may seem , there is not a word in the entire volume to show which .

		Possibly the
Czar	ORGANIZATION	fell during the early pages of the book ; if so , this was less important than the vicissitudes to which the As - toria Hotel , at which the author lodged , was sub - jected .

		Perhaps he had fallen before the book commences : Mrs.
Harper	PERSON	does not consider it worth while to let us into the secret .

		After sev - enty printed pages there is a casual reference to `` the Provisional Government '' ; and Kerensky enters the picture for the first time in the four - teenth chapter , though his name manages to stray into print earlier along with more weighty af - fairs Mrs.
Pankhurst	PERSON	, the price of caviar , the quality of wool , the cost of taxicabbing ,
Botch	LOCATION	- karova , the difficulty of assembling a bridge four - some in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, servant troubles .

		The book , according to the publishers , '' presents the Rus - sian revolution as seen through a woman 's eyes . ''

		Mrs.
Harper	PERSON	seems to have seen everything except the revolution .

		This is a calamity .

		The author exposed herself to the most fearful personal risks ; all that she has to show for it is a mass of trivi - alities , gossip , small talk , information of no last - ing value .

		Occasionally a bit of worth-while matter intrudes but it intrudes .

		When one has finished the book one has learnt the most embarrassingly intimate details about the author , but very , very little about
Russia	LOCATION	, runaway or otherwise .

		One knows , for instance , that Mrs.
Harper	PERSON	bathes frequently , even on trains ; that she is fond of cheese , wears washable
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 77 silk underwear , smokes cigarettes , dispenses with garters , and is given to untactful remarks , thus : '' Upon rejoining my Bolshevik friends , I re - marked that it was strange that the dome of the cathedral still remained , because it was covered with beaten gold , and as they had not hesitated to murder , I did not see why they should hesitate to steal ... Several black looks greeted me .

		... After that none of them spoke to me . ''

		All this one learns about
Florence MacLeod Har	ORGANIZATION	- per .

		But the Czar ?

		Kerensky ?

		Lenine ?

		Trot - zky ?

		These are flittingly unimportant figures in the misty outskirts of her narrative .

		The book should never have been called `` Runaway Rus - sia '' ; it should have been called `` Runaway Flor - ence . ''

		ILLUSIONS AND REALITIES OF THE WAR .

		By
Francis Grierson	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Fragments of haphazard thinking , useless to the student but perhaps worth the price to the tired business man who likes
Frank Crane	PERSON	, char - acterize this book .

		The author has traveled widely and thought narrowly , never having paused , it seems , to coordinate his impressions .

		After the first half-hundred pages the book be - comes a procession of platitudes , with contradic - tory opinions marching fraternally abreast , the whole culminating in a weird piece `` A Moral Revolution in
America	LOCATION	'' in which , af -LCB- er de - nouncing Prussian subordination of the individual and the destruction of originality by mechanical methods in American schools , Mr.
Grierson	PERSON	prophesies and welcomes a period of `` drastic '' -LRB- the author 's petted word -RRB- restriction of the in - dividual in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	: saloons , caba - rets , and
Sunday	DATE	movies will be prohibited ; `` a ban will be placed on banquets that last after ten o'clock ; ... - church discipline will go hand in hand with patriotic discipline ... backed by inexorable law ; ... laws will be framed against ... ribald songs and vaudeville acts ; ... all
Sunday	DATE	games will cease '' ; agnosticism in professors will be forbidden -LRB- verboten has crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	-RRB- ; and at last `` we shall pass laws for the abolishment of big cities '' -LRB- pages 176-181 -RRB- .

		There is an interesting suggestion that as newspapers close their columns to truth thinkers will become their own publishers , and the next will be an age of pamphlets resembling the era of
Desmoulins	PERSON	and
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Grierson	PERSON	is convinced that individualism has neu - tralized the initial benefits of revolution in
France	LOCATION	, nonconformity in
England	LOCATION	, and
Jeffer	PERSON	- sonian democracy in
America	LOCATION	; and argues that the plutocratic individualism of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, as well as the autocratic militarism of
Prussia	LOCATION	, will be defeated in this war .

		OUR BIBLE .

		By
Herbert L. Willett	PERSON	.


Christian Century Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		THE PSALMS AND OTHER SACRED WRIT - INGS .

		By
Frederick C. Eiselen	PERSON	.

		Abing - don Press ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		The business of branding as `` German '' that which one does not like is a favorite sport just now .

		While vociferous popular speakers and writers of a pronounced conservative type are frothing at scientific Bible study because it came from
Germany	LOCATION	, it is not strange that from theo - logical schools inoculating students with this `` Hellish Heidelberg Heresy '' there should come professional efforts to educate an innocent and withal inflammable religious constituency .

		Both these books bear announcements that they are `` non-technical in style , but of scholarly .

		au - thority , '' and to read them is to verify these state - ments .

		Professor
Willett	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, from the added vantage point of over twenty years ' experience as a popular preacher , Chautauqua lecturer , and writer , answers in - telligibly and interestingly the preliminary ques - tions that come to anyone beginning a scientific study of the Bible : its emergence out of the re - ligious experience of common folks , its growth , and the influences which gave it its present form .

		Problems of translation , revision , textual and higher criticism , and kindred themes are handled deftly .

		Page 116 has a succinct statement of the modern attitude toward the scriptures : `` These writings were not supernaturally produced in the beginning , and they have not been preserved to us in any miraculous manner .

		They bear the marks of human workmanship , both in their pro- duction and transmission . ''

		Professor
Eiselen	PERSON	has taken upon himself a much weightier task in his book , which is Volume III in a `` Biblical Introduction Series . ''

		This volume is a discussion of the origin , subject mat - ter , and value of the books called `` The Writ - ings '' in the Hebrew Bible : namely , `` Psalms , '' `` Proverbs , '' `` Job , '' `` Song of Songs , '' `` Ruth , '' `` Lamentations , '' ``
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	, '' `` Esther , '' ``
Dan	PERSON	- iel , '' `` Ezra-Nehemiah , '' and `` Chronicles : '' The first chapter , a study of Hebrew poetry , is a good survey of results attained in this most difficult and indeterminate of all fields of re - search , but it states conclusions more positively than most scholars would care to do .

		The short chapter on `` The Wisdom Literature of the Hebrews '' is well done .

		Other chapters follow , one each to the Biblical Books discussed .

		The book is thoroughly scientific painfully so .

		In method it is highly pedantic ; indeed , it reads like a brief of classroom lectures .

		To anyone wish - ing a concise , encyclopedic tabulation of critical pros and cons , and conclusions in the study of any of these Old Testament books , this volume will prove reliable and highly serviceable .

		78 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	NOTES ox NEW FICTION Of Persian poets and their aphorisms , and of the viziers and khalifs who sometimes rewarded them with many pieces of gold and sometimes cut off their heads , does Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	narrate with dry gusto .

		One
Ibn Kallikan	PERSON	, of the thirteenth century , is his source , and to his biographical dic - tionary at whose Englished volumes Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	`` had been sipping , beelike , for some years , '' he devotes the first half of the present volume , `` A
Boswell	PERSON	of
Baghdad	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		He takes his readers with him in these hours of sipping , as it were , even to
Ibn Kallikan	PERSON	's charm - ing admission of a misquotation : `` I since dis - covered that these verses are attributed to Ibn Musa ' 1-Makfuf .

		God knows best . ''

		There are the * poets who averted wrath or provoked it with their wit * one of whom wrote of his tooth , a boon companion , that `` whilst we were together I never saw him ; and when he appeared before my eyes , we had parted for ever . ''

		The humor of this Persian miscellany is compounded of its original wit , the translator 's quaint Englishing , and Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's own tolerant smile which leads him to modern interludes .

		He has something of the attitude of a collector toward wit .

		It stands him in good stead in his exploration of
Ibn Kal	PERSON	- likan 's vagaries ; but when he comes , as in the later part of the volume , to his own observa - tions and fancies , the reader feels a little as if wit had died and Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	were conducting a tour among its remains in a museum .

		He is not entirely free of the sin of anecdotage and his smile of tolerance becomes finally a trifle irri - tating .

		One craves more passionate loves and fiercer hates , untinctured with the entirely fanci - ful and the entirely literary .

		The sketch enti - tled `` The Listener , '' in which he tells of leaning against a lamp-post and overhearing the con - versation among the letters in the post-box , is of schoolboy triviality .

		One is grateful for the amusing correspondence entitled `` The Putten - hams , '' in which members of an ancient family express various degrees of indignation and tri - umph at the frankness of a newly published genealogy .

		Always Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	is master of a gracious style , but he does not always trouble to use it .

		Sometimes it seems almost as if he wrote in weariness .

		That is perhaps due to his having written some of these sketches in haste for periodicals .

		In that case they should have been excluded from this charming volume , or at least more completely altered than they have been .

		Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	loves his aristocrats , espec - ially the crabbed old ones , far too well to risk their unhappiness under the present democratic crisis ; and in his latest novel `` The Time Spirit '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , he comes to their rescue , re - arranging their patrician existences to the new order .

		In so doing he betrays praiseworthy in - genuity in bringing his story-teller 's bag of tricks up to the minute , although when all is said and done it is the same mid-Victorian stock that has in the past firmly established him in the affections of lovers of romance .

		This present story starts with a foggy night , a foundling , a
London Bobby	LOCATION	and ... it is needless to enu - merate further .

		With such a start it is inevita - ble that the foundling turn out of incomparable beauty , that she enjoy a dazzling career -LRB- the stage of course -RRB- , and end with wedding-bells and the strawberry leaf in her coronet .

		Whatever the political mode of the day , Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	knows full well that emotions are the same and that their response is the same under a democratic as under an autocratic dispensation .

		Students of social history will not be convinced that Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	has made an illuminating contribution to the subject , but
summer	DATE	students of fiction will be satisfied to the full .

		It is rather surprising to find that a writer of bracing fiction has taken to pointing morals , but that is just what Sir
Arthur Quiller-Couch	PERSON	has done in his `` Foe-Farrell '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Luckily , if you are the sort of person who does not like morals , you can skip the last page or two , and your impression of the whole novel , breezy and thoroughly fascinating as it is , will be unim - paired by the cloud of conscientiousness .

		Imagine two men hating each other heartily .

		One is the more or less direct cause of the loss of the , other 's experimental results of a lifetime .

		In revenge and it is a much more diabolical one than it seems the second dogs the footsteps of the first over land and sea , for thousands of miles , until they are cast upon a desert island , the sole sur - vivors of a wrecked ship .

		Then their identities become slowly and dreadfully interchanged .

		As for horror , the novel bears more than a slight resemblance to `` Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	, '' to which it has been likened , but the development is so much more subtle that the story gives a curiously different impression of fantastic reality .

		As a novel of adventure and invention it is a great success .

		`` Captain
Gault	PERSON	, '' by
William Hope Hodgson	PERSON	-LRB- McBride ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is a collection of ingenious adventure tales spiced with the inimitable tang of the sea .

		In their knowledge of men and women they display a kind of whimsical wiz - ardry .

		Whether dealing with secret societies , Chinese curio merchants , or pretty millionaire widows ,
Gault	PERSON	is a discriminating student of human nature .

		Except that `` student '' seems en - tirely too sedate an epithet for the rollicking sea captain with a penchant for smuggling and the dare-devil effrontery which escapes unscathed .

		A debonair faith in the eternal romance of life and in his own favor with the gods seems to
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 79 underlie the genial Captain 's tempting of fate .

		His pay is a `` trifle watery '' but there are `` little ways of making ends meet , '' and these little ways the story-teller demonstrates capably .

		Under the very eyes of the customs officers he defies their watchfulness .

		His exploits are well known and the patrols force him into corners , but he always eludes detection .

		The net seems all about him , but the wary Captain suddenly turns a trick and laughs at his pursuers ; and the reader laughs with him .

		It makes good vacation reading .

		`` Long Ever Ago , '' by
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	-LRB- Har - per 's ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , is a slight but gay book .

		It con - sists of several tales of the Irish in
America	LOCATION	, briskly told , but with a genuine sympathetic touch .

		The author is familiar with the subtle - ties of the Celtic temperament , and he does not make the common mistake of harping too persist - ently on the humorous string .

		Nor does he overdo those platitudes that are less genuinely Irish than born of the stage those capricious offsprings of the belief which still lingers that your Irishman is only graded by the making of the `` Irish bull . ''

		Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	has written a pleasant little book of stories , and he knows his material sufficiently well to bring a reminiscent smile to his reader provided , of course , the reader also is familiar with the psychology of transplanted
Erin	PERSON	.

		`` His Daughter , '' by
Gouverneur Morris	PERSON	-LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is the account of a young man 's awakening sex-consciousness , of his un - wholesome sophistication , and his eventual re - generation .

		The story is slow in getting under way and the first half is rather ineffectually oc - cupied with the banalities of young love .

		Fred - erick
Dayton	PERSON	is an athletic college youth with a frank American personality which proves irre - sistibly fascinating to women .

		On his way to
Paris	LOCATION	to study landscape gardening he meets and falls in love with
Dorothy Grandison	PERSON	, a pretty , unspoiled girl of fifteen .

		He has never been in love before .

		He feels that he is taking an un - fair advantage of his sweetheart 's youth , but he has not the will to break off his attention .

		How - ever , we are told that with him absence did not make the heart grow fonder .

		Quite the con - trary .

		Consequently , after
Dorothy	PERSON	has left
Paris	LOCATION	at her mother 's insistence ,
Dayton	PERSON	finds the pangs of separation speedily mitigated by the charms of
Claire D'Avril	PERSON	, the pretty owner of a
Paris	LOCATION	newsstand .

		He falls in love with
Claire	PERSON	, moves her into his studio , and dreads the time .

		when he will have to see
Dorothy	PERSON	again .

		With the introduction of this devoted mistress , the story gains momentum and discernment .

		Day - ton is called to
America	LOCATION	by his mother 's impend - ing death .

		Claire returns to the studio and learns of her lover 's hasty departure , but she fails to find the money and the letter he has left her .

		Through petty enmity his other letters are in - tercepted and
Claire	PERSON	goes on alone , bravely struggling to remain true to
Dayton	LOCATION	's memory and to rear her child in innocence ... In
America Dayton	ORGANIZATION	meets
Dorothy	PERSON	, finds himself more in love with her than ever , and marries her in spite of his secret hatred of his unworthi - ness .

		Other amours follow .

		Though Dayton always respects his wife , he is not satisfied with her love and is continually unfaithful .

		His adoration for their little daughter touches
Dorothy	PERSON	and she forgives his vice .

		The war of - fords the author an opportunity to plunge his immoral hero into a baptism of fire for physical and spiritual regeneration .

		The reformation seems a trifle precipitate , though prepared for in a measure by the shock of the daughter 's death .

		On the whole , the novel is not up to the best work of Mr.
Morris	PERSON	.

		There is too much ex - planation of motives and emotions , and not enough realization of these in suggestive and illuminating action .

		Claire D'Avril seems the most human of the characters .

		`` The Queen 's Heart , '' by
J. H. Hildreth	PERSON	-LRB-
Marshall Jones	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is described on the jacket as being `` a good old-fashioned romance '' written twenty-five years ago .

		Such candor in announcing the contents of a novel is welcome .

		In the opening chapter a likable hero and heroine , in order to escape the ennui prevailing aboard a becalmed sailing yacht , decide to row out a mile or two to examine a derelict .

		One is quite pre - pared for a proposal aboard the derelict , but not for what follows .

		A sudden storm sweeps down upon them and carries them out to sea , where the following day , when they are picked up by a mysterious vessel , their adventures begin .

		What follows is in the realm of the improbable and melodramatic , but the author leads us on so gently that the transition from the commonplace to the fantastic is rather like ascent in an aero - plane .

		The reader does not observe that he has left the terra firma of reality until he is aloft in fantasy , and the exhilaration is such that he then willingly abandons himself to the adventure .

		He is wise to do so , for Mr.
Hildreth	PERSON	is a skilful pilot and knows regions of adventure which are largely unexplored .

		In the case of this novel the term `` old-fashioned romance '' is the mark of sterling .

		Those who have a taste for that species of fic - tion , known as `` serial , '' which flourishes in the cheaper English newspapers may find `` The White Rook , '' by

		In conception the story is ingenious ; in execution , slovenly .

		Mysterious murders , suicides , and attempted poisonings are no longer the only ingredients required to make a good mystery story .

		80 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 18	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT OUR MOVING-PICTURES , OR RATHER OUR photo-dramas , are the despair of acute foreign observers .

		The curiously persistent conventions about human sentiment and human affections , the unreal grimaces , the rigid and artificial pattern of the fable , the conventionalization all these make the immense standardization of our moving - picture industry just that much more menacing .

		If it were not for its sweep and drive , one would not be concerned about the effect of moving - pictures .

		Yet the despair of the foreign observer , although explicable , is not entirely justified .

		If one recalls the photo-dramas of even five years ago , one finds the development striking .

		Of course it is a development largely in externals ; that is , in lighting , skill in arrangement of the chiaroscuro effects , a more flexible technique , and so on .

		The costumes have improved immeasur - ably ; the schemes of interior decoration are less absurd ; the taste in mere details of decoration is less offensive ; the feeling for aesthetic possibilities in out-of-door scenes is pronounced .

		SOCIOLOGY WAS FOR A LONG TIME BARREN OF anything except the vaguest of generalizations and the most far-fetched of analogies , until its ex - ponents acquired an extensive psychological back - ground .

		Then it became fruitful and suscepti - ble to practical application .

		Books like `` Human Nature in Politics '' and `` The Great Society , '' as noteworthy and important books of their kind as we possess , were pioneers precisely for that reason .

		For the first time the organized body of knowledge brought together by the psychologists was employed to sharpen and clarify current concepts about our community life .

		Many myths and phantasies of our thought retreated before this scientific attack .

		Certain loose theo - ries became henceforth impossible for the thinker of any intellectual integrity ; and if the field of speculation was limited in one sense , in another it was broadened , for freedom of initiative and inventiveness was enhanced within the more rigidly defined limits of the possible .

		Today it is clear that sociological thinking would be made even more fruitful by employing the illumina - tions which anthropology provides in ever in - creasing abundance .

		Some scholar with the ade - quate background and training , together with the necessary literary skill , needs to do for anthro - pology precisely what
Graham Wallas	PERSON	did for psychology bring it into the open and put it to work .

		Sociology needs imperatively the disci - pline of anthropological fact .

		For with the war there has come a recrudescence of the vicious kind of sociological speculation which the new training of sociologists in the psychology of be - havior had to `` a certain extent destroyed .

		Most oi this popular and flabby generalizing about `` races '' and `` bloods '' and `` hostile groups '' such as we have par excellence in a writer like
Houston Chamberlain	LOCATION	springs from downright ignorance of the simplest validated truths of an - thropology .

		For example , it is considered the shrewd and scholarly thing to say of
Russia	LOCATION	that her attempts at a sociological experiment of a totally new kind in the history of the world are `` abortive . ''

		It is considered the correct reading of the theory of evolution , so respectable a theory that no one dare dispute it .

		It is assumed that nations must pass through successive stages from the simple to the complex .

		`` How can
Russia	LOCATION	, '' these writers ask , `` expect to jump from the
eighteenth century	DATE	to the twenty-second ?

		Must she not pass through the mercantile , the indus - trial , the economic development which the more highly organized and more experienced democra - cies of the West have had to undergo ?

		Must not the new grow out of the old ?

		Would not any other development be mere caprice in what we know , scientifically , to be an orderly world ? ''

		The answer is that anthropology is largely the history of just this type of caprice .

		There is nothing in the facts which it discloses to justify any of these questions .

		Given a fortunate start , the lucky instrument of a popular will which is determined that it shall be so , and there is nothing in the history of mankind to show that the Rus - sian experiment is foredoomed to failure .

		On the contrary , anthropology w r ould tend to make one optimistic about its chance for success .

		Ex - amples of this kind might be multiplied .

		Especially needed is the corrective of scientific anthropological knowledge to those speculating about the natural differences between the various races at war for here ignorance and unreason is the general rule .

		THE DIAL hopes that such a type of book may speedily be written .

		The op - portunity is great , the need imperative .

		MARGARET DELANO IN THE JULY ISSUE OF ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' has written an article which is as remarkable for its structural design as for its insight and its extraordinary trans - valuation of the conventional moralistic values of the war into straightforward human values .

		It is noteworthy because it is a beginning ; here - tofore most of our writers have been special pleaders , even without knowing it , earnest and a little pathetic in their attempts to acclimatize us to the fact of war .

		But Miss
Deland	LOCATION	does not assume a naive audience just as our other writers , bit by bit , will realize that emotionally the war has long since come home to us .

		This will give our men and women of letters a greater margin of real freedom ; they will not spend three-fourths of their time attempting ; to induce a mood which already we can apperceive intui -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 81 tivcly .

		Yet striking as the article is as a symbol of the psychological change taking place in all of us to a greater or less extent , it has a special lit - erary significance .

		What our school rhetorics used to call `` unity of impression '' can not be at - tained by any method susceptible to definition by formula .

		Miss
Deland	LOCATION	, for example , wishes to convey the impression of bewilderment and expectancy , the sense of waiting , waiting for some triumphant happening to justify the present terrors of inarticulate fear just below the thresh - old of consciousness , tapping ever stronger at the thin shell which divides the outer normality from the massive and irrational inner life , and of the dread that this dumb fear may some day break its chains and strangle us in despair .

		To convey this so as to sustain the curious unity of impression which she has successfully maintained in her article would hardly be accomplished by employing the conventional essay form .

		It is more than probable that she was not fully aware of this , although the title of her article , `` Beads , '' and its sub-title , `` War-Time Reflections in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' suggests that
Miss Deland	LOCATION	knew that her work was not the ordinary impressionistic essay .

		And the title is particularly happy .

		There are beads of many colors on her string , crimson and black and crystal , but the black beads predominate black , the color of fear .

		Thus she can thread together her own doubts and hopes , mere incidents , the doubts and hopes of others .

		It is a remarkable pattern in its sin - gleness and strength , its inner unity .

		For the cord on which the beads are strung is as fine as silken thread , but a thread which is never broken .

		ALTHOUGH OUTWARDLY
GERMANY	LOCATION	HAS exhibited few signs of change , certain events of the last few weeks , when placed together in the order of their significance , make it fairly .

		clear that the so-called German `` unity '' is today , what - ever it may have been in the past , a myth .

		Per - haps the most illuminating series of recent events was the series culminating in the publication of that part of Chancellor von
Hertling	ORGANIZATION	's recent speech which referred to
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Events moved in a singularly contradictory fashion .

		First : Kiihlmann stated that a military victory for Ger - many is impossible .

		At once the pan-Germanists and extremists , the small clique of powerful and stupid brigands that cluster around the German General Staff , raised a frantic cry .

		Second :
Kiihlmann	PERSON	was forced to resign .

		This looked like a clear victory for those who wo n't be satis - fied until they get a military dictatorship , and all the reactionaries ' hats were gleefully thrown in the air .

		But what happened when Admiral von
Hintze	PERSON	was appointed in the former Foreign Minister 's place
Hintze	PERSON	, a rascal after their own heart ?

		At once the moderates , and those who have some political decency left , raised in their turn an equally frantic cry .

		The majority Socialists even threatened not to vote the budget .

		Third : no sooner was Admiral von
Hintze	PERSON	ap - pointed than the Chancellor arose and delivered a long speech in which he said , `` I will direct the line of foreign policy , '' and `` We have no inten - tion to keep
Belgium	LOCATION	in any form whatever . ''

		But this was a great victory for the moderates , an even greater because the reactionaries had reason to believe that with Admiral von
Hintze	PERSON	appointed everything was now clear sailing .

		Yet the speech of the Chancellor was circu - lated in the Allied countries with the passage referring to
Belgium	LOCATION	deliberately omitted .

		And then took place the last act of the political drama .

		Fourth : the next day the censored passage was sent out by wireless official statement .

		What happened during that twenty-four hours is now , in the light of the preceding events , fairly obvious .

		On the conclusion of the Chancellor 's speech the reactionaries must have been in a frightful temper .

		As they controlled the
General Staff	ORGANIZATION	, including the military censorship over the news service , they took what revenge they could by so deleting from the speech that the horrible moderation in the German attitude towards
Belgium	LOCATION	`` modera - tion , '' needless to say , as they understand the word would not be revealed to the world .

		Yet once more their political opponents brought pres - sure to bear on the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and the passage was published .

		A sort of indirect confirmation of the accuracy of this interpretation was almost immediately afterwards furnished by
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	, when , speaking at
Northampton	LOCATION	on
July 13	DATE	, he declared that `` it also seems clear that the German majority Socialists accept vir - tually all the principles of the inter-Allied memo - randum .

		All of which shows that the political strife within
Germany	LOCATION	has reached a stage of fruit - ful bitterness .

		There is a clear division between an extremist and a moderate policy , and each policy has its body of powerful followers .

		If this be `` unity , '' then it is of the kind of which the Allies , with a little shrewd diplomacy , can take tremen - dous advantage .

		With the stage so obviously set for a battle royal of domestic politics within Ger - many , our leaders should do nothing to throw the prospective combatants into each other 's arms .

		In due course , we hope , President
Wilson	PERSON	will , as he so often has done in the past , give exactly the type of speech calculated to fan the flames of German internal strife .

		Already this internal strife appears to have delayed the renewal of the grand offensive .

		When that offensive is finally defeated , a remarkable diplomatic opportunity will probably be presented to us an opportunity to shatter the morale of the enemy .

		And in the long run , as
General Smuts	ORGANIZATION	has said , the winning of the war is a question of morale .

		82 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	COMMUNICATION MISGUIDED YOUNG LIONS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Will you not do me the courtesy and the justice to inform your readers that I did not `` identify , '' or intend to characterise ,
Justice Brandeis	ORGANIZATION	as a Bolshevik , and that I did not speak of Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	as
Jane Addams	PERSON	?

		The explanation that `` Professor
Shorey	PERSON	refers to the flag of Bolshevik - ism '' is an inspiration of the reporter , presumably the same reporter who asked me if `` that
Norman Angell	PERSON	you talked about was the Professor
Angell	PERSON	out at your
University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		My opinions of Russian literature are the outcome of forty years of uncriti - cal reading in translation .

		If I am ever so rash as to print them I shall be resigned in anticipation to the assaults of your young lions who , for reasons undivinable by me , never miss an opportunity to `` slate '' me .

		But until , or unless I do print them , permit me to express my regret that so intelligent a journal as , in spite of its deplorable opinions , I acknowledge THE DIAL to be , is willing to take as its text a newspaper report of a professor 's utter - ances .

		There is a sufficiency of material in authen - tic print .

		And surely you must be aware that , even if correctly reported , a few sentences wrenched from their context and put into unintended juxta - positions , can not give a fair impression of a paper which was merely an uninspired professor 's endeavor not to bore beyond endurance an audience of ladies and gentlemen .

		In my own case the reporting never is correct not even when , lest worse things should befall me , I lend my manuscript to the reporter for a few minutes .

		Newspapers do not send experts to report professors of Greek .

		I re - main , with chastened resignation , Very truly yours ,
PAUL SHOREY	PERSON	.

New York	LOCATION	86 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 18	DATE	Here are some reasons why you should read The Public : 1 It will save your reading-time and energy and give you information you can get nowhere else .

		The Public is a weekly review which prints in concise and plain terms , with lucid explanations and without editorial bias , all the current news of the world of historical value .

		2 It will clarify and give you worth - while opinions on domestic and foreign affairs .

		The Public is also an editorial paper .

		Though it abstains from mingling edi - torial opinions with its news narrative , it has opinions of a pronounced char - acter , based upon the principles of fundamental democracy , which , in the colums reserved for editorial comment , it expresses fully and freely , without favor or prejudice , without fear of con - sequences , and without regard to any consideration of personal or business ad - vantage .

		Yet it makes no pretensions to infalli - bility , either in opinions or in statements of fact ; it simply aspires to a deserved reputation for intelligence and honesty in both .

		3 You can judge it for yourself and get a prompt refund of your money if you do not agree that `` The Public '' is `` a compass , never sensational , always calm and pointing in the same direc - tion . ''

		-LSB- Brand
Whitlock	PERSON	-RSB- The Public is staunchly American , fundamentally democratic , and is a militant liberal weekly for those who think .

		Readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	can get The Public weekly for six months trial and a copy of
H. G. Wells	PERSON	' new book , `` In the Fourth Year , '' for only 75c tttore than the book alone would cost them .

		THE fortnightly Journal of Criticism and Discussion or Literature ana Cfte flrts American Influence on Modern French Music Since all Americans are naively vain , it is as well to see ourselves as others see us , if we profit by it .

		.


Europe	LOCATION	has always thought strange things of us , especially
France	LOCATION	.


Gilbert Chinard	PERSON	, for example , has collected into two fascinating volumes all the `` exotisme americain '' in French literature , from
Rabelais	LOCATION	and
Ronsard	ORGANIZATION	through the eighteenth century .

		A third volume , covering the nineteenth century , would be still more amusing .

		Among others , there is a delightfully scurrilous volume , `` Asmodee a New -
York	LOCATION	, '' published anonymously in
1868	DATE	.

		Scurrilous but romantic as the travels of
Maundevylle	LOCATION	, for the author obviously never crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		He unrolls a fantastic panorama of civic corruptions , amateur fire-brigades -LRB- in
New York	LOCATION	! -RRB-

		, revolver-shooting citizens , out-of-door re ligious meetings where quadrilles alter - nate with sermons .

		Those who have been to
Europe	LOCATION	know what the American duel is a drawing of lots , followed by the suicide of the loser ; but who , before or since
Asmodee	PERSON	, has heard of the Ameri - can suicide ?

		It seems the despairing man one evening takes a drink of `` alcool , '' the next night two , the next night three , and so on , until his miserable soul is tor - tured from his ruined body .

		The author neglects to tell us how soon this denoue - ment occurs , but he assures us the practice is wide .

		With such grotesque material at hand , it is not surprising that the
United States	LOCATION	has added its genre to the modern French music .

		But a question intervenes : what have we done in music that is so char - acteristic ?

		It is true that some critics have traced a flavor of
MacDowell	ORGANIZATION	in
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	's `` La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin '' and `` Les Collines d'Anacapri , '' but this is thor - oughly unimportant .

		The answer is that we have a type of music instantly recognized anywhere on this globe as American .

		This is `` rag , '' that rank growth from the richness of our soil .

		No American composer -LRB- with the notable exception of
Henry Gilbert	PERSON	-RRB- has been able to use it ; for we are too near it , too familiar with it , to be able to extract any but the most vulgar effects from it .

		The Frenchman however has picked from out of our weeds a leaf here and there of a design curious to him , which he has formed into patterns of his own invention .

		Of course this has been tried before .

		When in the eighteen-sixties `` Ethiopian Minstrels '' invaded
Europe	LOCATION	with tremen - dous success , the serious-minded made attempts to use the Negro idiom in good music .

		Of all these attempts only one piece of music continues to exist
Dvorak	PERSON	's `` New World Symphony '' -LRB- 1893 -RRB- .

		Yet though he caught rhythms and built a couple of melodies so like the real thing that they have since been turned into Negro songs , his work as a whole gives no suggestion of any place on earth except
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		It has been the French , then , that alone have used American idiom recognizably .

		And of course it was Debussy that first made the attempt .

		In the `` Children 's Corner '' we find the initial experiment .

		`` Gollywog 's Cake - walk '' -LRB- all the titles are in English -RRB- is the last of this little set for .

		piano .

		De - bussy has taken a single syncopation which he uses as the basis for the entire composi - tion ; and here he is wrong , for true `` rag '' changes its meter continually .

		Debussy 's effect however is not monotonous his ear was too sensitive to allow him to commit any such mistake and the middle section drops the rhythmic figure for a while .

		This middle section is noteworthy for its delicate burlesque of the opening cello phrase of `` Tristan . ''

		The Teutonic super - lover becomes the grotesque Gollywog sur - prised by new , sacred emotions ; but these 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	are soon swept aside by the syncopated cakewalk .

		In the first volume of `` Pre - ludes , '' Debussy again tries American effects , and again he thinks his result suffi - ciently important to place it last in the volume .

		`` Minstrels '' he calls it , again using an English title ; and it is really only this that betrays its meaning .

		He is giv - ing his impression of a black-face show ; we hear the drum , the sentimental song , and so on , with a little phrase like a guffaw punctuating the music , just as the puns of the endmen punctuate the performance .

		But
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	has written this music with a characteristic bit of daring : he has left syncopation entirely out of it .

		And there - fore no American is likely to realize what is going on , unless he appreciates the title .

		This is all that Debussy tried , but an - other composer took up the idiom and did more with it .

		This was
Eric Satie	PERSON	, of whom there is nowadays quite a cult .


Eric Satie	PERSON	was among the modern ballet pio - neers , but he abandoned that for humorous piano sketches .

		He is a marvelous mix - ture of the dilettante , mystic , humorist , and decadent .

		He dares the limit , and cares not of the public .

		He cultivates the most exotic and the rngst naive harmonies .

		He writes chants for the Rosy-Cross and musi - cal descriptions of the life of fishes .

		He delights in misquotations : his `` EspaiianV -LRB- `` Croquis et Agaceries d'un gros Bon - homme en bois '' -RRB- is a strange mess of
Chabrier	PERSON	, and in `` d'Edriopthalma '' -LRB- `` Embryons desseches '' -RRB- he cites the `` celebrated mazurka of Schubert , '' which is in reality a perversion of
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's `` Funeral
March	DATE	. ''

		Among his titles one finds `` Tyrolienne turque , '' `` Apercus desagreables , '' `` Celle qui parle trop , '' `` Les Trois Valses du Precieux degoute , '' and `` Trois Morceaux en forme de Poire , avec une
Maniere de Commencement	ORGANIZATION	, une Prolongation du meme , et Un En Plus , suivi d'une Redite . ''

		His latest and most successful composi - tion was a return to the ballet , called `` Parade '' -LRB- or `` Vaudeville '' -RRB- , produced for the first time in
Paris	LOCATION	,
May 18 , 1917	DATE	.

		It is a `` Ballet realiste , '' whose collabo - rators were
Pablo Picasso	PERSON	, Leonide Mas - sine , and
Jean Cocteau	PERSON	, the poet .

		`` Real - istic '' indeed !

		It is realism `` which stifles the nightingale 's song beneath the rum - blings of the tramways . ''

		It represents a vaudeville in which one feels `` the terrible mysteries of
China	LOCATION	, the sadness of the nocturnal bar of the little American girl , the astonishing gymnastics of the acro - bats ; it contains all the sorrow of the boards the nostalgia of the hand-organ which will never play Bach fugues . ''

		At least so the preface says .

		As a matter of fact it is one of the funniest things ever written by a serious musician .

		Haydn 's `` Surprise Symphony '' has just one slap - stick or rather bang-drum moment ; `` Till Eulenspiegel '' keeps you good - humored ;
Carpenter	PERSON	's `` Perambulator Suite '' has several smiles in it ; but noth - ing has been written which rouses the roars of laughter which `` Parade '' creates .

		This is no small thing .

		And it must be remem - bered that the humor is in the very music that one laughs even without knowing the setting or the choreography .

		The plot is simple .

		A vaudeville has opened in
Paris	LOCATION	on a
Sunday	DATE	.

		Three man - agers attempt to advertise their show by exhibiting three numbers : a Chinese pres - tidigitator , acrobats , and an American dancer .

		-LRB- The management reserves the right to change the order of the acts ; and sure enough , in the actual presentation , the American girl precedes the acrobats ! -RRB-

		The crowd think that they are seeing the entire show for nothing ; so no one enters .

		Finally the exhausted managers fall upon each other , and the three turns reappear to renew the advertising .

		The influence of
America	LOCATION	is felt at the very beginning , for the managers appear imbedded in huge cubistic frames repre - senting fragments of skyscrapers .

		Their actions are therefore limited to smoking long clay pipes and continuous bowing .

		So much for American enterprise !

		I should like to describe all the music the Chinese effects of cheap incense , long moustaches , and erected forefingers ; the heavily sentimental waltz of the acrobats , interrupted by curious extra-harmonic pricklings as of the skin but our main interest lies with the little dancer , with her exaggerated steps and her very char - acteristic music .

		She is favored with two dances : one for her entrance , where a peculiarly imbecile measure is labeled `` vertueuse , '' and finally the great `` Rag - time du paquebot . ''

		Satie has composed a typical rag tune ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 95 which is -LRB- naturally -RRB- an unbelievable con - centration of reminiscences .

		I do not think he has used a single phrase which has not been used dozens of times before him by American composers .

		To this he has fitted an independent , yet character - istic , bass with a vigor all its own .

		Occa - sionally these two melodies make strange acquaintance , and often the harmonies be - , tween them are curiously twisted .

		The wrong thing is done at the wrong moment ; and when it is time to return to the theme , one seems an impossible distance away .

		Yet
Satie	PERSON	suddenly lets chords and rhythms sink , slide , and there you are , though you ca n't quite believe it .

		In short , what
Satie	PERSON	has done * is simply to reproduce the
Ameri	PERSON	- can invention , plus its awkwardness of ex - pression , its ignorance of rules and possi - bilities .

		The result more than justifies him .

		But , amusing as it is , it is a poor return to
France	LOCATION	for what she has given us in music .

		And
Eric Satie	PERSON	no doubt uncon - sciouslygives us a very correct criticism of our musical faults .

		We are ignorant , woefully ignorant , criminally ignorant , of music as an art .

		We will not take the trouble to learn it .

		We care nothing about its technique .

		Music is the most compli - cated of the arts -LRB- barring architecture -RRB- , and we are too lazy to find out how it is done .

		Our schools are ignorant of its basic principles .

		The foreigner begins early and writes his daily counterpoint for six years at least before he considers that he has mastered the simplest style ; whereas we begin late in life on an imbecile study called `` Harmony '' -LRB- whose false rules have been broken freely by every com - poser of the last two centuries and teach a baroque style in which no one ever wrote or will write -RRB- .

		Then we settle lazily into counterpoint for a year , and follow it the next year with laborious canons and fugues .

		After that the deluge of mediocrity !


Eric Satie	PERSON	profits by our mistakes and makes an amusing ballet out of it .

		This is our contribution to the music of the world .


France	LOCATION	has been the only country to appreciate it .

		S. FOSTER DAMON .


Emily Dickinson	PERSON	When .

		I want poetry in its most de - lightful and playful mood I take up the verses of that remarkable girl of the six - ties and seventies ,
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	she who was writing her little worthless poetic nothings -LRB- or so she was wont to think of them -RRB- at a time when the now classical
New England	LOCATION	group was flourishing near
Concord	LOCATION	, when
Hawthorne	PERSON	was burrowing into the soul of things , when
Thoreau	PERSON	was refusing to make more pencils and was sounding lake bottoms and holding con - verse with all kinds of fish and other water life , and when
Emerson	PERSON	, standing high upon his pedestal , was preaching of com - pensations , of friendship , of society , and of the oversoul .


Emily Dickinson	PERSON	has by no means lost her freshness for us ; she wears as would an old-fashioned pearl set in gold and dark enamels .

		One feels as if one were sun - ning in the discal radiance of a bright , vivid , and really new type of poet .

		For with her cheery impertinence she offsets the smugness of the time in which she lived .

		What must have been the irresistible charm of this girl who gave so charming a por - trait of herself to the stranger friend who inquired for a photograph : `` I have no portrait now , but am small like the wren , and my hair is bold like the chestnut bur , and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves ! ''

		She had unde - niable originality of personality , grace , and special beauty of mind .

		It was a charm unique in itself , not like any other genius then or now , or in the time before her , having perhaps a little of relation - ship to the crystal clearness of Crashaw like
Vaughan	PERSON	and
Donne	PERSON	maybe in respect to their lyrical fervor and moral earnest - ness , nevertheless appearing to us freshly with as separate a spirit in her poetry as she herself was separated from the world around her by the amplitude of garden which was her universe .


Emily Dickin	PERSON	- son confronts you at once with an instinct for poetry to be envied by the more ordi - nary and perhaps more finished poets .

		Ordinary she never was ; common she .

		96 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
August 15	DATE	never could have been .

		For she was first and last aristocratic in sensibility , rare and untouchable , often vague and mystical , sometimes distinctly aloof .

		Those with a fondness for intimacy will find her , like all recluses , forbidding and difficult .

		Here was
New England	LOCATION	at its sharpest , wittiest , most fantastic , most wilful , most devout .

		Saint and imp sported in her , toying with the tricks of the Deity , tak - ing them now with extreme profundity , then tossing them about like irresistible toys with an incomparable triviality .

		She has traced upon the page with celestial indelibility that fine line from her soul , which is like a fine prismatic light sepa - rating one bright sphere from another , one planet from another planet ; and the edge of separation is but faintly perceptible .

		She has left us this bright folio of her `` lightning and fragrance in one , '' scintil - lant with star dust as perhaps no other before her , certainly none in this country .

		Who has had her celestial attachedness or must we call it detachedness ?

		- and her sublime impertinent playfulness , which makes her images dance before one like offspring of the great round sun , as zeal - ously she fools with the universes at her feet and , with loftiness of spirit and ex - quisite trivialness , with those just beyond her eye ?

		Whoever has not read these flippant renderings , holding always some touch of austerity and gravity of mood , or the still more perfect `` letters '' to her friends , has , I think , missed a new kind of poetic diversion a new loveliness , evasive , alert , pronounced in every interval and serious , modestly so , and at a bound leaping as it were like some sky child pranking with the clouds and the hills and the valleys be - neath them .

		Child she surely was always , playing in some celestial garden space in her mind , where every species of tether was unendurable , where freedom for this childish sport was the one thing necessary to her ever young and incessantly caper - ing mind .

		It must be said , then , that `` fascination was her element '' ; everything to her was wondrous , sublimely magical , awsomely inspiring and thrilling .

		It was the event of many moons to have some - one she liked say so much as `` good morn - ing '' to her in human tongue ; it was the event of every instant to have the flowers and birds call her by name , and hear the clouds exult at her approach .

		She was the brightest young sister of fancy , as she was the gifted young daughter of the ancient imagination .

		One feels everywhere in her verse and in her letters an unexcelled freshness , a ' brightness of metaphor and of imagery , a peculiar gift that could have come only from this part of our country , this part of the world , this very spot which has bred so many intellectual and spiritual entities , wrapped in the garments of isolation , robed with questioning .

		Her genius is in this sense essentially local , as much the voice of the spirit of
New England	LOCATION	as it is possible for one to be .

		If ever wanderer hitched vehicle to the comet 's tail , it was this poetic sprite woman ; no one ever rode the sky and the earth as she did in this radiant and sky - bright mind of hers .

		She loved all things because all things were in one way or an - other bright for her , and of a blinding brightness from which she often had to hide her face .

		She embroidered all her thoughts with starry intricacies , and gave them the splendor of frosty traceries upon the windowpane , and of the raindrop in the sun , and summered them with the fragrancing of the many early and late flowers of her own fanciful conjuring .

		They are glittering garlands of her clear , cool fancies , these poems , fraught in some instances , as are certain finely cut stones , with an exceptional mingling of lights coursing swiftly through them .

		She was avid of starlight and of sunlight alike , and of that light by which all things are illumined with ' a splendor not their own merely , but lent them by shafts from that radiant sphere which she leaned from , that high place in her mind .

		To think of this poet is to think of crys - tal , for she lived in a radianced world of innumerable facets , and the common instances were chariots upon which to ride wildly over the edges of infinity .

		She is alive for us now in those rare fancies of hers .

		You will find in her all that is win - some , strange , fanciful , fantastic , and irresistible in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	character .

		She is first and best in lightsomeness of tem - per , for the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	is known as an essen - tially tragic genius .

		She is in modern times perhaps the single exponent of the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 97 quality of true celestial frivolity .

		She was like dew and the soft
summer	DATE	rain , and the light upon the lips of flowers of which she loved to sing .

		Her mind and her spirit were one , soul and sense insepa - rable .

		She was the little sister of
Shelley	LOCATION	, and the more playful relative of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	.

		She had about her the imper - ishable quality that hovers about all things young and strong and beautiful ; she con - veyed the sense of beauty ungovernable .

		What she has of religious and moral ten - dencies in nowise disturbs those who love and appreciate true poetic essences .

		For
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	had in her eyes the climbing lances of the * sun ; she had in her heart love and pity for the immeas - urable , innumerable , pitiful , and pitiable things .

		She was a quenchless mother in her gift for solace .

		Like all aristocrats , she hated mediocrity ; and like all first-rate jewels , she had no rift to hide .

		She was not a maker of poetry ; she was a thinker of poetry .

		She was not a conjuror of words so much as a magician in sensibility .

		She had only to see and feel and hear to be in touch with all things with a name or with things that must be forever name - less .

		If she loved people , she loved them for what they were ; if she despised them , she despised them for what they did , or for lack of power to feel they could not do .

		Silence under a tree was a far more talka - tive experience with her than converse with one or a thousand dull minds .

		Her throng was the air , and her wings were the multitude of flying movements in her brain .

		She had only to think and she was amid numberless minarets and golden domes ; she had only to think and the mountain cleft its shadow in her heart .


Emily Dickinson	PERSON	is in no sense toil for the mind unaccustomed to the labors of reading : she is too fanciful and delicious ever to make heavy the head ; she sets you to laugh ' and draws a smile across your face for .

		?

		and lets you loose again amid the mean Viess pleasing little humanities .

		I shajl .

		always want to read
Emily Dickin	PERSON	- son , ` for she points her finger at all tire - some scholasticism , and takes a chance with the universe about her and the first poetry it offers at every hand , within the eye 's easy glancing .

		She has made poetry memorable as a pastime for the mind , and sent the heavier ministerial tendencies fly - ing to a speedy oblivion .

		What a child she was , child impertinent , with a heav - enly rippling in her brain !

		These random passages ` from her writ - , ings will show at once the rarity of her tastes and the originality of her phrasing :
February	DATE	passed like a kate , and I know
March	DATE	... Here is the light the stranger said was not on sea or land myself could arrest it , but will not chagrin him .

		The wind blows gay today , and the jays bark like blue terriers .


Friday	DATE	I tasted life , it was a vast morsel ... A circus passed the house still I feel the red in my mind though the drums are out .

		If I read a book , and it makes my whole body so cold no fire will ever warm me , I know that is poetry .

		If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off , I know that is poetry .

		Is there no other way ?

		None but a
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	mind could con - coct such humors and fascinatingly pert phrases as are found here .

		They are like the chatterings of the interrupted squirrel in the tree-bole .

		There is so much of high gossip in these poetic turns of hers that throughout her books one finds a multi - tude of playful tricks for the pleased mind to run with .

		She was an intoxicated being , drunken with the little tipsy joys of the simplest form , shaped as they were to elude always her evasive imagination into thinking that nothing she could think or feel but was extraordinary and remark - able .

		`` Your letter gave no drunkenness because I tasted rum before
Domingo	PERSON	comes but once , '' she wrote to
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	, a pretty conceit surely to offer a loved friend .

		These passages will give the unfamiliar reader a taste of the sparkle of the poet 's hurrying fancy .

		She will always delight those who love her type of elfish , evasive genius .

		And those who care for the vivid and living element in words will find her , to say the least , among the masters in her feeling for their strange shapes and for the fresh significances contained in them .

		A born thinker of poetry , and in a great measure a gifted writer of it , refreshing many a heavy moment made dull with the weightiness of books or of burdensome thinking , this poet-sprite sets scurrying all weariness of the brain ; and they shall have an hour of sheer delight who invite poetic converse with
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	.

		She will repay with funds of rich celestial coin from her rare and precious fancyings .


MARSDEN HARTLEY	PERSON	.

		98 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 15	DATE	Anthropology Put to Work Recent developments are bound to accentuate the demand for practical utili - zation of science .

		This trend is not only natural under the present circumstances but derives not a little support from both philosophy and history .

		While our prag - matists are vindicating that `` instru - mental '' theory of knowledge which subordinates it to some definite end , his - torians have shown that the progress of science is intimately bound up with tech - nology .

		But this point of view must not degenerate into a crude
Gradgrind	PERSON	policy , lest it defeat its own ends .

		It is no longer admissible to decree that this or that department of thought merely caters to the gratification of idle curiosity .

		Time and time again researches begun through purely intellectual yearnings have yielded an ample return in social service .

		Gen - erally speaking , the greatest results are achieved when a sense for practical neces - sities is coupled with a grasp of theoreti - cal principles .

		It was thus that Helm - holtz , at once physician and physicist , came to invent the ophthalmoscope .

		So far as the older sciences are con - cerned our Gradgrinds have surrendered .

		The ultimate constitution of matter and the theory of relativity are not matters to arouse their enthusiasm any more than the philological exegesis of an Homeric text .

		But they know that physics and chemistry have revolutionized methods of produc - tion and transportation ; and they are will - ing to connive at the speculative dross that is somehow transmuted into the pure gold of aniline dyes , increased corn crops , and touring sedans .

		The newer branches of knowledge however are still suspect , for their uses are not so clear .

		As highbrow festoonings of academic bowers they may be tolerated , as one endures the piano - playing or other parlor accomplishments of an adolescent daughter ; but any con - nection with the vital affairs of life does not even loom as a possibility .

		Yet the development of psychology is instructive from this point of view .

		When Professor
Cattell	PERSON	less than fifteen years ago ventured a guess that people would come to consult the psychologist as they are now consulting physicians , his predic - tion roused skepticism in quarters where the study of mind was still linked with Aristotelian logic .

		Today we find trained psychologists with captains ' and majors ' commissions testing applicants for special army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	service ; pedagogical enig - mas are illuminated by inquiries into indi - vidual variability ; and that apparently most trivial of pursuits , the study of dreams , has become a powerful weapon in the hands of the psycho-analytic prac - titioner .

		Has anthropology likewise reached a stage where its conclusions may exert a potent influence on life ?

		The answer is an emphatic affirmative .

		The intensive preoccupation with such esoteric hobbies as cranial dimensions and basketry weaves , with quaint social usages and quainter re - ligious cults , is not without its wider bear - ings .

		Thinking particularly of those sur - vivals from savagery which hinder prog - ress and which anthropology marks out for removal ,
Tylor	PERSON	spoke of it as `` a re - former 's science . ''

		It is that and more .

		It is the universal prophylactic against loose thinking on practical problems that are ever with us ; it precludes views that are intellectually unsound and socially per - nicious but which the untutored mind almost automatically embraces because of their meretricious reasonableness .

		As
Graham Wallas	PERSON	has outlined the results of modern psychology that affect political thought , so it remains for some adventur - ous anthropologist to provide a corre - sponding vade mecum of knowledge alike for the statesman and the man in the street .

		For a moment 's reflection shows that there is really no escape from anthropol - ogy in the world of affairs .

		Every impor - tant issue , no matter what may be its other aspects , has also an anthropological phase .

		Consciously or unconsciously , therefore , the citizen is bound to assume an anthro - pological point of view .

		He may argue that private property is a necessity of human nature thereby postulating his omniscience as to the history of that insti - tution among the various groups of man - kind .

		He may decree that woman is or - ganically incapable of performing certain
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 99 tasks , or with the extreme feminists that her recent status is but a lapse from primeval glory ; and in either case he is , knowingly or unwittingly , attempting to summarize a body of anthropological data .

		Again , he is confronted with the Negro problem , and in arriving at a definite atti - tude he is obliged to operate with the anthropological concepts of racial inferi - ority or equality .

		Thus there is literally no escape from anthropology .

		Hume 's words , though in - tended to vindicate the value of psychol - ogy , may be quoted verbatim on behalf of the sister science : `` There ; s no question of importance whose decision is not com - prised in the science of man ; and there is none which can be decided with any cer - tainty before we become acquainted with that science . ''

		The only problem that looms ominously on the horizon is this : Shall the decisions reached on questions affecting human welfare be the dictates of chance , of the rule-of-thumb anthropology of the herd ignorant as to facts , anti- quated in point of view , shot through with traditional prejudice or thoughtless senti - mentalism ?

		Or shall it be the science of
today	DATE	, reared by the labors of dozens of trained and unbiased workers on the ashes of that folk-anthropology which bears to modern knowledge the relation which ancient astrology bears to astronomy , or medieval midwifery to obstetrics ?

		To ask the question is to answer it .

		Manifestly this is not the place to develop , even in outline , the science of applied anthropology , but an example or two may not be out of place .

		Among the doubting
Thomases	PERSON	who have watched the overthrow of the Czar the query has been broached whether the Russians could pos - sibly establish a modern democracy with - out previously passing through a stage of industrialism in consonance with the course of Western European history .

		This prob - lem reflects implicitly a definite view of human civilization , the so-called unilinear theory which assumes that mankind must everywhere conform to the same laws of evolution , every step being necessary at a certain stage of development .

		Now this view , which through
Lewis H. Morgan	PERSON	and his popularizers has attained an un - precedented vogue in lay circles , has been long discredited among professional an - thropologists .

		Doubtless certain condi - tions are favorable to certain sequels and there may be a limited degree of parallel evolution in different areas .

		But , broadly speaking , the supposed laws break down lamentably .

		Even in so relatively simple a phenomenon as the domestication of animals we find diversity rather than agreement .

		Thus , it would seem to the mind undebauched by ethnological learn - ing that the domestication of cattle must lead automatically to the milking of cows ; yet the Chinese and other East Asiatics have not taken to dairying in thousands of years of intimacy with the bovine species .

		On the other hand , it is a com - monplace of anthropology that wholly unexpected effects suddenly appear as a result of contact with other peoples .

		No group develops in splendid isolation from others ; all peoples derive the bulk of their cultural possessions from alien sources .

		There was no possible way for the ancient Scandinavians to progress unaided from the stone to the bronze age , for the tin prerequisite for the alloy was lacking in their country ; yet through contact with populations free from this limitation they were started on the highroad to a loftier civilization .

		To return to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is of course possible that certain conditions exist that hinder the establishment of a stable re - public there .

		But to regard a preceding era of industrialism as indispensable is to exalt the discarded theory of an earlier generation into an immutable dogma .

		To the statesman who has kept in touch with anthropological thought , that source of confusion at least will be spared .

		Of greater importance still is the rela - tion of race , language , and culture ; for without a correct comprehension of these basic concepts many practical questions can not be sanely envisaged .

		To take a single illustration from current war liter - ature .

		We are frequently assured that the character now displayed by the Germans has been distinctively theirs from the be - ginning of history , that it represents accordingly an organic trait .

		Now this view involves a series of anthropological postulates , some of which are demon - strably ridiculous .

		In the first place , the assumption is made that the Germans rep - resent a single stock ; yet this is not even 100 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 15	DATE	true of the Prussians .

		Any large random assemblage of Germans that is , natives of the artificial political unit known as the
German Empire	ORGANIZATION	reveals the fairly long - headed , blue-eyed , flaxen-haired giant from
Oldenburg	PERSON	jostling the round-pated , mid - dle-sized or short burgher from
Baden	PERSON	with his jet-black hair and tawny com - plexion .

		The two represent quite distinct Caucasian subraces , the Nordic and the Alpine .

		If human types differing in phys - ical traits also differ in their mental and moral manifestations , then we can not speak of the organic deficiencies of Ger - mans , but only of the Nordic or the Alpine Germans .

		Here , however , we are confronted with a significant fact .

		The Nordic German is indistinguishable from the
North Euro	LOCATION	- pean type as found , say , in
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		Hence whatever iniquities are organically the property of North Ger - mans must be shared by Britons and Scan - dinavians .

		On the other hand , the Alpine German is racially identical with the Swiss and a vast portion of the French , Italian , and Slavic peoples .

		Hence those traits which the Alpine German displays not be - cause of training but through his con - genital make-up must appear in equal measure among his congeners - of French , Italian , and Slavic speech or national affiliation .

		The conclusion is obvious .

		We are not dealing with organic differences at all , but with differences of tradition and training .

		The practical consequences of this conclusion are enormous .

		For if moral iniquity were an ineradicable trait of Ger - man nature , we could not stop short of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's jocular counsel to extirpate Ger - man women as the seed-bed of such infamy .

		But if the undesirable traits are the results of nurture , then a change of traditions and cultural atmosphere suffices .

		Thus a knowl - edge of the most elementary anthropologi - cal facts clarifies at once the international situation and serves as a preventive against the insane statecraft of the hysterical ob - scurantist .

		It is possibly no mere accident that anthropological courses have taken firm root in our Western state universities .

		In these much maligned centers of citricul - tural research and pomological experimen - tation there is often a larger vision as to essential educational activities than in the older privately endowed institutions .

		It may be in no small measure a glimpse of such wider practical bearings as I have suggested that has led to the rise of our largest anthropological school under the leadership of Professor
A. L. Kroeber	PERSON	of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		With still more assurance we can attribute the recent founding of a chair of anthropology at
the University of Washington	ORGANIZATION	to a growing confidence in the prophylactic usefulness of the science of Man .

		Ex occidente lux !


ROBERT H. LOWIE	PERSON	.

		Two Poems GHETTO TWILIGHT An infinite weariness comes into the faces of the old tenements As they stand massed together on the block , Tall and thoughtfully silent , In the enveloping twilight .

		Pensively , They eye each other across the street Through their dim windows With a sad recognizing stare , Watching the red glow fading in the distance , At the end of the street , Behind the black church spires ; Watching the vague sky lowering overhead , Purple with clouds of colored smoke From the extinguished sunset ; Watching the tired faces coming home from work Like dry-breasted hags Welcoming their children to their withered arms .

		NOCTURNE As we walked there by the park-wall The moon went with us all the way , Shining from behind the trees Big and round and yellow Like a Chinese lantern Dangling from the dark sky By some invisible thread ; As we walked there by the park-wall The moon followed us all the way , Big-faced and piteous , Like a wild creature Snared behind the impenetrable network of the trees ; As we stopped there in the doorway The moon watched us all the time , Yellow-faced and envious , Like a jealous lover Peering through the lattice of the trees .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 101 Our
London	LOCATION	Letter How unpleasant it would be to think of sit - ting down to compose a ``
London	LOCATION	Letter '' in mid-July if I were actually in
London	LOCATION	.

		But at the moment of writing I am a hundred miles away and can settle to the business with com - parative calmness of mind and in relative fresh - ness of air .

		But the air is not too fresh .

		There has been no rain here to speak of for weeks ; and today there is only just enough , at long intervals , to shake one 's faith in the brilliant sun that appears in between just enough , I may say , to make it seem the better part to settle down to this letter instead of sauntering to the top of
Dover	LOCATION	's Hill , there dreamily to survey the surrounding country or to sleep .

		For I am in
Gloucestershire	LOCATION	now , though to - morrow I shall be in
London	LOCATION	and there shall finish and post this letter , which will be suffi - cient excuse , I hope , for dating it from the city of my abomination .

		The fact may perhaps seem irrelevant to the matter I have in hand .

		I wrote it down , indeed , for the sheer joy of writing it ; but now that it is written I can see a certain relevance in it .

		For some such country town as this occupies a space , perhaps a disproportion - ate space , in the universe of nearly every Lon - doner who occupies himself with the dusty busi - ness of polite letters .

		Here I came by accident two years ago , choosing the place at random on the map as a good jumping-off point for walk - ing a couple of hundred miles down to the sea ; and here I had an experience which , I think , is not uncommon but which I shall proceed to relate .

		The road from the station was long , bare and dusty , and mostly up-hill .

		We came into the town late in the afternoon .

		There is only one street , very wide , lying in a gentle curve from north to south .

		All the houses are built of Cotswold stone , which is of a grayish color in winter , but in
summer	DATE	, when all the damp is sweated out of it , glows golden-yellow in the sun .

		They have steeply roofs and high gables , covered with slats of the same stone .

		The gables are characteristic .

		One architect here liked his so much that he refused to spoil them by run - ning a gutter round them and ran it direct through the rooms instead .

		-LRB- In that house , rumor says , they take turns with the bath-water , passing it on by the gutter when it is done with ... -RRB- Most of the houses were built before the
Civil Wars	ORGANIZATION	, some of them consider - ably earlier .

		The street can not have presented in the seventeenth century an aspect very differ - ent from that which it presents now .

		A few dignified late Georgian houses were built when the Napoleonic Wars raised the price of corn and enriched the farmers ; but that is all .

		We came in , I say , late in the afternoon .

		Nobody stirred in the street .

		A large dusty dog slept in the middle of the road .

		The inn signs there is one inn per hundred inhabi - tants hung quite motionless ; and there was a sky of brilliant blue and white , over the golden houses , such as I have never seen ex - cept in the
Cotswolds	LOCATION	.

		When we swore that here some day we should live , we were only making a resolution that members of the liter - ary community carry into effect every day in great numbers .

		I doubt if we ever really shall .

		The choice defines itself with disagreeable clear - ness when one comes close to it either live in the country and regret
London	LOCATION	or live in Lon - don and sigh for the country .

		It is better , per - haps , not to realize the ideal .

		After all , the houses and the hills and the lanes are always here when one wants them ; but friends forget one , and one grows out of one 's occupations , and these things can not be replaced .

		Yet everywhere writers are forsaking the town and settling in the country .

		Fleet Street flings out an ever widening circle of her dis - gusted children , with Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	at
Horsham	ORGANIZATION	in
Sussex	LOCATION	, Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	at
Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	in
Buckingham	LOCATION	, Mr.
Wells	PERSON	at Dunmow in
Essex	LOCATION	, and innumerable colonies of poets , painters , and what not in the
South Downs	LOCATION	and the
Surrey Downs	LOCATION	, in
Berkshire	LOCATION	and
Gloucestershire	ORGANIZATION	and Hampshire ^ It all began with the cult of the Knapsack and the Broken Boot , which sprang from Borrow , which
Stevenson	PERSON	made literary , and which Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	elevated to the level of a dogma .

		Just as once the literary man had to be urbane and to enjoy the smell of the pave - ment , so now he must like tramping and want to carry his pajamas and toothbrush romantically in a little bag slung over his shoulders .

		And one by one these sophisticated vagrants have found the ideal spot and have settled there .

		It both indicates and induces a feeling for nature which is very different from that of the Romantics .

		They , with the occasional excep - tion of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, had a predilection for Chasms , Precipices ,
Caverns	ORGANIZATION	, Waterfalls , and Forests .

		We like a country that has been sub - jected to man ; we like woods , fields , hedges , haystacks , and villages at convenient distances apart .

		After all , I think , the countryside of
England	LOCATION	is the most characteristic English thing there is ; and it is fast disappearing .

		But litera - 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	ture is after it and is describing it as it has never been described before .

		It is destined to survive after all and to make another tradition , which no doubt will in time grow to be arti - ficial and divorced from reality .

		But at the moment it is a real and potent and on the whole a very healthful influence .

		This rather lengthy digression is excusable apart from its own enormous intrinsic value on the ground that literature in
London	LOCATION	has been very quiet recently .

		We are really begin - ning to feel the pinch for paper .

		It began by snuffing out the aspirants altogether and next hampered recent comers to the profession .

		Now it is squeezing the famous , and
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	knows where it will stop .

		A publisher offered a new novel , by Sir
Hall Caine	PERSON	or Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, of the length which these writers usually favor , would probably have to produce it at a loss .

		I can not say that I should feel very much for him .

		A publisher told me the other day that a book which sold before the war at five shillings ought to cost twenty-five shillings now .

		I rather sus - pect that he was multiplying his own and every - body else 's profit except , probably , the author 's royalties as well as the cost of production ; but anyway if costs have gone up to such an extent , a publisher who can carry on without ruin on a paltry increase of twenty per cent , or so must have been doing very well before the war .

		Meanwhile the only literary event of any importance has been the publication of an address by the Poet Laureate , entitled `` The Necessity of Poetry '' -LRB- Clarendon Press ; 2s -RRB- .

		It was delivered to the
Tredegar	ORGANIZATION	and
District Cooperative Society	ORGANIZATION	; and Dr. Bridges suggests that he felt that in lecturing on poetry , a thing he much dislikes , he was `` doing his bit . ''

		He is , of course , besides being Poet Laureate , a most distinguished poet with many lovely creations to his credit ; and what is more than these things , he is a poet whom the younger generation is willing to revere and to accept , in some meas - ure , as a master .

		For this reason considerable interest attaches to any pronouncement from him on the subject of poetry .

		I must own however that I found his lecture somewhat arid and uninteresting .

		He was obviously afraid of boring his audience and unwilling to palm off on them empty generalizations which he would have known for worthless and of which he would have been ashamed .

		He therefore com - promised by speaking of difficult matters but handling them so gingerly as not to extract any profit from them .

		And so much still remains to be done in matters , which however , it may be argued , the
Tredegar Cooperative Society	ORGANIZATION	was not prepared to listen to .

		But Dr. Bridges might some day , somewhere go deeper than the dictum that the mind is full of concepts and that free and spontaneous movement of these is genius and produces poetry .

		He might have been more exhaustive on the origin of the pleas - ure we take in meters than he showed himself in saying that the ear is delighted by delicately managed deviations from a fixed standard .

		But the advance of psychology renders it more than ever possible to apply the scientific method to the elucidation of the nature of poetry , and indeed of all the arts .

		I do not mean that there is not something in poetic inspiration which is probably forever beyond the .

		grasp of the mere intellect .

		But I do believe that we include in this Unknowable many things which are capable of being known ; and I do believe that careful investigation of the inexplicable element , under - taken by somebody of imaginative sympathy , would give us a clearer notion of it .

		Would that a new
William James	PERSON	should arise !

		Mean - while Dr. Bridges is understood to be prepar - ing for publication the poems of his friend the late Father
Gerard Hopkins	PERSON	, and this is an announcement that may be received with pleas - ure .

		These poems have been long the secret de - light of a very few and have sometimes been used as a mere name to overawe the uninitiated .

		They combine , I believe , a strange but genuine poetic exuberance and exaltation with very strange prosodical theory and practice .

		Soon we shall know all about them .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 103 Democracy 's Permanent Task DEMOCRACY AFTER THE WAR .

		By
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		This book by the dean of English liberals and economists is the very distillation of wisdom .

		It exposes with sureness and clarity the complex of forces and motives which present a solid front to democracy , the vicious circle of reaction .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	calls the first half of his book , in which this task is so persuasively accomplished , `` The Enemies of Democracy . ''

		If his volume were to end there so sane and concrete and humanistic is his picture of the formidable bloc of illiberal power , which in its heart hates - democracy and all its works the reader might be pardoned for giving way to despair for the future .

		The cita - del of privilege and prestige looks well-nigh impregnable .

		Yet in the second half of the book , `` The Defence of Democracy , '' Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	does point the way .

		to permanent victory the only possible and therefore , being possible , the only de - sirable way , I am convinced .

		It is not the plea of a particularist reformer ; it is not any specious panacea evolved from the emotional distress oc - casioned by the war .

		It is the counsel , springing from expert knowledge and broad sympathy , for a general method of approach , an irrefutable ar - gument for organized and conscious democratic will and purpose .

		It does not ignore the hard facts ; it admits the grave dangers of possible defeat .

		There is none of that kind of fatuous optimism which assumes that democracy will necessarily come into its own if we merely wait for the hands of the clock to move round far enough .

		`` Facts are what they are , and the consequences of them will be what they will be .

		Why , then , should we wish to deceive ourselves ? ''

		asked
Bishop Butler	PERSON	.

		And it is this hard - headedness and objectivity , coupled with genuine concern for a more decent life for the great bulk of exploited human beings , which gives to Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's book its immediate importance and last - ing value .

		What is this vicious circle of reaction , this thing to be attacked , against which democracy must struggle for its very life ?

		It is an unholy alliance -LRB- and often an unconscious alliance -RRB- be - tween various forces , expressing its tendencies as these are sometimes stabilized in certain concrete institutions .

		It is the bureaucratic state , in so far ^ as the state attempts to resist the encroach - ments of popular attacks on vested interests ; it is the church , jn so far as the church , with whatever good intentions , attempts to take the edge off popular discontent by offering spiritual consolation for the discomforts of this world ; it is the law , in so far as the law attempts to make legal precedent a protection for the rights of improperty -LRB- as
Hobson	PERSON	terms unearned incre - ment -RRB- ; it is protectionism and imperialism , in so far as they attempt to promote national rivalries and economic jealousies leading invariably to war ; it is secret diplomacy , in so far as secret diplomacy attempts to use the whole force of a nation in the dark ; it is the press , in so far as the press attempts to keep the popular mind fluid and irresponsible so that public opinion can not formulate a definite course of action in terms of general welfare .

		Not only do these forces at - tempt to preserve the economic status quo ; they actually do , to a large extent , succeed .

		And militarism is their child , as it is their protector .

		Yet it would be the worst of folly to concentrate upon merely the economic side of the reactionary alliance .

		For the intensity of the reactionary drive comes from a much more irrational and instinctive background than any cold calculation of self-interest .

		This is the conventional fallacy of the socialists .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	is far from saying that the socialists are wrong in their essential analysis ; on the contrary , he says they are basic - ally right .

		But a good diagnostician is not neces - sarily a good doctor .

		And the common man does not like to be called `` materialistic , '' as he invari - ably is when he concentrates his criticism on the typical forms of economic injustice .

		So it comes about that by skilful exploitation of the instincts of vanity , prestige , of the desire for nobility or distinction describe it hostilely or favorably , as you will the very criticism -LRB- economic -RRB- which is most relevant to the existing situation is viti - ated at its source .

		Critics of the present order will not get very far so long as they fail to recognize the human and psychological aura of feelings , vanities , and desires in which every hard economic fact is wrapped .

		That is why Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	believes there is more to be gained tacti - cally by an `` appeal to reason , '' skilfully engi - neered , to the dominant class than by shrill vituperation .

		This , not because the vituperation is not deserved , but merely on account of strategy , a strategy which those most in sympathy with democracy far too often betray by their impul - siveness .

		How then shall democracy be victorious in its struggle against the vast array of forces bent on its undoing ?

		Certainly not by abandoning the state , as syndicalists sometimes suggest in their despair at the ineffectiveness of political action .

		104 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	After all , the state , like the poor , we have always with us , and after the war it will be more rather than less necessary to employ its instrumentalities .

		Industrial , financial , commercial , and economic laissez-faire doctrines are an expensive luxury which * the impoverished world after the war will not be able to afford .

		The wastes of political control of industry and production are still enor - mous and will continue to be until there is something like professional and scientific manage - ment .

		But the wastes of the old type of business competition are disastrous .

		So the question of whether or not the state shall continue to direct the main economic and industrial activities is largely academic .

		The only question is who shall control the state .

		The ultimate hope must then be that democracy capture the state as a whole .

		For , as Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	says , the only cure for the capitalistic state is not to abandon it , but to make it completely democratic .

		Now to capture the state as a whole , democracy needs primarily to unite to emerge from the ineffective particularism of special reforms into a general democratic unity .

		Like
Austria	LOCATION	, reac - tionism has preserved its power by observing the old rule of divide and conquer .

		One needs only to follow the trail of any specific reform to see how it leads back invariably to the need of a general victory , rather than of a series of minor victories , for democracy .

		Every advance is indis - solubly , if subtly , bound up with the success of an advance as a whole .

		It must be a major and general offensive against privilege and prestige rather than a succession of minor and tactical attacks .

		Foreign policy can not be democratized unless the state is democratized ; but the state can not be democratized until labor and industry are democratized ; neither can labor and industry be effectively changed until general education is made liberal , and education will be stultified as long as the press is left to the exploiters of pas - sion and unreason .

		And so at whatever point we confront the reactionary circle we find that for democracy to win it must become united and must attack not single things but the entire whole simultaneously .

		More specifically , the two chief types of prob - lems which will confront democracy after the war will group around the two complementary eco - nomic phenomena of production and distribution or consumption .

		Now concerning production Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	frankly warns labor that it must once and for all abandon its terror of in - creased production in so far as that increase is not the result of added direct toil but of `` dilu - tion '' of labor , scientific management , better organization , and so on .

		For it can be statisti - cally shown that even the pre-war income of an entire nation without the excessive expenditures on armaments involved in belligerency would not , were it equally distributed , suffice for a full life for each person in the democracy .

		In
Great Britain	LOCATION	, for example , it would be a mere
$ 680	MONEY	a year for an average family of four .

		Everyone of course now realizes that productivity in peace essentials has been seriously impaired by the war , and that the need for increased production will be necessarily greater when hostilities finally end .

		For some time , too , large armaments are likely to be a regular feature of every nation 's economic life .

		There can be no question that increased productivity is a necessity .

		Yet the suspicion of labor before the demand for it is understandable .

		When , in the past , has labor been assured that the products of increased production would be equitably distributed ?

		Again , the only way to allay that suspicion is for democracy to capture the state .

		For the complementary problem of consump - tion or distribution of wealth is largely a question of taxation , wage fixing , expenditure on public works , and so on all problems which will be solved - or muddled through according as political action is wise or foolish , according , for a specific example , as the incidence of taxation falls pri - marily upon all the different types of improperty .

		And once more democracy is forced to the difficult necessity for capturing the state as a whole .

		Yet capturing the state , as the experience of this war has too painfully shown , means much more than merely capturing a parliamentary or -LRB- as in our own case -RRB- Congressional majority through the effective exercise of the adult fran - chise .

		For modern legislation is merely a kind of blank check to be filled in by administrative bureaus .

		Our own
Interstate Commerce	ORGANIZATION	Com - mission , for instance , exercises a function which might not unjustly be described as legislative , with an appeal against its legislation to the reviewing body of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	this has been its inevitable and unconscious development .

		There - fore if democracy is to capture the state as a whole , it needs to develop those trained technicians and experts who can combine scientific knowledge with broad democratic sympathies .

		This in its turn demands the broadening of education , the reform of the press , the organization in unity of attack all along the line , the necessity for which Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	so unassailably reveals in his book .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL , 105 Will democracy succeed in its permanent task ?

		Here are the possibilities which make for a negative answer : The forces of reaction will be more closely consoli - dated than before , more conscious of their community of interest and of the part which they respectively can play in the maintenance of `` social order . ''

		They will have had recent and striking testimony to the submis - sive and uncritical character of the people , and of their own ability to impose their arbitrary will upon the conduct of affairs in which the popular temper was supposed to be most sensitive .

		They will have at their disposal a large number of new legal instruments of coercion and the habits of obeying them derived from several years of use .

		The popular mind will have been saturated with sentiments and ideas favorable to a constructive policy of national defence , Imperialism , Protectionism , and bureaucratic Socialisrn making for a close
State	ORGANIZATION	under class control with the empty forms of representative government .

		AH the educative and suggestive institutions , Church , schools and universi - ties , Press , places of amusement , will be poisoned with false patriotism and class domination masquerading as national unity .

		That is the black side of the picture .

		On the other side these forces are making for a new world : A powerful fund of genuine democratic feeling will be liberated with the peace .

		The temper of the peoples , released from the tension of war , will be irritable and suspicious , and this irritability and sus - picion , copiously fed by stories of governmental incompetence and capitalistic greed in the conduct of the war , and sharpened by personal sacrifices and privations , will be dangerous for governments .

		The contrast between the liberties for which they were fighting and the new restraints to / which they are subjected will be disconcerting and instructive .

		Every trade and every locality will have its special difficulties and grievances .

		Economic and financial troubles will everywhere break up the artificial national unity of war-time , and the grave political cleavages that must display themselves when the issues of taxation , per - manent conscription ,
State	ORGANIZATION	ownership of industries , imperial federation , and international relations open out , will , by breaking the old moulds of party , set free large volumes of political energy for new experi - ments in political and economic reconstruction .

		Many of the old taboos of class prestige , sex distinction , sanctity of property , and settled modes of living and of thinking , will be broken for large sections of the population .

		The returning armies will carry back into their homes and industries powerful reactions against militarism and will not be disposed to take lying down the attempt of the reactionists to incorpo - rate it as a fixed institution in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In every country of
Europe	LOCATION	popular discontent will be seething and suspicions against rulers gathering .

		In other words , all the factors of violent or pacific revolution will exist in conscious activity .

		The raw material and energy for a great democratic movement will be at hand , provided that thought , organization , and direc - tion can make them effective .

		Here is the real issue and the permanent con - flict .

		The cleavage has never been stated more soundly or more succinctly .

		HAROLD STEARNS .

		The Meaning of Architecture THE MEANING OF ARCHITECTURE .

		By
Irving K. Pond	PERSON	.

		Marshall Jones ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		A book with such a title , published at a time when architecture as an art is moribund , arouses only the expectation of the usual dish of intellec - tual prunes canned opinions on Classic and Gothic of the kind that are dished up by writers and lecturers on aesthetics .

		The more so , since the name of the author ,
Irving K. Pond	PERSON	, is an un - familiar one to the mere reader of books .

		But Mr.
Pond	PERSON	is a `` prune-hater , '' a man of powerful and original mind and indomitable will .

		After many years of striving with the recalcitrant ma - terials with which architects are forced to deal , and after long brooding over the problems they are required to solve , he has given us in this book the final distillation of a lifetime of thought and endeavor embodied in one of those generic root - ideas , so vital that , in the exaggerated language of Oriental proverbial philosophy , `` if you were to tell this to a dry stick , branches would grow and leaves sprout from it . ''

		This unpretentious little volume disposes of whole libraries of archi - tectural comment and criticism .

		The central and controlling idea of Mr.
Pond	PERSON	's book is that architecture should always and every - where express the action and interplay of those powerful invisible physical forces which deter - mine form and structure .

		From an engineering standpoint no building is inert in the large sense ; there is always compression and tension a sub - mission to , or a striving against , some manner of pull , thrust , or strain .

		Conceived of in this way , every building is , as it were , a theater for the play of concealed forces , a drama which only the technically trained mind can fully grasp and archi - tectural art fully render .

		Just as it is the part of the dramatist to present and make intelligible and articulate that subsurface warfare of temper - ament and character which is the very texture of social life , so it is the architect 's business to dram - atize to the eye of the beholder the effort of the building to become a roofed enclosure , to triumph by reconcilement and adjustment over those natu - ral forces which both maintain and threaten it .

		Without such dramatization by the architect , in the form of external expression and symboliza - tion , the building would be voiceless to the be - holder and therefore without interest a work of engineering merely just as without the poet , novelist , dramatist , the comedie humaine would not make the same imaginative appeal .

		Stated thus briefly and baldly , there perhaps 106 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 15	DATE	appears to be nothing new in this idea .

		It em - bodies a not unfamiliar truth , however little hon - ored by use or by observance .

		But in the hands of Mr.
Pond	PERSON	this truth takes on new meanings , enforces itself upon our acceptance in novel and surprising ways .

		His detailed analysis of the op - eration of those natural forces which determine form and structure , his correlation of them with the forces operative in human life , and his por - trayal of the amazing and beautiful manner in which they find symbolic expression in the great buildings of the past constitute the major excel - lence of his book .

		The suggestions it contains as to new ways in which the same thing may be accomplished now , are of more debatable value .

		But the development and presentation of an hy - pothesis so reasonable , illuminating , and suggest - ive is itself an achievement of the highest type .

		In no spirit of disparagement it must be said that in his literary and pictorial presentation the author has done somewhat less than justice to his theme .

		To the informed and educated reader the book is clear , and if he be sufficiently imaginative and open-minded , convincing ; but for lay uses , in certain parts and passages it perhaps presup - poses too great a familiarity with the technical language used by architects and engineers .

		Mr.
Pond	PERSON	's personal applications of his theory , though always interesting , are sometimes not wholly con - vincing , and they are made less so by the purely linear method of rendering employed .

		Photo - graphs of executed work would have been better , and they would have made clear a fact of which the book fails to inform the reader , that Mr.
Pond	PERSON	is an architect of structures full of individu - ality and imagination which are at the same time logical and practical .

		It is only when one comes to the matter of the creation of new ornamental motifs that there is a distinct consciousness of failure on the part of Mr.
Pond	PERSON	not a failure of theory , but of its applica - tion .

		The ability to create original ornament is perhaps the rarest in the whole range of art , and it is plain that Mr.
Pond	PERSON	possesses it not , just as in presence of one of Mr.
Louis Sullivan	PERSON	's build - ings it is plain that he carries it in his waistcoat pocket .

		This only means that the fairy god - mother who has the bestowal of this gift was ab - sent from the cradle of the one and present at that of the other : it does not in the least invalidate the principles enunciated by Mr.
Pond	PERSON	.

		Meanwhile this volume is one of the most original , penetrat - ing , constructive books on architecture yet written by an American .

		AMERICA AMONG THE POWERS .

		By
H. H. Powers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		M.
Cestre	ORGANIZATION	's book reminds me of a saying of Pascal : `` Time composes old quarrels , because one changes .

		Neither the offender nor the of - fended is any longer himself .

		It is like a people whom we have irritated and whom we meet again after two generations ; we are still French , but not the same . ''

		The English and the French have irritated each other often enough .

		For two centuries and a half the rivalry of these two peoples was so constant that it could be taken as a postulate of European diplomacy .

		Yet within a short generation they have composed their quar - rels ; and now that Englishmen are freely giving their lives to defend
Paris	LOCATION	it is not strange if they should appear , in the eyes of the French , `` still English but not the same . ''

		It is in this new light that
M. Cestre	PERSON	writes of
England	LOCATION	.


M. Cestre	PERSON	is too much of a Frenchman not to endeavor to see things as in themselves they really are ; and if his book is essentially an apology for
England	LOCATION	, it is by no means an apology inspired by blind admiration .

		He is not unaware of the `` realism '' of English policy , of the interested char - acter of English diplomacy , of the less defensible episodes in English history .

		But this , he thinks , is not the time to stress these things `` not the place to insist upon the shortcomings of the Eng - lish conscience . ''

		This is the time to insist upon the excellent side of English character and upon the notable achievements of
England	LOCATION	in the cause of human progress .

		M. Cestre might , in fact , have appropriately entitled his book `` What Eng - land Has Done for Liberty . ''

		He accordingly portrays the English as Frenchmen have rarely portrayed them : he portrays them as they might wish to see themselves , in terms of their better selves and their higher aspirations ; and he inter - prets their history as shaped , almost in spite of themselves , by these transcendent forces to noble ends .

		There is , indeed , a certain Hegelian flavor in
M. Cestre	ORGANIZATION	's fundamental thesis that the history of
England	LOCATION	and the history of
France	LOCATION	are the con - crete manifestations of the two vital principles of liberty and equality .

		It is true that the English -LRB- practical realists , but never surrendering to a
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 107 crass materialism -RRB- have always attended to their own interests and have never waged war without first calculating the profit to be obtained by it ; but the result of attending to their own interests has been to make
England	LOCATION	, without any such idealistic purpose on her part , the mother of lib - erty and the defender of small nations the de - fender of small nations , for the most part , against
France	LOCATION	, since
France	LOCATION	has , formerly , been con - cerned less with liberty than with equality , moved less by realistic aims than by devotion to certain abstract and universal principles .

		So often in conflict in the past , these two peoples have never - theless derived benefit each from the other ; the result of which is that in recent years
England	LOCATION	has moved in the direction of equality , and has taken on something of the spirit of French ideal - ism , while
France	LOCATION	has learned the value of the practical realistic spirit of
England	LOCATION	, and has be - come devoted to liberty as the English under - stand it .

		These , apart from all the concrete accidents of history , are the substantial influences that have brought
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	to stand together in this crucial world war .

		Not exempt from wrong-doing in the past ... they have learned the lessons of experience and have sub - mitted to the guidance of their better selves .

		Today they have foresworn ambition and conquest : they are striving to uphold certain lasting principles , born of groping endeavor , fostered silently through the ages , and matured in the light of their genius .

		English Lib - erty and French Equality constitute the base of all na - tional greatness in the present and of all international progress in the future .

		The alliance between the - two countries , since they stand for the `` same ideals , '' is no temporary affair .

		The friendship of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	is indissoluble .

		... The alliance will endure through the recipro - cal moderation of the two nations , through their trust - fulness , their veneration of right , and through their love of peace ... The two great nations are jour - neying henceforward hand in hand , united by a last - ing friendship destined to be surest guarantee of the peace of the world .

		One can at least hope that it may indeed be so .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	, I should guess , is not much sus - tained by such hopes .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	looks at things in a quite different light from
M. Cestre	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is not willing to overlook , even temporarily , what
M. Cestre	PERSON	calls the `` shortcomings of the English conscience , '' nor for that matter the shortcomings of anybody 's conscience , least of all the shortcom - ings of the American conscience .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	is one of those who pride themselves on `` looking facts in the face . ''

		He has the air of saying : `` Come , now , look at this object ; it is n't pretty , I admit , but there it is ; what 's the use of blink - ing \ He knows well that his tender-minded readers will often wish to interject the `` ought to be '' into the argument , and he has accordingly provided himself with a rough and effective answer to all such amiable considerations : `` That is not the point , '' he will say , the point being al - ways to find out simply what is the fact and to make the most of it .

		And how can you make the most of facts if you do not look them in the face ?

		With many people , looking the facts in the face means no more than that the disagreeable aspect of things is what chiefly strikes them .

		Mr.
Pow	PERSON	- ers is not to be dismissed by any such easy formula as this far from it but the number of disagree - able facts which he begs us to look at courage - ously is , at all events , extraordinary ; so much so that one wonders whether he is not sometimes given to turning the facts around in order to find out whether they have not a concealed disagree - able side to look at .

		It is nevertheless a very right attitude the desire to see things as in them - selves they really are more particularly perhaps at the present time , when we are in danger of see - ing ourselves somewhat too much in a `` light that never was on sea or land . ''

		It is Mr.
Powers	PERSON	's part to dispel the mists that create illusion ; and his book `` America Among the Nations '' is a use - ful effort in that direction , a kind of bracing north wind that falls not badly on the humid lower air of present-day emotionalism .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	would have us understand that
America	LOCATION	is now , and must be for all time to come , among the nations ; but chiefly he would have us understand that , being there , she had best look out , and watch her step , and calculate her chances , and be prepared for the worst , and not be duped at all hazards not be duped by temporary friendships and amenities .

		The days of our comfortable isolation are over ; for the world has grown something too small , and every people wants , necessarily and rightly , its place in the sun .

		The thing of prime importance , there - fore , is to be aware of this fact and of what it im - plies .

		What it chiefly implies is that at any time , by even slight shifts of circumstances , any or all nations may find in us their proper prey .

		`` We shall never be ... alive to our real danger until we can believe that a nation almost any nation when tempted by a great opportunity or driven by a great need , will despoil its neighbor . ''

		On
January 1 , 1870	DATE	,
Ruskin	PERSON	noted , as an evil sign , that we English ... are in much bodily fear ; that is to say , afraid of the Russians ; afraid of the
Prus	PERSON	- sians ; afraid of the Americans ; afraid of the Hin - doos ; afraid of the Chinese ; afraid of the Japanese ; afraid of the
New Zealanders	LOCATION	; and afraid of the
Caf	ORGANIZATION	- 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	fres : and very rightly so , being conscious that our only real desire respecting any of these nations has been to get as much out of them as we could .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	would hardly think this an evil sign ; for he counsels us to put fear in our hearts , the fear of God too , no doubt , but above all the fear of the powers , great and little .

		The little as well as the great ; the `` unf eared powers , '' such as Hol - land ,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	these have all unsuspected possibilities of disaster for us : `` Even
Bulgaria	LOCATION	may be our undoing . ''

		It goes without saying that the great powers will be , as they have al - ways been much more , indeed , than they have ever been our chief menace .

		That the present war is something peculiar , something unique and out of place , perversely brought on by
Germany	LOCATION	; that the defeat of
Germany	LOCATION	will usher in the mil - lenium of peace and good will this is to regard hopes instead of realities .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	does not doubt that we must defeat
Germany	LOCATION	; but aggres - sion is a potential characteristic of all people , and in the nature of things new menaces and new con - flicts will arise .

		`` The struggle is with
Germany	LOCATION	today .

		It will be with
Russia	LOCATION	tomorrow . ''

		It would be interesting to inquire whether Mr.
Powers	PERSON	derives his philosophy from the facts he looks at , or whether the facts he looks at so intently are determined by his philosophy .

		His philosophy , at all events , is an old one , and ex - tremely simple .

		It is that `` doctrines do not deter - mine destiny , but destiny determines doctrines . ''

		Climate in large measure determines physical exertion , or the lack of it ; and `` intellectual activi - ties are in themselves a by-product of physical exertion . ''

		In hot climates physical exertion is slight and intellectual activity correspondingly diminished ; from which it follows -LRB- and history bears it out -RRB- that , politically and industrially speaking , tropical peoples are and must remain in - ferior and `` backward '' peoples , and must accord - ingly be taken in hand by more energetic and ad - vanced peoples ; that is to say , by us , to the end that the resources of these countries , which are in - creasingly convenient for our purposes , may be obtained .

		Since we need rubber and have the abil - ity to get it , we can not help taking the tropical people in hand ; any more than they , having fewer needs and less ability , can help being the kind of people that have to be taken in hand by us .

		It is true that what we have done -LRB- and will do -RRB- to `` backward '' peoples does not square with certain treasured and oft repeated documents , such as the Declaration of Independence and the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	Address ; but this is only one of the facts that must be faced , and one of many which prove that `` doctrines do not determine destiny . ''

		What determines destiny is a complex of im - personal forces , of which the individual is a part , but of which he is not the master .

		It is this com - plex of impersonal forces that drives nations into war .

		Nations do not fight to make money , nor to force open the doors of trade .

		Nor do they rally as slaves to serve the ambitions of an autocrat .

		They are moved by great common impulses , which individually they do not understand , to do things which individually they do not enjoy , to seek ends from which individu - ally they do not profit .

		If this seems irrational , it is because our reasoning has taken account only of the individual life ... All attempts to translate this `` oversoul '' of the nation into terms of the individual life have been in vain and must always be in vain .

		To give it tangibility and substance is to degrade and falsify it .

		It envelopes us in an intangible atmosphere of emotion which expresses itself only in symbols .

		In comparison , our lives of the moment forget to assert their little claims .

		The materialistic pacifist may jeer and argue , but men will worship still .

		The cult may be folly , but it is folly to forget that it is a cult .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	's philosophy is good Hegelian too , not so pure Hegelian as the philosophy of
M. Cestre	PERSON	but still Hegelian ,
Hegelianism	PERSON	plus a little of
Karl Marx	PERSON	and
Darwin	PERSON	, and touched with the emotional exaltation of
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's `` White Man 's Burden . ''

		The fundamental .

		assumption in this philosophy is that disastrous assumption which lies implicit in most nineteenth - century thought the assumption that man can - not by taking thought shape his own destiny , since he is himself only part and parcel of a natural process , inextricably enmeshed in the com - plexly threaded forces that uselessly move the cosmos along its uncharted course .

		It is the philosophy of Romanticism , of the Historic Rights school of
Savigny	LOCATION	and
Ranke	PERSON	, of the social theories that derive from
Spencer	PERSON	and
Darwin	PERSON	.

		It is the philosophy of the new Imperialism which flourished in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	in the eighties and nineties , and which has been systematized and elaborated and ruthlessly applied by Ger - many .

		It is a philosophy which , in the name of an uncontrolled idealistic elan vital , bids you do others before they do you .

		It might be main - tained with good show of reason that , in the deep - est sense of all , we are fighting this war in order to reduce this philosophy to a reductio ad adsur - dum .

		In justice to Mr. Powers it should be said that he is not rigidly consistent , which is one of the things that make his book thoroughly worth read - ing and thinking about .

		He says many fine and true things about
America	LOCATION	and her problems , about
England	LOCATION	, about
Germany	LOCATION	, about war and the conditions that make for war , and about peace and the conditions that will guarantee it .

		In spite of his philosophy , which would seem to
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 109 make for perpetual war , Mr.
Powers	PERSON	has faith in progress towards human unity .

		One might call him a pacifist in the best sense if the term pacifist had any longer any sense at all .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	however thinks it is not through `` such baseless artifices as a ` league to enforce peace ' '' that we shall attain peace or progress towards `` human unity , '' but rather through an understanding , tacit and not formal , of which the growing Anglo-Saxon fellowship is the model and must be the directive force .

		Into this understanding ,
Germany	LOCATION	, which `` the world can not endure and which yet the world can not spare , '' must somehow be brought , after she has been chastened by overwhelming defeat .

		The best chance of peace is in such a world fellowship .

		The German , as Mr. Powers recog - nizes , may very well object to such a fellow - ship .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	imagines him asking : `` What is the superlative merit of your scheme of unify - ing the Germanic races as contrasted with ours ?

		The difference is merely that you want the Eng - lishman on top instead of the German . ''

		To this Mr.
Powers	PERSON	replies : `` No , what we want is the English principle on top instead of the Ger - man .

		That principle is the principle of fellow - ship , not of feudalism .

		It leaves each one free to live his own life and think his own thoughts and go his own ways , and sees the power and the greatness of the fellowship in this liberty of its members . ''

		This is very well .

		It is certainly better to have the English principle on top than to have the German principle on top .

		It is better to have the Englishman on top than to have the German on top .

		It is better to have anything English on top than to have anything German on top .

		But in calling in principles , what have we done with our philosophy ?

		To Americans ,
Iceland	LOCATION	is an object of curi - osity rather than of interest .

		Great nations are like big men : they smile condescendingly upon the little fellows and are inclined to ask them foolish questions .


Iceland	LOCATION	's claim to world recognition lies wholly in cultural achievements , mostly of a bygone age .

		Outside of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	few persons read the old sagas nowadays ; and yet they are in our libraries , translated into fine Anglo-Saxon English -LRB- so closely _ related in root and branch to the
Old Norse	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the work of such poets and scholars as
William Morris	PERSON	, Sir
George Dasent	PERSON	,
Frederick York Powell	PERSON	,
E. Magnusson	PERSON	, and Dr.
G. Vigfusson	PERSON	.

		There are few nations that can point to a brighter record of culture than this little nation of 100,000 people , practically isolated on their arctic island for nearly one thousand years .

		Why did they , not revert to barbarism , as has been the fate of many white groups out of touch with outside civilization ?

		There is but one answer : the Promethean flame which kindled the genius of the old , now nameless , monks the saga authors has never died in
Iceland	LOCATION	.

		It could not die so long as the sagas lived , firing the spiritual life of the nation .

		Each period of national prosperity since the saga age has seen a revival of literary activity .

		Now
Iceland	LOCATION	is more prosperous in a material way than ever in its history , and behold there is a pen scratch - ing in every cottage ; there is a poet apostrophiz - ing every waterfall , , dedicating the
summer	DATE	crop of poppies and daffodils , and charming or at least trying to charm the innumerable host of fays and light-elves , trolls and watersprites and `` landvaettir '' which have endowed the bleak hills and mountains of
Iceland	LOCATION	with an immor - tal soul .

		And the firstlings of
Iceland	LOCATION	's latest literary revival have taken wings overseas to this Vine - land of
Leif	PERSON	and Thorfinn .

		Not that we are so fortunate as to have secured translation of 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	any of the beautiful lyrics , which -LRB- it seems to me -RRB- Icelandic poets have been singing from time immemorial .

		The imports are of sterner stuff , better suited to literary baggage-smashers .

		They are plays , only three in number , and one of them , ``
Hadda Padda	PERSON	, '' somewhat damaged in transit .

		The other two `` Eyvind of the Hills '' and `` The Hraun Farm , '' .

		by
Johann Sigurjonsson	PERSON	are living proofs , if proofs be needed , that the creative genius of the saga skalds still lives in the little arctic island .

		But I imagine that the shades of the saga authors may frown on `` Eyvind of the Hills . ''

		Eyvind himself , and especially his consort ,
Halla	ORGANIZATION	, are bona fide Norse figures , personifying the weakness and epic strength of saga characters .

		But in construc - tion the play is an ugly duckling .

		It is more like a Greek tragedy than anything Scandinavian that I have read .

		Sigurjonsson might never have read a line by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	or
Strindberg	LOCATION	.

		There is not a mustard seed of a sermon text con - cealed in `` Eyvind of the Hills . ''

		But it has life , naked life ; and because
Sigurjonsson	PERSON	is a poet and an artist , his work is endowed with grace , strength , and beauty .

		No puppets are in his shop .

		You feel no curiosity about peering behind Eyvind or
Halla	ORGANIZATION	for props and strings .

		Here are no new social lessons , no modern phi - losophy except , of course , what few items one might garner from a faithful presentation of life .

		The action takes place in
Iceland	LOCATION	, about the middle of the eighteenth century .

		Eyvind , a handsome , attractive youngster , driven by hun - ger to commit a theft , becomes the victim of cruel eighteenth century justice , breaks jail , and turns outlaw .

		He leaves his mountain refuge in search of human companionship , and under the assumed name of
Kari	PERSON	finds service on the farm of
Halla	ORGANIZATION	, a wealthy young widow .

		They fall in love , and when the law traces Eyvind to H-alla 's home , she sacrifices her estate , her comforts , and the respect of the community to flee with her outlaw lover to the mountains .

		There follows a period of idyllic freedom .

		Halla bears children .

		But .

		the law still trails them the law written in the statute books and by and by the unwritten runes of human exist - ence begin their pincer-like movement .

		Halla and Eyyind have no mountains above the moun - tains to which to flee from forces operating with deathlike sureness within their souls .

		It is here that
Halla	ORGANIZATION	emerges as the central figure of the drama .

		Intensely feminine and yet an
Amazon	LOCATION	of strength and courage , she seems so clean and healthy morally that even her sacrifices of her offspring to save her lover stand out merely as convincing reactions .

		She simply fights and sac - rifices till she is crushed , and she is crushed only when
Eyvind	ORGANIZATION	's love , the sole fortress on which her life is based , fails .

		They are starving in their mountain hut when she discovers that Eyvind is really of base metal ; that he has always been afraid to steal , afraid to kill , and now is afraid of Hell .

		This is what he has to say to
Halla	ORGANIZATION	: `` You are homely ... Your face makes me think of a dead horse .

		May I feel of your hair if it does not all come out ? ''

		Mouthing these words , he turns to his Bible , advising
Halla	ORGANIZATION	to seek God 's help and mercy .

		Gudrun or Bergthora or any other grand dame of the sagas might have answered just as
Halla	ORGANIZATION	does : `` I want no mercy any more , but you can go on call - ing for help .

		I am sure He will hear you , if He is not too busy breaking up the glaciers or cleaning out the gorge of a volcano to make it belch more fire ... I have but one sole wish before I die , and that is to do some unheard-of cruel thing .

		I should like to be a snowslide .

		I would come in the dead of night .

		It would be a joy to see the people , half naked , running for their lives chaste old maids with gouty hips , and smug peasant women with bellies bobbing with fat . ''

		This pagan woman , `` never able to tell my soul from my love , '' continues : `` I once dreamed of two people .

		To them their love was their one and only law .

		When they lived a long life together Hunger drew near to the fine web that time had woven between them and would tear it asunder .

		Then they looked into each other 's eyes and together they walked out into the snowstprm to die . ''

		But
Halla	ORGANIZATION	had to walk out into the snowstorm alone .

		`` The Hraun Farm '' is a pleasant little dra - matic idyl of present-day country life in Ice - land .

		The theme , familiar in all literature , is the struggle between a man and a maid and the patriarchal parent of the maid who demands the right to shape her life that she may continue his life work , cultivate and enlarge the dear family estate , and rear a future generation of farmers .

		These two plays are splendidly translated by Mrs.
Schanche	PERSON	and , strange to say , both rather seem to have improved in the translation .

		I suspect the improvement is largely due to the fact that both plays have been trimmed of some useless lumber in the course of their preparation for the German and Scandinavian stage .

		Which is more than one can say of ``
Hadda Padda	PERSON	, '' by
Godmundur Kamban	PERSON	.

		The play itself is a distinctly worthy piece of dramatic art , poetic and tense , and in
Hadda Padda	PERSON	, the
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , in heroine , we have another decent copy of the saga figures in modern life .

		They might do worse , these Icelandic dramatists , than to con - tinue their worship of their classics .

		`` Hadda Padda '' lacks smoothness in the translation .

		The lines are clumsy here and there , and the one or two lyrics are lame ; but the original substance is there .

		Both these Icelandic dramatists are young men .

		Kamban is under thirty ; and his play , written when he was twenty-three , is a remark - able piece of work for a man of that age .

		Sigur - jonsson was making a grand failure of study - ing how to become a horse doctor when
Bjorn	PERSON	- stjerne
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Georg Brandes	PERSON	discovered his first attempts at playwriting and advised him to confine his equestrian attentions to old
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	.


Bjornson	PERSON	's heroic ballad , `` Arnljot Gelline , '' is pronounced by
Hjalmar Hjort Boyesen	PERSON	and other Scandinavian critics as constituting , to - gether with the saga trilogy ``
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	, '' the highest achievement of
Bjornson	PERSON	in his recon - struction of
Norway	LOCATION	's heroic past .

		Dr.
Payne	PERSON	has caught
Bjornson	PERSON	's fiery spirit and some - thing of that eternal boyish leap and gallop which characterizes the great Norwegian 's liter - ary stride :
Bjornson	PERSON	seldom walks in prose or verse .

		But `` Arnljot Gelline '' and `` Slembe '' as well are so intensely national , so Norse in flesh and spirit , and so much of a former age that they are not likely to offer competition in popularity with
Bjornson	PERSON	's `` Happy Boy , '' `` Arne , '' `` Syn - nove Solbakken , '' and other tales of peasant life that is , not outside of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	.

		Arnljot 's tale is that of a robber , a noble freebooter , and the ballad is full of the thunder of battles battles with human foes , human passions , the elements .

		The old Norsemen cared not what they fought so long as the foe was valiant and worthy of their steel .

		Gelline would tackle a blizzard or the sea , or abduct a maiden , or cleave an enemy 's skull with equal zest in the work at hand .

		With the exception of `` Hadda Padda '' we are indebted for all this worthy reading to the
American-Scandinavian Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, one of the most useful literary institutions of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	has yet to produce a mediocre volume .

		But consider its field .

		Its translators have not even approached the lean streak in Scandinavian letters .

		They are still picking gold nuggets , nor need they worry about the immediate future .

		A THEOLOGY FOR THE SOCIAL GOSPEL .

		By
Walter Rauschenbusch	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The pursuit of the millennial mirage , which has ever been the relief of religious devotees for whom unusual world events create an intellec - tual impasse , once more emerges as a by-product of our tragic world war .

		There are people of this type who have become so enwrapped in the assurance of
Christ	LOCATION	's immediate coming that they have financed a propaganda of large pro- portions to win the church to their view and this in the face of the definite commitment of a large part of the church to a program of social reconstruction .

		These conflicting attitudes are irreconcilable : one is cataclysmic , the other evo - lutional .

		Dr.
Schilling	PERSON	, in discussing
Matthew 24	PERSON	, an outstanding eschatological chapter , points out that every age has contained nearly all the conditions of Christ 's coming , but that no period of the world 's history has possessed a more de - tailed and accurate repetition of each item than the present age .

		The introduction to Dr.
Schill	PERSON	- ing 's book , penned by an adulatory friend , claims for him original contributions on questions of eschatology , but the whole trend of the book is along the line of conventional pre-millennial belief .

		The character of the book is written on page 121 : `` I believe the Devil has more preachers in the pulpit than Jesus . ''

		And the gangrenous Boswellian who wrote what the pub - lishers have fatuously labeled `` Introduction '' said that the panacean Dr.
Schilling	PERSON	was an optimist !

		The merit of the
Prideaux	PERSON	book is its extended comparison of the separate verses and phrases of Jesus 's eschatological utterances with the Jewish pseudepigrapha , using these abundant parallels to emphasize the essentially Jewish character of
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's teaching .

		The author 's point of view is that
Jesus	PERSON	and his followers , being children of their age , took the ideas then current those of the apocryphal writers of the first and second century and spiritualized and refined them .

		He traces two lines of thought in this process : one looking to a physical return at a given , though unknown date , with a final 112 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 15	DATE	judgment and the inauguration of a reign of bliss for the righteous and unending punishment for the wicked ; the other regarding the kingdom of God as already in a measure arrived , described in terms ethical , spiritual , and mystical .

		The author concludes that the actual second coming of Christ was at
Pentecost	LOCATION	, and that his com - ing is perpetual .

		Professor
Shirley Jackson	PERSON	Case makes an his - torical study of the different types of millennial hope that have been held in the past Egyptian , Babylonian , Greek ,
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	, and so on and in this panorama of history makes it clear that a millennial program grows out of adverse polit - ical and social conditions .

		From such a fer - tile study , which has about it the ring of scholarly authority , it is obvious that ancient forms of hope are ever recast to meet new conditions and that all past millennial programs have signally failed of fulfilment .

		The miscarrying of early Christian expectations is most striking of all .

		In the sight of historical study the obvious ten - dency is to view lightly present day reconstruc - tions of millennial hopes .

		As our fourth author , Mr.
Percy Gardner	PERSON	, says -LRB- page 184 -RRB- , `` we may fairly say that few expect or look for a cataclysmic return of the son of man in the clouds of heaven , or the raising of human bodies from land and sea on that occa - sion . ''

		The `` Evolution of Christian Doctrine '' is not directly a study In eschatology , but it does discuss the philosophy underlying the issue .

		`` For nearly a century , '' says the author , `` cata - clysmic and evolutional views have stood opposed in many ' departments of knowledge ; and the history of these is uniform : it is the gradual supersession of cataclysmic views by evolu - tional . ''

		His is a dignified English modernist 's discussion of traditional theology in epitome , establishing point by point that the religion of Christ , instead of being a system of belief re - vealed once for all to mankind , becomes a grow - ing , dynamic thing .

		This treatise , a volume in the `` Crown Theological Library , '' is a worthy handbook , in small compass , for the reader who wishes a brief sketch of the subject under discussion .

		Like a thunderclap from a clear sky , how - ever , reverberate the last four pages .

		C'est la guerre , of course !

		`` Out of the mists of war is slowly emerging another figure which to many seems more to be dreaded than war itself , which is destined to have deeper and longer working in the future the figure of social democracy , '' sighs the author .

		The dragging of this dreaded figure across the last few pages is horribly in - congruous to the author as well as to the reader .

		It seems to be a bit cataclysmic in its own way and musses up the theological horizon , for the English Church mind can not see that it natur - ally follows the evolutional view of Christianity as day follows night .

		Surprising it is that the author should be startled at its appearance as the newborn child of the European strife , thereby showing his unawareness of the exist - ence of the American prophet
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	, whose voice has for years been crying in the wilderness of theological confusion a herald of this figure of social democracy .

		His latest book , `` A Theology for the Social Gospel , '' is an ambi - tious attempt to rewrite theology in the light of modern social movements .

		He accepts it as axiomatic that the ills of society are not to be righted by an early destruction of the world , but by a gradual process of strenuous endeavor , under a keen realization and revaluation of social forces .

		The theology of every age fol - lows the psychology of that age ; our dominant ideas are social solidarity and personality .

		The social gospel springs naturally from our con - temporary life and is inevitable .

		`` It is the re - ligious reaction on the historic advent of democ - racy . ''

		Professor
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	rewrites chap - ters of theology on `` The Fall of Man , '' ``
Salva	PERSON	- tion , '' `` The Kingdom of God , '' `` Atonement , '' and so on with a background of social psychol - ogy , and furnishes fruitful material for theologi - cal reconstruction .

		Naturally his program of social reconstruction eschews the cataclysmic and looks to the evolutionary process , `` As to the way in which the Christian ideal of society is to come , we must shift from catastrophe to devel - opment , '' writes the author in his chapter on `` Eschatology , '' the longest , save one , of the whole book .

		A great book , epoch-making and determinative for theology , is due perhaps over - due .

		This is not that book , but certainly pre - pares the way for it .

		What shall we say , then , about the religious obsession that we are rapidly approaching the end of the world ?

		We must not be led astray by the assertion that it has the authority of Christ .

		Apocalypse was not his personal product but his environment , from which he was emancipating himself .

		The millennialist utilizes materialistic concepts that are the product of ancient mythol - ogy .

		These mythical images can not portray to the thoughtful modern mind the kingdom of God ; they fly in the face of scientific concepts that are the warp and woof of our present-day
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 113 life .

		But most galling of all , our modern mil - lennialist spurns all efforts to redeem society he damns it .

		The gospel of Jesus is a dynamic for the correcting of the ills of society and can - not , in an evolutionist age , be incarcerated in a Procrustean den of primitive mythology .


HERBERT W. HINES	PERSON	.

		The Georgians GEORGIAN POETRY : 1916-1917 .

		An Anthology .

		Putnam ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Whatever connotations it may grow to have , future English critics will undoubtedly refer to this literary epoch as the Georgian period .

		It is difficult to predict whether the coming compiler will speak of the Georgians with the air of fatu - ous enthusiasm his grandfather uses when re - ferring to the Elizabethans , or with the smooth superiority his progenitor employs when men - tioning the Victorians ' .

		One thing is sure : he will discover that , in spite of differences in theme , technique , and opinion , the artists , novelists , and especially the poets of this period will have expressed an age while they were expressing themselves .

		He will point out , first of all , that although the Georgians may have lacked both the lyric exuberance of the Elizabethans and the dra - matic if overelaborate rhetoric of the Victorians , these men of what he will doubtless call the nineteen-twenties produced a literature as dis - tinctive as and even more ' human than their predecessors ' .

		Warming to his thesis , he will expatiate on the probing analysis of their work , on its intellectual honesty , its creative curiosity in the workaday world rather than in rhymewofn stories out of
Bullfinch	ORGANIZATION	's mythology , on its exem - plification of the theory of Synge -LRB- whom he will , rather illogically , hail as the founder of the group -RRB- that before verse can be human again it must take pleasure in ordinary things .

		He will enlarge on the absence of cant , the growth of social tendencies , and the courageous groping toward a free fraternity of thought .

		He will have a vigorous chapter on the invigorating vul - garisms of
Masefield	PERSON	and an interesting essay on
Lascelles Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	, whom he will find , in spite of the latter 's too packed blank verse , to be even more `` modern '' than the author of `` The Everlasting Mercy . ''

		He will , aided by the
1945	DATE	variorum edition of
Freud	LOCATION	, make an illumi - nating study of
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	and wax ironic at the kind of pruriency that suppressed `` The Rainbow . ''

		A curious feature of his work will be the section in which he shows how , in the light of the new psychology , the gulf between the writers of impersonal fiction and the writers of personal lyrics was bridged how much in common such prose romancers as
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	,
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	,
A. Neil Lyons	PERSON	,
Rebecca West	PERSON	,
Thomas Burke	PERSON	had with such seemingly opposed verse craftsmen as
Edward Thomas	PERSON	,
W. W. Gibson	PERSON	,
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	,
James Stephens	PERSON	,
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	.

		Then he will end by showing that the very variety of the Georgians made for vitality , that in their refusal to be cloistered , or to contemplate life from any one angle of manners or morality , they achieved a disjointed but imaginative unity .

		Their music , he will conclude in a final metaphor , is not so much an experiment in cacophony as a study in counterpoint .

		And he will not be far wrong , if the three anthologies of poetry which have been coming biennially from the Poetry Bookshop are to be taken as evidence .

		In fact the affirmations of the future appraiser have already been anticipated by
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	, who for all his affiliations with the conservatives hailed the original seven - teen when they first appeared together in
1913	DATE	.

		`` They are not for making something pretty , '' he wrote .

		`` They are not members of an arts-and - crafts industrial guild .

		They write as grown men walk , each with his own unconscious gesture ; and , with the same instinctive tact as the walker , they vary their pace and direction , keep their balance and avoid collisions . ''

		And , what is more , they know where they are going .

		This third collection is not as illustrious as either of the two preceding .

		There is nothing here to be compared to
Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Sale of St.
Thomas	PERSON	, ''
Davies	PERSON	's `` The Child and the Mariner , '' or
Brooke	PERSON	's `` Grantchester , '' that ex - quisite blend of whimsy and satire , with its memorable slap at German precision when he speaks of the little English village where `` tulips do not bloom as they are told '' and where Unkempt about those hedges grows An unofficial English rose ; And there the unregulated sun Slopes down to rest when day is done And wakes a vague , unpunctual star ... But there are compensations for the missing .

		No one has yet appeared to take
Brooke	PERSON	's place , but there are several men , unheard of three years ago , who come close to filling it .

		In fact the 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	chief vigor of this volume is due to the new - comers , nine of whom appear in this series for the first time .

		None of these new contributors is without distinction , but the outstanding ones are five :
J. C. Squire	PERSON	,
Siegfried Sassoon	PERSON	,
W. J. Turner	PERSON	,
Robert Graves	PERSON	, and
John Freeman	PERSON	.

		Turner is the most ingenuous , Squire the most intellectual , Sassoon the most direct and most intensive .

		Turner 's `` The
Hunter	PERSON	, '' `` Magic , '' and `` Ro - mance '' are all plainly influenced by De la Mare , although not dominated by him .

		When I was but thirteen or so I went into a golden land ,
Chimborazo	ORGANIZATION	,
Cotopaxi	LOCATION	Took me by the hand .

		My father died , my brother too , They passed like fleeting dreams ; I stood where Popocatepetl In the sunlight gleams .

		I dimly heard the master 's voice And boys far-off at play ,
Chimborazo	ORGANIZATION	,
Cotopaxi	LOCATION	Had stolen me away .

		This , the first half of `` Romance , '' might have been taken -LRB- and slightly diluted -RRB- from `` Peacock Pie , '' but it has a flavor of its own .

		Squire is after more intricate subtleties .

		Some - times , as in `` The Lily of Malud , '' it is the subtlety of atmosphere and interior rhyming that impels him ; sometimes , as in `` A
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' he follows a homelier intellectual path and wrings beauty and a sort of philosophic faith from the aspect of an ugly red-brick building accentuating the loneliness of dusk : And this mean edifice , which some dull architect Built for an ignorant earth-turning hind , Takes on the quality of that magnificent Unshakable dauntlessness of human kind .

		Darkness and stars will come , and long the night will be , Yet imperturbable that house will rest , Avoiding gallantly the stars ' chill scrutiny , Ignoring secrets in the
midnight	TIME	's breast .

		The versatile Mr.
Squire	PERSON	proves not only that he can assume other men 's accents but that he has achieved an idiom of his own .


Robert Graves	ORGANIZATION	has an ingratiating manner , the product of a mind that is both rebellious and relaxed .

		Four of the poems in this collection also appear in his own volume `` Fairies and Fusiliers , '' which lives up to its title by com - bining warm fantasy with a cold fury at smug - ness and hypocrisy .

		`` The Boy in Church , '' `` Star-Talk , '' `` The Lady Visitor , '' `` Goliath and David '' -LRB- a brief set of couplets , small in range but wide in their bitter implication -RRB- , and the imaginative `` It 's a Queer Time '' stand out among the best examples of what has been pro- duced since
1915	DATE	by the poet as soldier .

		The last named has this illuminating opening : It 's hard to know if you 're alive or dead When steel and fire go roaring through your head .

		One moment you 'll be crouching at your gun Traversing , mowing heaps down , half in fun : The next , you choke and clutch at your right breast No time to think leave all and off you go ... To
Treasure Island	LOCATION	where the Spice-winds blow , To lovely groves of mango , quince and lime Breathe no good-bye , but oh , for the Red West !

		It 's a queer time ... By comparison with Graves 's , the belligerent poems of
Robert Nichols	PERSON	and
W. W. Gibson	PERSON	seem falsetto and thin ; they read like the usual overstressed war verse that is conventional in conception and stereotyped in expression .

		They seem doubly pale beside the burning poetry of
Siegfried Sassoon	PERSON	, the most individual of the newcomers .

		Not since
Masefield	PERSON	and
Brooke	PERSON	has England produced a poet who gives such promise of athletic loveliness coupled with un - flinching honesty .

		His volume `` The Old Hunts - man '' is one of the few British literary landmarks since
Brooke	PERSON	's sonnet sequence `` Nineteen Four - teen , '' and five of the best poems in that collec - tion are given here .

		Particularly forceful are `` They , '' `` To Victory , '' and `` In the Pink . ''

		`` Haunted '' is a bit too much in the
Masefield	PERSON	key to be entirely
Sassoon	ORGANIZATION	's ; and `` A Letter Home , '' for all its individuality of emotion , is uncomfortably reminiscent of `` Grantchester . ''

		But the eager
Sassoon	ORGANIZATION	is altogether himself in the first three and in the sharp lyric THE KISS To these I turn , in these I trust ; Brother Lead and Sister Steel .

		To his blind power I make appeal ; I guard her beauty clean from rust .

		He spins and burns and loves the air , And splits a skull to win my praise ; But up the nobly marching days She glitters naked , cold and fair .

		Sweet Sister , grant your soldier this : That in good fury he may feel The body where he sets his heel Quail from your downward darting kiss .

		Of those who have appeared in the earlier collections , the only ones who have not fallen back are
Walter de la Mare	ORGANIZATION	,
Ralph Hodgson	PERSON	, and
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, that trio of quiet , natural magicians .

		Dealing with the most usual of themes , choosing almost wilfully the stock properties of poetry , they achieve a freshness and
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 115 a glamor that is anything but a second-hand or shoddy loveliness .

		De la Mare has grown espe - cially skilful ; his mastery over what is a highly sensitive and delicate instrument is astonishing .

		`` The Fool Rings His Bells '' is a new departure for De la Mare , though in his old vein ; it is longer and more ambitious than anything he has done and , with a changed heading , has become the title-poem for his latest volume , `` Motley . ''

		It is so poignant a poem that one wishes more selections from `` Motley '' had appeared in place of the innocuous , patterned lyrics of
John Drink	ORGANIZATION	- water and the lugubrious archaisms of
Maurice Baring	PERSON	.

		One especially regrets the omission of `` The
Empty House	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` Alone , '' and `` Alexander , '' although `` The Scribe '' and `` The Ghost '' -LRB- both of which are included in the present anthology -RRB- are almost as fine as anything in `` The Listeners , '' with the exception of the single poem bearing that name .

		This , for instance , with its un - canny overtones , is THE GHOST `` Who knocks ? ''

		... `` I , who was beautiful Beyond all dreams to restore ; I , from the roots of the dark thorn , am hither And knock on the door . ''

		`` Who speaks ? ''

		... `` I once was my speech Sweet as the bird 's on the air , When echo lurks by the waters to heed ; 'T is I speak thee fair . ''

		`` Dark is the hour ! ''

		`` Aye , and cold . ''

		`` Lone is my house . ''

		`` Ah , but mine ? ''

		`` Sight , touch , lips , eyes gleamed in vain . ''

		`` Long dead these to thine . ''

		.

		Silence .

		Still faint on the porch Brake the flames of the stars .

		In the gloom groped a hope-wearied hand Over keys , bolts , and bars .

		A face peered .

		All the grey night In chaos of vacancy shone ; Nought but vast Sorrow was there The sweet cheat gone .

		This book then , in spite of the absence of
Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	,
Brooke	PERSON	,

		Stimulating Because Untrue THE LIMITS OF PURE DEMOCRACY .

		By
W. H. Mai	PERSON	- lock .

		Button ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's `` Book I : Political Democ - racy '' argues that there is no general will with regard to many important public issues ; that on these points the effective political reality is the will of an oligarchic few , transmitted by journalistic and other wiles to the mass ; that every democracy conceals an oligarchy , even the International having had its little king in
Marx	LOCATION	; that such oligarchy is necessary for efficiency , and is an inevitable consequence of the natural inequality of men .

		Book II argues that the democratization of industry would result in chaos , and that effective industrial like politi - cal procedure , is bound up with the oligarchic directive activity of a superior few .

		Book
III	ORGANIZATION	discusses democracy in distribution , and lavishes statistics on the thesis that unearned income and other forms of distributive injustice are of very moderate proportions .

		Book IV analyzes the history of socialist communities , and traces their decay to lack of provision for the necessary oli - garchic leaven .

		In Books V-VII the author ex - , pounds his plans for moderate social reform through a minimum wage and equality of oppor - tunity , denounces the political exploitation of discontent , and holds up
Russia	LOCATION	as a horrible example of what unmitigated democracy means .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's book is a stodgy and laborious marshaling of argumentative minutiae against a theory of democracy that no postdiluvian polit - ical thinker has ever held .

		Taking an inch of rope from the Abbe Sieyes 's defiant proposi - tion that the rightful influence of the
King of France	ORGANIZATION	was to that of his subjects exactly in the ratio of one to thirty millions , Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	hurries to hang himself by defining `` pure '' democracy as a condition of social aphasia in which `` no one man should , by his decision of character or his reputation for superior knowl - edge , so sway the mind of even a single com - panion ... that the thoughts and votes of two men were determined by the mind of one '' -LRB- page 39 -RRB- ; and it is mostly on this strange straw man that the author has showered the slings and arrows of his theoricidal mania .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	apparently assumes that such a system of deaf - and-dumb government has existed ; for after so defining his phrase he proceeds to talk of revo - lutionary
Russia	LOCATION	as a `` pure democracy , '' and his 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	publishers so far take him at his word as to announce that `` this brilliant study in political science seeks to establish the theory that pure democracy is the natural system of government for small communities '' only -LRB- ancient
Athens	LOCATION	, Swiss cantons , and so on -RRB- .

		But unless we choose to offer Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	a better definition of purity in democracy than the one which he him - self affords us , we shall have to reconcile our - selves to the conclusion that every democracy , past and present -LRB- and future too , while we are at it -RRB- has been , is -LRB- and will be -RRB- outrageously impure .

		For in a democracy it is not minds that must be equal in the determination of votes , but votes that must be equal in the determina - tion of policy ; and one of the policies so deter - mined may be the restriction of the kind of poli - cies so to be determined .

		Which is to say , less cryptically , that a people may vote away its claim to vote on certain questions , of emergency or detail , as when the voters of an American state reject the initiative , or the referendum , or the direct primary .

		Any limitation so put upon their own political power by the people themselves would not lessen the purity of democracy , but would illustrate it ; and Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's error obviously lies in confusing impurity with indirec - tion .

		So it is not undemocratic that war should be declared by elected officials , without a popu - lar referendum , if the people have by previous vote approved the proposition that war may be so declared .

		Democracy means that legislation and policy shall finally be determined by a ma - jority vote of the adult population , except in those cases whose exception is allowed by the explicit or tacit consent of the voters .

		To call a democracy of this kind impure is to be guilty of intemperate language unbecoming a man of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's distinguished sobriety .

		It may repay us to observe in this connec - tion that the possibility of one mind 's influencing several by persuasion is as much the hope as it is the peril of democracy .

		It is true enough that , as things stand , the greatest measure of such influence is wielded by those who have been able to purchase the larger and choicer assortments of editors : but bad as this is , it puts a premium on intelligence rather than on muscles and muskets ; better be gently fooled into voting for a villain than be compelled to it at the point of a gun .

		Not to speak of the possibility -LRB- let us at least keep this hope -RRB- that a large spread of knowledge and a better training of wits will enable Mr. Average Man to react with some measure of antiseptic skepticism to the patent editorials and other concoctions of the menial press .

		But let us follow the bloody traces of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's philosophical raid .

		After arguing in Book I that there are many political issues that do not lend themselves to direct democratic de - cision , he proceeds in Book II to apply the same principle to industry , with more relevance to real problems and more profit to the reader .

		The processes of production and distribution , the methods of forecasting demand and adjusting supply , are so complicated , the argument runs , that control of each industry by the workers engaged in it would be an open welcome to chaos and stagnation .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	believes that workingmen privileged to choose their own fore - men , superintendents , and so on , would select not those fittest for efficient performance of the duties involved but those best dowered with elec - tioneering plausibility and most prolific in prom - ises of a tolerant regime .

		This is a point on which even a reviewer need not pretend to expert knowledge ; and it may be admitted that if this proletarian paradise is imminent we had better do some looking before we leap .

		But Mr.
Mal	PERSON	- lock may reassure his friends : we are a long way from any such control of industry as has here given him a theoretical tremor .

		At best or at worst we shall have a moderate represen - tation of organized labor on industrial boards .

		There is no danger that labor will achieve the dominant voice in the industrial process before it has been trained by gradually increasing power and responsibility to use such power without seri - ously lowering the quantity or quality of the product .

		In any event , industrial democracy need not mean the election of all officials by the workers ; it may also mean that officials em - powered to adjust wages and determine policy will be elected by the workers , but that officials whose function it will be to secure efficiency will be appointed , from a list of men specially trained for the purpose , by the elected officials these last to be held responsible for the results .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	rightly inveighs against the notion that labor means muscle merely , and insists that it means also mind ; indeed , he goes on to argue , it is directive mind , rather than any increment of muscle , that is chiefly responsible for the vast increase of industrial output in the last one hun - dred and fifty years .

		But he overshoots the mark when he contends that because of the im - portance of mind in modern work , manual work - ers should be content , more or less , with their present remuneration and their present power
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 117 in the direction of industry .

		The rate of re - muneration and the degree of directive power accorded to labor or to capital or to organizing mind should be determined not altogether by their relative indispensability to the industrial result , nor by the fluctuations in the supply and demand of muscle and money and mind , but in increasing measure by bringing into the compu - tation the resultant effect on communal .

		amity , coherence , and stability .

		Democracy here , as elsewhere , may not be the highroad to efficiency and overproduction ; but better a loss in goods and speed than the unchecked oligarchy which Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	condones , and which has by its myopic selfishness brought to almost every West - ern nation the chaos of class war and the danger of disintegration .

		Yet it is an ill review that can find nothing good to say of a book that has been thought worthy of review at all .

		Let it be admitted that Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	is an honest and earnest poli - tical critic ; that several of his chapters particu - larly those on Socialist communities are inform - ing and illuminating ; and that his arguments , though in general they can be answered , assur - edly can not be ignored .

		Democracy is on trial not only at the cannon 's mouth but in the hearts of men ; and all sober appraisals of it are whole - some contributions towards a rejuvenated politi - cal philosophy .

		One may reject the central proc - esses of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's argument and yet find his book instructive , stimulating , and enjoyable .

		After all , as
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	put it , `` not the least charm of a theory is that it can be refuted . ''

		WILL DURANT .

		South Wind SOUTH WIND .

		By
Norman Douglas	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		Reading this book
last winter	DATE	, when it first appeared , I was extremely curious to know what comment a book so out of the ordinary would provoke in our press .

		Nepenthe , the little island in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	where the action takes place , has in these intervening months been char - acterized as `` quaint , '' `` haunting , '' `` vine-clad , '' and as `` the most unique of lotus-lands ... which lends a special enchantment to the bud - ding and flowering of a romantic love story . ''

		The author is in the habit of `` voicing some delightfully and absurdly radical sentiment ... with his tongue in his cheek , '' his pen meanwhile being `` dipped in liquid-rainbow . ''

		All these critics appear to be unanimous in find - ing the book `` saucy '' ; they then proceed accord - ing to personal moral taste , either to excommuni - cate or to lick their chops .

		It is the story of the conversion of a home - ward bound English colonial bishop , already a trifle seduced by the '' delectable idiosyncrasies of his late African diocesans , to thoroughgoing paganism .

		To work this change of heart Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	has employed a goodly company of pagan missionaries , among the most successful of whom are
Don Francesco	PERSON	, connoisseur in manners , books , and women , and altogether the eighteenth-century beau ideal of what a priest should be ; Mr.
Keith	PERSON	, that paradoxical cre - ation , a Scotch Sybarite ;
Count Caloveglia	LOCATION	, Greek in practice as well as theory and most philosophical of humbugs ; Millionaire van
Kop	ORGANIZATION	- pen , who upholds in pathways new the grand old traditions of his compatriot ,
P. T. Barnum	PERSON	;
Denis	PERSON	, an Oxford youth whose feline grace is discommoded by the tin-can surname
Phipps	LOCATION	; Mr.
Eames	PERSON	, the genteel , if somewhat oppressed , eremite of scholarship ; and ladies of at least two kinds , but more notably the latter .

		Inasmuch as these actors play their parts against a back - ground where we distinguish a quack , a black - mailer , a poisoner , a camorrista , and a mur - deress to say nothing of saints , lobsters , and girls not yet quite ladies of either category and as a volcano too does its own not inconsider - able bit , and as the South Wind herself plays an elaborate role , you may agree with
Denis	PERSON	that `` the canvas of Nepenthe is rather over - charged . ''

		At any rate , I fear you will find me hard to believe when I say that not one of these characters is blurred .

		A situation
Henry James	PERSON	would have found `` amusing , '' which is worked out with an inde - fatigable precision not unworthy of that master , is the sale of the Locri Faun by Count
Calo	PERSON	- veglia to Mr.
van Koppen	PERSON	.

		`` The Salt of the South , '' as
Keith	PERSON	likes to call that Ionic gen - tleman , is deft with the chisel as well as the spoken word .

		On Sir
Herbert Street	PERSON	, adviser in matters of art to Mr.
van Koppen	PERSON	, he palms off for antique a statuette of his own work - manship .

		Van
Koppen	PERSON	, at least tempera - mentally , comes from
Missouri	LOCATION	, but he admires so profoundly and feels so much in common with this unnatural Yankee of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	that he gladly pays the price .

		Then too it 118 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 15	DATE	warms the cockles of his heart to know how that American museum will cherish the valu - able patina of this gold brick .

		Thus warmly does humor flow beneath the delicate froth of Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	's gayety .

		But the story , as is fitting in a novel of ideas , wanders along discreetly in the background .

		How unimportant it is may be gauged from the fact that this author does .

		not deign to touch the key of personal emotion .

		Caloveglia says of the Greek : `` His art is purely intellectual ; he stands aloof , like a glacier . ''

		Such appears to be Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	's own attitude .

		Yet even he can not open the heart of
Keith	PERSON	without our shar - ing that hardy worldling 's pain , impersonal as it is , at the thought of death .

		The Count , we are sure , would not hold against Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	this human weakness , for the Greeks themselves were not proof against that too sedulous pain , and in the `` classic repose '' of their statuary I do not think it fanciful to discern a mute anguish .

		However this may be , in a book where the plot is so rightly filmy , we are satisfied that the action should close in a drinking bout , the merrier for being innocent of motivation .

		It is appropriate that the South Wind should sub - side rather than end .

		Those of us who had read Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	's book of travel , `` Old
Calabria	LOCATION	, '' felt that we already knew him .

		Perhaps we thought this knowledge came from our seeing him in so personalia type of book ; for , outside a picture gallery , there is surely nothing to show a man up like his own account of his travels .

		But the character of our intransigeant friend shoulders through this novel not less frankly , and we see that the inti - macy of our acquaintance came not so much from the type of book as from the type of man .

		Finding in `` South Wind '' a definite philosophy and what seems to be a complete representation of the writer 's character , we are tempted to think it a final expression and Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	a one-book author .

		All the more since much that is best in this novel , in particular the priceless hagiographa , is apparently worked up from the earlier sketches .

		On the other hand , the Pros - pero of so philosophical an island , he handles both his characters and his ideas with an easy detachment suggestive of the Olympian creator of
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	not exactly a one-book man .

		The glitter of this philosopher 's thought is on everything he touches .

		He tells his con - temporaries : `` Your ethics are stereotyped in black-letter characters .

		A gargoyle morality . ''

		Of the Renaissance : `` It shoots up like a por - tentous lily out of the blood-drenched soil of a thousand battlefields . ''

		Of Seneca : `` He was a cocoa-drinker , masquerading as an ancient . ''

		Yet brilliant as it is , this book is indubitably , if divinely , middle-aged .

		That characteristic is to be seen in the delineation of the bad effects of poverty , as also of the essential lie in the conventional self-sufficiency of the genteel , but it is most obvious in the insistence throughout the novel of the bare physical note , unsoftened by any overtone of romance .

		Indeed the opening scene , which gives the note for the whole book , is a picture of seasickness ; and if
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	is mentioned , it is only to say that in attitudes worthy of him `` they sprawled about the deck , groaning with anguish . ''

		The confessed vale - tudinarianism of
Keith	PERSON	unfolds the spirit of materialism as no more lustrous manifestation could do ; but only the strong of heart will accept this universe in which the role of the stomach pump is neither unimportant nor wholly indecorous .

		Sappho notwithstanding , I think most of those who have lived about the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	will agree with me that this candor of middle age is most often met with in that region .

		In a world of keen contours and shivering clarities , where there are , as Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	points out , no half-tones , the mind does not easily dodge hard facts .

		We are therefore not surprised to find our philosopher drawing many comparisons be - tween North and South , always to the advan - tage of the latter .

		Enclosed within the soft imagination of the homo mediterraneus lies a kernel of hard reason ... The Northerner 's hardness is on the surface ; his core , his inner being , is apt to quaver in a state of fluid irresponsibility .

		This need of the logical Southern mind to go the whole hog has been shared historically by the hard-headed countrymen of
John Knox	PERSON	.

		One who bears the name of
Douglas	PERSON	should find him - self at home among theories which are the grim development of his hypotheses , as were the Cove - nanters ' the grim development of theirs .

		When our Scotsman if such indeed he be falls with God 's own cudgel upon the unreason , `` the subur - ban defiance , '' of
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, we rejoice to recognize in him , however lamentably gone wrong , a chip of the old block .

		By
William Townsend Porter	PERSON	.


Atlantic Monthly Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This little book records the impressions of a physician sent to the battlefields of
Europe	LOCATION	by the
Rockefeller Institute	ORGANIZATION	to study the prob - lem of shell shock at first hand .

		Dr.
Porter	PERSON	has a considerable gift for vivid description , and the narrative of his journey fascinates the lay - man even where the technical side of his re - searches is likely to escape the average reader .

		It was Dr.
Porter	PERSON	's good fortune to go un - scathed through some of the most severe fight - ing of the war at
Verdun	LOCATION	and on
Vimy Ridge	ORGANIZATION	` and his unconcern about the dangers of his task soon proves infectious .

		His main concern is not with shell shock proper but with traumatic shock due to severe wounds , and his approach to the problem is entirely physiological .

		Dr.
Porter	PERSON	was a pioneer in this work and does not seem to claim conclusive results for his researches .

		The book takes its place among the authentic records of what war is really like when you come down to it instead of merely romancing about it .

		TENTING TONIGHT .

		By
Mary Roberts Rinehart	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		A camping trip through the little known western side of
Glacier National Park	ORGANIZATION	and a similar progress across the
Cascade Range	ORGANIZATION	in the
Lake Chelan	LOCATION	country of
Washington	LOCATION	pro- vide a background for Mrs.
Rinehart	PERSON	's char - acteristically subjective manner of writing .

		The book records the author 's sensations at various places and under varying conditions , but there is so little , comparatively , of the places and con - ditions that the effect on the reader is like that of seeing a film actor `` registering '' emotions without being shown the elements that induce them .

		The function of a travel book is to inform .

		If , in addition , it is entertaining , so much the better .

		It may even be inspiring , humorous , or satirical in its tone ; but unless it is informative , it masquerades in a false classi - fication .

		Adventures with equipment -LRB- which included everything from trout flies to a motion picture camera -RRB- , a hermit , camp cooks , horses , bears , and mosquitoes crowd the pages to the point where it seems as though , if its charms were confined to these matters ,
Glacier Park	ORGANIZATION	would be a good place to avoid .

		In chronicling the boat ride down the swift current of the
Flathead River	LOCATION	, the author says : `` Once out into the stream , we shot ahead as if we had been fired out of a gun . ''

		If there is any doubt in the reader 's mind as to whether this is exagger - ated , it is dispelled by the statement : `` I do not remember now how much the Flathead falls per mile .

		I have an impression that it is ninety feet , but as that would mean a drop of 9,000 feet , or almost two miles during the trip , I must be wrong somewhere .

		It was sixteen feet , perhaps . ''

		At all events Mrs.
Rinehart	PERSON	gives the impression that the boat went `` awfully fast '' and that , even if she could n't remember figures , the things she and her family did were really quite remarkable .

		Her most remarkable achievement however was finding so little objec - tive material to write about after having cov - ered such inspiring territory ; for , as she her - self says , `` the opening up of the west side of
Glacier Park	ORGANIZATION	will make it perhaps the most unique of all our parks . ''

		And that , to our mind , is a very superlative way of describing a place .

		THE METHOD OF
HENRY JAMES	PERSON	.

		By
Joseph Warren Beach	PERSON	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Of its kind no finer study of
Henry James	PERSON	is likely to be written than this book of Pro- fessor Beach 's .

		So frequently does he quote from
James	PERSON	's own words of introduction and explanation , and so modestly does he as host withdraw , having got the conversation started , that the book is a certain model of critical tact .

		This to lovers of
Henry James	PERSON	is an unspeak - able relief .

		It is much to be doubted if the mysteries of any writer have ever been so thor - oughly illuminated by detectives with dark lanterns turned invariably to light up not the object of their quest but the droll persons of the investigators .

		The long list of parodies and epigrams on
James	PERSON	, too , will repose with the illustrious list of Hamlets .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's
James	PERSON	is much more preposterous than Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's , and so on .

		Since much of this humor lies in the obvious irreverence of these obvious blasphemies , those who know better chuckle and do not dream of explaining the joke ; those who do not , presumably , believe them .

		Now here comes Professor Beach , politely , unanswerably , explaining the joke .

		`` I can find no fault with such an interpretation , '' the writer remarks of the charge that the expression of
James	PERSON	's mes - sage was not naturally the novel , `` except that it does not agree with my own impressions and preferences . ''

		Frequently this critic is not so blithe .

		The first half of his book , `` The Method , '' he has divided into eleven chapters , respectively on idea , picture , revelation , suspense , point of view , dialogue , drama , eliminations , tone , romance , and ethics .

		The second half , `` Toward a Method , '' in six chapters follows chronologically the development of the novelist from `` Obscure 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	Beginnings '' to `` Full Prime . ''

		In a chapter intermediate between parts one and two , `` The Figure in the Carpet , '' Professor Beach explains the joke : `` The Portrait of a Lady '' was the first book in which Jame-s plainly showed his `` little trick , '' which he went on showing more and more plainly from that time out .

		His little trick was simply not to tell the `` story '' at all as the story is told by the Scotts and the Maupassants , but to give us instead the subjective accompaniment of the story .

		His `` exquisite scheme '' was to confine himself as nearly as possible to the `` inward life '' of his characters and yet to make it as exciting for his readers as it was for the author , as exciting were that possible as it was for the characters themselves .

		The quoted phrases refer to
James	PERSON	's own story , `` The Figure in the Carpet , '' of which Pro- fessor Beach was writing at the time .

		Or , as he puts it elsewhere , other novelists sustain sus - pense by exciting the question , What is going to happen ?

		`` In James the question is more often , What is it that did happen ? ''

		The misgivings one may have about `` The Method of Henry James '' need not be resent - ment of it as an academic survey of sacred ground , or suspicion of the man or of the method .

		The book deserves neither misgiving .

		THE WONDERS OF INSTINCT .

		By
Jean	PERSON	-
Henri Fabre	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Teixeira de Mattos	ORGANIZATION	and
Bernard Miall	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		Lovers of good old-fashioned natural history studies will relish the famous Provencal ento - mologist 's book now presented with attractive illustrations in an admirable translation .

		Such unsophisticated communion with nature as
Fabre	PERSON	's has become rare in professional scien - tific circles unwarrantably so and the reader will cheerfully overlook the veteran field - worker 's suspicion of the triumphant laboratory rival , and the faint tang of affectation when he wonders why anyone should worry over the structure of an annelid 's egg .

		Fabre 's strength , of course , lies not in the position he assumes towards modern research but in his incompar - able gift of recording at once accurately and with a poet 's inspiration the varied phases of insect life .

		No reader will easily forget his impressionistic sketches of the grasshopper over - powering a colossal adversary ; of the tight-rope walking antics practiced by the pine caterpillar ; or of the uncanny skill with which the glow - worm chloroforms his quarry , the snail .

		In `` The Origin of Species ''
Darwin	PERSON	pays high tribute to
Fabre	PERSON	, `` that inimitable observer '' ; and the literary charm of his descriptions , liber - ally spiced with quaint personal asides , assures him a unique place in entomological literature .

		A MODERN PURGATORY .

		By
Carlo di For	ORGANIZATION	- naro .

		Kennerley ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		First-hand accounts of the lives and suffer - ings of prisoners are fast becoming so multiplied that it might seem an unnecessary addition to bring out in book form the personal experiences of yet another man .

		No one need apologize however for presenting this book to the public .

		It is clearly an accurate description of the experi - ences of the author during one year 's imprison - ment in the
House of Correction on Blackwell	ORGANIZATION	's
Island	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and as such carries a mes - sage to all interested in the progress of reform - ing penal methods .

		Moreover it is written with a literary skill and a remarkable restraint and freedom from sentimental coloring which would alone recommend it to hold the attention of the serious reader .

		Fortunately it is a compara - tively rare occurrence that a man of the author 's intelligence is subjected to the terrible experi - ences described in this volume .

		But that does not justify the criticism sometimes made that the methods at present existing in our institu - tions are well suited to the majority of the inmates , who are not as sensitive and percep - tive as the author .

		These inmates owe a debt to Mr.
di Fornaro	PERSON	for becoming the spokesman of the vast number of men who are passing each year through the institution on
Blackwells Island	LOCATION	.

		The book does not profess to be any - thing more than an account of personal experi - ences ; there is no attempt at generalization , and the author wisely refrains from far-reaching criticism .

		But there is a ring of truth and a vivacity to the personal touches , descriptions of the writer 's fellow inmates and the guards , which render the book quite unusual in the propaganda literature of prison reform .

		It holds the atten - tion as a clever work of fiction might , and as a work of propaganda seldom does .

		Although a trained prison worker might not give all the credence that the author does to some of the stories told by the prisoners , the author has caught the spirit of his subject in a way in which a mind more accustomed to the rules of scien - tific procedure might fail to do , and has pre - sented it in this book with force and artistic skill .

A. S. Barnes	PERSON	;
$ 3.20	MONEY	.

		For Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	history is still a record of names and dates , an encyclopedia of tradi - tional events , listed without an attempt to ex - plain their causes or effects .

		One may reason - ably draw an analogy between the methods of teaching the history of world politics and the history of world arts .

		If ``

1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL .

		121 Colon , c. 1446-1506 , b.
Genoa	LOCATION	'' no longer ade - quately explains a discovered
America	LOCATION	, then inevitably `` Michaelangelo ,
Florence	LOCATION	,
1475	DATE	, painter and sculptor '' must cease to be the critical background of a dome of
St. Peter 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Scientifically historical minds no longer use `` The Dark Ages '' nor `` The Renaissance '' as elastic passwords .

		Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	catalogues his Baedekered details correctly .

		Architecture , a fossilized mass , upheld by carefully distinguished Doric and Ionic capitals ; sculpture , analyzed by a process of unvisited museums , where replicas thereof may be found ; painting , an outgrowth of `` schools '' -LRB- never of the vital force that gave them being -RRB- ; even music , grown static , deprived of antecedents and consequences , are herded to - gether an uninspiring , unrelated , overwhelm - ing conglomerate .

		For one who knows noth - ing , the information is too much ; for one who knows anything , too little .

		But the illustrations , largely photographic , are numerous and well chosen .

		Some of the architectural plates are badly printed , but the many reproductions of sculpture and painting form the most useful pages .

		In post-bellum days , except for the fact that it is neither `` pocket-edition '' nor `` hand - book , '' it would serve as an enlarged and con - scientiously conceived guidebook ; as a modern history , it fails to supply the imaginatively con - structive analysis which we today demand as an essential .

		Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	has attempted the im - possible ; it is perhaps unfair to expect him to have achieved it .

		Yet a history of art which leaves uncommented upon , modern sculpture , painting , and music as expressed by
Rodin	PERSON	,
Bocklin	PERSON	, and
Auber	PERSON	can have forgiving other disqualifications only a limited power .

		And a critical estimate which devotes eighteen lines to
William Etty of England	LOCATION	, and five to
Whistler	LOCATION	, might more profitably have dealt with many of the selected list in one-line citations .

		THE REVOLUTION ABSOLUTE .

		By
Charles Ferguson	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This book is an argument for the transference of industrial power and leadership from bank presidents and coupon-clippers to engineers and other directors in shop and field .

		The manage - ment of production has passed from men immedi - ately concerned with its processes to financiers whose wisdom lies chiefly in market manipula - tions : `` the war is the explosion of this absurdity . ''

		The manual workers are not themselves capable of undertaking the management of industry ; but the engineering class are .

		Another half-century of economic control by the leisure class will widen the schism between worker and investor , and will result in the distintegration of Western society .

		It behooves us to imitate
Germany	LOCATION	at least in this , that her financiers were never per - mitted to dominate the economic processes of the country .

		When every country in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	is organized under the direction of its engineering class , war will cease .

		The book is frequently prolix in statement , and occasionally obscure ; but it is written with refreshing vigor and is rich in unworn phrases .

		In view of the increas - ing importance of the problem of illegitimacy , as a result of war conditions , this careful analysis of 500 cases and discussion of causes offers material of immediate value .

		In his intro - duction Dr.
Healy	PERSON	emphasizes the fact that `` whereas most infraction of laws coincides with destructive results , here we have a lawbreaker as a constructive agent , giving as concrete evi - dence of her ` misbehavior ' , nature 's highest product , a human being . ''

		In this connection Mr.
Kammerer	PERSON	's discussion of the attitude of social workers shows the inconsistency in the working hypothesis of one group , and of the public generally : Its thought is more in terms of ethics than of biology , and the ethics which it upholds are chiefly based upon a belief that human beings are by nature promiscuous , and that any relaxation of the severity on the part of society towards the unmarried mother will be immediately followed by sexual indulgence resulting in an increasing number of illegitimate births .

		It is because the welfare of the child is of the utmost importance to society that the child must be the starting point in any proposed measures for improvement .

		In the analysis of casual fac - tors the prominence of bad home conditions , bad environment , and bad companions , the lack of the right sort of recreation and of sound educa - tion , especially in matters of sex , reveals the extent of social responsibility for the prevalence of illegitimacy in a community .

		A step further , the same causes , aggravated in the case of the child by the social stigma attaching to his birth , may give him the slight bent in the direction of crime which often determines his future occu - pation .

		So long as society , for the sake of frown - ing upon the mother , shirks any interest in the care of the child , inevitably the quality of its citizenship will suffer .

		The author wisely makes no claim for the representative character of the individual cases 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	recorded , but by gathering them into groups he comes to certain conclusions as to types and cir - cumstances .

		His evidence tends to dispose of a number of long entrenched notions about the causes of sex irregularity .

		The theories that many girls are forced into immoral lives by the mere inadequacy of their wages , and that they are the innocent victims of designing men much older than themselves , find but little support in these records .

		The very large number of un - married mothers , as of prostitutes , who come from domestic service is not fairly chargeable to low wages , for the rate of domestic pay aver - ages high as compared with the wage in other occupations of similar grade , but rather is indi - rectly the result of the long hours , the unsatis - factory social relations , and the lack of oppor - tunity for needed recreation .

		Moreover the unmarried mother and the father of her child are usually at the age when they would normally be attracted to each other , and they are prob - ably about equally responsible for their relation - ship .

		The situation is clearly one of conflict between social and biological demands , and any attempts at amelioration are futile which mis - interpret or fail to take account of the under - lying causes .

		A summary of legislation in European coun - tries emphasizes the fact that the state 's chief concern is for the welfare of the illegitimate child .

		With the exception of
England	LOCATION	, whose laws about illegitimacy are notoriously behind the times , all important European countries have some provision for establishing the paternity of the child and for his inheritance .


Norway	LOCATION	's law , the most radical so far enacted , rests on these principles : legitimate and illegitimate chil - dren have equal rights before the law ; the rights and duties of both parents are the same ; society is entitled to know not only who is the mother but also who is the father of every child that is born .

		An indication of the tendency of pro- gressive legislation in the
United States	LOCATION	appears in the recommendations of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Chil - dren 's
Code Commission	ORGANIZATION	, included in an appen - dix .

		TROPICAL TOWN , and Other Poems .

		By
Salomon de la Selva	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Much is said in these poems , but with too little skill .

		Perhaps the lack of finished artistry is to be expected in a poet of twenty-four years to whom English is not native ; but the faults are too obvious to escape mention .

		Extra syl - lables are introduced haphazard ; in the iambic poems there is a riot of lines beginning with trochees 10 in one poem of 28 verses ; some - times the irregularities fall so closely together as to destroy the rhythm entirely ; the rhymes frequently distort the sense and sometimes are bad in themselves , as `` mother gather , '' `` kiss mysteries . ''

		There is also much obscurity , and the knife has not been used to prune out sec - tions which are only prose , or worse .

		It is unfortunate that virtues can not be cata - logued so readily as faults .

		Some of these poems have a power , a realism , a sincerity that leave no doubt of the poet 's vocation ; others have a music and an imagery that sharpen regret over his sudden lapses into mediocrity .

		The inti - mate and revealing nature of many of the pieces redeems otherwise trivial subjects .

		So uneven a poet can not be represented fairly in brief quota - tion , but `` Birds of Clay '' is too fine not to quote : Birds of clay I whistled through , Have you flown away ?

		I remember the smell of you , Birds of clay !

		Old it was , so old , so old , Dust of centuries of dead !

		All my childhood I was told You would fly , and are you fled ?

		When I am dead I want to lie Where in the centuries to be Children shall utter song and cry Through the winged dust of me .

		A TRAVELLER IN WAR-TIME .

		With an Essay on `` The American Contribution and the Democratic Idea . ''

		By
Winston Churchill	ORGANIZATION	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The first half of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's book is a somewhat sketchy , but wholly admirable , account of a brief visit to
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and the old front line along
Vimy Ridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		He does suc - ceed in presenting a picture of the social changes and the interpenetrations of classes which have taken place in both countries under the stress of necessity .

		And also , without rhetoric or the accent of propaganda , he conveys to the reader some sense of the liberating forces which war has released in these two countries .

		It is a picture drawn by an American , and therefore by a con - genital optimist , yet it is not a falsification .

		But the enduringly important part of his book is his essay on `` The American Contribution and the Democratic Idea . ''

		Here we have an honest and concrete depiction of the liberal and intelligent and sanguine American mind as it reacts to the circumstances and tendencies of the world war in the
early months of 1918	DATE	.

		We have said that Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	is an optimist , and certainly no one else could have given just this cheerful tone to an essay with his particular title ; nevertheless a colder and more cynically objective mind that of Mr.
A. J. Hobson	PERSON	has shown us that much is to be gained tactically by an `` appeal to reason '' to the closed , reactionary mind .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	gives specific color to this claim when he cites all the American precedents for the statement that the ferment of an awakening conscience and de -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 123 sire to do the decent thing is steadily working among our financial and industrial leaders .

		So far , so good .

		When he comes however to the definite aspects of the American contribution , a realist would have to say that he is expressing hopes rather than actual facts .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	is against intolerance ; he is against an economic boy - cott of
Germany	LOCATION	after the war ; he is sympathetic toward the Russian revolution ; he believes that imperialism is in essence the protection of nationals in foreign countries and cites our last Mexican policy as proof that
America	LOCATION	is against such imperialism ; he is for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	on the general plan outlined by the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- whose programme he calls the most im - portant political document since our own Dec - laration of Independence -RRB- ; he believes both the Republican and Democratic parties moribund and demands a new , liberal party ; he thinks the war is fundamentally a fight for economic even more than political freedom for all the world .

		This of course is exactly what our American contribution ought to be .

		Let us hope that it is what our American contribution may eventually become .

		ORIGINALITY : A Popular Study of the Creative Mind .

		By
T. Sharper Knowl	ORGANIZATION	- son .

		Lippincott ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		It is not every schoolmaster who carries through a wide , and perforce passing , acquaint - ance with contemporaneous books such a sagacity of selection and combination as hath T. Sharper
Knowlson	PERSON	-LRB- and what kindly fate bestowed such name ? -RRB-

		.

		Shrewd culling , clever collocation , comment -LRB- always schoolmasterish -RRB- , banal and refreshing by turns , and all led by an honest interest such are the traits ; and the result is a humanely bookish impression of the vogue of quotidian Anglo-American culture -LRB- our author is flatteringly aware of American books -RRB- in a sphere just better than social and just short of serious accomplishment .

		It is a book on `` originality '' obviously composed out of a well - ordered commonplace book , and yet it `` goes '' more often than it lapses !

		The vulgar would credit the author with `` punch '' sedate , book - ish punch , of the same sort -LRB- though in consist - ency as bouillon to pot-au-feu -RRB- one finds in
Burton	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , the analogy goes beyond man - ner to subject and matter ; for `` Originality , '' like the `` Anatomy , '' is a contribution to an unnamed science of man which finds , with equal zest , relevancy in facts physiological , psycho - logical , biological , theological one focus to all learning .

		A twentieth-century supplement to
Burton	LOCATION	, color sanguineous resurfacing the atra - bile , and for the learned Latins your Freud ,
Bergson	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Galton	PERSON	,
Dewey	LOCATION	,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	, et al. why not ?

		Besides , there is a final sec - tion on `` Praxis , '' with good horse-sense sug - gestions for those who wish to be originals and do n't know how .

		Which is of itself deserving of honest applause ; as , again with
Burton	PERSON	, `` omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci . ''

		FEODOR
VLADIMIR LARROVITCH	PERSON	: An Appre - ciation of his Life and Works .

		Edited by
William George Jordan	PERSON	and
Richardson Wright	PERSON	.

		The Authors ' Club ,
New York	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		To the uninitiated this black-bound volume will appear simply another rather dull tribute to an author of whom they have never heard .

		And indeed it is only a careful perusal of it that rewards even the interested .

		Larrovitch 's name is surely an unfamiliar one .

		But here it boasts no less a spokesman than
Professor Giddings	ORGANIZATION	.

		He declares that this remarkable Russian , whose death , we are told , occurred in
1881	DATE	, `` warned of the impending war '' in such arresting words as these : `` Kultur is the integration of
Hohen	LOCATION	- zollerns , accompanied by the differentiation and the segregation of nations , and the concomitant dissipation of Teutons . ''

		But the most fascin - ating chapters in this book of appreciations are those which deal with the personal side of
Larro	PERSON	- vitch and with his place in literature , and the really choice bibliographical notes and references .

		The latter relieve us somewhat of a too burden - some ignorance of this unique figure in Russian literature , as it appears that his works have been translated into French and German , Bulgarian , Italian , and Yiddish , but never into English .

		The following excerpt will give some flavor of the early chapters : His wife meanwhile , in an age when the ideas of commerce and manufacturing had hardly penetrated the mind of
Russia	LOCATION	, was keenly interested in all kinds of textiles , silks , linens , cottons , everything of the sort .

		In fact , she would accumulate from among the neighbors during the week , picturesque panniers or baskets of these fabrics , soiled by usage or wear , and by the application of saponaceous agents and enthusi - astic personal labor would work far into the night demonstrating the chemical reactions and cleansing effects of her various devices aided by her own physical efforts .

		The volume , which is illustrated with portraits of
Larrovitch	PERSON	and photographs of his personal effects and of his tomb , concludes with a plea for the establishment of a Larrovitch Founda - tion and Fellowship .

		It is sincerely to be hoped that the authors of this engaging book will re - ceive the necessary pecuniary support for such a foundation , if merely to reward them for the amusement afforded by a hoax almost as elabor - ate and quite as delicious as that of their friends the Spectrists .

		For Larrovitch never existed outside of the minds of the editors and those friends who cooperated with them .

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	oisr NEW WAB BOOKS Now that the flood of war books has reached so high a tide , their value for us lies not so much in what they add to our knowledge of war as in what they show us of the reactions of men to it .


Emmanuel Bourcier	PERSON	, in his new volume , `` Under the German Shells '' -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is con - cerned chiefly in describing what he has seen and endured at the front ; but the reader 's inter - est comes in watching him as he responds dra - matically and , for the most part , unconsciously to each situation .

		Without , one imagines , exag - gerating the high lights ,
M. Bourcier	PERSON	has given us a sense of war 's tight-strung intensity , of its emotional and nervous stimulus that is like an intoxication the eager agony of .

		waiting before the attack ; the steely grimness , the brute ecstasy of men in action ; the passion of resoluteness when the order comes to `` hold your position until the death '' ; the tensity of the night silences in the front lines ; the overpowering heaviness of sleep after days and nights of superhuman strain and fatigue in a great attack .

		The book has charm of style also the charm of dramatic simplicity , of brevity , imagination , and a keen sensitiveness to beauty .

		It is emotional rather than reflective , because it is true to the life of the poilu .

		Indeed , it is sometimes too emotional for us , too naively direct , but that is because it is French , and we do not understand .


M. Bourcier	PERSON	was already , before the war , one of the arriving younger men of letters in
France	LOCATION	.

		He fought in the battle of the Marne and at
Verdun	LOCATION	, and in
1916	DATE	he came to the
United States	LOCATION	as a member of the
French Military Commission	ORGANIZATION	, remaining until very recently as instructor in liason at
Camp Grant	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	's book `` Great
Britain	LOCATION	at War '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- is a slight one , being made up of short magazine articles on vari - ous topics relating to the Britons ' part in the war .

		He evidently had exceptional opportunities for visiting munition factories , shipyards , training camps , and hospitals , as well as certain parts of the front ; but the result is hardly more than an interesting verification of the hypothesis that the writer of popular fiction is apt to find his limita - tions when he essays to move his readers through the presentation of facts .

		Among the few rather vivid bits of description is that which tells how he was given a demonstration of various kinds of gases , with the dramatic accent laid on the lachrymatory .

		Another pictures a battlefield with the evidences of carnage still uncovered .

		It is quite horrible , but inadequate .

		In the less intense portions of the book Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	's pen may be halting because of the inhibitions of the censor , but in the rest his inadequacy is no doubt attributable to the embarrassment of a romancer in the presence of grim reality .

		The volume is not an important contribution to the literature of the war .

		In his foreword to `` Front Lines '' -LRB- Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	Cable expresses the contempt felt by the soldiers at the front for civilians at home who grumble at such slight inconveniences as the war conditions impose .

		Then he proceeds to depict life in the trenches with realism , so that the civilian may know why he should not com - plain that there is too little sugar for his tea and that there is a tax on theater tickets .

		The realism is not sordid .

		It includes the humor and the small talk that is current among the men , and it breathes life into the dramatic episodes that are chronicled .

		It lifts the book out of the `` thriller '' classification .

		How Private
Copple	PERSON	brought art into the trenches by taking a cue from
Corporal Richard	ORGANIZATION	's propensity for model - ing in clay is an incident of which Kipling could not have made better use .

		Another humorous chapter records the dialogue in which the `` skip - per '' of a land battleship almost convinces a dispatch-rider that the tank walked four miles under water along the bottom of a canal .

		Some exceedingly picturesque description of a subjec - tive nature is inckided in the sketch called `` Nightmare , '' which describes a charge on an enemy emplacement under cover of barrage fire , and the intimacy of its detail suggests that the author has been close to similar incidents .

		Taken as a whole , the chapters make up a graphic and stirring presentation of warfare on the front lines .

		Mr.
Thomas Tiplady	PERSON	in his book `` The Soul of the Soldier '' -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- has at once the preacher 's habit and the essayist 's manner .

		In consequence , although he illuminates his chapters with the most vivid narratives of soldier experi - ence and thinking , one feels the almost unchange - able background of Christianity with which he approached the war , lived in it , and brooded over it and over the souls of soldiers .

		Some of the idols of the market place have intruded them - selves upon the seclusion of his thought , as they do on most men of the cloth .

		He is at times too tolerant of snobbishness : witness the young Eton man who `` showed a self-control which only cen - turies of breeding could give . ''

		He is dogmatic , too , in matters of religious faith .

		He insists on the symbolism of the cross for the soldier and says that `` it has provided him with the only acceptable philosophy of the war '' and that `` the Cross of Christ is the centre of the picture for evermore , and the grouping of all other figures must be round it . ''

		But these are invidious examples of Chaplain
Tiplady	PERSON	when he is most passionately assertive .

		Each chapter has in it something of observation of men in war , of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 125 sympathy with the dumb agony in the trenches which leaves men nothing to do but pray or curse , as well as of the valiant cheerfulness which bursts into song .

		He handsomely admits that it took the war to reveal to him the inwardness of common men , who become transfigured before his eyes .

		His is the confession of a man who has been able to maintain his belief , dogmatic as it is , against horrors no portion of which he shirked either with his body or with his quick sympathies .

		Mr.
Heywood Broun	PERSON	carried over with him to his war correspondence as expressed in his book `` The A. E. F. '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- some - thing of his genial , anecdotal style as writer on sports for the newspapers .

		It is the good humor of the first Americans to enter the great war that he has set down easily .

		In fact little but the good-humored side of the great American adven - ture is permitted to come to the surface .

		Non - chalance or a joke in the face of danger is the order of his day .

		The character of the book is due partly to Mr.
Broun	PERSON	's inability to resist his talent for spinning yarns .

		One of his immortals is the sergeant whose studies were directed to the French equivalent for : `` Give me a plate of ham and eggs .

		How much ? ''

		`` What 's your name ? ''

		and `` Do you love me , kid ? ''

		He makes record of that historic first crap game played by dough - boys on French soil .

		And not least , there is the plaintive mule-skinner who remarks apropos of a refractory beast named Bill : `` I do n't like him as well as the rest of the mules , and I hate 'em all . ''

		Mr.
Broun	PERSON	's legions , setting out , are unbled .

		He himself is a newspaper observer seeing the sights , the war made easy , playing up what newspaper men call `` human interest stuff . ''

		The darker moments are not yet .

		It speaks well for much of his newspaper correspondence that it stands the test of republication .

		It has a value as a record of a state of mind at the outset of the great American adventure .

		It could not be written later on .

		Other books will come , about Americans in war , not so genially anecdotal as this of Mr.
Broun	PERSON	's .

		The rising pile of khaki-bound manuals , handbooks , guides , vocabularies , scrapbooks , and what not addressed to our embarking soldiers discloses two little books which have the merits of authority , brevity , and convenient arrange - ment : a `` Handbook of
Northern France	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
William Morris Davis	PERSON	-LRB-
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- and `` Health for the Sol - dier and Sailor , '' by Professor
Irving Fisher	PERSON	and Dr.
Eugene Lyman Fisk	PERSON	-LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	; 60 cts . -RRB-

		.

		Professor I > .

		i \ is , who is now Chairman of the
Geography Committee of the National Research Council	ORGANIZATION	, describes succinctly with maps , charts , and tables the geographical fea - tures of importance to officers working in northern
France	LOCATION	.

		Both his method and his vocabulary hit the golden mean between the too popular and too technical .

		The index however is not so valuable for quick reference as it would be if it were more comprehensive and more definitive : an officer on the
Meuse	LOCATION	, for instance , hunting a half-forgotten fact , might not always have time to look up all the fifteen page refer - ences to that river .

		`` Health for the Soldier and Sailor '' has no alphabetical index at all ; otherwise it is an admirable book of advice for both the officer and the private , neither of whom is likely to take too seriously its doubtless sound , but per - haps inopportune , strictures on alcohol and to - bacco .

		Professor
Fisher	PERSON	is Chairman , and Dr.
Fisk	PERSON	is Medical Director , of the
Life Extension Institute	ORGANIZATION	, whose
Hygiene Reference Board	ORGANIZATION	has endorsed the war hygiene material they have assembled .

		`` Keeping Our Fighters Fit '' -LRB- Century ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , written by
Edward Frank Allen	PERSON	with the cooperation of
Raymond Fosdick	PERSON	, Chairman of the War and
Navy Departments	ORGANIZATION	' Commission on Training Camp Activities , may not be inter - esting as a piece of literature , but it will no doubt be of value to those who need reassurance con - cerning their sons and brothers in the training camps .

		Its purpose is to describe the work of the
Commission on Training Camp Activities	ORGANIZATION	, in the creating and maintaining of camp morale ; and it does this very comfortingly .

		The spirit of our fighters who sing and laugh is , we are told , the finest of any army in the world , thanks to the services in the cantonments of a network of social and recreational agencies the
Y. M. C. A.	PERSON	, the
Hostess Houses	ORGANIZATION	, Liberty theatres , libraries , ath - letics , and the organization of many forces which make for wholesomeness of attitude and health of body .

		The book deals rather lightly with the negative and preventive sides of the work of the
Camp Activities Commission	ORGANIZATION	perhaps because it has been proceeding on the theory that \ \ hoU-MMue amusement will provide against the lure of the forbidden saloon and the red-light district .

		The critical reader will regret that the author has not given us a franker account of some of the social facts to be combatted by the commission .

		But to have discussed these would have been to defeat the constructive aim of the book .

		The volume is ungrammatical here and there , and written in an easy popular style .

		These facts need not , howex er , much diminish its value to those for whom it is written those at home who want to know that their `` boys '' in camp are working and playing under the auspices of a \ vholesome morale .

		126 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	osr NEW FICTION Adjectives like theatrical , fabulous , or prosy show how a good word-horse can be ridden to verbal death .

		Add to the list as one will , while the nouns keep their original value the adjectives formed from them grow more and more corrupt .

		For example , consider fiction and fictitious .

		Fic - tion we enjoy just as we trust a lie for the first time ; in fictitious fiction , however , we recognize the artfulness of a second offense .

		Here are three collections of short stories , sufficiently similar in aim since they are the recent magazine contribu - tions iof three practiced writers , which vary sig - nificantly in the degree of their success .

		`` The Flying Teuton , '' by
Alice Brown	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , and `` Gaslight Sonatas , '' by
Fannie Hurst	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , sound like the second offenses they are ; `` The Key of the Fields and Boldero , '' by
Henry Milner Rideout	PERSON	-LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , does not which reminds one of
Whistler	LOCATION	's famous rebuke to a well-intentioned friend who sewed up the hole in his hat .

		`` A hole , sir , '' he cried , ripping out the stitches , `` might happen to anyone ; a patch is premeditated poverty . ''

		This poverty in premeditation is what is shown in the first two volumes .

		`` Gaslight Sonatas '' probes too hard and too painfully with the literary instru - ment known as realism .

		`` The Flying Teuton , '' on the other hand , is the ether of etherealized lit - erary atmosphere .

		These are such stories as Miss
Brown	PERSON	and other excellent writers made the standard for literary magazines fifteen or twenty years ago .

		Good stories they are , admirably told the experiences of offhand men of letters with briar pipes , the apocalypses in store for Americans on the continent , the psychic visions our young men shall see .

		`` The Key of the Fields '' and `` Boldero '' are two as ripping yarns as Mr.
Ride	PERSON	- out has written since his `` Blue Peter '' of under - graduate days or since the `` Twisted Foot '' of later date .

		No blue prints of realism , no gray half-tones of the brain or soul for him , but action and color worthy of Sorolla .

		Now of `` Gaslight Sonatas '' it can be said that no one objects to unpleasant stories simply because they are unpleasant .

		One takes one 's medicine , hoping it will do one good .

		Yet it is difficult to imagine anyone taking medicine for medicine 's sake , squalor for squalor 's sake , although
Miss Hurst	PERSON	gives it an undeniable piquancy which makes it go down easily .

		Curiously blended with the other strains , too , is a strain of pronounced sen - timentality , which weakens the effectiveness of the work and enforces its fictitious quality .

		But the one of these three authors with the Touch - stone-like grace in weaving fabrications is Mr.
Rideout	PERSON	.

		More extravagant than those of the other two volumes in lavish use of plot and set - ting , these picaresque tales have somehow less pre - tense .

		This may come from the fact that one expects less accuracy from a romancer .

		Never - theless Jackdabos in `` The Key of the Fields '' and Door-nail Jimmy in `` Boldero '' emerge from these clouds of fantasy as creatures alertly alive and fascinating the former a cosmopolitan young mountebank of versatile accomplishments , first found with his two companions ,
Puig	PERSON	and Bar - javel , in a town in southern
France	LOCATION	; the other a distinguished Orientalist who assumed the role of a doddering miser in the Chinese quarter of a Western town .

		Both stories charm with bizarre antitheses , their enjoyment being in no way hur - ried by any very precise schedule of plot .

		On page forty of
Elizabeth Jordan	PERSON	's `` Wings of Youth '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	,
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- we find the follow - ing : `` The thing often happens in books , rarely in real life .

		It had happened to him . ''

		What had happened ?

		The aristocratic young
Devons	PERSON	, brother and sister , of
Devondale	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, tackle
New York	LOCATION	on fifty dollars each and pledge each other to stay a year and earn a living by the sweat of their respective brows .


Laurie Devon	PERSON	is something of a black sheep and agrees to his sister 's plan for his redemption through a year of voluntary exile from the advantages and disad - vantages of his inherited wealth and position .

		The beautiful
Barbara Devon	PERSON	-LRB- now `` Miss Smith '' -RRB- addresses envelopes , plays accompani - ments , and lives in a hall bedroom , first having the good fortune to set down her traveling case for the right man to stumble over .

		With the oc - casional help of this timely admirer she makes good her part of the bargain and stays the year out on her own resources .

		The once dissolute
Laurie	PERSON	sticks resolutely to the task of becoming a success - ful playwright .

		The trials of writing for the stage are clearly and sympathetically set forth .

		Miss
Jordan	PERSON	is evidently sure of her ground here ; and the striking triumph of the young dramatist is made more generally plausible than the romantic adventures of his sister .

		Hard work and the re - sponsibilities of making good prove the necessary stimulus for the hitherto purposeless young man .

		The
Devons	PERSON	return to their aristocratic home with a new appreciation of the simple and funda - mental values of life .

		`` Wings of Youth '' is a diverting fairy story which aspires to reality .

		The puzzle of personality is given a unique and sympathetic treatment in `` The Man Who Survived , '' by
Camille Marbo	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		A striking situation , that of one man 's spirit in another man 's body , is made appealing by imagi - native presentation .

		No scientific explanation is hinted until the idea has been made artistically conceivable in the careful development of mood and the interplay of personalities .

		And then the explanation is not insisted upon ; it is merely sug - gested .

		The mystery of physical and mental re - lationship , the subtle influence of matter upon mind , the possibilities as well as the limitations of human will are forces which the author handles
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 127 with delicacy and intelligent humility .

		The story itself , concerning the return from war of a man who must meet friends , wife , and work in his comrade 's body , is consistently less arrest - ing than the psychological problem it creates .

		To be told , at the beginning of a book , that the author was able to write it by means of a former incarnation , that the scenes and details are due to a sort of remembrance , is not ordinarily the most encouraging introduction .

		One opens the book fearing an overdose of pseudo-similitude .

		This fear however in the case of `` My Two Kings , '' by Mrs.
Evan Nepean	PERSON	-LRB- Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is very pleasantly dismissed .

		The story is set in the Stuart Restoration period , including the last part of the reign of
Charles II	PERSON	and the short reign of James II .

		Luckily , the treatment of this bit of English history is peculiarly appropriate .

		Not only do the colorful pictures of court scenes and actors suggest a Meissonier series in grace and detail , but the characters of the
King	LOCATION	, of
Monmouth	LOCATION	, of
Nell Gwynn	PERSON	, and of her rivals are touched with a sympathy really
Carolinian	LOCATION	.

		It is certain that dictionaries and encyclopedias and even
Pepys	PERSON	himself , to whom the reader flies upon finishing the book a rather good test of excellence in an historical novel , by the way fail to suggest what the author of the book implies , that the real reason for
Charles	PERSON	's reign of twenty - five years was his charm of personality .

		The story has the air of a warm personal document , and its sincerity and disinterestedness add to its fascination .

		There is only one reason why it should not make a great success if it were filmed : the censor might not approve of the moral if there is one .

		There is an engaging bit of derring do in
Marion Hill	PERSON	's `` The Toll of the Road '' -LRB-
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		In a would-be popular novel whose audacity merits the popularity it has probably forfeited the heroine is forced to the inevitable choice between home-town respecta - bility , with marriage to the usual reliable sturdy - oak fiance , and a stage career which promises to involve her in an affair with her brilliant but already married playwright-manager .

		In the face of every best-seller precedent she chooses the career .

		The road has already taken its toll of her in prejudices , illusions , lifelong habits of mind and person ; she is `` traveling lighter than before . ''

		And , on the whole , she is seeing with clearer eyes , except when she regards `` genius , '' of which she discovers a staggering amount .

		Both stage and village are presented candidly and sympathetically , though the luckless fiance is made unnecessarily self-centered .

		The reader of `` The Statue in the Wood , '' by
Richard Pryce	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is likely to fall back upon the adjective `` curious '' as the only keyword to his reaction from the story .

		The novel deals with an incident cover - ing two years , the awakening of passion in a young widow whose conventional marriage had left her untouched .

		The overseer of her estate , serenely healthy and unconscious of her almost childlike adoration , becomes , not her lover , but her beloved , and the father of her child .

		One has throughout a strange sense of looking through a lens at the characters , so detached and un - conscious they seem .

		Yet they , are far from being unreal even in their astonishing situation .

		There is more than a tinge of Hardy in the fatality , and in the understanding of feminine psychology a grateful novelty .

		The engaging whimsicality of `` Miss Pirn 's Camouflage , '' by Lady Stanley -LRB-
Houghton Mif	ORGANIZATION	- flin ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is perhaps its most distinguishing quality .

		In a deluge of war stories it achieves individuality by its delicious humor , its quaintly impossible premise , and the absorbing complica - tions which follow .

		Miss Pirn , a sedate English spinster of fifty , suddenly finds herself possessed of a most miraculous gift a power which enables her to render patriotic service at a crisis in her country 's history .

		She visits the battlefields of
France	LOCATION	, interviews military leaders , meets the
Kaiser	PERSON	himself , and all but ends his atrocious ac - tivities .

		The author does not attempt plausibil - ity ; she just writes an interesting story , making capital of absurdity .

		`` The Road That Led Home , '' by Will E. Ingersoll -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is a fairly well writ - ten if not convincingly original story .

		It has a somewhat conventional prairie setting .

		There is a farmer , a transplanted city-waitress wife -LRB- de - scribed not without some instinctive gift for psy - chological analysis -RRB- , an Englishman in the wilds and a love story .

		The hero is a schoolmaster ; the heroine , a daughter of the prairie .

		Mr.
Ingersoll	PERSON	writes well enough for one to wish he might find material less well worn , and situations less threadbare , on which to employ his powers of delineation and characterization .

		Inevitably somebody besides the joke writers must have taken advantage of the humor of war - time food conservation ; and what more revealing point of view than that of the small grocer , or more adequately still , the grocer 's delivery boy ?


J. J. Bell	PERSON	's latest story , ``
Johnny Pryde	PERSON	, '' -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- , is worthy of its predecessors , `` Wee Macgreegor '' and `` Wully McWattie . ''

		And it is the grocer boy speaking .

		Being a grocer in wartime , his employer has observed , is `` a fair tradegy . ''

		The humor has the true Scottish flavor , and the author accomplishes the difficult feat of making
Johnny	PERSON	seem human as well as perpetually humorous .

		A diverting if fragile tale , ``
Johnny Pryde	PERSON	'' should serve to lighten the par - ticular war gloom of anyone who gives an hour to the cheery little volume .

		128 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 15	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT IT IS EXTRAORDINARY HOW LITTLE WE KNOW about the American mind .

		We are not an intro - spective nation .

		And although we have had our fair share of description by foreign discoverers , it is really remarkable how they have confined themselves to what one might call the externals of American life .

		There are innumerable books on our industrial and economic institutions , on our system of politics , our material resources , our complexities of nationalities in the great `` melting pot . ''

		Yet when we strive to find a book which deals primarily with the peculiar and individual thing , the American mind and the American point of view , the task is almost insuperable .

		The truth is , every observer ourselves included shrinks from the task because of its enormous dif - ficulties and complexities .

		We have not yet de - veloped a specific national culture which is recog - nizable in terms of our older categories .

		We have no homogeneous background of folk legends .

		As much as the war has already bound us together , it has most strikingly revealed our heterogeneity , the fact that
America	LOCATION	means so many different things to so many different sections of our popu - lation .

		There is a tremendous organization at work already on the task of `` Americanization , '' a task we ought to have undertaken years ago .

		Yet in spite of these evidences of spiritual dis - unity , it is an indubitable fact that the American type of soldier in
France	LOCATION	has something which distinguishes him from all the other types .

		The `` doughboy , '' as we affectionately call him , is somehow a specific person .

		There is one indubi - table quality of the American mind its high spirits , its divine , jesting irreverence .

		We civilians who stay at home and work ourselves into fits of alternate depression and elation might learn with profit from the men actually at the front , who have not yet forgotten how to laugh .

		But back of that optimism and humor are concealed all sorts of qualities and tendencies which no student of the American mind has yet adequately exposed .

		One very discerning observer once said of us that in the mass Americans were the most unhappy and restless people on the face of the earth ex - cept that they refused to recognize it .

		And when we read the posthumous papers of our most characteristic humorist ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, that obser - vation does not seem wholly inept .

		But whatever we are , whatever the American mind is , it is worth knowing .

		If all of us had taken the trouble to understand the German mind some twenty years ago its fear , its jealousy at what it thought was unjust discrimination against Ger - many , its technical assiduity and tenacity , its docility what horrors the world might have been spared through understanding .

		It is as im - portant today for the world to understand the American mind .

		We are becoming one of the great , powerful nations of the world .

		If our great power is to be used for the benefit and advancement of the world , it is important that other nations should understand us ; it is impera - tive that we should understand ourselves .

		LIBERALS IN ALL COUNTRIES WILL FEEL DEEP disappointment in the decision which the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can
Government	ORGANIZATION	has considered it necessary to make respecting our joint action with
Japan	LOCATION	in protecting the Czecho-Slovaks in
Siberia	LOCATION	and else - where in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It had been earnestly hoped that
Russia	LOCATION	might find a way to solve her own difficulties without foreign assistance .

		One of the general principles for which we are fighting in this war is the free right of all nations to deter - mine their own destiny , and we distinctly affirm that it is in no sense our intention to interfere with the political sovereignty of
Russia	LOCATION	or to in - tervene in her internal affairs , `` not even in the local affairs of the limited areas which her -LSB- of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- military force may be obliged to occupy '' or , finally , to impair either now or here - after her territorial integrity .

		No one can ques - tion that such is our settled intention .

		Yet later in the same note we specifically state that our conclusions , while agreed to in principle by the nations with which we are associated in this war , do not in any sense limit the independent action of these other nations .

		There can be little ques - tion that , whatever our intention , we have em - barked upon a perilous course of action which may lead us in any one of a hundred directions .

		Simi - larly , there can be little question that , whatever our settled principles , from the Russian point of view the policy will and must distinctly appear as a meddling policy , violating our principle of non - interference in the destinies of nations .

		We can not go into the reasons which compelled President
Wilson	PERSON	to make his present decision , for we have not been permitted to know them .

		Nevertheless certain conclusions may be drawn from the fact of the decision itself .

		Evidently the Soviet Government is much weaker than had commonly been assumed in well-informed circles .

		It is hardly to be supposed that our present plans would have been put into action had it not been thought that the chance of their success was at least better than fifty per cent .

		And certain considerations can be brought to the support of this seemingly official view .

		The Czecho-Slovaks do occupy a strategic situation which will enable them to starve out the
Bolshevik Government	ORGANIZATION	in central
Russia	LOCATION	this
winter	DATE	.

		The great mass of the peasantry care little about anything except holding what land they possess .

		They are willing to make use of the local Soviet organization and even to elect representatives to the central con - , gress .

		But they neither understand nor care particularly about Bolshevik theories .

		In the last analysis they will support any government which
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 129 allows them to keep their land and lets them alone .

		There is little nationalistic feeling , and an ineradicable aversion to fighting as such .

		If the
Bolshevik Government	ORGANIZATION	can be overthrown ; if a new government , commanding the will of the Russian people and favorable to the Allied cause , can be erected ; and if , finally , an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	front can be reconstituted ; then the move will be justified in terms of present Allied political strategy .

		But this is an exceedingly large order , and no one can survey the known facts without serious misgivings .

		The presence of Japanese and Chinese troops on Russian soil may very possibly raise the religious issue .

		If something like a holy war is started against the heathen invaders , as they will be called , the presence of American troops in the invading army will not be likely to reassure the ignorant and superstitious peasantry .

		The possibilities of such a war , if it should occur , are plainly ominous .

		Or again , suppose the Bolsheviks , confronted on one side by the
German Government	ORGANIZATION	, with whom they are nominally at peace , and on the other by the Allied forces , with whom they will then be actually at war , should decide to throw in their lot with the Austro-Germans .

		Can we contem - plate with equanimity the very probable employ - ment of large Russian forces , recruited or im - pressed by the Germans , on either the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	or the Western front ?

		We ought to have a very clear idea concerning the Bolshevik theory of this war .

		Fanatically , these in , transigeant theorists believe that if only they can so arrange matters as to be left alone in a large section of
Russia	LOCATION	and to see to it that all other nations keep up the war among themselves to the point of blood and economic exhaustion , then the Bolsheviks can impose their will upon a tired and revolutionary-minded world .

		It is , if one likes , the theory of madness ; but madmen are dangerous , and we should not take any step which by ever so little plays into their hands .

		The need for a quick and decisive victory over
Germany	LOCATION	is now imperative .

		Our own American note states at the beginning very clearly : `` Military intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	would be more likely to add to the present sad confusion there than to cure it and would injure
Russia	LOCATION	rather than help her out of her distresses ... We are bending all our energies now to the pur - pose , the resolute and confident purpose , of winning on the Western front , and it would in the judgment of the Government of the
United States	LOCATION	be most unwise to divide or dissipate our forces . ''

		Let us never forget this wise caution , and let us not be drawn into any course of action whereby the Western front sinks into a position of relative unimportance and the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	front becomes the military centre of gravity .

		It is to be hoped that the economic commission to
Russia	LOCATION	which the note suggests will speedily be dis - patched , and that our action in
Russia	LOCATION	will em - phasize our hope and desire to rehabilitate as speedily as may be the shattered economic and industrial life of that tragic nation .

		IF COUNT VON HERTLING 'S PEACE TERMS , recently outlined in the press , really represent the views of the ruling class in
Germany	LOCATION	, then there can be no argument that all political strat - egy is utterly lacking in German official circles .

		Without going into details , these terms may not be unfairly described as a demand for the earth and the fulness thereof .

		One would think that with the German defeat on the Marne and the successful British advance , with
Russia	LOCATION	proving a barren triumph , with the growing discontent of the German people , with the prospect of a com - mercial boycott after the war staring her in the face , with the increase in shipbuilding and army recruiting in our own country one would think that with all these facts confronting her , some - body of official rank in
Germany	LOCATION	would begin to talk sense instead of nonsense .

		Of course , the probabilities are that such a speech as
Von Hert	LOCATION	- ling 's is meant for home consumption , and for
Junker	PERSON	consumption at that .

		If so , it is the height of political folly for the German leaders to allow it to circulate outside
Germany	LOCATION	.

		For those who can see beyond the end of their noses in
Germany	LOCATION	are no longer talking about a victory which is already unthinkable ; they are wonder - ing how
Germany	LOCATION	can end the war without com - plete disaster and ruin .

		Already the unofficial utterances of some of
Germany	LOCATION	's intellectual lead - ers -LRB- aside from
Harden	LOCATION	, who long ago seemed to have acquired the habit of telling the truth -RRB- , and the tone of many of the editorials in the newspapers , have undergone change .

		When these unofficial views of moderation , based first of all on the assumption that victory for Ger - many is impossible , become the official German views , then there will be some hope of talking about the end of the war .

		But certainly not until then .

		We ought to remember , too , that this is not a question of sincerity .

		There is really no reforming people like
Hertling	PERSON	,
Stumm	PERSON	,
Hintz	PERSON	,
Tirpitz	ORGANIZATION	,
Ludendorff	LOCATION	, and the rest of the bandit clique : they never learn and they never forget .

		But there is such a thing as their yielding to pres - sure which they can not resist , whether military , economic , or political .

		Already our military pres - sure must be causing sleepless nights to the Ger - man
General Staff	ORGANIZATION	, just as our economic pressure must be causing sleepless nights to the German bankers , industrialists , shippers , and traders .

		Let us also add to the political pressure , and refuse to play the Germans ' own game by answering `` bit - ter end '' speeches with similar `` bitter end '' speeches .

		Let us answer with speeches of moder - ation and clearness which even in the minds of the German people must contrast favorably with their own leaders ' blood-and-iron nonsense .

		130 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	BRIEFER MENTION In most of the many books constructed round the subject of women and the war there is a complacent acceptance and refurbishing of common material with little effort to search out the new .


Harriott Stanton Blatch	PERSON	, author of `` Mobilizing Woman - Power '' -LRB- Woman 's Press ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , has read the some - what exhaustive though valuable report of
the Health of Munition Workers Committee	ORGANIZATION	, but she has never apparently been tempted to inquire about the report on elevator girls and car conductors in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		Therefore she finds no objectionable features in these occupations , which in
America	LOCATION	are constant - ly recruiting women workers .

		She also has a jumpy habit of mind which allows her to jot down at ran - dom ill-digested conclusions .

		After she has laid herself open to criticism on the ground of one or two misstatements -LRB- for instance , concerning the comparison between the health of city and country dwellers brought out by the draft figures , and the equal necessity for protection in industry of male and female workers -RRB- one is not tempted to take too seriously her assumption that it is the poorer classes who should support the war by their economy , rather than the well-to-do .

		She claims that `` the richer a family is , the more it saves by skilled ser - vice . ''

		However , her book as a whole does not bear a consistently reactionary stamp , and her final plea for the consideration of the unpaid labor of the individual housewife as a real economic factor de - mands consideration .

		`` Maids , Wives and Widows , '' by Rose Falls Bres -LRB- Duttpn ; $ 2 -RRB- , may be classed among the real con - tributions to the woman literature of the day .

		It contains a useful digest of the different state laws affecting women and children , and also discussion , historical and argumentative , on the subjects of woman 's legal status , marriage and divorce , mothers ' pensions , child labor and minimum wage , and con - tracts and forms .

		We can not help regretting that the state laws were not tabulated in a more accessible form .

		Considering the scope of this volume , it would have been a difficult task , but one well worth attempting .

		Since the subject is in itself dry and not likely to be approached by anyone who is not desirous of getting the unadorned facts , it would add to the value of the volume were they set forth in the most unadorned way .

		That will be the noble task of some future statistician .

		Meanwhile Mrs.
Bres	PERSON	's book will be of very practical interest and value to the women of this country who intend to use their vote intelligently .

		`` The New Voter , '' by
Charles Willis Thompson	PERSON	-LRB-
Putnam	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , proclaims its contents as `` things he and she ought to know about politics and citizen - ship . ''

		So far , so good ; they are .

		The volume forms a simple and readable introduction to more scholarly books on government .

		A lawyer , a cor - respondent , an ex-Congressman , and a skeptical husband gather about a table conversationally to instruct a business woman and a college woman in the meaning of the familiar terms and habits of the political world .

		As information it is all very sound and true , but not for one moment can we believe that the moral drawn would have satisfied the two questioners .

		The discussion swings round the Democratic and Republican parties , fusion , Tam - many , certain historical incidents , and some current gossip .

		It dismisses socialism under the heading `` Minor Parties , '' and terminates with a hymn of praise to the Constitution and a back-handed slap at the `` American Bolsheviki . ''

		The series of articles first came into print in the columns of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		Anthologies are notoriously exclusive .

		And `` The Melody of
Earth	LOCATION	, '' selected by Mrs.
Waldo Richards	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is quite literally an anthology , in that it concerns itself with nothing but garden verse , is suspicious of wild flowers that might be only weeds , and for all its catholicity has omitted most of the poems that one would hope to find in such a volume .

		The list of contributors is a joy in itself however .

		Conceive of turning page after page in which such names as these follow each other in quick succession :
Arthur Guiterman	PERSON	,
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	,
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	,
Robert Frost	PERSON	,
Mary MacMillan	PERSON	,
Sara Teasdale	PERSON	,
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	,
Harry Kemp	PERSON	,
Amy Lowell	PERSON	,
Ella Wheeler Wilcox	PERSON	,
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	,
Henry A. Wise Wood	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are about two hundred of them in bewildering juxtaposition .

		But the compiler has been almost unfailing in choosing such examples of the important poets ' work as would contrast not too terribly with that of the minors .

		What is yet more wonderful is the sort of thing that seems to her to concern gardens .

		As well as the sort of thing that does n't .

		But if one can skip joyfully from `` within garden walls '' to `` gardens overseas , '' and thence `` under - neath the bough , `` and eventually find oneself in `` the garden of life , '' almost any poem might be quotable .

		The one definite impression that these three hundred and one pages leave upon an embarrassed reviewer is that horticulture should be left to scientists and poets to their own , wider and wilder , field .

		No series of travel books is at once so scholarly and so popular as the `` Highways and Byways '' series .

		Attractively made , fully illustrated , each volume is a guide to an English shire , accurate in its historical details and its archaeological data , and each is sufficiently a stylistic success to make its perusal enjoyable .

		The latest volume , `` Highways and Byways of
Wiltshire	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , by the author and illustrator of `` Somerset , '' abounds in historic interest .

		Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	is a com - petent writer , possessing an easy , vigorous style , and he betrays an enthusiasm which is frequently contagious .

		He has a confident , ready knowledge and an aesthetic appreciation of the many beautiful
Norman	PERSON	,
Gothic	ORGANIZATION	, and later monuments of
Wiltshire	LOCATION	, as well as an inherent love for the South English countryside , with its rolling Downs .


Nelly Erich	PERSON	- sen has provided very many attractive pen-and-ink drawings , and an excellent map is included .

		How men , cut off from home and friends , and sub - ject at all times to the capriciousness and tyranny of their German captors , constitute themselves into a more or less socialistic body , meet and conquer economic problems , and become , to all intents and purposes , a world within a world , this is the subject of Mr.
H. C. Mahoney	PERSON	's well written narrative , `` Interned in
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McBride ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- .

		A first - hand account of life in the prison camp at

		THE DIAL JF5 Journal of Criticism and Discussion of Literature and CD * flrts The Mental Attitude of the Educated Classes .

		When we attempt to form our opinions in an intelligent manner , we are inclined to accept the judgment of those who by their education and occupation are compelled to deal with the questions at issue .

		We assume that their views must be rational , and based on intelligent understanding of the problems .

		The foundation of this be - lief is the tacit assumption not only that they have special knowledge but also that they are free to form perfectly rational opinions .

		However , it is easy to see that there is no type of society in existence in which such freedom exists .

		I believe I can make my point clearest by giving an example taken from the life of a people whose cultural conditions are very simple .

		I will choose for this pur - pose the
Eskimo	LOCATION	.

		In their social life they are exceedingly individualistic .

		The social group has so little cohesion that we have hardly the right to speak of tribes .

		A number of families come together and live in the same village , but there is nothing to prevent any one of them from living and settling at another place with other fami - lies .

		In fact during a period of a lifetime the families constituting an Eskimo village community are constantly shifting about ; and while they generally return after many years to the place where their rela - tives live , the family may have belonged to a great many different communities .

		There is no authority vested in any indi - vidual , no chieftancy , and no method by which orders , if they were given , could be carried out .

		In short , so far as law is concerned , we have a condition of almost absolute anarchy .

		We might therefore say that every single person is entirely free , within the limits of his own mental ability , to determine his own mode of life and his own mode of thinking .

		Neverthe - less it is easily seen that there are innumer - able restrictions that determine his be - havior .

		The Eskimo boy learns how to handle the knife , how to use bow and ar - row , how to hunt , how to build a house ; the girl learns how to sew and mend cloth - ing and how to cook ; and during all their life they use their tools in the way they learned in childhood .

		New inventions are rare , and the whole industrial life of the people follows traditional channels .

		What is true of industrial activities is no less true of their thoughts .

		Certain religious ideas have been transmitted to them , notions as to what is right and wrong , certain amuse - ments , and enjoyment of certain types of art .

		Any deviation from these is not likely to occur .

		At the same time it never enters into their minds that any other way of thinking and acting would be possible , and they consider themselves as perfectly free in regard to all their actions .

		Based on our wider experience , we know that the industrial problems of the Eskimo may be solved in a great many other ways and that their religious traditions and social customs might be quite different from what they are .

		From the outside , objective point of view we see clearly the restric - tions that bind the individual who con - siders himself free .

		It is hardly necessary to give many in - stances of these occurrences .

		It seems de - sirable however to illustrate the great strength of these ideas that restrict the freedom of thought of the individual , lead - ing to the most serious mental struggles when traditional social ethics come into conflict with instinctive reactions .

		Thus among a tribe of
Siberia	LOCATION	we find a belief that every person will live in the future life in the same condition in which he finds himself at the time of death .

		As a conse - quence an old man who begins to be de - crepit wishes to die , in order to avoid life as a cripple in the endless future , and it becomes the duty of his son to kill him .

		The son believes in the righteousness of this command but at the same time feels 146 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 5	DATE	the filial love for his father , and many are the instances in which the son has to de - cide between the two conflicting duties the one imposed by the instinctive filial love , the other imposed by the traditional custom of the tribe .

		Another interesting observation may be deduced from those somewhat more com - plex societies in which there is a distinc - tion between different social classes .

		We find such a condition , for instance , in
North America	LOCATION	, among the Indians of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, in which a sharp dis - tinction is made between people of noble birth and common people .

		In this case the traditional behavior of the two classes shows considerable differences .

		The so - cial tradition that regulates the life of the nobility is somewhat analogous to the social tradition in our society .

		A great deal of stress is laid upon the strict ob - servance of convention and upon display , and nobody can maintain his position in high society without an adequate amount of ostentation and without strict regard for conventional conduct .

		These require - ments are so fundamental that an over - bearing conceit and a contempt for the common people become social require - ments of an important chief .

		The con - trast between the social proprieties for the nobility and those for the common peo - ple is very striking .

		Of the common people are expected humbleness , mercy , and all those qualities that we consider amiable and humane .

		Similar observations may be made in all those cases in which , by a complex tradi - tion , a social class is set off from the mass of the people .

		The chiefs of the
Poly	LOCATION	- nesian Islands , the kings in
Africa	LOCATION	, the medicine men of all countries present ex - amples in which a social group 's line of conduct and of thought is strongly modi - fied by their segregation from the mass of the people .

		On the whole , in societies of this type , the mass of the people consider as their ideal those actions which we should characterize as humane ; not by any means that all their actions conform to humane conduct , but their valuation of men shows that the fundamental altruistic principles which we recognize are recog - nized by them too .

		Not so with the privi - leged classes .

		In place of the general humane interest the class interest pre - dominates ; and while it would be wrong to say that their conduct is selfish , it is always so shaped that the interest of the class to which they belong prevails over the interest of society as a whole .

		If it is necessary to secure rank and to enhance the standing of the family by killing a number of enemies , there is no hesitation felt in taking life .

		If the interests of the class require oppression of the rest of the people , then they are oppressed .

		If the interest of the class requires that its mem - bers should not perform menial occupa - tions but should devote themselves to art or learning , then all the members of the class will vie with one another in the at - tainment of these achievements .

		It is for this reason that every segregated class is much more strongly influenced by special traditional ideas than is the mass of the people ; not that the multitude is free to think rationally and that its behavior is not determined by tradition , but that the tradition is not so specific , not so strictly determined in its range , as in the case of the segregated classes .

		For this reason it is often found that the restriction of free - dom of thought by convention is greater in what we might call the educated classes than in the mass of the people .

		I believe this observation is of great importance when we try to understand conditions in our own society .

		Its bearing upon the problem of the psychological sig - nificance of nationalism will at once be apparent ; for the nation is also a segre - gated class , albeit segregated according to other principles ; and the characteristic feature of nationalism is that its social ethical standards are considered .

		as more fundamental than those that are general and human , or rather that the members of each nation like to assume that their ideals are or should be the true ideals of mankind .

		At the same time it illustrates clearly that we should make a fundamental mistake if we should confound class self - ishness and individual selfishness ; for we find the most splendid examples of un - selfish devotion to the interests of the na - tion , heroism that has been rightly praised for thousands of years as the highest virtue , and it is difficult to realize that nevertheless the whole history of mankind
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 147 points in the direction of a human ideal as opposed to a national ideal .

		And indeed may we not continue to admire the self - sacrifice of a great mind , even if we tran - scend to ideals that were not his , and that perhaps , owing to the time and place in which he lived , could not be his ?

		Our observation has also another im - portant application .

		The industrial and economic development of modern times has brought about a differentiation within our population that has never been equaled in any primitive society .

		The occupations of the various parts of a modern
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean or American population differ enor - mously ; so much so , that in many cases it is almost impossible for people speaking the same language to understand one an - other when they talk about their daily work .

		The ideas with which the scientist , the artist , the tradesman , the business man , the laborer operate are so distinctive that they have only a few fundamental ele - ments in common .

		Here it may again be observed that those occupations which are intellectually or emotionally most highly specialized require the longest training , and training always means an infusion of historically transmitted ideas .

		It is there - fore not surprising that the thought of what we call the educated classes is con - trolled essentially by those ideals which have been transmitted to us by past gen - erations .

		These ideals are always highly specialized , and include the ethical tend - encies , the aesthetic inclinations , the intel - lectuality , and the expression of volition , of past times .

		Their control may find ex - pression in a dominant tone which deter - mines our whole mode of thought and which , for the very reason that it has come to be ingrained into our whole mentality , never rises into our , consciousness .

		In those cases in which our reaction is more conscious , it is either positive or neg - ative .

		Our thoughts may be based on a high valuation of the past , or they may be a revolt against it .

		When we bear this in mind we may understand the charac - teristics of the behavior of the intellec - tuals .

		It is a mistake to assume that their mentality is , on the average , appreciably higher than that of the rest of the people .

		Perhaps a greater number of independent minds find their way into this group than into some other group of individuals who are moderately well-to-do ; but their aver - age mentality is surely in no way superior to that of the workingmen , who by the conditions of their youth have been com - pelled to subsist on the produce of their manual labor .

		In both groups mediocrity prevails ; unusually strong and unusually weak individuals are exceptions .

		For this reason the strength of character and in - tellect that is required for vigorous thought on matters in which intense sentiments are involved is not commonly found either among the intellectuals or in any other part of the population .

		This condition , combined with the thoroughness with which the intellectuals have imbibed the traditions of the past , makes the majority of them in all nations conventional .

		It has the effect that their thoughts are based on tradition , and that the range of their vision is liable to be limited .

		Even the apparent exception of the Russian intel - lectuals , who have been brought up under the influence of West European ideas , does not contradict our general conclusion .

		There are of course strong minds among the intellectuals who rise above the con - ventionalism of their class , and attain that freedom that is the reward of a courage - ous search for truth , along whatever path it may lead .

		In contrast to the intellectuals , the masses in our modern city populations are less subject to the influence of traditional teaching .

		They are torn away from school before it can make an indelible impression upon their minds and they may never have known the strength of the conservative influence of a home in which parents and children live a common life .

		The more heterogeneous the society in which they live , and the more the constituent groups are free from historic influences , or the more they represent different historic tra - ditions , the less strongly will they be at - tached to the past .

		It would be an exaggeration if we should extend this view over all aspects of human life .

		I am speaking here only of those fundamental concepts of right and wrong that develop in the segregated classes and in the masses .

		In a society in which beliefs are transmitted with great intensity the impossibility of treating calm - 148 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 5	DATE	ly the views and actions of the heretic is shared by both groups .

		When , through the progress of scientific thought , the foundations of dogmatic belief are shaken among the intellectuals and not among the masses , we find the conditions reversed and greater freedom of traditional forms of thought among the intellectuals at least in so far as the current dogma is in - volved .

		It would also be an exaggeration to claim that the masses can sense the right way of attaining the realization of their ideals , for these must be found by painful experience and by the application of knowl - edge .

		However , neither of these restric - tions touches our main contention ; namely , that the desires of the masses are in a wider sense human than those of the classes .

		It is therefore not surprising that , the masses of the people whose attachment to the past is comparatively slight and who work respond more quickly and more energetically to the urgent demands of the hour than the educated classes , and that the ethical ideals of the best among them are human ideals , not those of a segre - gated class .

		For this reason I should al - ways be more inclined to accept , in regard to fundamental human problems , the judg - ment of the masses rather than the judg - ment of the intellectuals , which is much more certain to be warped by unconscious control of traditional ideas .

		I do not mean to say that the judgment of the masses would be acceptable in regard to every problem of human life , because there are many which , by their technical nature , are beyond their understanding .

		Nor do I believe that the details of the right solu - tion of a problem can always be found by the masses ; but I feel strongly that the problem itself , as felt by them , and the ideal that they want to see realized , is a safer guide for our conduct than the ideal of the intellectual group that stands under the ban of an historical tradition that dulls their feeling for the needs of the day .

		One word more , in regard to what might be a fatal misunderstanding of my mean - ing .

		If I decry unthinking obedience to the ideals of our forefathers , I am far from believing that it will ever be possible , or that it will even be desirable , to cast away the past and to begin anew on a purely intellectual basis .

		Those who think that this can be accomplished do not , I be - lieve , understand human nature aright .

		Our very wishes for changes are based on criticism of the past , and would take an - other direction if the conditions under which we live were of a different nature .

		We are building up our new ideals by utilizing the work of our ancestors , even where we condemn it , and so it will be in the future .

		Whatever our generation may achieve will attain in course of time that venerable aspect that will lay in chains the minds of the great mass of our successors , and it will re ` quire new efforts to free a future generation of the shackles that we are forging .

		When we once recognize this process , we must see that it is our task not only to free ourselves of traditional preju - dice , but also to search in the heritage of the past for what is useful and right , and to endeavor to free the mind of future generations so that they may not cling to our mistakes , but may be ready to correct them .

		Renewal ... And so , I am alone again ?

		But I shall run unto a barren place , and there Shall wait , and call , and hearken till there come Once more to me the trooping winds of dawn ; And I shall give them drunken shout for shout , And we shall laugh , and laugh ... old friends ... old friends .

		... Alone , you say ?

		But I shall sit upon my hilltop and be still , And wait , and gaze , until the riders of the east Come pricking through the paling dusk and lift Their flaming spears above the farthest hill ; While with a rush of tearing cloud , behold Ruddy and warm with labor , comes the sun The sun , my Brother ; greet him well , old world .

		One says I am alone ... They do not know , they have not seen or heard ; For when the dark comes I shall go again To that remembered pasture by the lake , There watch until a ripple whispering wakes And softly as of old I see her come Across the lake in white robes treading , lo The moon , my Sister , to our rendezvous .

		And we shall share the gossip of the stars , And tell old tales , and rest , and be content .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 149 New Paths As if to greet with a gesture of defiance the end of the fourth year of armed vio - lence there has just appeared in
London	LOCATION	a new annual of the arts under the title of `` New Paths , '' edited by
C. W. Beaumont	PERSON	and
M. T. H. Sadler	PERSON	, and published by the former at 75
Charing Cross Road	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book comes to me in
France	LOCATION	, where a tem - porary respite from the line gives me a little leisure and tranquillity for reading .

		Perhaps in the strange intellectual isolation of active service one appreciates any book more now than at other times , just as to a man of letters in prison the mere act of writing becomes something almost sacred .

		Anyhow it has been a great pleasure to turn over the leaves of this latest effort of `` les jeunes '' of
England	LOCATION	.

		For after all it is the work of `` les jeunes '' which matters , and it is pleasant to speculate as to who among the twenty young people of promise today will be the master of tomorrow .

		The object of `` New Paths '' is to give the educated public which takes an inter - est in these things an idea of the develop - ment of the arts in
England	LOCATION	during the four years of war .

		And to reach this end the editors have collected work of different , sometimes hostile , tendencies , from well-known and slightly known and unknown artists but work which has a certain cohesion , a definite trend , and at least an attempt at originality .

		You will find Mr. de la Mare and Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	, whose work is already becoming of international import , side by side with quite new young men whose names are unfamiliar .

		If such a book lacks the dogmatic fervor of `` Blast , '' it has the merit of being infinitely more comprehensible and more pleasingly mod - est in its claims .

		So here we have an anthology of new verse , new prose , and new pictures not the `` newest scream '' in Cubism but a clear if sedate indication that `` les jeunes '' are surely breaking with the ways of their for - bears .

		They are cremating the nineties with the same glee with which the nineties buried the romantics .

		Sic semper and they also shall be dispossessed by their nephews .

		Verse comes first in `` New Paths , '' which , as Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	once remarked , seems the only right and proper and French proceeding .

		Here we have roughly three main groups : the Georgians , the Imagists , and the young university folk .

		Mr.
Bick	PERSON	- ley in a just and very cautious estimate of modern English verse remarks that the outstanding feature of the new generation is its sincerity .

		That is true .

		The poets today are as hostile to the delicate manner - isms of the
last two decades	DATE	as they are to the `` grand style '' of the previous genera - tions .

		Instead of the heavy rhetoric of the Victorians and the languid posing of their successors we have here direct , simple expression of the experience lived , the thing seen , the passion felt .

		The defect of this attitude is of course its natural ego - tism ; but when these young men advance beyond that first delightful discovery of self to the discovery of the rest of the world , who can deny that they will pro- duce work as worthy as their ancestors ' ?

		I must excuse myself from any quota - tion and from any comparison of merits , yet I can not refrain from mentioning the `` Siren Island '' of Mr.
J. W. Harvey	PERSON	, a name which is new to me -LRB- pardonably , since I have read practically nothing for more than two years now -RRB- .

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	has a sense of mystery , the love of beauty , and some `` verbal imagination . ''

		I think he may write perhaps has already writ - ten fine poetry .

		Since the work of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	is represented , one regrets the absence of three other Americans who dwell in the tents of Shem : `` H. D. , '' Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, and Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	.

		Perhaps they were too proud to play .

		Anyhow , with these regrettable exceptions , `` New Paths '' gives a fairly representative collection of the work of the poets still in their twenties .

		Coming to the prose , one notes Mr.
Guedalla	PERSON	's parodies of older prose writers and Mr.
Sadler	PERSON	's long note on modern fiction , with a pretty complete bibliography of recent novels where the desire to create a work of art is paramount to the desire to create royalties .

		Among many interesting books he mentions the astonishingly fine work of
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	-LRB- now undergoing penance for the crime of lese-pudeur brit - annique -RSB- , the very original work of Dor - 150 THE DIAL othy
Richardson	PERSON	, the vivid and tortured prose of
James Joyce	PERSON	, and the suave , de - lightful cynicism of
Norman Douglas	PERSON	's `` South Wind . ''

		I find only one con - siderable omission the `` Tarr '' of Mr.
Wyndham Lewis	PERSON	.

		Mr.
A. J. Fletcher	PERSON	contributes a most interesting , if slightly inhuman , article on the tendencies in present-day English art .

		He analyzes clearly and with great knowledge the influences which have acted upon the most talented of the younger painters and sculptors , and his remarks are illustrated by photographs and reproduc - tions from artists mentioned . '

		Epstein and
Augustus John	PERSON	are there of course , and the unfortunate Gaudier-Brzeska , killed in
September , 1915	DATE	during the fierce house to house fighting at
Neuville St. Vaast	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are reproductions also of the work of Mr.
Nevinson	PERSON	, Mr.
Gertler	PERSON	, and the two
Nash	PERSON	brothers , as well as of the two women painters
Nina Hamnett	PERSON	and
Anne Rice	PERSON	.

		In a collection so manifestly cath - olic one misses the work of the Vorticists at least worthy of record and one feels Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has been a little tranchant with the
Camden Hill	ORGANIZATION	and
Omega	ORGANIZATION	Work - shop groups .

		Ar | d why is the name of
T. E. Hulme	PERSON	omitted from the dedication to the `` gal - lant gentlemen who have given their lives for their country ? ''

		Hulme had consider - able influence at one time among the young men and was especially a friend of Gaudier-Brzeska and Epstein .

		He was killed in action last year beside his battery .

		If I seem to have dwelt more on the omissions than the contents of `` New Paths , '' it is simply that I want to com - plete by these few notes the very wide and almost complete information contained in the new annual .

		I can not imagine a better medium whereby an American can get in touch with the latest features of English art .

		There were bound to be a few omis - sions , but on the whole this is undoubtedly the best resume which has appeared since the war .

		So far as I know there is no American edition , but it is worth the while of those individuals who like to know what is doing in the arts to take the trouble to import copies .

		RICHARD
ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		The New Education in
India	LOCATION	It is exceedingly difficult for our West - ern friends to understand what really lies at the bottom of the present agitated con - dition of
India	LOCATION	.

		It is not so much political discontent as an entire spiritual rebirth .

		The outward unrest , comprising the revo - lutionary plots and riots , the nihilistic assassinations , the breaking of the crystal - lized caste system , the furor of the feminist movement , the militancy of strikes and boycotts , and the silent turmoil of the Hindu-Mohammedan rapprochement all is but the outward symbol of the renais - sance , the troubled surface of an inner joy at the new birth .

		And it can not be denied that this rebirth has long been overdue .

		Out of every five men in the world one is a Hindu ; in other words , the popula - tion of
India	LOCATION	is about as large as the combined population of
North America	LOCATION	,
South America	LOCATION	, and
Africa	LOCATION	.

		And in
India	LOCATION	, in the
second decade of the twentieth century	DATE	, only ten men out of a hundred , and only one woman out of a hundred and fifty , can read and write .

		About eighty per cent , of the total population of the country live in villages , and there are no schools in four villages out of five .

		As a result four fifths of the children of school age are growing up in ignorance and illit - eracy , without any schooling whatever .

		With the exception of a few progressive Indian principalities , there is no free and compulsory system of primary education .

		About eighty-five per cent , of the total population of
India	LOCATION	is agricultural , but there is not even one agricultural school or college accessible to the farmers of the land .

		The first agricultural college in In - dia was opened only a few years ago , and that by the high-minded generosity of an American man of wealth : Mr.
Henry Phipps	PERSON	gave
$ 150,000	MONEY	to the British - Indian government for this purpose .

		The
Phipps College	ORGANIZATION	will remain a monument of friendship between
America	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	.

		The woeful illiteracy of
India	LOCATION	is re - sponsible for many of her chronic ills , as is the case with
China	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Yet illit - eracy , if we are to judge from recent ex -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 151 periences , is not difficult to destroy .

		In about forty years
America	LOCATION	has educated over half of her newly freed negro slaves ; in about twenty years
America	LOCATION	has flooded the
Philippines	LOCATION	with public schools and school teachers .

		In less than forty years
Japan	LOCATION	has educated all but five per cent , of her people .

		What
Japan	LOCATION	has been able to accomplish
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	can certainly do only ten times over .

		Yet while
Japan	LOCATION	can today enter into an offensive or defensive alliance with any of the great powers , in
India	LOCATION	a Hindu is not even thought fit to have arms in his home for self-protection .

		Tigers and cobras may kill human beings , as they do by the thou - sands , but the people can not be trusted with arms .

		`` Legal ineligibility , '' writes the `` New Statesman '' of
London	LOCATION	, `` to bear arms in
India	LOCATION	carries with it such a sense of humiliation , helplessness , and self-con - demnation that before it all other bless - ings dwindle into insignificance . ''

		At the middle of the last century
Japan	LOCATION	was looked down upon by her neighbors and
India	LOCATION	was thought the most progressive of all Asiatic countries .

		But how vast is the disparity between
Japan	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	today !

		The smarting sense of humiliation at the backwardness of
India	LOCATION	's international status is responsible for the universal cry in
India	LOCATION	for a sound system of education .

		Education is not an innovation in
India	LOCATION	from the philanthropically `` civilizing '' countries of the
West	LOCATION	.

		It is true that In - dia today is backward , and the children nations of the West talk glibly of `` civiliz - ing ''
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	.

		But the merest acquaintance with ancient history would convince anyone that there was a time in
India	LOCATION	's history when special ambassadors , scholars , and philosophers from
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	were wont to come to
India	LOCATION	for exchange of courtesies and for study .

		From the earliest days of Aryan settlement in
India	LOCATION	, say about 4,000 < or 5,000 B.C. , there have been educa - tional institutions that gradually developed out of the growing rites and rituals of a people that migrated from a bleak and cold country into the warm and congenial valleys of the Indus and the
Ganges	LOCATION	.

		In the
Upanishads	LOCATION	, compiled about 2,000 B.C. , we find references to educational institutions that prescribed the study of `` the four Vedas , chronicles , cosmogonies , grammar , ancestral worship , arithmetic , science of portents , division of time , logic , ethics , etymology , pronunciation , prosody , demonology , military science , astronomy , medicine , science of serpents and spirits . ''

		Elphinstone in his `` History of
India	LOCATION	'' and
Hunter	PERSON	in his `` Indian Empire '' most un - reservedly acknowledge the debt of human civilization to the Hindu 's contribution towards the very birth of many such sciences as arithmetic , algebra , geometry and astronomy , grammar , medicine , music , and metaphysics .

		We have in
India	LOCATION	today ruins of ancient universities where as high as ten thousand students studied arts and sciences , philosophy , law , and literature , entirely without payment of tuition ; and in many instances these students were even fed and clothed at the expense of the state .

		But no nation and no race can thrive in modern times by simply basking in the sun - shine of its past glories .

		Neither can the bewildering labyrinth of the complexities of modern civilization be mastered except by scientific education .

		Certainly it can not be mastered by overemphasizing meta - physical speculation on the Nirvanic bliss of the next world , or by memorizing choice passages from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Shelley	LOCATION	, Rus - kin , or
Bentham	PERSON	.

		In recent years
India	LOCATION	has had enough of `` bookful '' education .

		What she needs most today is the mating of her innate spiritual ideals of education with the exact scientific knowledge of the
West	LOCATION	.

		This union is essential for
India	LOCATION	if she is to avoid some of the ugliness and brutali - ties of the cold and callous industrialism of the
West	LOCATION	.

		She wants to keep what was beautiful and gracious in the old order .

		Fortunately she is no longer indifferent to her needs .

		Different educational insti - tutions are being established all over In - dia .

		The
Arya Somaj	PERSON	of the
Punjab	LOCATION	is .

		rendering a splendid service toward this through its schools and colleges , especially through its unique academy , the Guruku of
Haridwar	LOCATION	.

		Here , as in the case of Sir
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	's model school at
Bolpur	LOCATION	,
Brahmacharya	PERSON	and the classical culture of ancient
India	LOCATION	are united with the studies of a modern Western technology .

		The Hindu university of
Benares	LOCATION	, which has recently been opened under the direct and lavish patronage of most of the prom - inent Hindu rajas and maharajas , has had millions donated to it by the wealthy 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
September	DATE	5 potentates of
India	LOCATION	, who wish to make this university well worthy of the country in which it is located .

		The main objects of the university are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- to promote the study of Hindu shastras -LRB- scriptures -RRB- and of Sanskrit literature generally , as a means of preserving and popularizing the best thought and culture of ancient civilization ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to promote learning and research gen - erally in the arts and sciences ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- to ad - vance and diffuse such scientific and tech - nical and professional knowledge , com - bined with the necessary practical training , as is best calculated to promote indigenous industries and develop the material re - sources of the country ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- to promote character by making religion and ethics an integral part of education .

		His Highness the Gaekwar of
Baroda	LOCATION	, the pioneer in
India	LOCATION	of many reform move - ments , founded his famous Kala-Bhavan -LRB- the
Institute of Arts and Sciences	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- about twenty-eight years ago .

		It teaches engi - neering of all kinds , fine arts , industrial arts , and commerce .

		Quite unlike the cus - tom prevalent in
British India	LOCATION	, the vernac - ular of the province , and not English , is the medium of instruction .

		Immediately after the notorious partition of
Bengal	LOCATION	in
1905	DATE	the
National Council of Education	ORGANIZATION	was started in
Calcutta	LOCATION	.

		It has a College in
Calcutta	LOCATION	and schools in different dis - tricts of
Bengal	LOCATION	.

		Some of the teachers and the students of the
National College	ORGANIZATION	are doing sound research work in
India	LOCATION	's cultural life .

		Soon after the establishment of the
National Council the Bengal Tech	ORGANIZATION	- nical Institute was opened by the munificent gifts of Mr.
T. Palit	PERSON	.

		Also in
Bombay	LOCATION	, the center of the industrial activities of
India	LOCATION	, Mr.
Jamsetji Nusservanji	PERSON	Tata spared no pains and no money to advance the cause of scientific and industrial edu - cation .

		Though some of the project was delayed by official red tape , his example remains to inspire to further effort .

		And already at least a dozen other Parsees have made most royal gifts for the promo - tion of learning in
India	LOCATION	.

		But perhaps the most ambitious and consequential educa - tional institution was started in
1904	DATE	by Mr.
Jogendra Chandra Ghose	PERSON	, a leading lawyer of the
Calcutta High Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was the famous
Scientific and Industrial Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its principal objects are to send students to
Europe	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	for scientific and industrial educa - tion , and then to help these students , on their return home , to start model farms and factories for the manufacture of boots and shoes , buttons , pins and needles , um - brellas , papers and porcelains , silk and cotton fabrics all with the help of mod - ern machinery .

		Hundreds of students have been educated by this association , mostly in
America	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, and these young men are now the recognized leaders in the tremendous industrial revolution that is going on in mystic
India	LOCATION	.

		When the froth and foam of present political propaganda will have had a chance to die a natural death , the names of the Gaekwar of
Baroda	LOCATION	, Mr.
Tata	PERSON	, and Mr.
Ghose	PERSON	will stand out prominently among those of the major constructive workers of modern
India	LOCATION	.

		Nor is
India	LOCATION	today unmindful of the grave problem of female education .

		The pernicious system of early marriage cuts short the education of the girls who have both the means and the inclination for higher education .

		The men of
India	LOCATION	have begun to feel the peril of the lack of fe - male education in the country .

		Further - more the educated women of all sects and creeds are taking things pretty much into their own hands .

		They quite understand - ably resent any spirit of patronage on the part of the men .

		They have organized the
All-India Woman 's Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its prin - cipal aim is to educate the women of
India	LOCATION	.

		By sheer force of its organizing impetus aided by the cooperation of the women at large the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is dotting the country with schools for the education of women from Kashmere to
Cape Comorin	LOCATION	, the purdah women not excepted .

		They are taught weaving and knitting , sewing and embroidery , domestic science and hygiene , arts and crafts .

		Dr.
Karve	PERSON	's idea of a
Woman 's University	ORGANIZATION	at
Poona	ORGANIZATION	has re - ceived generous financial support from all quarters of the country .

		Women 's study clubs are being formed , mostly for the study of newspapers and magazines .

		Translations of the idealistic parts of President
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's speeches are being memorized by even the purdah women of the remotest villages of
India	LOCATION	.

		The new man and the new woman of new
India	LOCATION	do not deem any sacrifice too great to help the cause of education .

		When
1918	DATE	-RSB-
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, 153 we see a high caste Brahmin boy of wealthy parents work for ten or twelve hours a day in a tannery or in a soap factory in
New York	LOCATION	or
California	LOCATION	, then we can safely rest assured that
India	LOCATION	is changed indeed .

		And again , when we see a Hindu beggar give away his ragged coat , a pros - titute give away all her amassed fortune , a man mortgage his property , a woman sell her jewels all to help the cause of pop - ular education in
India	LOCATION	then none need question
India	LOCATION	's sincerity , none despair of
India	LOCATION	's future .

		Instructors When you entered the classroom a dry wind followed you , Crackling .

		It seared my soul three hours a week For a year .

		Yet I should have learned great things from you , Who are so prim , so platitudinous , so scholarly That one of these days you will be The Head of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		n .

		You ruled us with a rod , but not of iron .

		Your rod was long and flexible and had a hook That neatly flicked away pieces of self-conceit Now here , now there , So that we left the classroom raw And respectful .

		in .

		You sent us leaping at each other 's minds Intelligently , and from the tangle of our argument As one who watches kittens with a skein Now and again you rescued the Main Point , With pensive pleasure .

		You wore your education without grace As the Suddenly Rich Man wears his dress suit Not too ill at ease in it to be Clumsily pleasant to the less successful , And yet afraid That without patronage they may begin To feel themselves his equals .

		SUSANNE
HOWE	PERSON	.

		Our
Dublin	LOCATION	Letter To the outside world , whose impressions of
Ireland	LOCATION	are based upon inspired and not entirely disinterested newspaper paragraphs , it may seem strange that we have time for literature amidst the pressing and exciting exigencies of `` German plots , '' anti-conscription campaigns , and the in - numerable crimes thrust upon the patriotic by the ubiquitous Defense of the Realm Act .

		Yet the fact is that never since the insurrection of Easter ,
1916	DATE	have the printing presses in
Ireland	LOCATION	been so busy , and this in spite of the amazing difficulties of book production , the familiar ob - stacles of increased cost being complicated in this country by the existence of a military Press Cen - sorship which is more severe than the correspond - ing civilian establishment in
England	LOCATION	.

		Possibly the more cynical reading public has reason to be thankful for this , since editors and publishers have adopted the practice of submitting work in manuscript to the Censor , so that he may give his imprimatur before the expense of setting is incurred , with the result that an interesting library of banned or mutilated works awaits the return of happier days for publication .

		A re - markable case of this kind occurred in the
spring	DATE	, when two different publishers decided to issue the collected writings of the Irish politician and economist
James Fintan Lalor	PERSON	, one of the leading figures of the Fenian movement of
1848	DATE	.

		With that divine impartiality upon which
Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	congratulated the law , the Censor pro- hibited the publication of these rival editions of an author who died nearly seventy years ago !

		This practice of literary
Malthusianism	PERSON	has not visibly diminished the output of Irish books , although it has certainly added to the adventure of collecting rare Irish editions , as many banned works enjoy a limited and surreptitious sale , which only too frequently confers lustre on books which would pass unnoticed if exposed to the strong light of the day .

		The rise of
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	has been accomplished , like all previous move - ments of revolt in
Ireland	LOCATION	, by a flood of political literature whose patriotism is its chief merit .

		But the most notable work of pure literature published this year was the second volume of
Maunsel	ORGANIZATION	's fine edition of the `` Collected Works '' of
Padraic H. Pearse	PERSON	-LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Having given us the plays , poems , and stories in the first vol - ume , they have added a volume containing `` Songs of the Irish Rebels '' and `` Specimens from an Irish Anthology , '' which will be remembered by read - ers of the `` Irish Review . ''

		The arrangement whereby the original Irish text and the English translation appear side by side makes this a more satisfactory book than its predecessor , from which all texts were omitted , so that it was a composite work , partly the English of
Pearse	PERSON	and partly the English of Mr.
Joseph Campbell	PERSON	.


Padraic Pearse	PERSON	held strong views as to the necessity of creating a modern Irish literature in the Irish language , and he deliberately cut himself off from the readier popularity of English .

		It would therefore have been more fitting to give the orig - inal text in
Irish	LOCATION	, as
Pearse	PERSON	wrote it , in every case accompanied by a parallel translation .

		This plan would have made the second volume stouter and more in proportion to the first , for it might have contained the poems included in that first volume .

		Thus we might have had one book of prose and one of verse , the former containing plays and stories , the latter poems , original and translated .

		However , the edition is a beautiful one and worthy of a place beside the now famous edition of Synge , whose rarity it may equal , since the first editions of Volume I were only procur - able at an increased price a few weeks after pub - lication .

		It is interesting to compare
Pearse	PERSON	's versions of the sixteenth and seventeenth century Gaelic poets in `` Songs of the Irish Rebels '' with the analogous efforts of Mr.
James Stephens	PERSON	in his `` Reincarnations '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Pearse of course was more concerned to give a faithful rendering of those early Irish hymns of hate , whereas
Stephens	PERSON	has simply found inspiration in the main stream of the national poetic tradition .

		How beautifully his mood coincides with that of his literary ancestors has been noticed by all who have welcomed this wonderful sheaf of verse the finest the author has given us since he first burst gaily and riotously upon us with his `` In - surrections . ''

		Whenever the Anglo-Irish poets
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE 155 have turned to the springs of national tradition they have returned with rich booty , and since Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	has absorbed himself in Gaelic from the time of his return from
Paris	LOCATION
two years ago	DATE	, we look upon `` Reincarnations '' as but a specimen of the treasure-trove which he will share with us in the near future .

		Meanwhile
Dublin	LOCATION	has greeted the arrival of a young poet , still in his teens , Mr.
Austin Clarke	PERSON	, whose `` Vengeance of Fionn '' -LRB-
Maunsel	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been the occasion of a literary battle between admirers and critics .

		`` JE '' has not been afraid to assert that there is finer poetry in this little book than in anything written by
Yeats	PERSON	at that age , and the prophets assert that `` The Vengeance of Fionn '' will one day be regarded with the same interest as `` The Wanderings of Oisin . ''

		Mr.
Joseph Campbell	PERSON	, voicing the opposition , complained of the exag - gerations , the overladen imagery , and even the erroneous botany of the young poet ; and for some weeks a controversy raged in the columns of ``
New Ireland	LOCATION	, '' the unexportable literary weekly , which miraculously survives the acts of God , the Censor , and the
King	ORGANIZATION	's enemies .

		As is usual in such cases , the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes of appreciation and depreciation , and Mr.
Austin Clarke	PERSON	must be content to know that much is expected of him .

		When he first emerged it was to come and wait shyly at my door that he might intercept me with a plea to read his epic of
Grania	LOCATION	, the heroine so strangely neglected by the poets , as I once pointed out , in favor of her rival in legend ,
Deirdre	PERSON	.

		I read his manuscript with great pleasure , but was skeptical of its prospects of securing attention in these troubled times .

		The author scorned my proposal that he should bring out a book of lyrics instead ; so I sent him to '' , , '' whose un - failing kindness and enthusiasm would , I knew , be helpful .

		`` JE '' acted as I had foreseen , but the public did not with the happy result that Mr.
Austin Clarke	PERSON	found himself the most talked of event of the publishing season .

		Two unusual and totally dissimilar novels re - main to be mentioned : `` The Valley of the Squinting Windows '' -LRB-
Maunsel	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by a new writer , Mr.
Brinsley MacNamara	PERSON	, and `` Chil - dren of Earth , '' by Mr.
Darrell Figgis	PERSON	, who is now in
England	LOCATION	for the second time with a group of
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	deportees .

		This is the first work of fiction which Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	has published since he gave up his work in
London	LOCATION	and became a `` re - turned native , '' although he has been extremely active in swelling the volume of pamphleteering literature already referred to .

		The defects of Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	's style are familiar and almost notori - ous ; he never uses one word where two can be employed , and his flair for precious and unusual locutions is extraordinary .

		Concealed between vast layers of his characteristic verbiage there is in `` Children of Earth '' a fine story well told , and a really striking picture of Irish life in the remote West , outside the radius of urban Anglicization .

		Paradoxically , this Sinn `
Feiner	PERSON	writes uncon - sciously of politics , and as his verbose attempts at `` symphonic word-music '' are interpolated at almost regular intervals , it is possible to read his riovel without floundering into these morasses of words , of which the most hideous example is in the opening chapter , with such inventions as a `` gesture of distance '' and `` gesture of gauntness . ''

		If the author would prune his novels of these affectations as thoroughly as he has pruned his political and historical writings , he would not dismay so many who truly appreciate the fine quality of his work .

		Mr.
Brinsley MacNamara	PERSON	is a novelist of a very different caliber , but he has set forth in `` The Valley of the Squinting Windows '' a chron - icle of malice , cruelty , and petty meanness as un - compromising in its showing up of a rural com - munity as Mr.
James Joyce	PERSON	was in his exposition of
Dublin	LOCATION	in `` A Portrait of the Artist '' and `` Dubliners . ''

		Mr.
MacNamara	PERSON	however has had the satisfaction of exciting his victims to retalia - tion .

		The community in the
County Westmeath	LOCATION	described in the book has been in a state of effervescent rage ever since its appearance , and the author has been stoned by the infuriated vil - lagers , who have made the house of his family unbearable and are now threatening the pub - lishers with an action for libel .

		Yet in the novel Mr.
MacNamara	PERSON	does not even mention the name of the place where his scenes are cast , and the reading public generally is quite unaware of the identity of the persons and events described .

		It is as if the inhabitants of
Spoon River	LOCATION	were to threaten Mr.
Edgar Lee	PERSON	Masters for having slandered them before the eyes of the world !

		Apparently our village
Hampdens	PERSON	and Miltons are neither as mute nor as inglorious as Gray imagined .

		It is certainly disconcerting , after the classical experiments in this direction of
Synge	LOCATION	,
Moore	PERSON	, and
James Joyce	PERSON	, to be expected to sympathize with the woes of the `` Valley of the Squinting Windows . ''

		A new terror has been added to the precarious profession of free speech .

		By
Arthur D. How	PERSON	-
den Smith	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doran ;
$ l.SO	MONEY	.

		All biographies are suspect .

		Much more so when the subject is still alive ; and above all when he is so much alive as to be entrusted with the most momentous of present-day tasks the de - termination of the bases of a lasting peace .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	will smile forgivingly if we take with a grain of skepticism the first adjective in his title ; and
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	, being a philosopher , will not balk at our suspicion that he is not so utterly and incorrigibly virtuous a person as his biographer would have us suppose him to be .

		Indeed we are inclined to the belief that the real
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	would have preferred to have some of his faults and misses catalogued along with his successes , if only as spice to the pudding ; and that in per - mitting himself to be displaced by an abstract perfection -LRB- strangely at home among diplomats -RRB- he has merely indulged the theories of his
Boswell	PERSON	on the art and science of political biography .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	aims , initially , to dispel the aura of mystery that has gathered about the Colonel 's head ; and so far as this mystery connoted some degree of popular objection to a `` third house '' in the government , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's purpose has meaning and result .

		Of course every president has had a
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	, but has usually made more of an effort to conceal him ; President Wil - son seems so confident of his own mental re - sources as to dare admit to all the country that these resources , unaided , are inadequate to the vast and varied tasks that have swept down upon him since his first inauguration .

		Despite our pro- vincial distrust of the trained administrator , we are being forced by fact to welcome the expert .

		and the adviser into our governmental hierarchy ; and
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	is but one of many men whom the President has had the splendid sense to call into his supposedly monarchical councils .

		Mystery has moved about
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	because , like
Von Moltke	PERSON	, he can be silent in seven languages , and is gifted with the capacity for infinite listening : adage has it that if a man will but hold his tongue he will not long lack reputation for wis - dom .

		In
America	LOCATION	-LRB- because
America	LOCATION	is still in its cultural swaddling clothes -RRB- political leaders were , until lately , almost always men of many words and loud ; to have a president who keeps quiet -LRB- except for certain occasions that conscript him into oratory -RRB- and works vacationless , is queer enough ; but to have him select as his adviser a man whose noiselessness makes even the silence of his chief seem loquacious , is intolerably unusual , and can be borne by the mind only under the cate - gory of mystery .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	takes us rapidly through
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	's career as Democratic pilot of
Texas	LOCATION	pol - itics , and soon brings us to the point at which the Colonel , having become a national power in the counsels of the party , met Governor
Wilson	PERSON	and discovered in him unsuspected presidential values .

		`` You know , '' said
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	on this point , `` in politics you can almost never elect the best man he has done something , said something , or has something about him , which prevents his suc - cess .

		You have to take the next best man , or perhaps the next to the next best man .

		But here was the best man available , the ideal man .

		And he seemed to have a good chance of success . ''

		The liking was mutual : the Governor , who had not been so long in politics as to have lost all relish for intellectual feasting , enjoyed the quiet culture of the Texan , and put the essence of his admira - tion with characteristic finish in a talk with some newspaper men .

		``
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	, '' he said , `` can hold a subject away from him , and examine it and analyze it , as if he had nothing to do with it , better than any man I ever knew . ''

		This is the heart of the matter .

		Some interesting passages follow : Mr.
Smith	PERSON	tells , for example , how the President sent
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	to
Europe	LOCATION	in
May , 1914	DATE	to attempt to stem the tide that had set in towards war , and how the policy of `` watchful waiting '' in relation to
Mexico	LOCATION	was adopted chiefly because the Presi - dent anticipated the great conflict and wished to be free of lesser entanglements in case
America	LOCATION	should become involved .

		In
February , 1915	DATE
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	again visited
Europe	LOCATION	, this time in an attempt to bring
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	to some agreement for the limitation of the naval side of the war .

		The Colonel 's passage was taken on the
Lusitania	LOCATION	; and it was on this trip that the stately Cunarder flew the American flag as she passed through British waters flew it , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	presumes , as a justifiable device to protect the American envoy from the submarines that were lying off the mouth of the
Mersey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three months later , while
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	was still in
Europe	LOCATION	, the
Lusitania	LOCATION	was sunk ; and this greatest of German psychological blunders had a good deal to do with the frustration of the
Colonel	ORGANIZATION	's mission .

		The mission was to present to the states - men of
Europe	LOCATION	the American notion of `` freedom of the seas . ''

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL .

		157 He meant a literal , unlimited freedom of the seas , which would imply the safety of merchantmen in enemy ports on the declaration of war ; the safety not only of food cargoes , but cargoes of actual contraband ; the uninterrupted progress of the world 's ocean-borne commerce in the midst of the most widely dispersed war ... Accepted by the belligerent nations , it would have the immediate result of confining the war to a struggle between fleets and armies and exempting from harm non-combatants and neutral nations , while the economic structure of civilization would survive almost unimpaired .

		`` But for what would navies be used then ? ''

		de - manded the Germans .

		`` For defense against invasion , '' returned
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- Page 188 . -RSB-

		The English rejected the plan because it meant the abandonment of the blockade of
Germany	LOCATION	, and saw little force in
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	's conten - tion that it also meant the protection of
England	LOCATION	from the submarine threat and the freedom of
England	LOCATION	to supply men and munitions unimpeded to the army in
France	LOCATION	.

		One other passage deserves quotation a pas - sage not directly quoted from
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	, but given as his view .

		The President `` will not suf - fer the effects of militarism to halt or overthrow the splendid development of liberalism which has attended his administration '' -LRB- page 242 -RRB- .

		Here is the formulation of the hope of many .

		Every schoolboy knows that there are powerful forces in the country -LRB- or , should we rather say , in this city of
New York	LOCATION	? -RRB-

		which are resolved and con - fident that the war will issue in a militaristic system fastened on the American people , and rivaling in its thoroughness and brutality all the achievements of the Junkers .

		The President has condemned our orgies of `` patriotic '' lynching , he has pronounced himself open to all honest criti - cism , and he has interfered again * and again -LRB- in
Arizona	LOCATION	, in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and in
California	LOCATION	-RRB- to redress the evils of war-time reaction ; but sometimes one wonders if these occasional efforts will suffice .

		One wonders , for example , if the President is entirely in sympathy with the severity with which Mrs.
Stokes	PERSON	has been punished ; surely the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	is sufficiently confident of its own integrity and is sufficiently supported by a unified and resolute people , to warrant it in call - ing a halt on the almost czaristic severity of some of the lower federal courts .

		These are matters which deserve more attention from the President , hard worked though he is .

		It is his privilege , and in large measure his obligation , to set the moral tone of the country in this regard ; let him say the good word and give it point with decisive action , and all
America	LOCATION	will follow him and be glad ' WILL DURANT .

		How to Create the Scientific Spirit A SHORT HISTORY OF SCIENCE .

		By
W. T. Sedgwick	PERSON	and
H. W. Tyler	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Historians of science may conceive their task in a variety of ways .

		Some will approach it as annalists bent first of all on registering names , dates , and events .

		Another group naturally throw the emphasis on the biographical element : they are interested primarily in the psychology of the scientific worthy and , like Duhem and
Ost	PERSON	- wald , aspire to a satisfactory classification of in - tellects .

		Still `` others unfold the method underly - ing all scientific activity and illustrate the gradu - al extension of a rigorous logical technique from one field of inquiry to another , from physics to chemistry and biology , and even to anthropology and sociology .

		Again , it is possible to study sci - ence as the product of cooperative labor by social units encompassed by and overlapping other social units .

		Finally , a great historian would unite in his person the qualities of reporter , psychologist , logician , and sociologist and rise to the dignity of a true philosopher of science .

		Professors
Sedgwick	PERSON	and Tyler belong emphat - ically to the first category .

		The logical founda - tions of science , the personalities of the outstand - ing figures , the functions of science in modern culture are not wholly ignored by them , but these things hardly loom up as of more than subordi - nate significance .

		The authors are primarily re - corders of facts , and in fairness their product should be judged from this angle .

		They have certainly brought together an imposing array of worthwhile information within a relatively small compass .

		The history of science is so novel a sub - ject of interest that so serious and painstaking an essay to popularize its data must be hailed with appreciation .

		Nevertheless , even in the present groping stage , doubts arise as to the method - of procedure and , in the interest of other attempts in the same direction , deficiencies should not be ig - nored .

		First of .

		all , then , a curious disproportionate - ness mars the value of the work .

		Mathematics , astronomy , and physics are dealt with in so liberal a manner as to crowd out almost everything else .

		Even chemistry hardly receives a due share of space , and biology suffers distinctly scurvy treat - ment .

		There is no attempt to show precisely what Darwinism meant in the development of evolutionary theory , while
Weismann	PERSON	,
Mendel	PERSON	, and De Vries are barely mentioned .

		Psychology , Cinderella-like , is passed over in silence Gal - ton 's study of individual variability ,
Fechner	ORGANIZATION	's 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 5	DATE	application of mathematical methods , the estab - lishment of laboratories by
Wundt	PERSON	and his American followers , have apparently failed to impress the authors as significant phenomena .

		This one-sidedness , however , is merely the most glaring of a series of rather unfortunate errors of judgment .

		Throughout the volume there are sprinkled copious quotations from a host of authors .

		Some of these are remarkably illumi - nating - 1 for example , the sentence from White - head -LRB- page 41 -RRB- as to the abstruseness of long division for the ancient Greek mathematicians .

		But often Professors
Sedgwick	PERSON	and
Tyler	PERSON	are less fortunate in their selections .

		Thus it is far from clear why the reader should be bored with several pages of historical commonplaces about the older civilizations of
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Worse still , statements are quoted without comment even when they are questionable or even positively false .

		The hoary legend of the Phoenician dis - covery of glass -LRB- page 14 -RRB- should no longer be cited without at least a corrective footnote .

		Simi - larly ,
Kelvin	PERSON	's overemphatic insistence on the reality of the ether -LRB- page 356 -RRB- requires some suggestion that divergent views have been held by eminent savants .

		Again , sometimes there is little or no attempt to harmonize quotation and text so as to convey a definite conviction .

		The atomic theory is assuredly of such importance that the reader is entitled to know the authors ' point of view ; but they content themselves with quoting
Kelvin	PERSON	pro and
Dumas	PERSON	contra , throwing in a sentence by way of summarizing the type of criticism urged against the theory -LRB- page 362 -RRB- .

		These strictures are directed against the book as a compendium of facts .

		But a more funda - mental query arises .

		To what extent is such an assemblage of data a genuine desideratum at present ?

		To be sure , every cultivated man should know something about the peculiarly Greek con - tributions to pre-Hellenic knowledge and he should connect definite achievements with the hallowed names of
Kepler	PERSON	,
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Newton	LOCATION	,
Darwin	PERSON	, and
Helmholtz	PERSON	.

		But his memory need not be burdened with the names of Antiphon and Menaechmus or of a host of estimable but not epoch-making modern investigators .

		All the salient facts can be condensed into a terse sum - mary of possibly fifty say , at most , a hundred pages .

		Literature supplies a parallel example .

		What cultivated layman cares to hear about
Gleim	PERSON	and
Opitz	PERSON	,
Scarron	PERSON	and
Boileau	PERSON	,
Shen	PERSON	- stone and Akenside ?

		But just as the student of literature must combine some conception of the world 's giants with an intensive probing of some particular type of literature , so the reader of the history of science should become saturated with the spirit of science , imbibing the atmos - phere that invests a particular set of problems .

		Let not his vision be blurred by an uncoordinated wealth - of detail .

		A hundred pages outlining the greatest achievements in all lines of research , followed by thrice that space devoted exclusively to the progress of either dynamics from
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	to
Newton	LOCATION	, or of biology from
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	to Dar - win , or of anthropology from
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	to
Boas	LOCATION	, will prove more illuminating than the histories of science executed on traditional lines .

		Perhaps the very disproportion in Professors
Sedgwick	PERSON	and
Tyler	PERSON	's volume might aid them in convert - ing it into a history of the type here projected .

		They would merely have to remodel the sec - tions on the exact sciences so as to stress leading principles rather than facts and to rearrange , with some minor modifications , the matter de - voted to other departments of learning .

		But whether they themselves undertake the task or not , they have certainly placed at the disposal of future historians an appreciable storehouse of raw material .

		Half -
Truths About Russia UNCHAINED RUSSIA	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Charles Edward Russell	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		For a journalist , this book is a first-rate per - formance ; for an acknowledged radical and socialist , it is the kind of timorous evasion which forever robs a man of any legitimate right to either of these names .

		After all , Mr.
Russell	PERSON	went to
Russia	LOCATION	as the radical member of the American mission ; he publishes his book several months after the signing of the treaty of
Brest	LOCATION	- Litovsk ; he knows better than most of us can possibly know the turbid stream of lies and stupidities which have so misguided the American public about the Soviet government .

		Is it not his obvious duty at this time to compress his descriptive and impressionistic chapters and to give us as accurate and fearless an interpretation of the facts about
Russia	LOCATION	as he can ?

		If any action we take with respect to
Russia	LOCATION	will very possibly cost the lives of countless of those we hold dear , should it prove mistaken , then is not a high obli - gation laid upon Mr.
Russell	PERSON	to do his best to tell the truth and the whole truth ?

		Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- sell 's first sentence is : To the last syllable of recorded time , mankind is likely to have cause to lament that in the years
1917	DATE	and
1918	DATE	the people ef the
United States	LOCATION	did not under - stand the people of
Russia	LOCATION	and the people of
Russia	LOCATION	did not understand the people of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 159 Well , the important and salient fact about
Russia	LOCATION	has been the Soviet government whether or not it was honest , whether or not it really represented the mass of the Russian people , why it destroyed the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	and signed the shameful peace of Brest-Litovsk , why today it is fighting the Czecho-Slovaks in
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		A correct diagnosis of the quality and purposes of that government , from
November , 1917	DATE	to the present day , has been perhaps the most needed corrective to the distortions of badly informed American public opinion .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	makes no attempt whatsoever to furnish that diagnosis : to be sure , his tone in the chapter called `` The Bolshevic '' has neither the fanatical bitterness of the emigre nor the palpable special pleading of the expropriated landholder .

		It is , on the contrary , quite amused and amiable .

		For the Bolshevik , as Mr.
Russell	PERSON	describes him , is an `` obsessionist . ''

		`` At least once in every generation the woods have been full of him . ''

		He is a `` moon-struck dreamer , '' and the `` Bolshevics could never have been a great power in
Russia	LOCATION	if the Russian nature had not been peculiarly adapted to a dreamy altruism , gorgeous as the gold of sunset and as difficult to lay hold of . ''

		There is a word or two more about how this gentle gullibility of the
Bol	LOCATION	- sheviks was easily exploited by the Germans for their own purposes and how Prussian militarism `` led the unfortunate Trotskys by the hand through the economic Dreamland to the edge of the cliff and pushed them into the abyss . ''

		All of which , of course , is utter nonsense , just as Mr.
Russell	PERSON	in his heart knows it is utter nonsense .

		If ever a government signed a peace treaty knowing with cold-blooded logic just what that treaty meant , it was the Soviet government at
Brest	LOCATION	-
Litovsk	PERSON	.

		But it suits Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's purposes to represent the Soviet government as composed of kindly but deluded fools and to end the matter there .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	gracefully draws the curtain on `` Unchained
Russia	LOCATION	'' with the tragedy of
Brest	LOCATION	- Litovsk .

		The reader is left to infer what he likes which of course , if he is a casual reader of the newspapers , is that the Bolsheviks , finding that the world did not bend to their folly , be - came so infuriated that they turned to the Ger - mans for protection against the sullen and dis - illusionized but apathetic Russian masses .

		Cer - tainly Mr.
Russell	PERSON	does nothing in his book to correct this all too prevalent fable .

		It is as if
Arthur Ransome	PERSON	had never written his dis - patches ; as if the Manchester `` Guardian , '' the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily News , '' and the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' -LRB- of the old days -RRB- had ceased pub - lication ; as if there were no reliable eye-witnesses and unprejudiced observers to tell us what the Soviet government was really like , what it had accomplished and what it hoped to accomplish .

		Surely it is hypocrisy for Mr.
Russell	PERSON	to tell us rhetorically at the beginning of his book that `` to the last syllable of recorded time , '' and so on , and then do so little to bring about the understanding between us and the people of
Russia	LOCATION	on which the happiness of the world depends .

		He does , to be fair , make a feeble attempt .

		He writes brightly and in good temper .

		In excellent journalistic phrases he conveys the `` feel '' of the Russian peasant 's true democracy .

		Trotzky , he tells us , is sincere , and although he has some doubts about
Lenine	PERSON	, yet he can not quite credit the elaborate documents which are supposed to prove Lenine a German agent .

		There is none of the psychological animus against the Russians as a mass which I always sense in a writer like
E. J. Dillon	PERSON	, and of course there is none of the rhetori - cal idealization of a romanticist like
Stephen Graham	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	could hardly fail to de - tect the stupidity of observers who had never come in contact with any except their own re - spectable , clean-linen class .

		He makes fun of the silly stories of violence and licentiousness which were supposed to sweep over
Russia	LOCATION	on the Czar 's overthrow .

		He does explain the deep instinct in all Russians for cooperative endeavor , as in the organization of the village communities .

		Nor is he wholly lacking in perception of the `` dusky forest '' of the contradictory mind of the Russian ; he understands its curious blend of Oriental fatalism and laziness with
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	intelligence and energy .

		He is never betrayed into an intem - perate attitude towards the Russian people .

		That is why it is so hard to forgive him for leaving us in the lurch .

		A returned banker or a gentleman who has spent all his life amid dip - lomatic intrigue is not expected to be singularly intelligent about a social and economic revolution .

		People whose bonds have been repudiated by a government may be forgiven for not exhibiting sweet reasonableness towards that government .

		But we expected something more of Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- sell .

		It is not that Mr.
Russell	PERSON	is not dispas - sionate and objective enough so far as he goes -LRB- except for his mock-humorous picture of the Bolsheviks as `` moon-struck '' -RRB- : he merely refuses to go far enough .

		He stops almost at where we should wish him to begin .

		Just when we com - mence to hope for some frank interpretation , based on the known facts , which will give us a general clue to the confused series of events since Brest-Litovsk , Mr.
Russell	PERSON	becomes silent .

		And it is timid evasion .

		He simply does n't dare to 160 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
September 5	DATE	point to the implications of our mistake .

		He does n't dare to stress the simple and obvious fact that the real issue from the borders of what was
Germany	LOCATION	before the war to the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	is between feudalism and autocracy ; that in a coun - try where the middle class are so numerically few as to make a compromise republic as we know it in
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	impossible , no solution is possible but an extreme solution .

		Either
Russia	LOCATION	gets something like a socialistic commonwealth , or she gets autocracy .

		Names do not especially matter : it is a fight between in - dustrial democracy and agrarian communism on one side , and private property and special privi - lege on the other .

		While that particular con - flict is being settled ,
Russia	LOCATION	can of course have anarchy .

		And in the conflict now raging will Mr.
Russell	PERSON	have the temerity to say that the sympathies of the Entente nations , in contra - distinction to
Germany	LOCATION	, are all on the side of the socialistic commonwealth ?

		He knows they are not .

		Then why does he not speak the truth and shame the devil ?

		The American Family A SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY FROM COLONIAL TIMES TO THE PRESENT .

		By
Arthur W. Calhoun	PERSON	.

		Vol .

		II ,
From Independ	LOCATION	- ence through the Civil War .


Arthur H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		Since the period covered by this volume ante - dates not only that notoriously bitter fruit of the American tree of statistical knowledge , the fact of one divorce to every eleven marriages , or that still bitterer fruit , the fact of lowering birth rates ; since the period antedates even such meager information on family organization as can be correctly gleaned from federal or state census , Dr.
Calhoun	PERSON	has had to seek for data in the im - pressionistic byways and among the culs de sac of contemporary prepossession .

		His volume is a compilation of extracts from the letters , diaries , sermons , pamphlets , and so on of the times .

		Such miscellanies are confusion of themselves ; unfortunately , in spite of well-intentioned efforts to introduce order by a classification of subjects to which the chapter heads more or less corre - spond , the author adds to the unavoidable con - fusion certain personal entanglements of outlook and method .

		Foremost among them is his un - certainty as to whether he is a scientist or a moralist .

		When he promises an interpretation of the family along the lines of `` the influence of pioneering and the frontier , the development of urban industrialism , the rise of city luxury marked by conspicuous consumption , and the cul - mination of the chattel slave system , '' he is con - tent to be an economist .

		When he declares in a discussion of Mormonism that `` to attribute so great an achievement to mere animalism is the cheap recourse of the idler or the fanatic , '' he is even more content ; the consciousness of virtue he gets from scientific detachment is thorough .

		At other times , however , his sense of detachment fails and economic interpretation appears inade - quate .

		For example , in comparing the family of the North and West with that of the slave states , he remarks that `` diffusion of economic opportunity and the resultant democratic dignity held promise of an exalted type of democratic family life based not on economic necessity but on spiritual values . ''

		Again , in introducing a discussion on the `` emergence of woman , '' he opines that `` the economic forces back of modern progress and of the democratic enthusiasm in - volved in it could scarcely fail to unsettle the subordination of woman . ''

		In many other passages Dr.
Calhoun	PERSON	shakes off the shackles of strictly economic interpreta - tion in order to declare his faith in democracy an indulgence one is surprised that he can afford , even as a moralist , in the face of the pictures he has assembled , pictures of sweated children as well as subordinated women , of destructive Northern factories as well as of merciless South - ern plantations .

		I suspect Dr.
Calhoun	PERSON	remains of the faithful because he thinks or rather feels in terms of evolution in his opening sentence he refers to the evolution of the American family and we know the concept of social evolution is so unchallenged a pattern of American opinion that it seems `` as an armor against observations however massive or analysis however penetrating .

		To one who is not a social evolutionist , and to one who is a social psychologist rather than an economist , the final impression left by this `` social history '' is not concerned with the family at all , or not primarily .

		It is an impression of the social processes of rationalization , an insight into the justification of social sores by social authorities .

		Listen to this plea for the introduction of cotton mills by one Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	, head of the Masonic order of
South Carolina	LOCATION	: `` Here will be found a never-failing asylum for the friendless orphans and the bereft widows , the ^ dis - tribution of labor and the improvements in machinery happily combining to call into profitable employment the tender services of those who have just sprung from the cradle , as well as those who are tottering to the grave , thus training up the little innocents to early and wholesome habits of honest industry , and smoothing the wrinkled front of decrepitude with the smiles of competency and protection . ''

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 161 In his final volume Dr.
Calhoun	PERSON	may tell us how a century later at a hearing of a Congressional committee an even more prominent Southern gentleman was heard to argue in behalf of child labor in the mills as a prophylaxis against hook - worm .

		Examination of the recent opinion of the
United States Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	against the Na - tional Child Labor Law may also afford illus - trations of the method of imputing social values to what is , or is not , desired .

		A particularly striking illustration of this method , by the way , is cited by Dr.
Calhoun	PERSON	in his chapter on the effects of the Civil War .

		In
1865	DATE	certain general orders were issued that ho marriage license was to be got in the South until the contracting parties took the oath of allegiance to the
United States	LOCATION	, nor was any unsworn clergy - man or magistrate to officiate .

		In forwarding these orders , General
Halleck	PERSON	wrote to General
Stanton	PERSON	: `` You will perceive from paragraph V that measures have been taken to prevent , as far as possible , the propagation of legitimate rebels . ''

		Have we not a suggestion , in this association of illegitimacy or compulsory celibacy with dis - loyalty , for the control of pacifists or other sus - pects ?

		More than one suggestion that history may re - peat occurs in this diverting compilation , but there is little or no clue to when repetitions may be expected , nor are there any valid answers to queries about the antecedents of the family as we see it today , the highly unstable single family .

		The answers given are of the kind generally re - ceived by children curious about the nature of fire or wind or of the devil , answers primarily designed to stop questions and arrest thought .

		Such terms or phrases as `` liberalizing influences , '' `` fierce democracy , '' `` anarchistic democracy , '' `` conspicuous consumption '' -LRB- why does Dr.
Cal	LOCATION	- houn ignore the analysis behind
Veblen	PERSON	's phrase ? -RRB-

		, `` breezy freedom of the frontier mar - riage '' -LRB- for conventionality in marriage or in sex relations in general give me the frontier -RRB- , `` sor - did unions , '' `` the ethical counterpart of laissez - faire economics , '' `` pure '' -LRB- does not Dr.
Calhoun	PERSON	mean `` barren '' ? -RRB-

		, `` emancipation of childhood , '' conjugality `` freed from sentimentality , '' `` the clean slate of the New World '' -LRB- then as now more nearly an Old World palimpsest -RRB- such expressions have sufficient emotional content to gratify and to enable their contradictions to pass muster ; but such expressions and their implica - tions neither satisfy nor stimulate curiosity .

		They have the unforgivable vice of explaining without explaining .

		The Life of a Great Naturalist AUDUBON THE NATURALIST : A History of his Life and
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Francis Hobart Herrick	PERSON	.

		2 vols .

		Appleton ;
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		`` What a curious , interesting book , a Biog - rapher , well acquainted with my Life , could write , '' Audubon remarked in a letter to his wife .

		Professor
Herrick	PERSON	has written such a book , that will fascinate not only the scientist but anyone who is interested in human life .

		His subject gave him , at the outset , an enormous advantage , for the story of
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	's life has the varied shifting scenery and the dramatic plot of a romantic novel .

		Realizing this advantage , the author has quietly allowed the story to tell itself ; instead of throw - ing into relief the elements in his matter that would have challenged the artist , he has presented the facts and the documents in the spirit of the scientist .

		Among the documents are a mass of records letters , wills , deeds , and so on that by a happy chance have recently been found `` slum - bering in a house in the commune of Coueron . ''

		Having access to these , as well as to the earlier lives , Professor
Herrick	PERSON	may be regarded as the `` Biographer , well acquainted with my Life '' to whom Audubon referred , and his book may be regarded as the thorough , complete biography to which
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	was surely entitled .

		The two large volumes contain nearly one thousand pages , abundant and excellent illustrations , a bibliog - raphy , and a collection of original documents .

		The new documents dispose of the mystery that has always shrouded Audubon 's parentage and birth .

		He was born at
Les Cayes	ORGANIZATION	,
Santo Do	ORGANIZATION	- mingo ,
April 26 , 1785	DATE	, his parents being a Creole woman of
Santo Domingo	ORGANIZATION	known as Mile .

		Rabin , and
Jean Audubon	PERSON	, a Frenchman who having left his wife at
Nantes	ORGANIZATION	became a prosperous `` merchant , planter , and dealer in slaves '' in
Santo Domingo	LOCATION	.

		The story of the life of Audubon 's father excels that of the son in exciting action .

		He fought , on land and seas , in the Seven Years ' War , was in the battle of
Yorktown	LOCATION	, and took part actively in the French Revolution .

		When Captain Audubon left the
West Indies	LOCATION	in
1789	DATE	, he brought to his wife in
France	LOCATION	two children not her own ; happily for Audubon , however , his stepmother became a veritable parent to him .

		Looking back to his boyhood ,
Audubon	PERSON	said that the only school he had ever attended was that of Adversity .

		His opportunities for an education proved to be slight , his desire for it slighter .

		His ardent love of nature , which hindered his progress at the same time that it led to his greatness , re - vealed itself very early in his career : 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 5	DATE	Living things of every description which he found by the banks of the Loire or along the stonewalls and hedgerows of Coueron gave him the greatest pleasure , but birds were his early favorites .

		These he soon began to depict with pencil and crayon , but to the dryer discipline of the school he ever turned with laggard feet .

		There already we see the artist-naturalist ; it would seem that he had been created simply to produce `` The Birds of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		In
1803	DATE
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	, a youth of eighteen , re - turned to the New World .

		So far , of course , he was French , despite his birth in the
West Indies	LOCATION	; but
America	LOCATION	became his adopted land the land of his marriage , his work , his happiness .

		At
Mill Grove	LOCATION	, near
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, he began to use the English language and to know the American birds .

		In following the Perkioming above the mill dam he found a cave , carved out of the rocks , as he thought , by nature 's own hand , which was a favorite haunt of the unpretentious but friendly pewees , the first Ameri - can birds to attract his serious attention .

		So delighted was the youthful naturalist that he decided to make the pewees ' cave his study ; thither accordingly he brought his books , pencils and paper , and there made his first studies of American bird life , in the
spring of 1804	DATE	, in the third year of the presidency of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	.

		It is impossible to give here even a summary account of the ` years of unsuccessful ventures in business , from
New York	LOCATION	to
Louisiana	LOCATION	, that with all their diverting incidents and revelations of American life and manners constitute the center of Audubon 's outward life till he transformed his avocation of bird study and drawing into his vo - cation .

		Had it not been for his wife ,
Lucy Bake	PERSON	- well , an Englishwoman by birth , who labored for him by teaching school and serving as governess , and who had the practical instincts that he lacked , Audubon would never have completed his great task .

		The chief pleasures which
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	's business ven - tures in the West seem to have afforded him were his leisurely journey by river and long horseback rides to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to buy goods , when he could roam through his `` beautiful and darling forests of
Ken	PERSON	- tucky ,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, '' which gave him grand opportunities to make observations upon birds and animal life of every sort .

		He would seldom hesi - tate to swerve from his course to study his favorites , and has related how on one occasion , when driving before him several horses laden with merchandise and dollars , he quite lost sight of the pack saddles and the cash they bore , in watching the motions of a warbler .

		`` Watching the motions of a warbler '' was , as the event proved , his real business .

		As an orni - thologist and artist he was not only overflowing with infectious enthusiasm but dominated with a sense of care and a devotion to his work that enabled him to surmount obstacles which seemed hopeless .

		For years , on stated anniversaries , he burned his masterpieces , despite the praise they had evoked .

		He could paint for fourteen hours at a stretch : `` For instance , I am now working on a Fox ; I take one neatly killed , put him up with wires and when satisfied with the truth of the position , I take my palette and work as rapidly as possible ; the same with my birds ; if practicable I finish the bird at one sitting , often , it is true , of fourteen hours , so that I think they are correct , both in detail and composition . ''

		Accidents naturally happened , as when rats de - voured a treasure chest of drawings .

		Again and again he could not travel , or even pay for a night 's lodging , without painting portraits .

		The following journal entry is only typical .

		He finds himself stranded , penniless , in
Meadville	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	.

		`` Next day I entered the artist 's room , by crazy steps of the store-garret ; four windows faced each other at right angles ; in a corner was a cat nursing , among rags for a paper-mill ; hogsheads of oats , Dutch toys on the floor , a large drum , a bassoon , fur caps along the walls , a hammock and rolls of leather .

		Closing the extra windows with blankets , I procured a paint - er 's light .

		`` A young man sat to try my skill ; his phiz was ap - proved ; then the merchant ; the room became crowded .

		In the evening I joined him in music on the flute and violin .

		My fellow traveler also had made two sketches .

		We wrote a page or two in our journals , and went to rest .

		`` The next day was spent as yesterday .

		Our pockets replenished , we walked to
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	in two days . ''

		At length , after years of apparent failure in all departments of his life , he reached the age of forty-one an unrecognized man .

		Since America could not value his work , he turned to
Europe	LOCATION	, and there in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	he sud - denly found himself a man of high distinction .

		In
1826	DATE	, through a Scotsman named
Lizars	PERSON	, he had the satisfaction of seeing his first ten plates completed -LRB- Number 1 being the `` Wild Turkey Cock '' -RRB- .

		Exhibited at the Royal Institution of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, they became the talk of the town and the long-maned American woodsman became the latest social lion .

		`` I go to dine , '' he wrote , `` at six , seven , or even eight o'clock in the
evening	TIME	, and it is often one or two when the party breaks up ; then painting all day , with my correspond - ence , which increases daily , makes my head feel like an immense hornet 's nest . ''

		Small wonder that he began to yearn for his beloved magnolia woods ' in
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		More than once he met
Scott	PERSON	, who described him in his journal : `` less of a Frenchman than I have ever seen no dash , no glimmer , or shine about him , but great simplicity of manners and behaviour ; slight in person , and plainly dressed ; wears long hair , which time has not yet tinged ; his countenance acute , handsome and interest - ing , but still simplicity is the predominant character - istic . ''

		Clear-eyed Sir
Walter	PERSON	, in selecting simplicity as
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	's predominant characteristic , was doubtless right .

		His face , as the portraits show ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 163 was open and gentle in the extreme , without pro- fundity , without egotism .

		* He had one aim , to publish his tremendously ambitious `` Birds of
America	LOCATION	, '' which cost
$ 100,000	MONEY	to produce .

		This single aim was the result of his single passion for nature most of all for birds which possessed him all his days , and to which he gave free rein through years of wandering up and down and across
America	LOCATION	-LRB- traveling altogether countless thousands of miles -RRB- in those remote days when the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	was a primitive wilderness .

		From the full account of his life as told by Pro- fessor
Herrick	PERSON	, with its vivid background of the contemporary scene , there rises in the end a clear image of an ardent and lovable nature , not with - out faults but essentially admirable .

		I have given here only the main lines of
Audu	PERSON	- bon 's life up to his initial success in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		Full success came only later , and was followed by fresh efforts that caused more than one return to
America	LOCATION	.

		The scientist will read these later pages quite as absorbedly as the earlier ones , but the lay reader should be pardoned if he feels that , with the publication of the first plates , the story is virtually at an end .

FOERSTER	ORGANIZATION	.

		Twenty Lessons in Mediocrity PERSONAL MAIL COURSE IN PRACTICAL ENGLISH .

		By
Grenville Kleiser	PERSON	.

		20 lessons and 6 vols .


Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	.

		The momentum attained by the movement for correspondence instruction is indicated by the ap - pearance of private mail courses , attracted by profits into a field which is being cultivated by educational institutions in a spirit of social ser - vice .

		Such bureaus as the
Extension Department of the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	and the Depart - ment of
University Instruction	ORGANIZATION	of the
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, though in their infancy as colleges count time , have already developed extensive curricula and a flexible administrative technique .

		In English composi - tion , to speak only of the subject here considered , the latter offers a series of courses graduated from the primary lessons in `` English for New Ameri - cans '' the word foreigner is taboo in that de - partment up through English for civil service , for business , for college entrance , and so on as far as `` Short-Story Writing . ''

		The courses supple - ment the best available textbooks with mimeo - graphed lessons or `` lectures , '' expounding the text and supplying selected exercises .

		These are corrected and returned to the pupil , who may be required to rewrite them .

		If he becomes delin - quent he is followed up by encouraging letters and perhaps by a personal visit ; and when he has completed a course he may take a supervised examination and receive a certificate admitting him to more advanced work .

		The fees cover no more than the bare cost of materials and postage , and are assessed at all only because human nature inclines to neglect that which it gets for nothing .

		Carefully as such systems have been elaborated , correspondence teachers know well how experi - mental their work still is , how difficult it is to find textbooks suitable for study that can not be overseen , and how much it costs to provide expert and tactful criticism of the pupils ' exercises .

		Not professional jealousy but a hard won sense of the inadequacy of even the best public agencies , of their pedagogical and financial limitations , is behind the teacher 's distrust of private ventures .

		This course of Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	's , since it is issued by established publishers and has been prepared by an experienced editor , would seem as well cal - culated as any private venture to challenge the efficiency of the public systems .

		The lessons are more clearly printed , better bound , and accom - panied by a larger body of supplementary material than is usual in public courses .

		This collateral matter consists of convenient daily drill cards , informal `` Side Talks , '' and six pocket volumes three compilations of specimens and three abridged texts .

		The compilations will be more valuable than the texts , of which
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's `` Philosophy of Rhetoric '' and
Blair	PERSON	's `` Lectures on Rhetoric '' are way out of date and repellently formal , while Trench 's `` Study of Words , '' still a discussion stimulating to mature students , can ; scarcely replace the simple composition-grammar of the high school curriculum .

		I do not know what charge is made for all this material , but clearly the fee might be several times larger than the fee in any similar public course and still pro- vide the author and the publisher no more than < their due .

		The proper subject matter for such a course , and its most effective arrangement , have been the - object of no little theorizing and experiment .

		The most successful public courses develop word study , grammar , and rhetoric side by side through - out the lessons , try early to interest the pupil in good reading , and parallel the exercises with increasing assignments of original writing .

		But : Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	's course seems to have been arranged by accident .

		The first three lessons are devoted to word study , as are also the ninth , thirteenth , , and fourteenth .

		By way of grammar , the fourth 164 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 5	DATE	lesson presents the parts of speech -LRB- chiefly through long lists of nouns , verbs , and so on -RRB- and the fifth and eleventh conclude the matter with lists of blunders which , since there is no syste - matic development of grammatical structure , naturally have the look of isolated phenomena to be learned by rote ; sometimes they are ex - plained in grammatical terms which themselves have not been explained .

		Academic teachers no doubt err in the direction of too much systematic grammar , but Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	errs decidedly in the direction of too little .

		Meanwhile , in Lessons VI-VIII , he has already smothered the essen - tial rhetoric in folds of unnecessary definition and unprofitable terminology : under `` Clearness '' the pupil is confronted by those overlapping brethren , `` tautology , '' `` redundancy , '' `` verbos - ity , '' and `` circumlocution '' ; and under `` Figures of Rhetoric , '' introduced as early as Lesson VIII , he meets no less than fourteen differentiated labels `` metonymy , '' `` synechdoche , '' `` apos - trophe , '' `` hyperbole , '' and the rest of that antique crew .

		Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	appears more interested in rhetoric , and a pretty archaic rhetoric at that , than in grammar or in practical writing .

		Only at Lesson X is he ready to tell the pupil how to study ; the sentence is not treated until Lesson XII , and then rhetorically rather than gram - matically ; the paragraph delays until Lesson XV , and punctuation until Lesson XVI ; yet by Les - son XVIII the pupil is expected to be writing `` essays . ''

		Any considered design there may be in this arrangement has escaped me .

		Many of the exercises as exercises are admirably adapted to stimulate independent judg - ment and awaken originality .

		But lacking a simple , lucid textbook for reference , the pupil can only ask questions and there is nobody to ask .

		He writes his exercises and waits for the next lesson to supply him a key by which to correct his own work .

		His natural inability to under - stand many things in the lessons and many dis - crepancies between his exercises and the keys discrepancies which do not necessarily mean that he has failed these he must repair alone as best he can .

		Worse still , he has no contact with a taste other than his own and may easily fasten bad habits upon himself before he meets any chastening public .

		Worst of all , to delay prac - tice in original composition , in which the pupil ' must select and order and present his own mate - rials , until after some fourteen weeks of daily labor at exercises , in which he is constantly play - ing another man 's game , is to ask him to accumu - late on faith and to retain by conscious effort rather than by use a large equipment whose prac - tical import he can ` only guess at to discourage his early enthusiasm while encouraging the for - mation of that self-conscious punctilio which chiefly hampers ease in expression .

		The defeat of originality is complete if you suddenly set before such a one , as Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	does in
Lesson XVIII	LOCATION	, 162 subjects like `` Atheism , '' `` The Sea , '' `` Napoleon , '' and `` A Visit to Niagara Falls , '' and ask him to write `` essays . ''

		For the whole drift of this kind of instruction is toward the formally imitative .

		The pupil is never sure of his own ground , however low , and he is never led from a low assurance to a higher .

		Instead , he is forever trying to approximate con - ventional levels , and his efforts are so compassed about with the monotonous established that he soon believes mimicry to be the way of the world .

		Every teacher of English but especially the correspondence teacher who has to do with adult pupils knows that his labor to elicit originality is most handicapped by his pupils ' conviction that for every idea there is a stand - ardized expression , and that to write well one has only to acquire a sufficient number of these expres - sions .

		Such acquisitive pupils will be in clover in Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	's course .

		He promises to increase vocabu - lary by five thousand words , and if the student will industriously follow directions he ought shortly to get his head packed with an assortment of what the instructor calls `` beautiful words , '' `` felicitous phrases , '' and `` metaphorical expres - sions . ''

		`` You should seek to make your own , '' says Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	, `` many hundreds of expressions used by standard writers . ''

		The following is not an essay in vers libre ; it comprises just a few `` striking and felicitous phrases '' which I have made my own from the stores so generously garnered here by Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	the author , by the way , of a work entitled `` Fifteen Thousand Use - ful Phrases '' : grave concern impending doom inevitable conclusions intense application unflagging energy magnificent result pleasing presence gracious smile dazzling brightness nimble fancy delicious torment radical difference i gloomy apprehensions pardonable pride Some of these are from the daily drill cards , which tell the pupil , `` Deliberately use each of these phrases in your conversation TODAY . ''

		Ah the thrill when he has safely launched his `` competent authorities '' at an astonished company !

		One could get up a pretty parlor game from these cards `` Noun , noun , who 's got the noun ? ''

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 165 with a forfeit against every player responsible for a misalliance .

		If you desire balance there are the twins : wealth and fashion sunshine and shower decline and fall time and tide cold and haughty ready and eager before and after less and less though here one misses the thing that is never `` to '' but it is `` fro , '' and never `` pro '' but it is `` con , '' and some will feel that `` right-thinking and forward-looking '' really deserves recognition .

		If the twins fail , try triplets : just , pure , and true deep , widespread , and permanent industrial , economic , and social initiate , control , and direct And Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	proffers more intricate felici - ties like `` sense of responsibility , '' `` tenure of office , '' `` flight of fancy '' which may even em - brace entire sentences : `` The sun was blotted out , '' or `` He took his chin in hand . ''

		Nor will the diligent pupil ignore the metaphorical and idiomatic expressions culled for him : make a hit bite the dust like a flash yawning gulf quick as lightning swift as an arrow You begin to perceive the beautiful economy of this method .

		Why acquire a vocabulary word by word when you can acquire it felicity by felicity , gaining two or three words at once ?

		And why go to the trouble of building your own expression , and risk its looking queer , with all these ready-made and recognized phrases at your elbow ?

		I do not mean to say that this is the sum of Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	's word study only the effect .

		There is much in the six lessons on words which makes for discrimination and precision , as notably his thorough discussion of synonyms .

		But his sounder part is overlaid with page upon page of these short cuts , so seductive to the pupil possessed with the notion that every idea has its standard - ized expression .

		That is the notion at the heart of our medi - ocrity , manifesting itself on one hand in the dreary conventionality of the correct and on the other in the excessive slang of the rebellious .

		It it that notion which English instruction must set itself to exorcise , a task difficult enough with the unformed child but doubly difficult with the rigid adult .

		The vital objection to this course of Mr.
Kleiser	PERSON	's is that its approach fortifies , instead of resisting , that notion .

		In effect his twenty lessons in `` Practical English '' are twenty lessons in mediocrity .

		Realistic and romantic movements are com - monly supposed , in the cycle of literary evolution , to be alternative .

		As soon as the one begins to dim , the other begins to glow .

		But one of the curiosities of the present revival of poetry here and in
England	LOCATION	has been the simultaneity of these supposedly antipathetic strains .

		`` Sword Blades and Poppy Seed '' had scarcely begun to make itself known when the `` Spoon River Anthology '' and `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	'' interrupted the festivities ; the first Imagist anthology shrilly intervened only to be rudely jostled by the first Others anthology ; and so , ever since , the battle between the realists and the romanticists has been , if unconsciously , at any rate acutely waged , and seems at the present moment no nearer a decision .

		The explanation of this is not dif - ficult .

		Reaction is usually the propulsive force of an artistic movement , and in the present case it is possible to maintain that the rebirths of romanticism and realism a curious pair of twins were occasioned by a reaction to one and the same situation .

		This situation was the amazing decrepitude of American poetry , not merely dur - ing the last decade or two but , with the exception of Whitman and
Poe	PERSON	, during its entire history .

		In general it may be said that American poetry has been , when romantic , romantic without imag - ination ; when realistic , realistic without intelli - gence .

		Of the two strains the former has usually been dominant a sort of ethical sentimentalism -LRB- naive effort to justify puritanism on aesthetic grounds -RRB- supplanting any attempt to think or imagine freely .

		Home and mother have played the deuce with us .

		It is therefore against the failure of the realists to think , and the failure of the romanticists to imagine , that , superficially at least , our modern realists and romanticists have respectively re - volted .

		Are these terms quite adequate ?

		Per - haps not .

		We might more accurately say that 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 5	DATE	the failure was in both instances a failure of con - sciousness , a failure to perceive .

		It is natural therefore that we should now be seeing our realists , on the one hand , constituting themselves psychoanalysts , and our romanticists , on the other , making a kind of laboratory of aesthetics .

		At the same time , it is a little puzzling to sus - pect that in a sense the roles are here reversed .

		There is something scientific not to say realistic in the manner in which our more radical ro - manticists conduct their researches in aesthetics ; and certainly it is an adventurousness bordering on the romantic which impels our more radical realists to the exploration , not seldom , of such sinister , violent , and unfamiliar souls and places .

		The terms may prove to be outgrown .

		If , however , we take refuge in some such state - ment as that it is the function of romanticism to delight with beauty and the function of realism -LRB- psychorealism ? -RRB-

		to amaze with understanding , we can have no doubt that Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare 's `` Motley '' and Mr.
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Japanese Prints '' are in the romantic tradition .

		Mr. de la
Mare	ORGANIZATION	's position as an English poet is as secure as , in a period of such amazing flux , it is possible to have .

		He could be safely said to share with Mr.
William H. Davies	PERSON	first honors as a maker of delightful lyrics .

		`` Motley '' will neither add to nor detract from this reputation .

		It is a little unfortunate that it should have been her - alded as signaling an advance and expansion of Mr. de la Mare 's talents , for this it clearly can - not be said to do .

		The most that can be said is that , on the whole , it proves Mr. de la Mare to be still himself engaging , whimsical , and with a delicious knack for making conventional meters unconventional .

		One is likely , in appraising the latest book of a poet whose work is familiar , to mistake one 's failure to be surprised for a decline or stiffening of the poet 's style .

		It is with some diffidence therefore that one confesses to a feeling that there is not quite the clear magic here that illuminated `` Peacock Pie '' or `` The Listeners , '' not quite the same joyous plunge , but instead a gray sobriety which does not suit the poet so well .

		It is still the overtones of the supernatural that Mr. de la Mare plays on most skilfully and it is these overtones that most definitely impel one to call him a romantic .

		Here is a search for escape .

		It is curious too in the light of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's later work -LRB- not yet gathered in any book -RRB- to find him doing in his `` Japanese Prints '' precisely this same thing .

		Recently Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has been feeling his way towards a kind of realism an acceptance of -LRB- but also an attempt to sublimate -RRB- the world of reality .

		But in `` Japanese Prints , '' even more sharply than in `` Irradiations '' and certainly more conventionally than in `` Goblins and Pagodas '' we find him participating in the current romantic nostalgia for the remote and strange .

		As Mr.
Aldington	PERSON	and `` H. D. '' have been exploiting
Greece	LOCATION	, and Mr. Pound and
Miss Lowell	PERSON	exploiting
China	LOCATION	, so now Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	takes his turn with
Japan	LOCATION	.

		This whole tendency is indicative of a curious truckling to reason : one desires to talk of beauty and wonder as if they shone at one 's very door , but the joyous confi - dence of youth , the only magician who could make that immanence a reality , has alas vanished .

		Consequently one admits that such things are not to be found at one 's humble and matter-of-fact door , and takes refuge in the impalpability and marvel of distance .

		In `` Japanese Prints '' Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has made this excursion neither bril - liantly nor badly .

		These poems are slight , pleas - ant , sometimes sharply etched , in a few cases magical ; but one can not feel that they will com - pare very well with `` Goblins and Pagodas . ''

		Has Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	perhaps a little too studiously at - tempted the Japanese method of compression and concentration ?

		That is not the style most suited to him : he appears rather to be the sort of poet who reaches his greatest brilliance when allowed to develop rapidly successive musical variations on a theme capable of prolonged treatment .

		In such work words evoke words , images evoke images , the trains of association function freely and richly ; but in work like the present he has restricted himself at the outset to what can be achieved by an effort of intelligence alone , de - liberately exerted .

		It is Fletcher the craftsman imitating
Fletcher	PERSON	the poet .

		Mr.
William Rose Benet	PERSON	's new book , `` The Burglar of the Zodiac , '' proves him certainly to belong with the romanticists , but little else .

		Mr.
Benet	PERSON	is clever , but mechanical .

		One detects in him a considerable intelligence working through a shallow and unoriginal sensibility .

		Neither his rhythms nor his color seem to be peculiarly his own , nor has he apparently any sense of effect .

		His best work is a jargon of approximations .

		The two anthologies , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's `` Golden Treasury of Magazine Verse '' and Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's `` Masque of Poets '' need little comment .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's new venture , con - taining one hundred and twenty magazine poems , is a considerable improvement on his annual , though its usefulness may be questioned now that
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAI , 167 we have `` The New Poetry '' unsatisfactory as , in many respects , the latter is .

		`` The Masque of Poets '' was , it must be said , considerably more interesting as a magazine venture than it is as a book .

		Few of our poets quitted themselves like men .

		Miss
Lagerlof	PERSON	's artistic skill never flags .

		Is there any living novelist who has an imagination at once so luxuriant and so disciplined ?

		Around her simple Swedish people in their simple rela - tions she weaves a magic of all their legendary hopes and fears , that Christianity and their tidy civilization have not been able to destroy .

		Yet each character of hers emerges beautifully molded and clear , like some delicate head that a gifted peasant has carved out of wood .

		That form she has become so , - fond of is most perfectly suited to her quality .

		She builds up her story in a series of incidents , each of which is a complete story , with its own tension and color , but which weave together into a gorgeous fabric , with each strand infallibly in its place .

		She is able in this way to present the life of an entire community , the various characters steal - ing almost imperceptibly into the narrative and yet indelibly imprinted upon it .

		She handles this complex interplay of souls with such undeviating skill that her completed story , ' for all its poign - ancy of feeling and intricacy of motive , is as clear as a classic tale .

		She is never wholly im - mersed in it .

		She is a master of the tone of sympathetic detachment .

		She seems to love her characters all the more because she understands them so deeply .

		They do not need to be senti - mentalized over in order to produce the full ef - fect of their pathos , or the fervor of their rugged lives .

		Her latest book to be translated into English shows no shadow of turning .

		`` The Holy City '' carries on the story told in ``
Jerusalem	LOCATION	'' of the Dalecarlian rural people who were tempted from their Northern home by the religious call to spend the rest of their days among the holy shrines in the city of
Christ	LOCATION	's death .

		There the personal dramas begun in the Swedish community play themselves out to an end against the background of fanatic zeah
Bo Ingomar Mansson	PERSON	, who has come out to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to forget his love for Ger - trude , the schoolmaster 's daughter , sees her arrive just as he is saved from the temptation to desert the colony and rush home to her .

		How per - fectly that picture sets the tone of the book the Swedish pilgrims disembarking at
Jaffa	LOCATION	, solemn and serious with stern rugged faces , rowing to - wards him over the smooth silvery-blue
summer	DATE	sea !

		And
Ingmar Ingmarsson	PERSON	, who has married
Barbro	PERSON	in pique , comes after
Gertrude	PERSON	, fleeing unhappy
Barbro	PERSON	in his wistful pursuit .

		But Ger - trude has become the most ardent of the pilgrims , going every day at dawn to watch for the coming of the Son of Man , and following through the streets a dervish who thrillingly resembles the Christ .

		It is not long before she returns to her - self , and goes back to
Sweden	LOCATION	with
Bo	PERSON	and the prodigal
Ingmar	PERSON	, to whom
Barbro	PERSON	has borne an heir and for whom she has suffered .

		But with what richness of imagination does the author see this religion-fevered , plague - haunted
Jerusalem	LOCATION	in which she works out her moving drama !

		She searches out every nook and cranny and makes the city live almost as a person in all its vivid unhealthiness .

		The life of this
Gordon	PERSON	colony , to which the Swedish pilgrims come , lies dreamily on the borderline of fervent desire and reality .

		The Americans themselves are characteristic kindly , prosaic , combining a practical efficiency of working and teaching with a fanatical unreason in the ends they are there for .

		The poor Swedes suffer from the rumors that are set afloat about the colony by rival sec - tarians .

		They live in a stream of ardent wish - fulfilments .

		The heated air of the arid city shimmers with fantasies for their tired minds .

		Yet their faithful spirits glow with the glory of legend and religious hope .

		Surely these Northern artists burn with a flame that is more than hard and gemlike .

		If
Miss Lagerlof	PERSON	has a grave warmth that covers in its comprehending sympathy the passions of many interlocking lives ,
Jens Peter Jacobsen	PERSON	shows us a fire of suppressed sensuousness that at times is almost incandescent .

		He is so little detached from his heroine that she seems sometimes incom - prehensible , though it is evident that for her painter she is a symbol of all that is most ardently beautiful .

		He lived the last eleven years of his life , before his death in
1885	DATE	at thirty-eight , in a constant struggle with physical disability , and his zest for life beat its way inward instead of outward as in
Miss Lagerlof	LOCATION	.

		Out of the ro - 168 THE DIAJL -LSB-

Holberg	PERSON	and
Anderson	PERSON	, he has created a world of wistful beauty , with figures that are patently projections of his own intuitions of the pathos of desire and the inexorable recoil of life against happiness .

		The story is an historical romance only in the sense that the scenes make up a richly jeweled case which encloses an exquisite miniature .

		The scenes are worked out with a loving and sensuous patience , but they have little movement of their own , and exist as brocade through which runs the strange pattern of
Marie	PERSON	.

		It is a triumph for the translator ,
Hanna Astrup Larsen	PERSON	, that a book which dazzled the Danish literary world with its style , and rejuvenated the language of literary expression , should have brought over into English so much of its poetical beauty .

		Even the archaisms are translated with unfailing tact , and add their touch to a portrait that is as lustrous and rich as the finest Vermeer .


Marie Grubbe	PERSON	, this beautiful lady of the
Northern Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, with her tragic love life and her wild sweetness , is the woman in whom the passions to dominate and to be loved fight a thrilling battle .

		At fourteen she is the lovely daughter of
Squire Erik of Tjele Manor	ORGANIZATION	, neg - lected by her father and abused by his coarse mistress .

		In the drowsy garden , fantasies come to her of the suffering Griselda shut out in the rain and cold , and of Queen
Brynhild	PERSON	, stripped and tied by the shaggy yokel to the tail of a fiery stallion .

		She is somehow herself these volup - tuous sufferers , and when later in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	at her aunt 's home the lovely girl is kissed by the adored young
General Gyldenlove	ORGANIZATION	, she has a dull sense of bondage .

		A foot seems to press on her neck and grind her helplessly in the dust .

		And when she dreams of throwing herself down before him as he rides by in the street , his horse sets its cold iron-shod hoof on her neck .

		But her love withers in his dying delirium when she steals to him and he kisses her and then thrusts her vio - lently away as an imp of Satan , She takes her aunt 's beatings with perfect indifference , and , re - membering a wretched dog that she had seen stoned to death in the pond , she identifies herself with it , and `` welcomes every sorrow , only wish - ing that it would strike deep , for she is so un - happy that the death blow is her only hope . ''

		After his death she turns to piety and feels a dim desire for power , and a mystic ascetic pleas - ure which is followed by dreams of shining at court .

		She leaps at the idea of marriage with the gay
Ulrik Frederik	PERSON	, son of the king .

		Ulrik Frederik brings her neither power nor love .

		When he returns to her from a mission to
Spain	LOCATION	and humiliates her by his importunate , con - descending demands , her unconscious hate flares out at him as she plays with a knife , and she sud - denly plunges at his bare breast .

		When he takes her away to
Norway	LOCATION	and installs a mistress in the castle , she endures the insult for a while and then suddenly gives the wanton a sound thrashing and flees the castle .

		She is divorced and recovers her dowry .

		Now power is hers .

		She goes on a journey with her brother-in-law , who has made love to her beauty .

		But
Marie	PERSON	's sensuality awakens only at the motive of struggle .

		She has given herself to her brother-in-law only after a desperate fight at an inn , where she has seen her elegant companion dis - play an unexpected ferocity .

		The man who awakens her again at last is the groom
Soren	PERSON	, as he brings the plunging horses out of the burning stable one night .

		At forty-six her longings re - vive , she woos him , and spends the rest of her life with him in a little ale-house by the Falster ferry , which they manage too .

		In him her desire finds its haven .

		When he beats her , she expects to find an implacable hatred rising in her soul , but no such thing happens .

		She is her
Queen Brynhild	ORGANIZATION	.

		In her having wooed him , in her having him for the first man of her three husbands and two lovers whom she has chosen and created , her desire for power is subtly blended with her love .

		She had to have the subtle spiritual sweetness of herself setting the emotional current for her love , and she had to feel animal power over her , `` to accept good and evil from this black hand . ''

		Into this fascinating erotic figure ,
Jacobsen	PERSON	has apparently poured the ardor of a repressed soul .


Marie Grubbe	PERSON	is the beautiful woman , living in a world of heart-drenching beauty , yet sick with longing , torn by her discordant passions , finding peace only in the humility that he , as an invalid , would know was the end of the world 's beauty for him .

		She was at once the woman he could love , and his own struggling self .

		One can only suggest the richness of speculation that such a book lures to .

		Those who can trace out erotic roots in the soul will find these pages scattered with psychological intuition .

		It is an amazingly profound and beautiful book , a rich acquisition for the American reader .

		For its presence one forgives the publishers for their effrontery in palming off the portrait of Beatrice d'Este on us as the likeness of this tragic heroine

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL , 169 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS A HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH .

		By
Williston Walker	ORGANIZATION	.

		Scribner ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		This is a very readable 600-page volume cover - ing the whole history of the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	, and is characterized by clarity and historical reliability .

		It will meet with a favorable recep - tion in many student quarters , and will prove a convenient reference book for busy religious workers .

		We are glad to note that the tra - ditional division of church history into ancient , medieval , and modern has disappeared in this book , and that attention is paid to the growth of doctrine and the modification of religious thought .

		There is however a lack of consideration for social and psychological factors , which lack will hinder its being a book for the future .

		A one volume church history is still needed , written by an author of Professor
Walker	PERSON	's ability and learning , but with the added feature of the psycho-sociological point of view .

		We want to look on a panoramic unfolding and emergence of religious beliefs and practices out of their social and political environments out of life itself !

		THROUGH
LAPLAND	LOCATION	WITH SKIS AND REINDEER .

		By
Frank Hedges Butler	PERSON	.

		Stokes ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		If the bibliography at the end of this volume is approximately complete , then even the unpol - ished state of Mr.
Butler	PERSON	's work will not stand in the way of its holding a prominent place among the books about
Lapland	LOCATION	.

		English writers espe - cially have given this region a wide berth , and the majority of the few books on the subject are in other languages .

		The lore of
Lapland	LOCATION	needs a more skilful interpreter than Mr.
Butler	PERSON	; but , informal as is his style , he conveys to the reader much interesting information about the country and its people , and opens up a valuable field of ethnological and geographical investigation .

		Hon - esty , he says , is one of the major virtues of the Lapps ; they are , moreover , charitable to the poor and hospitable to strangers , clean , and indus - trious .

		They make their own tools , implements for fishing , clothes , and ornaments .

		Their aggre - gate number is somewhere near 30,000 , and they are distributed over an area of 150,000 square miles , of which two thirds is in
Russia	LOCATION	and the remainder in
Norway	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	traveled in
Lapland	LOCATION	as the natives do .

		He wore the reindeer skin breeches , the coat , shoes , and gloves of the same material , and rode in a `` pulka , '' or sledge , drawn by a reindeer .

		These picturesque draft animals are driven by a single strap laid across the forehead , but not around the antlers , and extended into the rein which just reaches the driver seated in the pulka .

		The thumb of the right hand is placed in a loop at the end of the rein , which is held tight by being twisted around the wrist .

		The rein lies on the left side of the animal , and as a rule the reindeer makes off at once , but if any incentive to go is needed it is given by striking a blow on the left side and throwing the rein over to the right .

		The evolution of the ski and its use is traced from early times , and there are many references to the possibilities of
Lapland	LOCATION	for winter sports .

		In fact the author looks forward to the development of the region as a winter resort where a post-season of snow and ice may be enjoyed by those who wish more than
Switzerland	LOCATION	provides .

		If there are any who wish to explore this land for them - selves , the directions for reaching and traversing it will be found as enlightening as war conditions and the character of the place make possible .

		THE POETS OF THE FUTURE : A College Anthology for 1916-1917 .

		Edited by
Henry T. Schnittkind	ORGANIZATION	.


Stratford	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		There are two reasons why these anthologies , now in their second year , fail to represent
Ameri	PERSON	- can undergraduate verse fairly .

		One reason is the method by which the poems are selected ; the other reason is the editor .

		The previous volume contained 140 pieces from some sixty institutions , yet contrived to neglect such colleges as Prince - ton ,
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Williams	ORGANIZATION	,
Vassar	LOCATION	,
Radcliffe	LOCATION	,
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	, and
Smith	PERSON	and such college magazines as the Yale `` Lit '' and the Harvard `` Monthly . ''

		The present volume contains an additional score of poems , from an additional score of institutions , but still passes over several colleges where good verse has regularly been written , still ignores the best of the undergraduate magazines .

		We are not told just what is the method of selection that produces this misrepresentative result , though it appears that several thousand poems have been `` submitted . ''

		Why have them submitted ?

		Why not choose directly from the college magazines ?

		Not only would the anthology be more fairly representative of its field ; but also , realizing upon previous editorial selection , it would contain fewer pieces upon which printer 's ink should never have been wasted .

		This brings us to our second reason Mr.
Schnittkind	PERSON	, who belongs to the
Braithwaite	PERSON	school of anthologists .

		That is to say , he distributes the laurel lavishly , prefer - ring to indulge ninety and nine mediocrities rather than miss one talent .

		Of course the effect of his generosity is merely to cheapen the laurel .

		Some thirty of these poems are worth reading , but you must find them among 165 ; perhaps a dozen of the authors deserve every encouragement to per - sist , but the encouragement is spread thin over a dozen dozen , with ten dozen more waiting hope - fully in the outer court where -LRB- again the
Braith	PERSON	- waite technique -RRB- `` Other Poems of Distinction '' 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 5	DATE	are awarded laurels of the second class .

		A still more significant kinship between Messrs.
Braith	PERSON	- waite and Schnittkind reveals itself in the latter 's introduction to this anthology : Our human minds are like so many imperfect and distorted mirrors in which the One is reflected in a million apparently irreconcilable variations .

		Now and then , however , the mist lifts for the fraction of a second before a small part of the mirror of our minds , and a poem is born ... I have picked out for inclusion in the anthology those poems that have most forcibly brought home to me the truth that we con - tinually meet God face to face , that we see his smile in every star , in the glitter of the firefly , in the poet 's dream , in the soft still fall of snow flakes ... and so on through a tedious catalogue .

		No one would deny Mr.
Schnittkind	PERSON	his private defini - tion of poetry ; but an anthologist who makes it his business to represent to the interested public the poetry of its college youth is under direct obligation to the definitions that obtain in that public and among those poets .

		Among the poets Mr.
Schnittkind	PERSON	recognizes , the following would seem , on the evidence here presented , to deserve special encouragement :

		WELFARE AND HOUSING .

		By
J. E. Hut	PERSON	- ton .

		Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		During the war Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	has been respon - sible for securing labor for the largest commercial undertaking in
England Vickers	LOCATION	, Limited and providing for it the necessary welfare supervision and living accommodations .

		The exigencies of war have pushed ahead the hands of the clock and we find ourselves adopting methods in shop management which a few years ago would have been denounced as impractical and revolutionary .

		Instead of the old-time manager whose chief duties were `` hiring and firing '' we have a service department , the function of which is , in addition to engaging labor , to hold on to it and to keep it healthy and contented for the purpose of secur - ing its maximum production .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	con - trasts the system of
Physiological Management	ORGANIZATION	, as he calls it , with what is known in
America	LOCATION	as
Scientific Management	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter system has fallen short of the claims made for it by its sponsors , chiefly by reason of its overvaluation of the financial reward as an incentive to production and the underrating of the individual quality of the worker as a human being .

		The writer feels that no unpleasant suspicion of philanthropic in - tention attaches to arrangements for the comfort and convenience of workers so long as it is frankly understood that the cost of welfare supervision is repaid in the increased capacity for production and the reduction of labor turnover .

		The chap - ters dealing with the practical details of organiz - ing and administering hostels and canteens are of especial value , although the wide difference in dietary habits between workers in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	needs to be taken into consideration .

		COLOUR STUDIES IN
PARIS	LOCATION	.

		By
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The essays reprinted in this volume were all of them written apparently over a decade ago , and even those which do not actually date from the nineties are redolent of that perfumed time .

		The author 's style has all those virtues of refine - ment which a fin de siecle should possess espe - cially of so lettered a century as the nineteenth .

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's French studies have influenced him in more ways than one .

		Quite apart from the sub - stance of his thought , not only is the vocabulary predominantly Latin but in pursuing la clarte franqaise he has achieved a simplicity so trans - parent as to be almost painful .

		Again we are reminded that languages like men have their characters and that to write English with French abstinence is as much of a strain as it would be for a Frenchman to gesticulate with our meager - ness .

		But if we feel that Mr.
Symons	PERSON	proves the impossibility of writing English with quite the same clarity as French , that is only because this prose of his remains unchallengeably immaculate : we know that if anyone could have done the trick , it would have been he .

		`` We reach the
Boulevard Saint-Germain	ORGANIZATION	, coming out suddenly under the trees , so beautiful , I always think , in that odd , acute glitter which gaslight gives them . ''

		Here one sees the charm of this book , where Mr.
Symons	PERSON	` has traced for us with such a delicate mastery the luminous attractions of material
Paris	LOCATION	and , not less undeviatingly , those rare fig - ures
Verlaine	PERSON	and the rest to know whom well was the privilege of this foreign litterateur .

		THE VIRGIN ISLANDS .

		By
Theodore De	PERSON	-
Booy	PERSON	and
John T. Faris	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		American travelers who are planning to visit our new possessions in the
West Indies	LOCATION	will find this volume profitable reading .

		Though prima - rily interested in the history , the archaeology , and the romance of the
Caribbean	LOCATION	islands , the authors have not attempted to write very extensively con - cerning the West Indian past ; their work deals chiefly with our new dependencies as they are to - day with climate , scenic attractions , elements of population , material resources , and such other matters as might be presumed to interest the tourist or the business man who is looking for new fields for investments .

		The volume also contains a chapter devoted to the neighboring British islands of the Virgin group .

		It is written in a sprightly , somewhat informal style and is provided with nearly one hundred illustrations showing what man and nature have wrought in this interesting corner of
America	LOCATION	.

		The maps , of which there are five , have however no great claim
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 171 to real excellence .

		As to our future policy in the
West Indies	LOCATION	the authors proffer no advice aside from the suggestion that the
United States	ORGANIZATION	should make an effort to acquire -LRB- by purchase of course -RRB- , the Dutch islands in the
Caribbean Sea	LOCATION	; these are apparently a source of mere expense to the Dutch , but would be of real value to us , as they would increase the strategic importance of the naval station which we shall eventually establish on the
Virgin Islands	LOCATION	.

		WOMEN AND THE FRENCH TRADITION .

		By
Florence Leftwich Ravenel	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This pretentious book of essays on French women of note is absolutely devoid of virtue .

		The author 's facts are those one might better learn from any good encyclopedia , while her manner of telling them is illustrated by this excerpt from a typical sentence : '' ... of difficult self-mastery and resolute repression and subordination of com - peting motives and impulses in the path of the ruling passion or purpose . ''

		Any one of the dis - tinguished women whom Mrs.
Ravenel	PERSON	deals with `` deals with '' is the only possible way of putting it would turn in her grave at these repetitious , formless vaporings .

		Worst of all , she drags in again and again the obviously reluctant
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, so out of place as to be humorous in this barbarous cacophony .

		Professing an open mind and a sympathy with the ambitions of her sex , she is nevertheless , apparently without knowing it , the conventional Victorian would-be fine lady .

		The fact that in Scandinavian countriej `` certain conclusions '' are accepted `` without wincing '' calls to Mrs.
Ravenel	PERSON	's attention the `` defective deli - cacy '' of those unladylike peoples .

		In Mrs.
Rave	PERSON	- nel 's Utopia the females will all marry and each will be the proud possessor of a dowry sufficient to ensure a dignified independence .

		Until that happy time shall dawn Mrs.
Ravenel	PERSON	is content piously to repeat : `` Time is the only just judge .

		His verdict is always vindicated in the end . ''

		ETHICS AND ESTHETICS OF PIANO-PLAYING .

		By
Constantin von Sternberg	PERSON	.

		Schirmer ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This little book has the quite definite purpose of encouraging the student `` to do what , after honest and sincere thinking , seems right to him , though this may involve the breaking with any tradition that militates against the world 's mod - ern and enlightened conception of music . ''

		Old rules , such as `` the note that bears an accentuation sign must be the loudest of its group , '' are there - fore wholesomely scrutinized , and one finds this welcome sentence : `` It may be said here that more than half of the mystery of touch , over which gushing writers and talkers of pianistic melliflux marvel , lies in this melodic and harmonic purity which is fundamentally necessary to musical de - sign produced on a piano . ''

		This needs to be said by one in authority at a time when the effective - ness of `` pressure touch '' is taken for granted with as little doubt as fetishisms are likely to receive .

		The purpose of the volume implies a limited audience the piano player whose thoughts on music have not become fixed but even the ad - vanced student or the mature teacher may receive some useful suggestions .

		For instance , it is shown that , because of the diminishing nature of piano tone , the volume of notes following a sustained note should usually correspond to that of the latter when released .

		The skilled player may have followed this practice without being aware of it , and a valuable feature of the book is that of stating plainly some things about which a player might previously have had only an uncertain no - tion .

		Mr.
von Sternberg	PERSON	has the clarity which he demands in the interpretation of theme or de - sign on the piano .

		Perhaps the forbidding `` ethics '' could have been omitted from title and text , for the first two chapters make an unpropitious beginning .

		Though some good points are brought out , these chapters are dull , a little flamboyant , and not al - together sound .

		`` Soul '' is used without being defined , and too much confidence is placed in analogy .

		Occasionally through the volume occur dubious statements , but they partake of the gen - eralities of the first two chapters and do not af - fect the value of the practical suggestions which follow .

		FIFTY YEARS OF ASSOCIATION WORK AMONG YOUNG WOMEN : 1866-1916 .

		By
Elizabeth Wilson	PERSON	.

		Woman 's Press ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This is a history of the
Young Women	ORGANIZATION	's
Chris	PERSON	- tian Associations in the
United States	LOCATION	from the various preliminary organizations , both here and in
England	LOCATION	, which held the genesis of the idea , down to
1916	DATE	.

		The convenient appendix includes a chronological table , a list of the
American Associations	ORGANIZATION	and of the national officers , and a competent index .

		The volume is naturally of most direct interest to workers and members , and of course it contains a great deal of matter and a great many names which the lay reader will cheerfully skip ; but its very completeness conveys better than could any briefer record the astonishing growth of the institution .

		The
Y. W. C. A.	ORGANIZATION	has pursued its work so inconspicuously that it needs such a chronicle as this to bring home to the outsider what has been accomplished .

		If the work has sometimes seemed narrower more evangelical and less liberal than it might have been , that is a condition which is now rapidly yielding to the exigencies of war service .

		A later edition of this history will probably have to add to the present record of swift growth an equally astonishing record of versatile adapta - tion to social emergencies never dreamt of by the founders .

September 5	DATE	NOTES ON NEW WAR BOOKS Of three books on the situation in
the fourth year	DATE	of the war ``
Germany	LOCATION	as It Is Today '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , ``
Germany	LOCATION	at Bay '' -LRB-
Doran	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , and `` The Winning of the War '' -LRB- Har - per ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , by a journalist , Mr.
Cyril Brown	PERSON	, by a soldier , Major
Haldane Macfall	PERSON	, and by a pro- fessor , Dr.
Roland G. Usher	PERSON	it must be said at the outset that the performance of the journalist is by far the most workmanlike and convincing .

		Mr.
Cyril Brown	PERSON	spent the first years of the war in
Germany	LOCATION	as correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	`` World , '' and his information seems authentically documented to
January , 1918	DATE	.

		He deals explicitly and categorically with those aspects of the organized life of
Germany	LOCATION	which have given persistent hope to the Allied nations that the war would end by the internal collapse of that empire the lack of fuel and food , the diminution of the efficiency of labor , the wearing out of transportation systems , financial bank - ruptcy , the rapidly declining birth rate , the lower - ing of the general morale of the people .

		The author repeatedly refuses to predict that any one of these factors will bring about the fall of
Germany	LOCATION	in the near future ; and yet the account of the condition of strain produced by the simul - taneous action of them all gives , first , a half - unwilling admiration of the extraordinary skill with which that strain has been shifted and dis - tributed , and second , a profound conviction that the breaking point must be near .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	supports his statements by copious citations from government reports and documents , as well as his own observations , and granting the accuracy of these , it may be fairly said that his is the most authoritative account yet issued of the internal condition of
Germany	LOCATION	in
1918	DATE	.

		Major
Haldane Macfall	PERSON	describes himself as late of the
Sherwood Foresters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The addition suggests the myth-making power of the brave days of old , and the Major amply qualifies himself as the author of what will doubtless become the authentic British legend of the war .

		In brief ,
Major Macfall	ORGANIZATION	's thesis is that the war was won by
Marshals Joffre	PERSON	and French in the battles for
Paris	LOCATION	and
Calais	LOCATION	in the
autumn of 1914	DATE	.

		Since then his only fear has been that
Germany	LOCATION	would refuse to recognize her defeat and would hypnotize her conquerors into abandoning at the peace table the fruits of their prowess .

		The account of the failure of the strategy of the Ger - man high command in these two campaigns is undoubtedly correct , and the praise accorded to Joffre for refusing to be drawn into premature combat for the defense of
Belgium	LOCATION	and northern
France	LOCATION	is well deserved , as is that to Lord French and the `` Old Army '' for the dogged persistency with which they performed their allotted task in holding the left of the line in the battles for the Channel ports `` where in long lengths in places one man had to hold seventeen yards '' ; where `` one British division held eight miles against three German army corps '' ; where `` the
7th Division	ORGANIZATION	fought against odds of 8 to 1 , with enormous odds in artillery against it . ''

		The story , even allowing for some pardonable exaggeration , is a splendid one , and eternally worthy of the descendants of
Robin Hood	PERSON	.

		One suspects the exaggeration however when
Major Macfall	ORGANIZATION	continues to describe the course of the war in the same formulas of victory .

		Ac - cording to his view , the Germans were hope - lessly and irremediably downed in
1914	DATE	, and have been down ever since .

		`` The frantic struggle to keep off the besieging strangle-hold from grip - ping them had ended in failure .

		Henceforth the German could but make the sorties of a be - leaguered people . ''

		And these sorties have been failures .

		Reluctantly he concedes to Hindenburg a victory at
Tannenberg	LOCATION	, and one somehow under - stands that
Serbia	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	, and
Roumania	PERSON	have passed into the enemy 's hands .

		Gallipoli is put among the side issues .

		But for all that , the vic - torious march of the Allies has not been checked .

		The strategy of Hindenburg in the
East	LOCATION	has been as full of elementary errors as that of
Moltke	PERSON	and Falkenhayn in the
West	LOCATION	.

		The losses of the Ger - mans have been unthinkable .

		At
Ypres	LOCATION	in
May , 1915	DATE	, `` the German infantry were annihilated and their commander began to flinch . ''

		`` Loos cost the German battalions 80 men in every hundred . ''

		`` The Champagne battle cost the Germans 100 , - 000 casualties and 23,000 prisoners , and 155 guns . ''

		At
Verdun	LOCATION	`` with a loss of 60,000 men the broken German columns collapsed and were taken out of the disaster . ''

		`` In three weeks -LRB-
1916	DATE	-RRB- 4,000 officers , 194,000 men , 219 guns , and 644 machine guns were the Russian capture . ''

		It is an easy problem in addition to show that the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	lost more men on
Major Macfall	ORGANIZATION	's pages than they ever possessed , while he admits only trfling losses for the Allies 20,000 French at
Verdun	LOCATION	and 50,000 English at
Gallipoli	LOCATION	.

		The Allied commanders have had it all their own way .

		`` Joffre in fact was making his French troops realize that he could make the Germans feel his will wherever and whenever he chose . ''

		`` Haig and Foch decided that certain things should be and they were . ''

		And the Rus - sian generals treated Hindenburg as cavalierly .

		Major
Macfall	PERSON	describes himself as `` the student of strategy , '' and playfully conceives himself as instructing a thick and muddle-headed person whom he calls The Man-in-the-Street .

		After Major
Macfall	PERSON	's clarion notes , Profes - sor Usher seems a bit depressing .

		His book `` The Winning of the War , '' is described as a sequel to `` Pan-Germanism , '' in which , in
1913	DATE	, he revealed
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 173 the programme of Mittel-Europa .

		He begins by frankly admitting that the Russian Revolution has made the Pan-Germanic Confederation `` a European and international fact unassailable to armies and impermeable to diplomacy . ''

		He pro- ceeds to show that
Germany	LOCATION	with her soldiers and her `` invisible army '' of penetration has made her position in the East unshakable and probably relieved her economic and industrial situation .

		He discusses and dismisses the possibility of revolt in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Historically the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, he affirms , was called into being as a device to prevent the recurrence of the old tragedy of the German peo - ple , defeat through division .

		They will be true to it .

		He warns us of the futility of war aims which include or depend upon the change of government in
Germany	LOCATION	, for the keynote of democracy is self-government , not government by others , the decision by each nation of the way in which its affairs shall be conducted , not the attempt of one nation to decide the expedient form of government for another .

		He dismisses also the possibility of victory through revolt among the subject peoples of
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Their traditional desire for autonomy , he believes , will yield to the practical benefits of tariff union and an international position result - ing from their continued combination .

		He is skeptical as to the possibility of complete military victory in the
West	LOCATION	.

		And yet Professor Usher has a formula for victory no less satisfactory than
Major Macfall 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , like the Major , he regards the war as already won : The Allies have won already because
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	are safe , because
France	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	are now merely the European members of a vast democratic alliance which includes the British Empire , the
United States	LOCATION	, the larger South American nations , and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Internationalism is safe because the Allies already control the new international fabric which will certainly , by reason of its very existence , readjust the European balance and impose upon the powers of
Europe	LOCATION	a new morality , a new regard for the equality of nations , a new respect for law .

		One is startled into attention .


France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	safe ?

		Yes , says Professor Usher , for they are the indispensable minimum of the mili - tary objective and can be taken along with the Trentino any time in the next five or ten years .

		Internationalism safe because the Allies control the international fabric ?

		Yes , Professor Usher gravely assures us : A real international democracy has been created by the development of
Asia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	during the nineteenth century ... The future of democ - racy and of civilization will be safe whatever hap - pens in
Europe	LOCATION	so long as close cooperation and friendly understanding continue among the
United States	LOCATION	, the British Empire ,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and the principal South American natiuus .

		In other words Professor Usher 's formula for victory is one of
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		Let the Allies hold together and think themselves victors , and the war is won .

		One may inquire how long Professor Usher 's reading of history permits him to prophesy that this `` close cooperation and friendly understanding '' will continue .

		He would doubtless reply , `` At least for the period of the war . ''

		We are not surprised therefore to find Professor Usher little concerned about the dura - tion of the struggle and actually advising the Entente not to hurry its military programme .

		Five years , or perhaps ten better not get tired out !

		His formula of victory is a paradox .

		So long as the war continues , the war is won .

		These two books , ``
Germany	LOCATION	at Bay '' of the English `` student of strategy , '' and `` The Win - ning of the War '' of the American professor , would scarcely justify such lengthy notices were it not that they are unhappily representative of much of the war thought of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		In the first we recognize the intel - lectual attitude of the `` Old Army , '' which has given commanders to the new .

		In the second we recognize the cloudy idealism that marks the American war mind , the trust in an iridescent dream of internationalism which is based on no facts except that of the present conflict itself and the grouping of powers which it has called forth .

		This unreal treatment is as characteristic of American professors as
Major Macfall	ORGANIZATION	's is of British soldiers .

		In the case of the two authors in question it probably makes little difference but it is not to be forgotten that for the edu - cation of some of their colleagues the two nations are paying in blood .


James B. Connolly	PERSON	has always written freshly and vigorously of the sea .

		He is the very man to give us a picturesque volume on `` The U-Boat Hunters '' -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Connolly has a richness and a vitality of imagination which give a fine sunlit color to his subject .

		He tells joy - ously of the voyage of the American fleet to foreign waters early in the war , of adventures - in a destroyer , of rescues , and terrors cour - ageously met .

		The book is enthusiastic rather than realistic ; for
Connolly	ORGANIZATION	writes from the angle of a man who enjoys life and people , and above all , the sense of freedom and of adven - ture which the sea gives .

		The style is free and friendly , often conversational .

		It is slangy , true to our American masculinity of the sea .

		The author frankly makes an appeal to the interests - of young men likely to respond to the call of naval service .

		It is perhaps for this reason that the picture , as he paints it , is so vividly colorful and so adventurous .

		It is not really a book about the war .

		It is like a sunny , blue and orange and white poster that displays the glory of clean fighting .

		174 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 5	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT THE EFFORTS OF EDUCATIONAL REFORMERS TO re-create the public school system as an arena for personal growth and for the development of per - sonal skill collide with the fact that too often the school is a firmly welded part of the political system .

		When the district school was consoli - dated under a state-administered machinery , it gained of course in mechanical efficiency .

		But to the politician the new centralized system be - came a welcome addition to his office-filling ma - chine , and the various state and county superin - tendencies , principalships , and even teachers ' posi - tions became simply so many more petty rewards for the deserving party worker .

		Between educa - tional and political motives in the public school the struggle has been incessant .

		Frequently the politician has been successful in converting edu - cational advances into victories for himself .

		The city school system could never have developed into the uniform , mechanical , quasi-military machine that it is if educators and not politicians had dic - tated its organization .

		For the rigid and uniform organization is exactly the one which is most easily handled by the politician ; once set in mo - tion it almost runs itself .

		It is likely to squeeze out any originality and initiative , and with patient tending soon reaches that state of cataleptic trance revealed in so many of the recent surveys , where a curriculum is pictured revolving automatically in a dull , unconscious vacuum , utterly out of touch with either the real world or the lives of the children caught in the machine .

		Most of the current educational controversy is not between vital theories of education , but between persons who have a theory of education and a school per - sonnel where the struggle for prestige and prefer - ment absorbs emotional energy .

		Livelihood , pre - ferment , first ; afterwards , at a very far remove , education .

		Reformers who go about trying to cast out devils find , as they have recently found in
New York	LOCATION	, that after one exorcism seven other devils enter .

		The politician soon learns to use educational theory as masquerade for his essen - tially non-educational purposes , and confounds you by destroying ideals in the very name of their eager acceptance .

		He will justify his reaction as long as he can by the old and tested theories , and when the tide turns will steal the very best phrases and motifs of the new .

		The good will of a public interested in improving the school has to beat about the periphery of this solid and un - yielding block of the political system in the state - administered school .

		Attempts to leaven the lump are like trying to apply yeast to a locomo - tive .

		For when the school system becomes , as the education authorities in some of our large cities have conceived it their duty to make it , an arm of the state in inculcating instinctive respect and uncritical acceptancy of all authority and political forms , then the school as an educational institu - tion almost ceases to exist .

		What began as an opportunity for the free development of the com - mon man , what has been seen by all true edu - cators as the spur to intelligent individuality , may become a tool by which the state secures the auto - matic conformity and docility of the people .

		It is because of these tendencies that clear-sighted minds like
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	see in a state - organized and state-administered system of com - pulsory education a serious menace to our recon - structing society after the war .

		How to make the school an educational , institution will become a problem upon which the very resiliency and re - vival of Western society will depend .

		THE BATTLE OF PRESTIGE IS NOT CONFINED TO statesmen .

		Labor also presents its candidates .

		Perhaps the most adroit method of self-advertise - ment yet discovered is that adopted by
Samuel Gompers	PERSON	, President of the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, who has left for
England	LOCATION	informing us that he intends to combat the dangerous pacifism of
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	, it ap - pears from the official statement , `` plans to elect 400 Labor men to the
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and make himself premier , so that a speedy peace can be effected . ''

		Of course Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	is bound to be successful in this ambitious task of stopping what without his opposing influence might be - come a really dangerous pacifist move in Eng - land .

		He will undoubtedly prevent Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son from becoming premier .

		For it is safe to say that Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	never contemplated and does not now contemplate becoming premier as a result of the forthcoming general election .

		Even those who would be inclined to be most optimistic about the number of
Labor	ORGANIZATION	members that will be returned as , for example , Mr.
Sydney Webb	PERSON	have recently stated that
Labor	ORGANIZATION	will be lucky if it returns a bare hundred .

		In other words , this `` 400 '' and this deep-laid scheme of Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's to capture the premiership in order to hasten to make a negotiated peace with Ger - many are both pure myths .

		They are straw men erected by Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	for the express purpose of being overthrown amid the plaudits of an American labor public , deeply grateful to Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	for having contrived to keep the war going until
Germany	LOCATION	is beaten in the field .

		This task successfully accomplished , Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	can return home , his prestige greatly enhanced .

		But can so transparent a trick be seriously accepted by labor men in this country ?

		Is it possible that
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	, who more than any other single man has held the restive elements of British labor steadily for peace by victory , can be so mis - represented so flagrantly and openly misrepre - sented ?

		What must inevitably be the effect of such a mission as Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	pretends to di - rect ?

		It must almost of necessity tend to alienate
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 175 those very elements in British labor which here - tofore have been most anxious to bring about a friendly rapprochement with the
American Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration of Labor .

		It must almost of necessity do more harm than good .

		It will create perfectly unnecessary antagonism .

		For Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	will be presuming to read a moral lecture to the very men who have given already to the common cause more than we shall , in all human prob - ability , ever give .

		It is worse than impudence for Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	to assume the task of elevating the morale of British workers .

		They have at - tended to their own morale for over four years without Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	's help .

		And they probably feel that they can continue to attend to it .

		What is more , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has lost one son in this war and another is in active service in
France	LOCATION	.

		One wonders just how Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	will go about the delicate mission of telling Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son to his face that he is a dangerous pacifist .

		Or will he confine his oratory to the British workers , who know better ?

		Perhaps , after all , this is just an ingenious scheme for creating new votes for
the Labor	ORGANIZATION	members who will stand for
Parlia	ORGANIZATION	- ment in the coming election .

		Certainly it took no mean order of Machiavellian genius to devise so sure a scheme for enhancing Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	^ prestige in
England	LOCATION	.

		Where it counts .

		`` THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE '' is THE PARA - doxically engaging title of a book which
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	will shortly complete and of which he has written already the preface , the outline of the contents , and some of the text .

		It appears , even in prospect , to be an extraordinarily in - teresting attempt .

		Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	has encountered difficulties .

		`` The new circumstances under which we are placed , '' wrote
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	to
John Waldo	PERSON	in
1813	DATE	, `` call for new words , new phrases , and for the transfer of old words to new objects .

		An American dialect will therefore be formed . ''

		During the century that has elapsed since this was written , intercommunication , as it has developed under modern technology , has weakened the strongest assumption on which this prophecy was based .

		But , as Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	says , one of his most serious difficulties was in the ef - forts made by nearly all the writers on the sub - ject to prove `` that no such thing as an American variety of English existed that the differences I constantly encountered in English and that my English friends encountered in American were chiefly imaginary , and to be explained away by denying them . ''

		That , when it is not un - conscious provincialism , is flatly untrue .

		There are obvious differences , as in intonation -LRB- where Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	thinks the advantage is with the English -RRB- , as in spelling -LRB- where Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	thinks the advantage is with us -RRB- , as in grammati - cal idiosyncrasies , as in localisms of all kinds , as in our peculiar euphemisms and forbidden words , as in our abbreviations and special uses of the verb .

		The influence of
Webster	PERSON	can not be ig - nored .

		Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	does not pretend to be a scientific philologist , yet he is quite right in mak - ing no apology for his work .

		The texture of our living speech , whether destined ultimately to dominate or be absorbed by English usage , is to - day definitely divergent from the mother tongue .

		And up to this present attempt of Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	's no sketch has been made of it .

		The only contri - butions philologists have so far made to the study are three or four inadequate and frankly incomplete dictionaries of `` Americanisms . ''

		On American grammar not a book has been written .

		On American spelling and pronunciation Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	could discover only a few fugitive magazine articles .

		Is it not curious that this book , the first of its kind , should be appearing today when in so many other directions we are becoming nationalistically self-conscious ?

		THE EFFECTS OF THE PAPER SHORTAGE ARE not altogether desolating .

		In our last issue Mr.
Shanks	PERSON	noted that , in
England	LOCATION	at least , it is pre - venting or postponing the publication of long novels .

		Among us it is already taking the course which has reduced the foreign newspaper to a manageable bulk : we may yet get a newspaper which we can actually read during breakfast .

		Now one of the book publishers announces that he is cutting down his `` literary items '' seventy-five per cent .

		The `` canned review , '' the ready-made `` blurb , '' the inconsequential gossip about authors will scarcely survive so drastic a revolution if it should become general , as present conditions in - dicate it will .

		THE DIAL will not be sorry .

		Its `` Notes and News '' column has long tried to sal - vage from the flood of waste paper that sweeps through its offices what bits of information about forthcoming books are of real interest to the in - telligent reader , and any diminution of small talk and puff is calculated to make that service easier to perform .

		Moreover there is the hope that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, in its own good time , will follow fashion where it has ignored petition and so far abate the flow of printed matter that an editor can once more read his morning mail before lunch . ''

		!

		T -LSB- INTERVENTION IN
RUSSIA	LOCATION	-RSB- is A MAD PROJ - ect and we can only hope that President
Wilson	PERSON	, if he could not resist its inception , may at least be able in some degree to restrict its development . ''

		So writes the
Manchester	ORGANIZATION	`` Guardian '' in its issue of
August 5	DATE	.

		For the benefit of our English contemporary we must affirm that the liberal opinion of this country is divided .

		However ; many of the well-informed believe President
Wilson	PERSON	does intend rigidly to restrict the Russian policy , and that it was action taken , as the axiom has it , lest worse befall us .

		The reasoning is : better limited intervention with American partici - pation than unlimited intervention without .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
September 5	DATE	COMMUNICATION A WORD OF ADVICE ABOUT POLICY -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL -RRB- The very mention of the Revolutionary fathers has become a suspicious matter nowadays , simply because professional pro-Kaiserites like
Viereck	PERSON	used them to suggest we should hate
England	LOCATION	, or should continue to back the most treasonous of the Irish .

		There the discussion stopped .

		There was none of the real American spirit in the approach .

		Let us take it up again , avoiding anti-Britishism .

		Let us look upon the discussion remembering
Burke	PERSON	in his orations on conciliation .

		The step after this is more difficult .

		Yet I hold it is essential to a present-day American policy , such a policy as I hope you may be having in mind in regard to internationalism and radicalism .

		I suggest that you study the real mood and tense of the Sons of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, the Daughters of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, and kindred American societies .

		Their traditions are precious to some of the most liberal and fire-eating as well as to some of the most conservative people of
America	LOCATION	.

		The valuable papers read before these societies , the monu - ments and tablets set up , the family traditions told to a few , hold precedents for an absolutely non - Germanic , non-Marxian internationalism and radi - calism .

		These precedents meet every channel of precedent in the American mind and the Demo - cratic and Republican parties , and yet are not dis - gustingly Anglo-Saxon .

		I have reached the point where as a formerly avowed voter of the Socialist ticket in
America	LOCATION	, the very mention of the Socialist party gives me a nausea almost physical .

		The
St. Louis Platform	LOCATION	has cured me for all time , I presume , of all German importations of this sort .

		The writers of that platform , and of the list of platforms that preceded it , are so hyphenated that hardly one of them can speak plain schoolboy English .

		When they are before a crowd the stupidest child can detect their foreign accent , and they themselves appear to be always somewhere east of the
Rhine	LOCATION	.

		None of them show symptoms of having attended an Ameri - can public school through so much as the sixth grade .

		They are apt to give the impression of having crammed
Marx	PERSON	in some university of Zenda or Swat heavy with outlandish philosophies which have as little to do with the American mind as primitive Chinese picture writing .

		Let us begin at the other end .

		Let us listen to what the Sons and the Daughters of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	have to say .

		It will be easier to make the kind of internationalists the world needs out of the sons and daughters of these houses than to reconstruct the impossibilist soreheads who parrot the treason of the
St. Louis Platform	LOCATION	and make it a litany of their saints .

		There are a plenty of Jeffersonians among the old Americans , or people of the spirit of the
Adams	PERSON	clan .

		The letters of
Jefferson	PERSON	are still waiting to be read by the American people , who have thought to follow him for these hundred years .

		We are facing a re - construction period in the world that parallels the history of
America	LOCATION	between the close of the Revolutionary War and the establishment of the Constitution .

		We are seeking a Constitution of the World .

		The Federalist papers have far more for us this hour than any platform written by any breed of Marxian .

		By what magic was
Virginia	LOCATION	induced to restrain herself to two senators , and let
Rhode Island	LOCATION	have two ?

		Taking the world around , we have fifty Virginias and fifty
Rhode Islands	LOCATION	trying to come to a similar agreement at this moment , and the spirit of the times is to give the little
Rhode Islands	LOCATION	all possible chance , because so often they represent not only a geographical unit but an immemorial tiny race .

		Let us see that every
Rhode Island	LOCATION	has two senators like every
Virginia	LOCATION	... Our destined leaders ought to be the boys and girls now eighteen years of age , sons and daughters of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, and as fine fire eaters as the world holds .

		Sophomores , Juniors , and Seniors do not allow the Freshmen to run the social life of the colleges and I protest against people who are not born on this soil arrogating to themselves al !

		radical leadership .

		The principle that keeps such people out of the presidency ought to be extended to the soapboxes .

		The greatest objection to Marxian internationalism as interpreted by such documents as the Socialist party has sent forth , is that it tries to unify by destroying boundaries .

		By the same sign there would be no line between
Indiana	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		By the same sign they would put a watch together by melting it into a lump ... The simple constructive way to eliminate the hyphenated revolutionary is by
American Revolu	ORGANIZATION	- tionary anecdote , carefully and correctly told , in a way that will appeal to all hot-blooded Americans .

		We go by precedent , not by philosophy .

		Prac - tically every detail of large constructive work in the world-federation we have ahead of us was worked out in miniature on this soil .

		AU we need for refresh - ment is the exact episode The Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution have accumulated these stories by the thousand , printed and unprinted , and have not the least notion how useful they are right now .

		If THE DIAL simply makes itself their re-write man , it may make over the most conservative families in
America	LOCATION	!

		... The American system as it stands , ruthlessly applied , would eliminate classes , and we would have no class war , no anything that could be so mis - described .

		All
America	LOCATION	would be upper middle class at once , by comparison with the rest of the world , if the total of our private citizens used the pick and shovel as the drafted men do in camp and used the ballot in the same way .

		Which is nothing more than old-fashioned Americanism .

		Any Amer - ican who pushes his own lawn mower abolishes the class war , and the majority of them , Democrats or Republicans , do push their own lawn mowers , and hate kings , and multimillionaires , and expect in time to abolish kings and multimillionaires .

		This they will do , not in the name of the `` proletariat / but of the all conquering , all absorbing American aristocracy of the lawn mower , the ``
Saturday	DATE	Even - ing Post , '' and the
Ford	ORGANIZATION	automobile .

		GINN AND COMPANY
Boston New York Chicago London Atlanta Dallas Columbus San Francisco BRIEFER	ORGANIZATION	MENTION The introduction to the new edition , revised and amplified , of
Madison Grant	PERSON	's `` Passing of the Great Race '' -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- informs us that the book is `` devoted to an attempt to elucidate the meaning of history in terms of race . ''

		The major argument of the book runs somewhat as follows : the best chance for cultural progress is through the preservation of superior races , since heredity is a more persistent and powerful influence than environment ; the race of of greatest capacity for cultural progress is the Nor - dic ; and because the history of
Europe	LOCATION	generally , and the trend towards democracy in recent years in particular , have led to the mixing of races and threaten to bring about the disappearance of the Nordic race , history generally and recent history especially has been a great mistake and ought not to have been allowed to occur .

		The truth would seem to be that the book is not in any real sense an elucidation of history in terms of race .

		It is rather a discussion of European races , in the course of which certain facts of history are made use of for purposes of illustration .

		`` American Negro Slavery , '' by Professor
Ulrich B. Phillips	PERSON	-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- tells , so the publishers inform us , `` in a very spirited and popular manner the entire story '' of Negro slavery in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		And large as this order may seem , the book really fills it .

		Beginning with the early exploitation of
Guinea	LOCATION	, the narrative traces the slave trade in this country , various statutory enactments regard - ing the Negro , the management of Southern planta - tions , the conditions of life there for both blacks and whites , the Westward movement , business aspects of slavery , slavery in towns , the status and the anomalies of the free Negro , and so on .

		Professor
Phillips	PERSON	was prepared for his task by residence as a boy on a Southern post-bellum plantation and later by tenure of a professorship of history in a Northern university ; thus he enjoys intimacy with certain parts of his subject , and at the same time outlook and detachment .

		His investigations have extended over a long period of years and have gone beyond courts and legislatures into `` the letters , journals , and miscellaneous records of private per - sons . ''

		The reader will not find a more detailed account of the tobacco , rice , cotton , and sugar plantations , or of the human side of slavery .

		Nor will he find , in this day of perplexing readjustments , so full and sure a portrayal of the past upon which one of these readjustments must be built .

		Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have issued a revised edition of
A. J. Grant	PERSON	's `` History of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
$ 2.75	MONEY	-RRB- which includes six new chapters , four of which deal with the history of
England	LOCATION	and two with the history of
Europe	LOCATION	since
1871	DATE	.

		These additions bring the volume up to 750 pages a history of
Europe	LOCATION	from Homer to Hindenburg in about 300,000 words .

		The narrative is on the whole clear , accurate , and readable as readable as a manual can well be .

		In the matter of proportion Professor Grant concedes less to the most recent era than would most French and American historians especially since the war .

		No more than a hundred pages are given to the period since
1815	DATE	, and no more than 31 pages to the period since
1871	DATE	.

		This is no doubt partly due to
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 179 the fact that the present volume is a revision of a book written some time ago ; but no history of
Europe	LOCATION	professing to come down to
1914	DATE	can be satisfactory which gives so little space relatively to our own age .


Claude Tillier	PERSON	's `` My Uncle Benjamin '' -LRB-
Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	; # 1.60 -RRB- is the man , rare in literature as in life , who has attained the distinction of knowing how to live .

		He is an epicure whose tavern debts are paid with a kiss , whose gentle blasphemy is innocent rather than vicious , whose bravado and whose mishaps are a constant source of delight .

		He is even less sophisticated than `` G. B. S. , '' not so subtle as
Coignard	ORGANIZATION	, the Philosopher in `` The Crock of Gold '' ; nevertheless no critic of men and manners is more trenchant and humorous at once than
Uncle Benjamin	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is one of the French classics of humor of a type , speaking generally , whose only American exponent has been
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		It is here well translated by
Adele Seltzer	ORGANIZATION	and published in an unusually attractive edition , with illustrations in black and white by
Emil Preetorius	PERSON	.

		No com - bination could prove more ideal .

		As exemplified in his posters , his cover designs , and his various illustrations , Preetorious has ever displayed a sense of the ludicrous , the humorous , and the satiric .

		Unfortunately clay intended for the thumb of the professional sometimes falls into the hands of a fervent dabbler .

		The result is amazing , `` but is it art ? ''

		In ``
Potter	PERSON	's Clay , '' by
Marie Tudor	PERSON	-LRB- Put - nam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , one has the merest fragments of a finished piece , conventional bas-relief of flowers and ferns half-erased by a careless finger , efforts at the new art that are hopelessly incomplete .

		Briefly , this is a book of verse which under an out - worn title parades a strange but not unusual group of poems .

		The author has evidently come to the conclusion that free verse is now respectable , and she pays it her devoirs .

		Her bow however is a trifle awkward ; she still remembers how long she has ignored the newcomer .

		Mr.
Liveing	PERSON	, author of `` Attack '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	; 75 cts . -RRB-

		, is a methodical , dignified young English - man who tells us with a wealth of circumstantial detail about an attack in which he participated upon the fortified village of Gommecourt in
July , 1916	DATE	.

		His story , which of itself is interesting , is told with commendable straightforwardness and absence of straining for style .

		Still Mr.
Liveing	PERSON	is a little too conscientious , a little too orderly .

		His thoughts and emotions under fire are described at mathe - matically precise intervals , carefully spaced between very striking descriptions of the battle itself .

		And again , who but an Englishman would refer to his fellow officers and men as `` Captain W t , '' `` S , '' `` Sergeant S 1 , '' `` Sergeant S r , '' `` W k '' ?

		Discre - tion passes into absurdity when the author refers to himself as `` L '' !

		In `` How to Sell More Goods '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB-
H. J. Barrett	PERSON	has brought together in the form of narratives by various salesmen the secrets of success - ful salesmanship as revealed by actual experience .

		The book has thus a human quality and should be of interest not only to the drummer , the clerk , and the sales manager , but to the general reader as well , because most men have something to sell in the form of goods or services .

		The thesis of the book that salesmanship is an art to be learned by imita - tion is well defended .

		THE DIAL 3ournai of Criticism ana Discussion of Eittramrt and ClK JRrts Poilu , What Are You Fighting For ?

		i .

		What arc you fighting for ?

		u You are fighting for this and for that !

		No , for that ! ''

		cry some .

		`` You are fighting for nothing , '' whisper others .

		You are fighting for something which is not what many are trying to promulgate .

		You are fighting for justice , for the libera - tion of man , and for that alone .

		We must make intelligible to you the reasons for your sacrifice and your suffer - ings .

		You have the right to know ; it is our duty to speak .

		We must give you this explanation , to you who give up your life ; and the cries of the wounded and the wail - ing of the mutilated also demand a reply worthy of their misery ; and , furthermore , we owe it to the silent and exacting faces of the dead .

		But in order to know , you must make a personal effort , not only with your intelli - gence but with ypur will .

		The light which you need is not a sensational revelation from without .

		It comes from within .

		Truth is within you : it is in your mind and your conscience .

		You must disentangle it there help yourself .

		You were born and you have grown up in a world where ideas , notions , and principles are confused .

		You hear them buzzing ; you see them twine about you .

		In this forest search for what is evident , absolute , and firm ; and of all truths seek for the greatest and the purest , those whence the others flow .

		Thoughts , impulses , sentiments , beliefs , faith take each of these moral springs , examine it , scrutinize it , verify its authenticity .

		Trace back , with your intelligence with your own intelligence , mind you the effects to the causes , and go on from principle to principle until you reach what is indisput - able and forces itself upon you .

		Make a fresh survey of yourself and of others .

		Begin again , if necessary , with a magnifi - cent integrity .

		This criticism is the noblest of all achievements that our minds are capable of accomplishing here below .

		The great - est thinkers have thus begun their tasks .

		We can undertake it without any phrases and without any philosophical formula ; : sincerity and an upright and clear mind are alone necessary .

		Your mind , O Poilu , is upright and clear .

		Go and commune with yourself .

		In the abstract chaos which surrounds you you will find acquired notions .

		They do not arise from your very heart ; you have accepted them through docility .

		You believe in them because people have told you to believe in them in the past and in the present .

		Their only authority , their only proof , is that they have existed .

		This is not a sufficient reason .

		Free yourself of the so-called truths which , im - palpable by themselves , are imposed upon you like a kind of heritage .

		Be not im - pressed by the names which disguise these great or petty prejudices , or by the stately pomp which adorns them .

		`` Traditions , '' you will be told .

		`` They are the sacred traditions , the national traditions , '' they will add .

		Thrust them aside if the ' y are sheer tra - ditions , even if you have formerly wor - shiped them .

		They are senseless and deadly words .

		Progress is the power we have to free ourselves from those tempta - tions .

		Slavery , bondage , and torture were in the national traditions of the nations which have abolished them .

		Revolt against the submissive , the blind , the deaf and dumb obedience of the past .

		Do not accept that command which directs you to turn your back upon the future and retro - grade .

		Learn to hate the word `` tradi - tion '' ; some day you will understand that it is the deadly disease of society .

		You will find in your inmost heart latent instincts which agitate you and wish at 198 THE DIAJL , -LSB-
September 19	DATE	times to drive you along a certain path .

		Distrust the prestige that we willingly grant to our instincts .

		The sophists make great use of them .

		But all the low in - stincts of barbarity are dormant within us .

		Hatred , envy , murder , and plunder are hidden away in the depths of the most civilized souls .

		Attempts will be made to transform in your eyes , for the needs of the cause , some of these deceptive figments into holy and respectable symbols , pre - viously transmitted by the generations whence you come and which suggest to you the path to be followed .

		Tear yourself away from this trap .

		Besides , the passion and love for an idea must be born of the idea , and never the idea of the passion .

		You will hear resound within you the echoes of big words .

		Beware of big words .

		They sometimes give shelter , in a dazzling and noisy way , either to bad in - stincts or to bad prejudices .

		Distrust also what is written ; do not believe improved words .

		Be the judge of what you read and of what you hear .

		Distrust politicians ; distrust learned specialists , and minute his - torians , and the votaries of documents hypnotized by hobbies for particular cases , and lawyers , and diplomats , and in gen - eral all those who compile isolated facts .

		Judge events only according to their ultimate consequences .

		Distrust immedi - ate advantages which hide future disad - vantages , and immediate objects , and everything that is seen closely .

		Think of what you still do not see , and even of what you will perhaps never see !

		Distrust people .

		We have a tendency to associate a doctrine , with a man whether it be a man of whom we hear others speak or some one close by whom we know and the doctrine is strongly colored by the sympathy or the reprobation that this person inspires , or else by his talent , and even by his mediocrity and ig - norance .

		It is a shortcoming of reason .

		Mind you avoid it .

		Distinguish always , always , between men and their ideas .

		When you have achieved this task of reflecting upon facts , arguments , theses , systems , thrusting aside everything that seems to you doubtful and ill-founded , you will attain that grand and simple thing which is the bed rock of everything else .

		The supreme underlying principle which we can not transgress without lying or de - ceiving is the moral law .

		II .

		You will be told that this moral law is not primordial , that it emanates from di - vine law and religious faith .

		This is not true .

		It is religion , or rather the disunited and whimsical family of religions , which emanate from the moral law and they only resemble one another through what they have in common with it .

		The moral law is in an absolute and per - fect way the law of general interest ; more precisely , it is the law of human grouping in all its extent and infinity .

		It implies al - ways and everywhere , under diverse forms , the sacrifice of the individual to society .

		Its necessity and its form are confused in some degree with its reality .

		It is self - sufficient .

		It has been enforced by certain so-called `` revealed '' truths in order to impose upon childlike peoples and the children of the people .

		This theatrical subterfuge , as - suming that it was useful to humanity at certain periods , is no longer admissible to - day .

		You will still hear people say , `` The masses must have a religion . ''

		Thrust aside this blasphemy against truth .

		No , religion is not necessary .

		Even though religions are not destroyed when examined by an uncontaminated mind , be - cause of their multiplicity and their recip - rocal hostility it is dangerous to give them a voice in the conduct of man , for they are absurd and disputable , and what is grounded on them is imperiled and threat - ened by their frailty .

		The religions also present another dan - ger .

		Very pure in their historic beginning , when '' they sprang forth from the hearts and minds of their sublime founders , they have in the end changed completely in the hands of their priests ; they have become the tools of a very definite social propa - ganda ; they have changed into political parties with characteristic policies .

		Look about you , everywhere .

		Read two opposed journals ; listen to two speakers .

		You will observe that the religious party is always ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 199 without any exception , with the block of reaction and retrogression for the simple reason that religion lives on authority and not on enlightenment : blind acquiescence and bondage , which she calls `` order , '' must needs maintain her position ; besides , her representatives have a personal interest to watch over the temporal privileges and advantages that are contrary to the libera - tion of the masses .

		It is thus , after having swept from your mind all kinds of artificial dogmas and fragments of dogmas deposited in you , the unfounded affirmations that a long im - punity rendered venerable , or that indiffer - ence , mechanical imitation , laziness of mind , or timidity permitted to vegetate , that you attain the undefiled moral law .

		Stick to this magnificent ideal .

		Do not swerve from it .

		Make it your dream , your fancy , your passion .

		You will no longer be able to err ; you are on the path of truth .

		As a reward for your intellectual loyalty it must be constant and active you will see the great eternal axioms unfold them - selves clearly , and the notion of justice will appear to you as beautiful as the light of day .

		You will see and feel that it is ab - surd , in the light of the moral law , to pre - tend that one man has more rights than another , to attribute to birth a privilege of domination ; and you will see how wrong it is to impose upon the world petty interests that is , personal interests , or those of a small class to the detriment of a larger class , and a fortiori to the detriment of the whole of society .

		You will ascertain that , if it is necessary and divine to be just , it is just to say that all men are equal before the social law , that they all have the right to participate in the government of a society to which they have bound their destiny by a kind of contract .

		You will know that in spite of the sophistry of the ignorant , or the apish - ness of the pedants , or the bawling of the liars and antics , or the maneuvers of the hypocritical pettifoggers who put aside the main issue and embrace indirect questions and points of detail you will know that universal suffrage is the only truly just form of government , and moreover that all nations are so many individuals having an equal right to live .

		And from all this there will emerge the vision of the re - public ; then of a great republic composed of all the others .

		III .

		There was a time when this ideal was only to be found in some individual con - sciences lost in the darkness and error of the social rest .

		Now it is no longer thus .

		The triumph of moral and social truth is being realized with a kind of fatality .

		A universal light is dawning .

		The people are getting rid of old regimes which lived on them and laid them waste .

		There is no longer in this world a single personal and absolute power .

		The impetus of demoli - tion imparted by the French Revolution , the magnificent and ineffaceable glory of our country , continues as the men with open eyes become more and more numer - ous .

		We no longer want those obscurely accepted tyrannies where thought was sub - merged for ages and ages .

		The world is eradicating its errors ; it is growing sound .

		Everywhere man is astounded , then wear - ied , then angered , for having so long stupidly upheld without realizing it ideas with no particle of truth in them .

		Well , great forces had begun to set up against the progress which was taking pos - session of the world .

		The most irreducible one was the imperialism and nationalism quartered in the heart of
Europe	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	wanted to secure the material power of world-wide empire .

		This pre - tention is contrary to eternal law , and in - admissible .

		Before the invader and his appalling doctrine you have set up your barricade and your bosom .

		Your cause is just and holy .

		You are fighting against nationalism which is the egotism of a nation run wild .

		But , hold !

		Nationalism is raging every - where .

		Not only does it exist in the lair you are storming now , and where , indeed , it is in the clutches of a preponderant caste and has the power of law , but it is also all around you .

		It is not exclusive to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It also has crept into
France	LOCATION	less official and feudal , and more scattered , indeed , but yet alive , fierce , sinister , captious , and hypo - 200 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 19	DATE	critical , having gathered and jumbled to - gether all our prejudices and all our blus - tering phrases .

		It attempts to bereave you once more of your liberty , your mind , and your heart by all the artifices of the past , pranked out in new formulae , by which per - haps you yourself , in former days when you did not deign to reflect and look into the heart of things , were beguiled by some catchword or other .

		This nation - alism is now becoming more complicated , more complete , in accordance with the un - bridled rage of logic and militarism .

		Unravel this entanglement and cut the knots .

		Repeat to yourself this common - sense view : French nationalism is not worth more than pan-Germanism and all the `` pans '' in the world .

		Lay low German militarism , not in order to substitute your own , or to destroy
Germany	LOCATION	, but in order to do away with militarism .

		You are the liberator who kills the tyrant in order to kill tyranny .

		You are not the assassin who kills in order to take the tyrant 's place .

		To the revolting and oppressive cry of `` Deutschland euber alles '' you must reply by saying , `` No ! ''

		and not by bawling ``
France	LOCATION	d'abord ! ''

		These two cries equally tear asunder the commandment of human solidarity and authorize all the other peoples to spread , from their corners , the same clamor of disorder the world over .

		They are im - moral , therefore socially absurd and in - capable of enduring .

		They mean per - petual war , an increasing avalanche of ruins , and the disappearance of mankind in the charnel house .

		Poilu , love
France	LOCATION	as you do your mother .

		Wish her great , noble , rick and prosperous .

		But do not place her above justice and the moral law .

		You have no more right to bawl to the world , ``
France	LOCATION	d'abord ! ''

		than to proclaim `` Moi d'abord ! ''

		or `` Les miens d'abord ! ''

		Remember : all men are equal , and all nations are equal .

		It may come to pass that the interest of a powerful country is to act in disaccord with justice ; but , in reality , we have not even an interest in violating the primordial com - mandment : the advantage acquired by these means is short-lived .

		This love you have for your country with all its noble , great , and beautiful treasures , you will serve better and more efficaciously be - cause more lastingly by making her the champion of law and justice and of the divine equality of mankind .

		Justice above everything else .

		Those who are on the other side I do not speak only of the other side of the border will challenge your saying that you love
France	LOCATION	.

		They pretend to monop - olize patriotism in behalf of their narrow , paltry , Utopian , and anarchic programme .

		But with regard to treating outrageously as `` men without a country '' those who are honest , logical , and matter-of-fact , those who realize that all progress in labor , science , and art , in the prosperity and well - being of the living , must be based on a com - plete international solidarity no !

		You will laugh at the jumbling of hollow phrases , but you will rise against these falsifiers .

		This is what you are fighting for ,
Poilu	ORGANIZATION	.

		For a magnificent booty : not the one you put into your pocket or that you take from corpses ; not either for a wretched premium or gratuity , or for plunder and conquest , or for a crime that is not excusable be - cause the epithet `` collective '' is pinned to it .

		No !

		you are fighting for justice , good - ness , and beauty , and in fine for labor and the happiness and prosperity of all .

		Ever uphold and maintain this ideal .

		You have the right to have and manifest your opinion in the immense tragedy where you have paid for your place .

		It is a holy task for the writers to tell you what you are fighting for .

		What you have fought for , O invincible people you very soon will shout it , rising undivided .

		1918 -RSB- THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, 201
James Joyce Stephen Dedalus	PERSON	, the hero of `` A Por - trait of the Artist as a Young Man , '' de - sires to try out all possible means of ex - pression .

		Whether or not the somewhat scattered personality of this hero be a child wholly after his father 's heart , at any rate Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	himself is publicly try - ing out his own mettle in the short story , the novel , the Elizabethan lyric , and the Ibsenesque drama .

		The most recent of his publications in this country is `` Exiles , '' a prose play in three acts .

		The scene is laid in the suburbs of
Dublin	LOCATION	and the im - portant characters are of the upper class .

		The play appears to be intended to illus - trate a problem and perhaps to throw light upon it ; the question however is so intri - cate that I for one am quite unable to fol - low even the speeches of the characters , still less to fathom the author 's own in - tention or conclusion .

		The problem is the seasoned one of marriage and freedom , but just what takes place and why and what the upshot of it all is does not emerge from the emotional scenes and the final disin - tegration of the protagonist .

		On the stage , which stops for no man , this drama would be an impregnable puzzle ; and even when it is held fast o * n the printed page , hope - lessly conflicting solutions vie with one another .

		Next time Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	would do well to try his hand at exegesis and to take this play as his subject .

		`` Chamber Music '' is all but the in - tensely contemporary and distinguished final poem a remarkably perfect echo of the best in early seventeenth century prosody .

		These little songs are so inti - mately alluring that no one but a school - master would cavil at their harping upon one note , and that the secular one of court - eous-mannered love .

		And I but render and confess The malice of thy tenderness disarms all strictures that might be made upon the futility of repeating an already deviously explored manner .

		After all , when we see a beautiful face we do not savor it the less because we have loved one like it before .

		Indeed in the case of these lyrics our reminiscence of earlier pipings does but enhance our pleasure : it is good to know that a mind so crammed with the impertinences of modern city life as the creator of `` Dubliners '' can yet achieve the liquid grace of a less handicapped age .

		This collection of short stories published under the title `` Dubliners '' is certainly Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	's finest piece of work ; indeed I should not know where to go for their bet - ters .

		The title is a very appropriate one , for these stories are not so much narra - tives of events as they are evolvements of character .

		To be sure , these people of
Joyce	PERSON	are not painted as standing still for our perusal of their complicated linea - ments ; they are caught , so to speak , on the wing , and the portrait is the more suc - cessful for this fact .

		In the changing light and shadow of their veering flight we are able to look them over pretty thoroughly , and Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	sees to it that we look to the right place at the right time .

		Judged from
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's point of view , the vague plots of these stories are so unsymmetrical as to be definite malformations : they are the hunchbacks of fiction .

		Yet the sparse incidents that make them up are casual only in their relations to each other and to the rest of incidental , practical life ; they are uncannily indicative , even ratiocinative , when rightly taken for what they are media for the expression of character .

		There is therefore almost no plot tension ; and however much we may sympa - thize with certain of the characters , curi - osity as to the outcome of the predicament is scarcely awakened .

		As in some dreams , we ourselves are unaccountably detached not only from the incidents narrated but also from practical interest of every kind .

		With an hypnotic attention we perceive these characters evolve and our whole will is so strangely absorbed in their contempla - tion that otherwise we neither wonder nor desire .

September 19	DATE	railing of the pier , her soul at odds , unable to move , we do not question what the out - come will be , far less do we wish upon her the happiness of either going or staying ; like her we are wholly passive .

		This does not mean that our emotions are unmoved .

		On the contrary , our hearts as well as our minds are roused to an unusual tense activ - ity .

		Controlled by the genius of Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	, the short story is an art not less pure than music : we do not ask how the piece will end , still less that it should end sunnily ; that our emotions and our imaginations are so proudly stirred gives us a profound content .

		The people of Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	are for the most part not less casual than the tales in which they figure .

		More obviously flotsam even than the majority of mankind , they are yet almost at home on the shifting , contradictory currents of their life .

		Casual in soul , they are casual too in manners and in dress .

		They sidle through the stale streets , and they wear yachting caps , and those pushed far back .

		They are not markedly discontented in their element , and like fishes in the yellow waters of an ill-kept aquarium they gravely drift before us .

		They exhibit now one side , now the other , and with a sad shamelessness they keep back nothing .

		At the last we are re - minded that they are not fishes : we are aware of their body smells .

		The `` Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man '' is , paradoxically , less a portrait than these stories in `` Dubliners . ''

		Ostensibly and successfully the biography of a young man of sensitive imagination bent upon the difficult career of letters , it is yet primarily a cross-section of contemporary Irish mid - dle-class life .

		When the boy is at home , it is so overpoweringly an Irish one that we almost forget home and boy together in the glory of this immense gulp of Celtic domesticity .

		When fate submits poor
Stephen	PERSON	to the smooth , disagreeable ma - chinery of boarding-school , the pallid boy is easily lost sight of against the highly coloured Jesuitical background .

		Even in the latter half of the - book , where the harsh insistence of sex replaces the home and school interest , we almost forget the patient , so intent are we upon this catas - trophic disease of puberty .

		We who had first read `` Dubliners '' smiled at Mr.
Huebsch	PERSON	's advertisement on the wrapper of the `` Portrait '' : we looked for better things from
James Joyce	PERSON	than an `` account which would enable us to understand the forces social , political , religious that animate
Ireland	LOCATION	today . ''

		We said to our - selves , `` There are some shopmen who would advertise
Keats	PERSON	's ` Hyperion ' as to be read for tips on real estate in a select vale . ''

		After we have read this book we feel the publisher was not without shreds of justification .

		Although it is the relig - ious passages , rising in the middle of the book to so shrill a pitch , which convince us least and to which indeed we remain the cold students Mr.
Huebsch	PERSON	addresses , nevertheless the preacher 's exhortation is so well reproduced that , scoffers as we are , we yet do fall half in love with this brilliant hell , and feel once again that at any rate as an aesthetic phenomenon the concept is quite justifiable .

		This particular passage is also interest - ing as an example of what good old pitch - fork rhetoric Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	can on occasion throw .

		For in his prose style the intelli - gent Irishman is not less protean than in his flirtings among literary genres .

		Beside this God-given buncombe of the priest , there is the pre-prandial conversation in the Dedalus household , so delicately reminiscent of
Thackeray	PERSON	, and most every - where else in the novel , as in all of `` Dub - liners , '' that singular , spare , athletic phraseology which is perhaps the most dis - tinguished achievement of this author .

		While the limber quality of
Joyce	PERSON	's speech is most peculiarly apposite in dialogue , yet his clear , nervous language is not less well illustrated by a paragraph in which De - dalus , whom we may surely take at least here as the mouthpiece of our author , re - flects to himself upon his enforced use of our Anglo-Saxon tongue : The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine .

		How different are the words home ,
Christ	LOCATION	, ale , master , on his lips and on mine !

		I can - not speak or write these words without unrest of spirit .

		His language , so familiar and so foreign , will always be for me an acquired speech .

		I have not made or accepted its words .

		My voice holds them at bay .

		My soul frets in the shadow of his language .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL , 203 Reading these lithe sentences it is not easy to commiserate with so gifted an alien .

		The last pages of the `` Portrait '' are in the form of a diary and written in a style jotty and spasmodic .

		If we look back we find something similar in the paragraphs picturing the sensations and thoughts of the boy
Stephen	PERSON	ill in the school infirmary : The face and the voice went away .

		Sorry because he was afraid .

		Afraid that it was some disease .

		Canker was a disease of plants and cancer one of animals : or another different .

		That was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening light , creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line , a heavy bird flying low through the grey light .


Leicester Abbey	ORGANIZATION	lit up .

		Wolsey died there .

		The abbots buried him themselves .

		This style , suggestive fancifully at least of pointillist painting , is a perfect expression of the mood of the sick boy .

		But a novel written in this jerky way becomes very tir - ing , and that seems to be the case with Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	's `` Ulysses , '' now appearing in `` The Little Review . ''

		It has something in common with not a few of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's prose passages .

		But while the poet is in - clined to employ this disconnected utter - ance only for brief intervals set off between the smooth periods of his verse ,
Joyce	PERSON	now makes of it a narrative style .

		This is not , however , perverse .

		For
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's characters are of course speaking aloud , and naturally , except in rare instances of madmen and women who keep inns , speak connectedly ; while
Joyce	PERSON	's novel is really a long inward soliloquy broken only by hap - hazard small talk .

		After comparing
Joyce	PERSON	to impressionist writers like
Flaubert	PERSON	,
Ezra Pound	PERSON	in his `` Pavannes and Divisions '' finds `` that he excels most of the impressionist writers be - cause of his more rigorous selection , be - cause of his exclusion of all unnecessary detail . ''

		This is true of `` Dubliners , '' where each story is an imaginative entity , but in `` Ulysses ''
Joyce	PERSON	is no longer an im - pressionist in the same way as
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		The great Frenchman did his best to depict things as he saw them , and that is all the word `` impressionist , '' at least in literature , heretofore implied .

		Joyce has become im - pressionist in a much more subtle sense .

		He gives us , especially in `` Ulysses , '' the streaming impressions , often only subcon - sciously cognate to one another , of our habitual life that vague , tepid river of consciousness to which only our ephemeral moments of real will or appetite can give coherence .

		Joyce succeeds in this under - taking to a remarkable degree .

		The chief fault of this method is its jerkiness , pecu - liarly inapt to interpret the calm flow of our sensations merging so noiselessly one into another .

		Some of us feel it a pity that he who could write the strangely sinuous final pages of `` The Dead '' should now have adopted so different a medium .

		But there is a time for all things .

		The
Ireland	LOCATION	of this `` Dubliners '' is a long shot from the land of legend and of poetry ; for
Joyce	PERSON	, despite his own verses , is persistently occupied with such muddy raptures as in this life we do attain .

		The creation of which he is author has gold in its teeth and walks not so much on feet as in decayed sport shoes .

		It is a world of battered derbies and bleared souls , where if there be gallants at all they are of the sort who wait outside areaways for the sovereigns of amorous housemaids .

		Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	exhibits the cynicism of a fine nature habituated but not subdued to the sordidity of our industrial civilization , and his pictures are too acrid not to persuade us of their truth .

		In the end we come un - comfortably near feeling that human life itself may be insolvent .

September 19	DATE	Our
London	LOCATION	Letter It is now over three years since
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	died in the French hospital ship in the
Levant	LOCATION	; and after many delays a collected edition of his poems , preceded by a long memoir by Mr.
Ed	PERSON	- ward
Marsh	PERSON	-LRB-
Sidgwick & Jackson	ORGANIZATION	; 10/6 -RRB- , has at last been produced .

		On such an occasion it would be natural to attempt some estimate of his permanent poetic value ; but I notice that with hardly any exceptions our reviewers have rather conspicuously shirked this .

		I suspect that the general belief in his greatness , even his potential greatness , as a poet is rather waning ; but that no one is particularly anxious to say so .

		If I am right and this hesitation really exists , it is a pity and it should be removed .

		For , on the one hand , it implies no disrespect to
Brooke	PERSON	to say that criticism lost its head at his death and proclaimed him greater than he was .

		On the other hand , there is no real reproach to criticism in suggest - ing that it lost its head for a moment under the influence of the extraordinary beauty and com - pleteness of
Brooke	PERSON	's short life .

		For if
Brooke	PERSON	was not a great poet , not even so near greatness as his contemporary
Hecker	PERSON	, who died a few months before him , he left a memory which will preserve its charm as long as any poetry could have done .

		And when I appear to depreciate his work I do so only to exalt the man .

		In any other I should have praised those verses unreservedly .

		Indeed this difficulty was always arising with
Brooke	PERSON	, even during his life .

		Those who knew him were often a little surprised at the fuss which those who did not know him made about his poems ; and they were themselves often accused of carping unnecessarily at what the world knew best of him .

		But the truth is that
Brooke	PERSON	himself was much more remarkable than anything he ever did .

		It seemed that nature must have taken a holi - day to finish this piece of work peculiarly well , to discover what would happen to a man endowed with every possible requirement for happiness .

		It was not merely that
Brooke	PERSON	was extraordinarily good to look at , though he was .

		But his most salient quality was the beauty , the happiness , the sunniness of his temperament .

		Success and he had amazing successes ; he never really failed in anything that mattered never spoilt him .

		He was always quietly radiant with friendliness and good humor , always essentially unaffected and modest .

		But this attempt to define him with adjectives will not do .

		He was more than friendly , unaffected , or modest .

		There was some - thing positive in him which powerfully affected all who came into his neighborhood something which can not be well explained in words , but an impression of which can still be gained from the memories of those who knew him .

		It is small wonder that his friends felt him to be always on the point of turning this remarkable power into great poetry .

		What he did write gave them a good excuse for this view .

		But what was great in
Brooke	PERSON	was not a talent waiting to be applied to its proper use , but a talent which he exercised fully and properly simply in being himself .

		And Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	has now preserved this finest aspect of
Brooke	PERSON	's personality in a memoir that is really a model of its kind .

		Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	will not perhaps desire to be praised for having writ - ten an essay of independent merit , a composition that would still be read with pleasure if
Brooke	PERSON	had never been heard of or even if he had never existed .

		Indeed if he had sought this kind of triumph , if he had concerned himself with pro- ducing a piece of good and vivid writing , he would very likely never have achieved the suc - cess that he made .

		It is from his complete devotion to his subject that the merit of his memoir springs ; and he gives us not merely a record of
Brooke	PERSON	, but the most complete evidence that could be desired of the affection that
Brooke	PERSON	inspired in his friends .

		And friendship seems really to have been the main factor in his life .

		There is nothing in the world like friendship -LSB- he writes in a letter from
Fiji	LOCATION	-RSB- .

		And there is no man who has had such friends as I , so many , so fine , so various , so multiform , so prone to laughter , so strong in affection , and so permanent , so trustworthy , so courteous , so stern with vices and so blind to faults or folly , of such swiftness of mind and strength of body , so apt both to make jokes and to understand them ... Friendship is always exciting , and yet always safe .

		There is no lust in it , and therefore no poison .

		It is cleaner than love , and older ; for children and very old people have friends but they do not love .

		There is only one criticism that can be made against this passage and tha.t is that it is a little self-conscious , a little reminiscent , indeed , of the manner of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's essays .

		But
Brooke	PERSON	's self-consciousness was inevitable and was never harmful to him .

		It never made him insincere ; it only made him , at worst , express what he really felt with rather more of a flourish than was en - tirely natural to him .

		As for the reminiscences of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, that too points to a factor in
Brooke	LOCATION	's life and to one that has not yet been remarked , so far as I know .

		Brooke lay very much through the whole of his life under Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's influence and was at ne pains to hide it .

		He used in private to recite
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 205 with immense gusto scandalous unpublished poems which purported to come from the master 's pen one of these my memory still treasures , though I should blush to transscribe it here .

		And the influence is fairly obvious in the verse which
Brooke	PERSON	pinned on a packet of food left by the roadside : Two men left this bread and cake For whomever finds to take .

		He and they will soon be dead .

		Pray for them that left this bread .

		The hitherto unpublished pieces which appear in this volume ten in all , excluding the frag - ments are not of very great interest .

		But there are lines and notes for what he called `` an ode - threnody '' on
England	LOCATION	, which suggest that it might have been his finest poem .

		He himself described the line `` In Avons of the heart her rirers run '' as `` lovely , '' and probably others will agree with him .

		Again he writes : She is with all we have Ived and found and known Closed in the little nowhere of the brain .

		I confess that I am still doubtful whether
Brooke	PERSON	would ever have attained what could properly be called greatness as a poet .

		He wrote several very fine , very true poems ; and these frag - ments attest that he would have written others .

		But why should he have done more ?

		He was what he was .

		A great man who saw him once said that it really would not be fair if he could write great poetry as well .

		And that in a way is true .

		The fact that he himself had doubts as to his own poetic future proves , of course , abso - lutely nothing .

		I tried to be a poet -LSB- he writes from
Tahiti	LOCATION	-RSB- .

		And because I 'm a clever writer , and because I was forty times as sensitive as anybody else , I succeeded a little .

		Es ist voruber ; e
$ 1st	MONEY	un < wiederruflich zu Ende .

		I am what I came out here to be .

		Hard , quite , quite hard .

		I hare become merely a minor character in a Kipling story .

		I 'll never be able to write anything more , I think ; or perhaps I can do plays of a sort ... And when I last met him it was on
July 30 , 1914	DATE	he said that he was going into the country `` to write bad plays , '' unless , he added , the short - age of food caused by the European war , which we had then made up our minds to , dragged him to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, where his fellowship entitled him to free dinners .

		But all that , as I say , proves nothing .

		It was not long after that he produced the `` 1914 Sonnets . ''

		And at the end , for all one says , the thought returns may he not have been a potential great poet after all ?

		The `` caressing dream '' comes to one a poet as wonderful on paper as
Brooke	PERSON	was in the flesh ... ?

		The Impotence of American Culture LETTERS AND LEADERSHIP .

		By
Van Wyck Brooks	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Here is an attempt to assess our spiritual re - serves as they stand at the moment .

		Now , every - body knows the type of book to which such at - tempts usually lead .

		It is ingrowing .

		It is irritable and dismally self-conscious .

		It is a little priggish , I think , even when
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	writes it .

		Inevitably it fails of its purpose , which is to fill the natural man with a conviction of original sin .

		What it really fills him with is an inarticulate rage which sours finally into the obscenity that is only the vindication of his man - hood .

		Such books rest on a theory which a more humane outlook has long rendered obsolete .

		Cul - ture is exhibited as a delicate exotic , flourishing when it does flourish in a soil prepared by the decay of all our instincts and natural impulses .

		Its virtue , like that of medieval religion , lies in its power of coercing the primitive brute .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	assumes that we have outgrown all that .

		It is his distinction that he has written a book about culture that is immensely readable , pro- vocative , and sane ; and he has done it by aban - doning the type altogether .

		What he offers us is a free examination of the American mind as it is shaped by a thousand and one influences that have nothing to do with books or formal art .

		He takes us into the open where we can get rid of some of our fevers .

		On the descriptive side his book is eloquent and true .

		The physical background , which is carefully elaborated , functions doubly .

		It has all the force of a symbol , and yet it is indubitably the American scene .

		At once resplendent and mean , ample and niggardly , the thing to notice about it is that it is tragically casual in both aspects .

		Everywhere we live , whether in
New York	LOCATION	or the raw and straggling hamlets of
Maine	LOCATION	or
California	LOCATION	, we live amid the wreckage bequeathed by the pioneer and the exploiter .

		The passion for quick returns set the pace and all more humane passions were inexorably subordi - nated .

		About the huge structure we reared there is something flimsy and insubstantial , something finally irrelevant to the continuing needs of the human spirit .

		Facing a continent long since despoiled and preempted , we can no longer doubt .

		A measure of disenchantment is the price we have had to pay , here as elsewhere , for knowl - edge .

		206 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
September 19	DATE	Old American things are old as nothing else any - where in the world is old , old without majesty , old without mellowness , old without pathos , just shabby and bloodless and worn out .

		That is the feeling that comes over one in villages like this , capable only of being galvanized by some fresh current of enterprise into a semblance of animation .

		Inhabited as they have always been by a race that has never cultivated life for its own sake , a race that has lived and built and worked always conscious of the possibility of a greater advantage to be found elsewhere , there is no principle of life working in them , three hundred years of effort having bred none of the indwelling spirit of continuity .

		In the wreckage and the rawness we can trace the leavings of aborted desires that failed because they were disproportionate , the impatience of a greedy child who has not yet measured the forces that circumscribe and condition human life .

		And if we turn to the motive , this vast disorderly drama of wealth-getting and life-wasting be - comes a little incredible .

		What are we to think of that `` practical '' wisdom which was able , with - out too much inner discomfort , to leave so enor - mous and complicated a task to a single instinct ?

		True , the acquisitive instinct is a particularly tough one .

		It served , in a way .

		In fact we al - most succeeded in turning art into nature and producing the economic man .

		If we actually failed to produce anything so monstrous , it was from no moral revolt : we failed simply and solely because nature herself sets limits to our imbecilities and finally matures us by offering the inexorable criticism of fact .

		But the experiment lasted long , and it has produced an American type .

		Nor did our anarchic scramble set its stamp on the successful alone ; far from it .

		Look , for example , at the soured and embittered , the dismally antisocial , spawn that has come out of `` Spoon River '' in our time American to the last recess , twisted and envenomed , utterly incapable of creating , or even of imagining , a common life .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	cites the
Spoon Riverites	PERSON	as the natural product , on the lower plane , of our in - dividualistic doctrine , and his choice could not have been happier .

		But equally on a higher plane the same forces have been at work .

		The scramble for what we call -LRB- whether mistakenly or not -RRB- culture has been largely a struggle to save the soul alive by withdrawing it from the environment .

		It was the counterpart of Protestant salvationism and only a little less fierce .

		Feeling itself so largely on the defensive , our culture has never been able to afford the luxury of that genial tolerance which was the other side of our commercial ruthlessness .

		Nowhere , surely , has the sheer fanaticism of the classical spirit been so evident as among our elder humanists , men whose sensi - tiveness turned from the crudity about them to the finished and the achieved to what was ir - revocably dead .

		Something in them clove ir - resistibly to the static ; mere becoming shocked them like an impropriety .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	says , truly enough , that youth from the first repudi - ated such leadership and found its enthusiasms in the broad humanity of
William James	PERSON	.

		But I do n't think he makes it sufficiently plain why this was inevitable .

		The issue hinged on noth - ing so accidental as a temperament .

		The reason is n't to be found in the unresponsiveness of such a critic as
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	.

		It was not because he happened to ignore the creative impulse about him , assumed its inferiority .

		What the younger generation felt , it seems to me , was rather the inadequacy of what Mr.
More	PERSON	and his kind had to offer ; it felt the inadequacy of the literary discipline generally , the peevishness of its dis - ciples , their restless dissatisfaction with what can be accomplished by living men , their disturbing nostalgia of the tomb .

		By focussing attention on the unattainable and setting up unapproach - able models such training depresses hope and dis - courages effort .

		But chiefly it is too narrow .

		And by a curious paradox , however fastidiously it selects , however ruthlessly it pares down the human adventure to a few happy episodes , it still leaves the scene too crowded .

		It is human , all too human .

		There is no reason to believe that the anthropocentric can exhaust our curiosity .

		No wonder youth turned to science for light and air .

		It wanted a truer perspective .


Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, whose fine responsiveness has enabled him to interpret so many of the disinterested im - pulses of youth , has interpreted this one too better than anyone else I know .

		`` The desire for a larger life and wider interests , for an escape from private circumstances , and even from the whole recurring human cycle of birth and death , is fulfilled by the impersonal cosmic outlook of science as by nothing else . ''

		No , the failure was not that of a small group .

		What really failed was a whole discipline .

		The honor of being the real `` awakeners '' of
Young America	ORGANIZATION	Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	accords to the prag - matists , but he denies that theirs is a continuing leadership and his book is partly an appeal for new leaders .

		My own notion is that the breach so far as it exists is largely the result of an his - torical accident , but Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	finds reasons
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 207 more valid for his temperament .

		If I read him aright the gist of his complaint is that the prag - matists happened to be philosophers instead of poets .

		In other words , he has begun to be a little repelled by the chill of the instrument .

		What made the appeal of the pragmatists was never of course anything in their technical phi - losophy .

		It was solely their decency and their responsibility .

		They set out to restore the philosopher to his original place in society ; their leaders became reformers in spirit .

		But there are two ways in which you can go about getting reforms the inspirational way and the more or less disillusioned practical way .

		Having ob - served how the innocence of the transcendentalists played into the hands of masterful men who knew precisely what they wanted and how to get it , the pragmatists were not for repeating such folly .

		It is not enough to generate ideals ; you have to see that they are applied at the right point and drive the right wheels .

		But as soon as you descend to details you find yourself work - ing with such entirely prosaic facts as `` the con - trol of fatigue . ''

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	admits that the pragmatists do not stop with that : No , they can do one thing better ; they can evade reality altogether and say with Mr.
Henry Ford	PERSON	that `` no man can take pride in his work until he gets some - thing out of it , until he has leisure to enjoy life . ''

		In this way , throwing up the sponge altogether , accepting machinery and still more machinery as a fait accompli , and giving up all hope of determining the rational place of machinery in life , they can tell every one ex - cept the favored few whose sophistication enables them to glut their intelligence on that strange freak of the American soul , to seek reality in anything else than work .

		But machinery appears to be a fait accompli if ever there was one , and what is to be gained by quarreling with the source of that fat social surplus on which all our hopes of making a more passable society depend ?

		Nor is the control of fatigue absolutely contemptible .

		It is just one of those thousand obscure details with which , it seems to me , the intelligence is better equipped to deal than that intuitional leadership for which Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	appeals .

		Besides , I doubt whether what is wrong with society at present is any want of ideals .

		What I think we chiefly need is the patience and the organized good will to put some of our idle ideals to work .

		Once we did that we should have , I believe , a world such as Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	longs for , a world that was `` able to keep and use the whole of its creative energy . ''

		The New Hope in Industry THE CREATIVE IMPULSE IN INDUSTRY : A
Propo	LOCATION	- sition for Educators .

		By
Helen Marot	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` The Creative Impulse in Industry , '' by
Helen Marot	PERSON	, is a very forceful and illuminating analy - sis of the present state of affairs in the industrial world , with particular reference to the part played by education in its relation to the industrial system .

		It comes at a most opportune time and will undoubtedly prove helpful in guiding us through the perilous times ahead , when men are realizing the freedom which comes from the breaking down of the institutional thought which has in the past had such a dominating influence over human actions .

		The underlying theme throughout the book is that industry to properly perform its function must be first of all a continuation of the educa - tional process begun in school , and must there - fore offer opportunity for first-hand experimenta - tion .

		In this way men will be attracted toward industrial work and look upon it as a great field of adventure which offers unlimited opportunities for creative work .

		Miss
Marot	PERSON	points out how necessary it is that the schools , which are the starting point of the individual 's contact with the life processes , make clear the universality of natural law and offer a chance to demonstrate these laws in actual practice .

		The real purpose of science is seen to be the classification and organization of the observed facts in nature , with the end in view of determining the natural law or principle which causes any particular phe - nomenon .

		The child therefore , and later the workman if properly educated , becomes a free determining factor ; that is , a center of creative energy which , as he increases his knowledge of natural processes by education and experiment , learns to direct the forces of nature to the service of humanity .

		The individual gradually begins to realize that if nature is to serve him he must conform to her laws .

		It is pointed out that a paternalistic edu - cational and industrial system can not succeed , for the reason that it attempts to mold the individual into a predetermined form , so that the environ - ment becomes master of the man instead of the man becoming the conscious master of his en - vironment .

		Of course , as Miss
Marot	PERSON	points out , our conception of industry will have to undergo a complete change .

		Created , by man himself , it will be destroyed again by him if it 208 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 19	DATE	docs not serve his purpose and enable him to real - ize life in greater fullness .

		It can not survive unless it ceases to exploit and begins to develop the latent powers of the individual .

		Upon the impractical proposition to return to the old order of things , where the individual manufactured the complete finished article ,
Miss Marot	LOCATION	makes this very illuminating observation -LRB- page 211 -RRB- : `` The proposition to revert to an earlier period sug - gests nothing more than the repetition of an ex - perience out of which the present state of affairs has evolved . ''

		It at once becomes evident why this is so when we realize that many of the most useful devices for harnessing nature 's forces to our use would not have been created without the collective efforts of many men .

		Such a de - vice , for instance , as the electric generator , whose service to humanity is undisputed , could not have come into its present state of perfection except as industry has been the means of uniting men of special technical skill and ability to contribute each his part to the problem of producing the perfected machine .

		But that this organizing of men through the individual industry can be done without violating the inherent desire of the individual workman to express himself , is indicated on page 137 : Creative effort is not necessarily an individual matter .

		It may be possible for a group of people to associate cordially and freely together with a single creative purpose and endeavor .

		It may be possible for each worker to experience the joy of creative work as he takes part with the others in the planning of the work along with the labor of fabrication .

		It is a creative experience or dull labor as his association with others in the solution of the problem is freely pursued and genuine , or as it is forced and perfunctory .

		The central thought is that associated enter - prise will not lessen the opportunity for individ - ual self-expression , but will rather increase it , for the reason that real cooperative industrial organization gives the workman not only a knowl - edge of nature 's laws but also a knowledge of human emotions as well , and this will enlarge the bounds of the intellect to include the laws of mental as well as material processes .

		In pro- portion as the field is enlarged , of course , the power of the workman to express what is unique and individual in himself is increased .

		Miss
Marot	PERSON	points out that the tendency to take away individual responsibility from men has its origin in the instinctive deske to capture and exploit .

		The increasing intelligence of the masses how - ever makes this exploitation more and more dif - ficult , for the workmen are realizing that the only way to prevent this exploitation is by obtaining a voice in the management , which naturally means a determination to force a recognition that the workman is an individual and should have a chance to express his individuality .

		The effect on human actions of what she calls the possessive instinct she points out quite clearly on page 14 , as follows : Where the motive of individuals who engage in in - dustry is the desire to possess , the rational method of gaining possession is not by the arduous way of work but of capture .

		The scheme of capture is a scheme whereby you may get something for -LRB- doing -RRB- noth - ing ... `` Doing nothing '' does not mean that manual workers , managers of productive enterprises ... as well as financiers , are not busy people , or that their activity does not result in accomplishment .

		They are indeed the busy people and their accomplishment Is the world 's wealth .

		Nevertheless the intention of all and the spirit of the scheme is to do as near nothing as possible in exchange for the highest return .

		The whole industrial arrangement is carried on without the force of productive intention ; it is carried forward against a disinclination to produce .

		The remedy she believes lies in directing the attention to the creative instinct , as industrial leaders have been forced to do in the present emergency , for she says on page 59 : Equally important in the interest of creative work is the power of these appeals to shift the motive for production from the acquisitive to the creative im - pulse .

		In the midst of the world 's emergency , driven by the fear of destruction the nations have turned in - tinctively to the unused creative force in human and common labor , that is to the ability of the wage earner to think and plan ... If labor in answer to these appeals gains the confidence that it is competent to carry industrial responsibility , or rather that common labor , together with the trained technicians in me - chanics and industrial organization are competent as a producing group to carry the responsibility , one need we may be sure will be eliminated which has been an irritating and an unproductive element in industrial life ; I mean the need the workers have had for the cultivation of class isolation .

		As the workers become in the estimation of a community and in their own estimation , responsible members of a society , their more rather than less abortive effort to develop class feeling in
America	LOCATION	will disappear .

		Under these condi - tions concerted class action will be confined to the employers of labor and the profiteers , who will be placed in the position of proving their value and their place in the business of wealth creation .

		On this I believe we may count , that labor will drop its defen - sive program for a constructive one , as it comes to appreciate its own creative potentiality .

		That labor organizations will do this construc - tive work has already been demonstrated , and if it can be done in the country as a whole during the period of the war , there will be no need for the dreaded reconstruction after the war ; be - cause of the conscious manifestation of unre - pressed constructive creative power society will easily readjust itself to the new conditions and change quite naturally from the production of
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 209 implements of destruction to articles which have constructive social purposes .

		All of this implies however that man must be - come master of the machine and not be mastered by it .

		We must recognize the fact ,
Miss Marot	PERSON	says , that `` the workers have resisted machinery not only because as individuals they were thrown out of jobs for a time or lost them permanently , but because the machine imposed on them a method of work , of activity over which they had no control . ''

		And any form of management which makes the man an appendage of the ma - chine is working contrary to natural law and does not in any sense deserve to be called scientific .

		Joy in work comes only when the worker is par - ticipating consciously and therefore intelligently in his work , and full participation requires not only a knowledge of progress in the particular part controlled by the individual , but the relation - ship of that part to the whole .

		The machine therefore should be the instrument for increasing the workman 's knowledge and mastery of nature 's forces and not something which limits his oppor - tunity to acquire greater knowledge .

		This thought ,
Miss Marot	PERSON	suggests , is back of the organized labor movement .

		To quote her again , page 71 : The conscious purpose is the direct and simple de - sire to resist specific acts of domination and to in - crease labor 's economic returns ... Anyone who follows the sacrifices which organized workers make for some small and equivocal gain or who watches them in their periods of greatest activity , knows that the labor movement gets its stimulus , its high pitch of interest , not from its struggle for higher wage rates , but from the worker 's participation in the administra - tion of affairs connected with life in the shop .

		The real tragedy in a lost strike is not the failure to gain the wage demand ; it is the return of the defeated strikers to work , as men unequipped with the adminis - trative powers as men without will .

		The above implies that the logical course to pursue , if we are to stabilize American industry , is to cooperate with organized labor so that it will become an integral part of each industry .

		The autocratic disorganization of a whole industry because of change of policy or ownership which would seriously affect the workman , would be impossible , and much unhappiness therefore would be avoided .

		Miss
Marot	PERSON	suggests that the workmen operat - ing through their organization are much more to be trusted than the employer to maintain the proper working environment , for the reason that their organizations are primarily designed to pre - vent exploitation , while the employer , in a ma - jority of cases , seeks to exploit .

		The underlying theme of the book teems to be that democracy must first come in industry before it can come in political institutions , and this will not be materialized until industry ceases to be autocratic and becomes genuinely demo - cratic .

		This necessitates however an industrial organization that gives the greatest possible op - portunity for self-expression to everyone , with every facility for acquiring greater knowledge of the laws underlying the processes .

		Industry , in a very real sense , will become educational , with the main emphasis on the development of men .

		When this has been accomplished in the country as a whole , political institutions , in the very nature of things , will take on a real democratic character , which it is impossible for them to do when controlled , as they are now , by an auto - cratic type of industry .

		The author 's endeavor is `` to regard
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	's art as far as possible in relation to the art that preceded , surrounded , and followed the great master '' ; but his method of what he calls `` constructive criticism '' leads him to confuse history , descrip - tion , stylistic analysis , and the grouping of artistic individualities ; If however the reader and it will be well worth his while is willing to dis - entangle the truly critical passages from the mass of the work , he will be rewarded with a fuller knowledge and a keener appreciation of the mas - ter whose gesture was , I think , the widest and noblest between the days of Phidias and of Michelangelo .

		It is so easy to take Giotto in historical per - spective and to note his innovations that few critics put sufficient emphasis upon what he ex - pressed : upon the solemn serenity of his rhythms , the majestic exaltation of his figures , upon the tragic , brooding spirit that pervades every paint - ing that came , not from his followers , but from the master himself .

		Dr.
Siren	PERSON	, fortunately , does not lose sight of these loftier qualities , even though , as I have intimated , his criticism is scat - 210 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 19	DATE	tered , derived from considerations of individual pictures .

		He says rightly : `` Compassion , amaze - ment , grief , and terror are the most common emotions in the art of Giotto '' ; and he stresses justly the `` plastic volume '' of his figures , the `` emotional import condensed . ''

		I can not how - ever agree that
Giotto	PERSON	's rhythm is `` restful . ''

		Serene it usually is , of course , but no more rest - ful than the rhythms in the `` Agamemnon '' of ^ schylus .

		Like most modern scholars , Dr.
Siren	PERSON	discards
Vasari	PERSON	as an authority except in so far as he is supported by
Ghiberti	PERSON	, who himself is none too trustworthy , since he wrote more than a hundred years after
Giotto	PERSON	's death , and who is none too valuable , since most of the works mentioned by him have been lost or destroyed .

		The author therefore takes a few typical examples , such as the famous Arena frescoes , and proceeds to de - duce from them the typical qualities , material and spiritual , of the master ; and these he applies to such works as have been attributed to him .

		The extreme delicacy of this task can be appreci - ated only by those who have attempted similar work and by those who remember that the medi - eval custom of communal labor led artists to sign pictures that were painted wholly or in part by their pupils and assistants .

		It may be interesting to Americans , by the way , to know that Dr.
Siren	PERSON	ascribes , without hesitation , the `` Nativity '' in the Metropolitan Museum ,
New York	LOCATION	, to
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, and considers its artistic value equal to that of the
Arena	ORGANIZATION	frescoes .

		The fallacy in the scheme of the book is best seen in the essay on
Bernardo Daddi	PERSON	, wherein the author finds it necessary constantly to point out the `` fundamental dissimilarity '' of that mas - ter 's work to
Giotto 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are told that Ber - nardo 's `` graceful , flexible design is entirely un - like the sculptural modeling developed by
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, '' and that the latter 's `` compositions are rhythmic expressions of this creative imagination , '' whereas the former 's are mere `` theoretical propositions . ''

		But in that case why treat him as a follower of Giotto ?

		Is there any more valid reason for do - ing so than that he lived in
Florence	LOCATION	in the four - teenth century ?

		It would have been more logical , to say the least , if Dr.
Siren	PERSON	had either not con - sidered him at all or confined himself to pointing out the artist 's own qualities : his rare delicacy , his charm , the originality of his color , his skill in space composition .

		There are , to be sure , a few works of his in which he seems to have made an effort to obtain a monumental effect ; but they are so few and so relatively unimportant that they can scarcely be taken as in any way characteristic of his genius .

		In discussing
Taddeo Gaddi	PERSON	the author fol - lows the fashion of our day in underrating an artist who was perhaps overrated in his own day .

		Dr.
Siren	PERSON	, having a thesis always in mind , blames him for having diverged from `` the central and most artistically significant elements in
Giotto	LOCATION	's style '' and for having created a tradition that was `` followed by most of the later painters of the Trecento . ''

		This is as valuable as saying that
Keats	PERSON	never obtained the monumental grandeur of Milton !

		Besides the essay on Giotto the most admirable part of the book is that devoted to Andrea Or - cagna .

		Like the earlier master and like so many of the masters who were to appear in the full Renaissance , he was equally versatile as sculptor , architect , and painter ; and if we may believe the author of the `` Libro di Antonio Billi '' he also `` amused himself with sonnets . ''

		A man of stately emotions , majestic and sublime , a painter at once gorgeous and precise , he had also those plastic and tectonic qualities that were so characteristic of Giotto and that therefore endear him to Dr.
Siren	PERSON	.

		Vasari tells us that `` he began the study of sculpture while still a child , under
Andrea Pisano	PERSON	'' ; and though there is nothing further to prove this , the author considers it in all proba - bility true and , in his many critical descriptions , he emphasizes the sculptural influence in the handling of the figures and the drapery and in the relief-like effect of several of his pictures .

		The material in Dr.
Siren	PERSON	's book is so exceed - ingly valuable that it would be difficult to under - stand how it could be arranged so awkwardly , were it not that the preface informs us that it was finished with `` much haste . ''

		Even so , one does not readily perceive why the author should begin with a consideration of some frescoes at
Assisi	LOCATION	; abruptly stop for a chapter headed `` Biographical Notes '' ; and then proceed with his descriptions .

		There is another awkwardness due to the fact that all of the text is in one volume and all of the plates in another .

		Unless the reader can carry accurately in his memory 220 pictures this necessitates his laying down one heavy book and taking up another every time he has finished a page or two .

		The reproductions are not worthy of the very handsome make-up of the volumes : .

		one may obtain from them the linear composi - tions and but little else .

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 211 New Bottle , but Old Wine THE NEW RATIONALISM .

		By
Edward Gleason Spaulding	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Were it in sooth new , one who is a bit wearied with speculative isms might have less patience with it , but the truth is that the New Rational - ism -LRB- in so far as it is rational -RRB- is a venerable and by no means misprized acquaintance .

		To be sure , as it comes to us in the work of Professor -LRB- now Lieutenant -RRB- Spaulding five hundred pages bristling with italics the wine of ancient reason is outwardly disguised : it is served in a vessel of modern finish and the label is just from the press .

		Moreover there is novelty at least in the twist of the terms -LRB- always of some seriousness in meta - physics -RRB- , and again there is ingenuous sincerity in the author 's conviction of newness : he has filtered away old sediments , analyzed out false infusions , and into the clarified essence injected the commotion of a militant temperament .

		Alto - gether one feels that he has written his book in fine fettle , perchance finding his own liquor a trifle heady .

		`` The New Rationalism '' is the most ambitious work yet put forth by a member of the aggres - sive American group of Neo-Realists -LRB- Rational - ism and Realism are identical in Professor Spaulding 's view -RRB- .

		It undertakes a criticism of philosophic method and a survey of all important philosophic problems , the refutation of outstand - ing rivals in the metaphysical field , and the solid enseatment of a constructive realism .

		In the work there are 2 Parts , 7 Sections , 46 Chapters , and there are postulates and problems , arguments and solutions , refutations and demonstrations all the schematism dear to the heart of your Thomist , and to the reviewer a stern reminder of his own insufficiency .

		Clearly , the gist of so much matter is not to be caught in a few fleeting paragraphs ; the very aspect of the book invites to brown study .

		Nevertheless not all this framework sup - ports variety .

		The scholastic method is repeti - tious and often sadly tedious , and Professor
Spaulding	PERSON	has not altogether reformed on his medieval models in this regard .

		Indeed his reader is once and again moved to raise a deprecating hand ... `` My dear sir !

		really , your point is understood ; let us on to the con - sequence ! ''

		But these be matters of style .

		They are im - portant as showing how difficult it is to be `` new , '' at least in mode , and again as showing tempera - mental affinities .

		They tend to make intelligible , too , the metaphysical parti pris of the movement which calls itself at once Realist and Rationalist and which assumes not only to controvert the past but to plot the future .

		This might be de - scribed as the basis of the mathematical model .

		Time and again in the course of history philos - ophers have become enamored of number and have ascended into the altitudes of mathematics in their effort to purge away the dross of empiri - cal speech ; but times as many , lest philosophy dissolve into the webs of its own gossamer , some
Socrates	PERSON	has arisen to summon it back from the heavens and habituate it to the plains of men 's common discourse .

		To be sure these flights have brought vigor and fresh air , and there is always a thrill for the groundlings in watching the avia - tion , with who can know what triumphs in its airy combats .

		They are fine in spirit , and it is only the relentlessness of gravitation that com - pels the eventual fall .

		Professor
Spaulding	PERSON	's point of departure is de - fiance of Aristotle and all his logic .

		Aristotelian logic , he says , is a logic of substance and quality , of identity and causality in short , a materialistic logic , modeled after the physical `` thing '' ; and the history of philosophy , up to the Neo-Realistic era , is but the dismal exposition of metaphysical servitude to
Aristotle	LOCATION	.

		Science -LRB- through a happy ignorance -RRB- and mathematics -LRB- through fortunate preoccupation -RRB- alone have escaped the thralldom , and have luckily hit upon other models for the reason models which lead straight to the per - durable truth , which is reality .

		It is these models which the
New Rationalism	ORGANIZATION	would apply to metaphysical problems , thereby demon - strating the New Realism and relieving the human mind from all save incidental meta - physical inquietudes .

		First , there is ontology .

		Modern philosophy has been embogged in epistemology and confused by psychology , with the result that there has been but floundering where gymnastic was ex - pected .

		Aristotle is responsible for this , for a psychological theory of knowledge means reason embodied and therefore `` thingized '' -LRB- Spauld - ing 's term -RRB- substantial `` knowers '' with reality - making `` knowings , '' and the like ; all of which get the hapless speculator into the `` ego-centric predicament '' from which Neo-Realism points the way to freedom .

		The way is ontological , and the ontology is a mathematicized ontology , in which `` entities '' replace `` concepts '' and `` things , '' `` subsistences '' outclass `` existences , '' `` relations '' resolve `` substances , '' realia oust qualia , and 212 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 19	DATE	`` states of affairs , '' when analyzed in situ , show `` functions '' which `` hold '' serially without in - curring any of the opprobrious unreason that attaches to the idea of `` cause . ''

		There is , for ex - ample , on page 494 a tabular scheme of the `` sub - sistents '' -LRB- known alias , `` consistents '' -RRB- , which divides them into the existent and the nonexistent subsistents , and divides these progressively , until it supplies tags not only for all the furniture of creation but for `` experienced , but not implied subsistents , '' embracing , with others , phlogiston , satyrs , and the `` snakes of tremens '' One is surely relieved to know that , though experienced , the snakes are not implied !

		Soberly -LRB- for one can not take all of Professor Spaulding 's pages quite so -RRB- , a student of history is moved to wonder how just this verbal para - phernalia is to free us from the Aristotelian tra - dition .

		Do we wholly liberate the reason by em - phasizing `` term '' and `` relation '' instead of `` thing '' and `` quality '' ?

		Are `` numerically dis - tinct '' facts , which happen to lodge in the same `` state of affairs , '' less mutually responsible than causes and their effects ?

		By defining time as `` a one-dimensional series formed by asymmetrically and transitively related instants '' -LRB-
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	would have tersely said , `` numbering number '' -RRB- , is history -LRB- which is the `` numbered number '' -RRB- emptied of all necessity and meaning ?

		Or is there no miracle in a `` creative synthesis , in ac - cordance with which one or more specific organiz - ing relations so relate parts that there are new qualities in the resulting whole , and whole and part belong to specifically different universes of discourse '' ?

		It is this latter principle which is to account for the values , for beauty and justice and goodness , and indeed for all those `` entities '' prized by the human spirit to which
Plato	ORGANIZATION	gave the name `` Ideas , '' and which he set as shining rulers over the world .

		Some of these questions are answered uncon - sciously by the author 's own settings forth .

		Thus Realism 's `` Hypothesis I , '' that knowing and the known object may be qualitatively different , rests upon the assumption that terms may have quali - tative differences , and it argues that these dif - ferences are ultimate .

		Indeed the weighty enouncement of the `` cosubsistence of independ - ence and relatedness , '' upon which so many of the `` new '' reasonings turn , is quite simply resolv - able to `` the world is full of a number of things '' each , let us hope , with its own happy glint .

		And if so , if qualities thus ontological are lurking in the very shadows of the mathematicals -LRB- whose sum only Allah knoweth ! -RRB-

		, is there no effrontery in .

		asserting that already `` human knowledge en - compasses the main types of things , '' and that these are just nine -LRB- pages 381-86 -RRB- ?

		Your scho - lastic , who loves a closed and circumscribed uni - verse , with all the houses of the heavens surveyed and delimited , will certainly find a kindred satis - faction in the `` stratified '' hierarchy of realities which this new scholasticism offers as its chart of the universe .

		But for one who is seeking a liberation of the reason ... the varnish of newness rubs thin .

		The fact is that history is serene in the pres - ence of rebels and impassive to refutation .

		Men rise up with a determination to overthrow the past , and at the most but discard an outer gar - ment ; the ancient body of human experience and the soul of speculation do not greatly vary .

		So it was with
Thales	ORGANIZATION	, so with
Descartes	LOCATION	; and the New Realists bring with them little more than a fresh zeal for an antique mode of thinking .

		Of logic there are but two essential types the mathe - matical and the grammatical -LRB- Professor
Spauld	PERSON	- ing is certainly wrong in deriving
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's logic from the `` physical thing '' ; it is in fact but a sublimation of grammatical analysis -RRB- .

		Human nature even rational human nature is incon - stant ; and men 's minds find fruitful now one and now the other of these images of discourse .

		The New Realists follow Plato in their devotion to the mathematical model , and they are arriving as among others this book shows at a truly Platonic definition of the All , within which physical things are the meanest and forms the lordliest of beings .

		But the
New Realism	ORGANIZATION	is still far from a Platonic understanding either of its methods or of its purposes .

		For none was more , keenly aware than Plato of the insufficiency of mathematics for the last solution of life .

		Num - ber may indeed give us a chart of the moving heavens and a computation of the instants of time ; but of that need -LRB- born out of what nights of cosmic endeavor , who can guess ? -RRB-

		which im - pels men to the love of philosophy , only knowl - edge of the Good can discover the answer .

		Pro- fessor Spaulding closes his book with a discussion of the Realistic doctrine of values and of Realism 's teleology and theology .

		It is an honest discussion and not without wisdom , but by what leaps of inconsequence its course is pursued he who reads may find out , and finding , he will the better judge how difficult is the task of him who would outbuild the kingly past .


HARTLEY B. ALEXANDER	ORGANIZATION	.

		1918 -RSB- THE DIAL 213 Liberalism Restated THE WORLD PEACE AND AFTER .

		By
Carl H. Grabo	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		A
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	we shall have as a re - sult of the war , but for those who take literally a pledge to make the world safe for democracy a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is but the first turn in a long road .

		The war has taught the enemies of democracy that a secure commercial expansion and a rapprochement between competing na - tional capitalistic groups are inseparable .

		The German autocracy has also proffered a fertile suggestion in its successful manipulation of the German workman .

		The latter does not seem overly concerned about his political impotence or about limitations upon his freedom to speak and write , so long as he is assured an effective educa - tion , material comforts , recreational facilities , and security against the misfortunes of ill health , accident , and an impecunious old age .

		Democ - racy will continue endangered if the conclusion of war leaves capital in control of an interna - tional government which winks at international devices for combating labor , checking freedom of speech , controlling the dissemination of news and opinion , and allaying popular discontent by means of programmes for social reform .

		In his book `` The World Peace and After ''
Carl H. Grabo	PERSON	expresses his fear of such an eventuality .

		He maintains that the test of our belief in the ideals of democracy is our willing - ness to introduce democratic institutions at home .

		To be sure , he would establish a league of na - tions which will guarantee the free use of roads of commerce , the equality of all states before law , a like economic opportunity for all nations , the protection of small peoples from the exploita - tion of larger , and the right of diverse peoples to develop diverse cultures .

		But all this , he holds , does not mean of itself a democratic world .

		A democratic ideal implies equality of opportunity as between individuals .

		And equality of oppor - tunity means , if it means anything , `` that we should all be born , inheriting strong bodies free from defect ; that we should be well nourished ; that we should be equally well educated . ''

		Nature has forever decreed that men shall be unequal in ability , but man 's intelligence can make an ap - proach towards an economic democracy as it has made progress towards political democracy .

		A true democracy , then , according to Mr.
Grabo	PERSON	, involves both economic and political equality .

		And this , manifestly , we do not have .

		But the war makes possible the creation of a more just society .

		It has swept away the old order .

		Under the necessities of war governments have increased their functions .

		In a world that has spent its inheritance the necessities of peace will require their multiplication .

		We seem to face a situation in which we must decide between an oligarchy which combines political and in - dustrial power , and an intelligent reorganization of the state which will unite industrial efficiency with democratic control .

		The British Labor party aims at the second , and much that Mr.
Grabo	PERSON	writes is a restatement of its programme .

		His chapter `` The Citizen and the State '' dis - cusses the immediate steps requisite for a trans - formation of our present society .

		A progressively increasing tax upon incomes , inheritances , and unearned increments affords a transition to greater economic equality and supplies one means for financing the socialized activities of the state .

		The gradual participation of labor in the man - agement of industry will lead to an industrial democracy , while the referendum , the recall , and proportional representation are indispensable con - ditions of a political democracy .

		The book is worth reading .

		To be sure , one familiar with
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	,
Sidney Webb	PERSON	, and others in sympathy with the programme of the
British Labor	ORGANIZATION	party will find little in it that is novel .

		* The radical social philosophy which the war brings into prominence merits however a con - stant restatement , and particularly in
America	LOCATION	.

		But novelty of content is the only justification I can imagine for the tiresome repetition of ideas which leads Grabo to cover 154 pages in saying what might better be said on 75 .

		In point of fact there is very little in the five chapters that is not said in the chapter on `` International Re - lations '' with one exception .

		And this exception is irrelevant to the main purpose of the book .

		It occurs in connection with a plea for a new social morality to replace the present individualistic morality .

		Grabo evidently believes that since our individualistic morality professes an origin and sanction in a personal God , a social morality must derive vitality from a pantheistic God .

		This new deity is `` the larger all-embracing consciousness of the world realiz - ing his aims through the willing cooperation of men . ''

		A sympathetic reader will perhaps know what these words mean .

		I confess that I do not .

		But I think we have here Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's Invisible King masquerading under an assumed name , `` The World Spirit . ''

		And Mr.
Archer	PERSON	will get him if he does n't watch out .

		OUTCASTS IN
BEULAH LAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Roy Helton	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Magic , whether of diction or of thought , is the one quality in poetry which all poets seek with equal passion .

		But how different are the wiles of these fantastic huntsmen in pursuit of this golden bird !

		For some are bold and direct , attempting to slay the creature outright ; some go warily with a fine net ; some wait in the dark - ness , hoping to be found rather than to find ; while others still it can not be doubted trudge patiently through the forest with a handful of salt .

		This much their contemporaries may observe of their appearances as huntsmen but of their success , who can say ?

		For magic is itself a chang - ing thing .

		The sparrow of today is the phoenix of tomorrow , and vice versa ; and tomorrow the cap - tors of sparrows and phosnixes may regard each other with changed eyes .

		This , it hardly needs to be said , is largely a matter of diction ; and this again is largely a mat - ter of the rate of growth and decay in the language at any given time .

		Some poets resist the growth of language , some merely acquiesce in it , and some -LRB- like
Dante	PERSON	and
D'Annunzio	PERSON	-RRB- exult in and compel it .

		These last are the boldest spirits , and , on the whole , the most likely to fail .

		`` Will this word live ?

		Will this word die ?

		Will this word , tomorrow , be beautiful or merely vul - gar ? ''

		In every line they hazard answers to these questions ; and the chances are much against any high average of success .

		These differences in the attitude towards dic - tion set gulfs between poets who would otherwise be commensals , and constitute the deliciousness and futility of criticism .

		Observe , for example , the astonishing unlikeness , on this point , of `` New Paths , '' that most interesting English anthology of the verse and prose of the younger men , and the two volumes now before us .

		The anthology rep - resents , rather consciously , a band -LRB- by no means unvaried -RRB- of pioneers wrestlers with new dic - tion and rhythms , pursuers of new kinds of magic .

		One could gladly forego , it is true , a sort of Pre - Raphaelitic pinkness and faunishness which crops out here and there , as in the work of the Sitwells .

		But many of these English huntsmen have attained to a subdued and cool and almost intellectual kind of magic which , in
America	LOCATION	, we do not know .

		At the same time one can not help feeling a trifle dubious about a charm which is so conscious of itself , so practiced in self-exploitation .

		It is too deliberately naive , too sophisticatedly primi - tive .

		However nicely a poet may write of sirens , fauns , elves , or other superannuated evidences of man 's thirst for the supernatural , nowadays it inevitably smacks of affectation .

		It is partly because this fault is common in
England	LOCATION	that one is delighted with such a volume as `` Fairies and Fusiliers , '' of which the American edition has just appeared .

		This is forthright and honest verse , Anglo-Saxon in its vigorous direct - ness , at the same time irresponsible and sure .

		Mr.
Graves	PERSON	is less ostentatiously serious than his sedater contemporaries in `` New Paths , '' yet one is not certain that in the upshot he does not come off better .

		Whereas among the younger con - temporary poets one finds a good deal of empha - sis on phrase-making for its own sake , here one finds a poet almost scornful of trappings and color , intent only on what he has to say , and say - ing it vividly and musically in the unaffected lan - guage of prose .

		Certainly these are among the most honest and vivid war poems which so far have come to us and if Mr.
Graves	PERSON	does not cut very deep , neither , on the other hand , does he go in for the usual mock-heroics and sentimental bun - combe .

		Hear him in `` A Dead Boche '' : To you who 'd read my Songs of War And only hear of blood and fame , I 'll say -LRB- you 've heard it said before -RRB- `` War 's Hell ! ''

		and if you doubt the same To-day I found in Mametz Wood A certain cure for lust of blood : Where , propped against a shattered trunk , In a great mess of things unclean , Sat a dead
Boche	LOCATION	; he scowled and stunk With clothes and face a sodden green , Big-bellied , spectacled , crop-haired , Dribbling black blood from nose and beard .

		This approaches , it is true , that sort of roman - ticism which consists in the deliberate exploitation of the ugly or horrible .

		But for the most part Mr.
Graves	PERSON	is a dealer in whim , and it is to Mr.
Roy Helton	PERSON	that we must turn to see this method working in extenso .

		`` Outcasts in Beulah Land '' qualifies Mr.
Helton	PERSON	for admission among our realists , but not as yet on a very high level .

		For the most part his work is still tentative and imi - tative : one swims successively through currents of
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Masefield , Service	ORGANIZATION	, and
O. Henry	PERSON	.

		The rhythms are insecure , the narrative psychol - ogy undeveloped .

		Mr.
Helton	PERSON	at present finds it difficult to end a story otherwise than in senti - mentality or melodrama .

		At the same time it should be said that these stories are often vivid , richly if somewhat commonplacely imagined , and on the whole well-proportioned .

		Most of one 's objections are comprised when one has said that Mr.
Helton	PERSON	is young .

		As for diction , Mr.
Helton	PERSON	's method is that of
D'Annunzio	PERSON	and Dante : he believes in using the demotic tongue ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 215 neologisms and all .

		He is willing to take his chances that the slang of today will become the magic of tomorrow .

		Unfortunately he does this without much discrimination ; he appears to be somewhat insensitive to values .

		Even among neologisms it is possible to distinguish vigorous from vulgar , beautiful from merely pretty .

		And it is this which Mr.
Helton	PERSON	, like .

		The Relegation of God JOAN AND PETER .

		By
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		It is always a question whether Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is an incomparably gifted observer of the sweep of events , or whether he uses the world of institu - tions and ideas primarily as symbols of his own insistent personality .

		Was his recent religious flare an attempt to beat to its goal a real world rapidly mysticizing under the strain of war , or was it a personal recoil against a sudden sense of helplessness ?

		If we could answer these questions we should know whether it is
England	LOCATION	that has righted itself , abandoning the Mr.
Britling	PERSON	who found conscious social control too much for him without the guiding hand of a divine comrade , re - turning to the old confident maker of new worlds for old ; or whether it is only Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's own robust spirit emerging from its so singularly un - becoming religious widowhood to the delights of pragmatic power again .

		At least , this new novel represents a complete convalescence .

		Its chief sensation is the relega - tion of God back to the innocuous role into which the late Victorian had got him .

		This book puts God familiarly but decisively in his place , and restores our responsible , curious , adventurous , experimental youth at the heart of the world 's soul and the hejm of its affairs .

		To young
Peter	PERSON	, shattered in limb but wise from his war experi - ence , progress is again religion : `` work and learn - ing are our creed . ''

		God , seen in his vivacious dream , is the Old Experimenter , tinkering about in his dusty workshop , as he tells
Peter	PERSON	with a rather jolly cynicism : `` If you have no will to change it , you have no right to criticize it . ''

		So it becomes our task for the future to `` take hold of the world , unassisted by God , with the acquies - cence of God , and in fulfillment of some remote incomprehensible planning on the part of God . ''

		Fickle Mr.
Wells	PERSON	!

		What has become of the
Invisible King	ORGANIZATION	, the first President of the Republic of
Mankind	LOCATION	?

		Even
Oswald	PERSON	, the noble old im - perialistic idealist , finds God as a `` name battered out of all value and meaning , '' and sinks back on a `` Nameless and Incomprehensible , an Essence beyond Reality , a Heart of all Things , by which he lives and is upheld . ''

		God has been withdrawn from the Wellsian programme .

		Thrown back on our own resources , we have a right to ask how this old unquenchable pragmatic optimism feels
today	DATE	in a world still blindly ago - nizing at war .

		Joan and
Peter	PERSON	go ahead to build a `` civilized life of creative activities in an atmos - phere of helpful goodwill . ''

		After the war he is to take up biological research and she is to do house-building .

		Well , this return of
Wells	LOCATION	to the old ideas and aspirations finds virtue gone out of them .

		It is something to have gotten rid of a superfluous mysticism , but the morsels of un - critical pragmatism handed back taste a little stale and cold .

		What Wells misses is the slight skepti - cal weariness with which the living remnant of a younger generation is beginning to view the ease and blitheness of political pragmatists .

		Why has our scientifically trained and experimental generation in all countries put all its energy at the service of an industrialized statism ?

		Why do so many of our former minds of democratic good - will betray now so shallow an emotional compre - hension of the forces our war is raising up that they seem like children who witness passionate scenes between their elders with only a na'ive wonder what it can all be about ?

		Wells is not exactly glib , but he gives no hint for the future how we are to tame or sublimate the terrible mob unreasons that have made the `` social '' and the `` collective '' our old ideal fetishes into so bitter a mockery .

		When he offers us his old instru - ments , made for the creative life of society , we are impatient and hold off , not through sheer pique or inertia , but because we are honest enough to be suspicious even of ourselves and all the vali - ant brandishings we have made .

		But this morbid preoccupation with
Wells	PERSON	as an antebellum prophet should not blind us to the triumphant achievement that ``
Joan	PERSON	and Peter '' is .

		Never has he spread for us such a gorgeous sociological panorama .

		If he does the antebellum , he has done it with a superb bounce and com - petence that no one will ever surpass .

		This is not a novel ; it is a library ; it is a telescoped newspaper .

		It is everything that one needs to know about the public life of the significant classes in
England	LOCATION	for the last twenty-five years .

		BHIEFS ox NEW BOOKS THE DESERT .

		By
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	.

		Il - lustrated from photographs by
J. Smeaton Chase	ORGANIZATION	.

		Scribner ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The addition of photographic illustrations to the new edition of
Van Dyke	ORGANIZATION	's notable work on the American desert calls for another word of praise .

		To visualize the desert one must either see it , or see many pictures of it combined with an inspired description .

		Chase 's photographs and
Van Dyke	PERSON	's paragraphs reveal the desert almost as it is .

		Those who have seen it who have shriveled and thirsted in its burning heat , who have climbed its naked mountains , who have known its luscious color have in this book a more intimate interpreter of its vagaries .

		It re-creates the great arid stretches of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	pictor - ially , poetically , and scientifically such a satis - fying and altogether delightful blend as one seldom meets in an authoritative work .

		The fact that , after seventeen years in print , the subject matter is still fresh is evidence of something more than the changeless quality of the desert .

		THE HIVE .

		By
Will Levington Comfort	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This book arouses more curiosity than it satis - fies .

		It is formless , yet alive with an eager tensity that makes you wonder how a mind with so many ideas on the adventure that is life can elude any plan or design .

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	has much to say about the New Race and Democracy and Art and the Path of Life ; but he somehow manages to escape most of the platitudes that you have heard before .

		Through his discursiveness you get glimpses of a remarkable school-community on the shores of
Lake Erie	LOCATION	, where children and teachers pursued the quest of life together and gained much wisdom and poetical receptivity .

		Later they are all somehow in or about to be in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia , living a life of austere paganism in that divine climate by the sea .

		The book is dotted with the letters and compositions of the children , some of whom are at college or out in the world .

		Either Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	has hypnotized them into his style and ideas , or he has truly a new race of seven-year-olds .

		The profundity of their imagi - nation and poetic feeling strains your credulity to the breaking point .

		Why does he not tell us how such amazing children are produced ?

		There is an exhilarating taste of a new civilization of glorious youths and girls bathed in the sun and air of Greek-like
California	LOCATION	, living a life of sensuous austerity and wisdom and comradeship .

		The philosophy is not at all of the
Western	LOCATION	world , but is a vague yet appealing mysticism , with the Path of Life , and discipleship , and spiritual growth restored as the divine satisfac - tions of the soul .

		Is Mr. Comfort the fore - runner of a Californian mysticism which has con -
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 217 quered jargon and cant and has really assimilated the East for the working out of the `` good life '' ?

		His book is striking enough to make you want to track his ideas and implications down to the hive - to see whether the honey there is real .

		THE NEGRO IN LITERATURE AND ART .

		By
Benjamin Brawley	PERSON	.

		Duffield ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		In his preface the author promises to describe the achievement of the Negro in the
United States	LOCATION	measured `` by absolute rather than by partial or limited standards , '' meaning , one may infer , that the criteria are to be found in the history of arts and letters itself rather than in racial estimates .

		The purpose appeals to those who share in the hope of the author that `` some day the Negro will cease to be a problem and become a human being . ''

		Unfortunately the purpose fails of fulfillment .

		Such expressions as `` the grand epic of the race , '' `` foremost com - poser of the race , '' `` foremost man of the race in pure literature , '' `` the longest poem yet writ - ten by a Negro in
America	LOCATION	, '' jerk back into the old confines of racial comparison the refugee from the racial point of view .

		We are invited to consider not the work of artists who happen to be Negroes , but the work of Negroes who hap - pen to be artists .

		Nor is there much apprecia - tion shown of the work of Negroes in so far as they are , not successes , but artists .

		The book is a catalogue of pictures , books , statues , songs , and so on , and a listing of prizes and honorable mentions rather than a study of contributions to art and literature .

		USE YOUR GOVERNMENT .

		By
Alissa Franc	ORGANIZATION	.

		Button ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		As early as
1839 Congress	ORGANIZATION	appropriated
$ 1000	MONEY	`` for the purpose of collecting and distributing seeds , prosecuting agricultural investigations , and procuring agricultural statistics . ''

		The De - partment of Agriculture has since extended the scope of its activities so consistently that it is now expending an appropriation of upwards of
$ 7,000,000	MONEY	annually and employing in the neighborhood of 20,000 workers .

		Perhaps no other single factor , through the years of peace , has been more potent than this in keeping alive the national spirit .

		`` Use Your Government '' is an exposition of what the national govern - ment , through its various departments , is accom - plishing in promoting activities for the well - being of its citizens .

		The case of the farmer , where by far the most notable success has been achiered , is taken up in detail , from the plant - ing and growing of crops to the development of cooperative selling plans .

		Other chapters are devoted to national aid extended to the would - be settler , the man in business , the working man , the Negro , the woman in the home , to boys and girls , and -LRB- chapters of too scant achievement -RRB- to the immigrant .

		Miss Franc 's book would be of more practical worth to the average citizen if it were accompanied by a chart , or series of charts , enumerating the vari - ous bureaus of governmental activity and the character of aid and information which each has at its disposal .

		The lack of this impairs its accessibility as a work of ready reference , but the volume is adapted admirably for use by teachers of civics in American schools .

		RUSSIA IN
UPHEAVAL	LOCATION	.


Ross	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		By
Edward A	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a useful record , rich in fact and illum - inating incident , of an extensive tour through European and
Asiatic Russia	LOCATION	.

		Our wanderlustig professor entered
Siberia	LOCATION	with anarchist exiles from
America	LOCATION	and tells how they set to work to `` govern ''
Russia	LOCATION	as soon as they set foot in
Vladi	LOCATION	- vostok .

		The disintegration of order appears spontaneously as the narrative proceeds .

		Trains leave never on schedule , and sometimes only on threat of death to the stationmaster .

		At one point a troop train , by force of undisciplined bay - onets , wins precedence over the express , pulls out without orders , runs into a freight train , and 401 soldiers are burned to death .

		A people coerced into ignorance during centuries of brutal oppres - sion must leap into license when liberty comes .

		But order is returning : the blows of disaster are slowly molding Russian wilfulness into con - structive will .

		Reorganization would have come more rapidly and easily had not social criticism been heated to intransigeant rebellion by
Siberia	LOCATION	and universal compulsory ignorance .

		Destructive revolution is the price that must be paid for the refusal of free speech and education , and for lack of a statesmanlike intelligence capable of foresee - ing changes in the distribution of economic power .

		Yet through all the chaos even the oversophisti - cated can see the Russian sense of brotherhood as the bearer of reasonable hope for the future .

		The emphasis in this book is on the helpfulness and kindliness of the Russians .

		It is a point which might have borne more stress : in these qualities , after all , are the roots of democracy , rather than in political forms and creeds ; the Russians hare these many centuries outdone us in democracy because they have surpassed us in kindly fellow - ship and spontaneous cooperation ; the Revolution merely gives political sanction to a psychological fait accompli .

		Professor
Ross	PERSON	maintains that equal division , as in the commercial land system , has failed wher - ever applied , and argues that private ownership is the indispensable stimulus to prudent hus - bandry .

		And a valuable chapter surveying the 218 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
September 19	DATE	industrial methods established by the Soviet com - mittees , while regretting the absurdly extreme de - mands made by the workers and the outburst of sloth that came as the natural reaction to centuries of slave driving , yet affirms the high value of many of the innovations now being made in the relations of Russian labor and capital , particularly the representation of labor on all industrial boards .

		Professor
Ross	PERSON	makes the oft neglected distinction between the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	and the So - viets , and argues that the Soviets are the only `` party of order '' in
Russia	LOCATION	today , unless the order which we desire for
Russia	LOCATION	is the Prussian feudal order which German slaves are establishing for their masters .

		The Russian bourgeoisie is irrevoc - ably pro-German ; and Allied aid given in that direction always turns out to be pearls cast before swine .

		Given another half-year of sobering re - sponsibility , and the boiling Soviets will simmer down to a rational adaptation of ideals to possi - bilities , and may very well serve as a valuable experiment in the decentralization of government .

		The book concludes with an appeal for a more generous and enlightened patience with what the author believes are the passing excesses and in - firmities of the Revolution .

		THE JOYS OF BEING A WOMAN .

		By
Wini	PERSON	- fred
Kirkland	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Of recent years it has been so customary to hear about the hardships of being a woman that one opens `` The Joys of Being a Woman '' with some curiosity .

		That curiosity is not satisfied .

		One is conscious of reservations : `` the little shy soul thing , the naked ego , with its eerie eyes , '' escapes us .

		The essays which make up this book deal with people , places , things , and of course with the preferences and prejudices of the writer .

		They have the charm of a buoyant and sympa - thetic personality , and show observation and humor ; but they give happy expression to every - day thought rather than independent and original views of life , and they leave the reader in some doubt as to the writer 's grasp of its fundamental values .

		The first essay , which gives its name to the volume , is the least satisfactory ; it is labored and unconvicing , and its satire does not ring true .

		`` The Woman Who Writes '' throws some light at first hand on the reasons for the difference in the intellectual accomplishment of men and women .

		With a woman it is too often the case of a choice between personal relations and her art or profession , and `` in any crucial choice a real woman chooses living rather than literature . ''

		She reckons `` her spirit 's capital , not in terms of accomplishment , but in terms of her own joy . ''

		The essay entitled `` Difficulties in Doing Without Eternity '' contains some caustic , and perhaps not unmerited , criticism of contemporary values and ascribes the modern desire for short cuts to health , wealth , and happiness , and the surrender of the modern man and woman to the insistent ma - terialism of the day , to the loss of the point of view of the eternal .

		Miss
Kirkland	PERSON	is successful in catching and suggesting fleeting moods and im - pressions ; her characterization is entertaining and her descriptions of nature are vivid and stimulat - ing .

		But she still leaves undescribed those specific joys which prompted her title .

		IDEA AND ESSENCE IN THE PHILOSOPHIES OF HOBBES AND SPINOZA .

		By
Albert G. A. Balz	PERSON	.

		Archives of Philosophy .


Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Philosophy in
America	LOCATION	is placed under an obli - gation to the philosophical faculty of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	by these studies in the history of thought .

		For , first , the book comes in a period of philosophic dearth , so far as publications are con - cerned ; and second , it appears at a time when historical sanity is tremendously needed , an invigoration of the historical sense ; while in a third place , the essays are uncommonly interest - ing .

		They comprise three essays on Greek philos - ophy , eight on seventeenth and eighteenth cen - tury thinkers -LRB-
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	,
Descartes	LOCATION	,
Spi	LOCATION	- noza ,
Berkeley	LOCATION	, Dr.
Brown	PERSON	and with these ought to be placed the two capable doctorate theses , published in the `` Archives '' -RRB- , and two studies in modern logic , each marked by shrewd criticism .

		Three aspects of the collection espe - cially deserve a reviewer 's note .

		The key to the collection is very clearly
John J. Coss	PERSON	's ``
Francis Bacon	PERSON	and the History of Philosophy , '' in which he points out that
Bacon	PERSON	's healthy conception of the history of philosophy as an integral part of the whole history of culture men 's thought taken in its living context if not forgotten , has yet to their damage been disregarded by the historians of the subject , most of them Germans .

		Says Professor
Dewey	PERSON	-LRB- in `` The Motivation of Hobbes 's Philosophy '' -RRB- : The history of thought is peculiarly exposed to an illusion of perspective .

		Earlier doctrines are always getting shoved , as it were , nearer our own day .

		We are familiar with the intellectual struggles of our own time and are interested in them .

		It is accord - ingly natural to envisage earlier thought as part of the same movement or as its forerunner .

		We then forget that that earlier period had its own specific problems , and we proceed to assimilate its discussions to our present interest .

		He goes on to correct , strikingly , some of the misconceptions associated with Hobbes .

		The whole group of essays falls into the same temper ,
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, 219 which is pragmatically expressed by Professor
Bush	PERSON	's sagacious aphorism -LRB- in `` An Impression of Greek Political Philosophy '' -RRB- : `` The ideals of a people are a function of its experience . ''

		Whether corollary to this conscious historical program or incident to the hour , a second notable feature of the collection is the stress upon the pathfinding work of British thinkers
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	,
Berkeley	LOCATION	.

		Even American students of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment have found it difficult to get away from the German conception that philosophy from
Descartes	LOCATION	to
Hume	PERSON	was , as it were , a consciously dramatic preparation for the entry of
Kant	PERSON	and his chorus a mummery of historic fact if ever there were one .

		Here the Germans are notably absent , even from the index , while one can not but feel that a substantial contribution has been made , in the several studies , toward that great desideratum of the English-speaking world an historical study of British speculative genius .

		Something of the British character is indeed indicated in the third outstanding trait of the `` Studies '' ; namely , their stress upon political problems .

		This , to be sure , is tertiary ; there is plenty of pure metaphysics in the discussions ; but it is sufficiently emphatic to keep alert one 's consciousness that , after all 1 , the vitality of philosophy is its political character politics being taken in that broad gauge which makes it to comprehend all structures of men 's thinking which bring them to mutual understand - ing and free cooperation ... One ought to remark , in parting , that the well-maintained thesis of the first essay -LRB-
McClure	PERSON	's `` Appearance and Reality in Greek Philosophy '' -RRB- , that `` Real - ity is a choice of values , '' gets an odd-angled cor - roboration from the logical studies at the close .

		The editors may or may not have been aware of this , but it gives their volume a unity one does not expect to find in so varied a collection .

		KARMA .

		By
Algernon Blackwood	PERSON	and Vio - let
Pearn	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		One must recognize the limitations of any art form used as a medium for propaganda .

		And it is equally certain that in `` Karma : A Reincar - nation Play , '' either
Algernon Blackwood	PERSON	or
Violet Pearn	PERSON	, or both , have neglected this funda - mental .

		In `` Milestones '' in `` The Phantom Rival '' more particularly , to which this play bears a not too striking resemblance we were impressed with the absence of dramatic power which almost inevitably accompanies the episodic play , especially the play where , in each of the acts , the situations are so paralleled that all sus - pense ordinarily aroused by the unfolding action vanishes .

		As `` The Phantom Rival '' dealt with the vagaries of a hero in a dream world , so does `` Karma '' concern itself with the psychological wonderings and abnormalities of its heroine .

		But the great advantage it has over the former , and similar dream plays , is that
Algernon Blackwood	PERSON	is one of the justly recognized masters of the world of mysticism .

		Whatever we think of him as a dramatist , he carries weight and distinction as an investigator of the occult , as an experi - menter with the subconscious , as an interpreter of what , to most of us , is the magical side of natural phenomena .

		But ideas of reincarnation , even of the reincarnation of a love-life , do not constitute a play .

		And if he called on
Miss Pearn	PERSON	to supply `` a story told in action , '' he failed to get what alone could have rescued him .

		Even an unusual theme , an analysis of our past existences , which has on occasion puzzled even the most materialistic , needs a sound foundation .

		Given as a skeleton for that mental state the eternal conflict between mated love and civic duty , as omnipresent as it is vital , given a feeling for style uncommon in even `` literary '' playwrighting , it is unfortunate that no better a drama than this could have been constructed .

		Its inception is original ; its development labored ; its finality unimportant .

		And as a matter of structural fact , Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	ought to realize that label - ing as `` prolog '' and `` epilog '' material as rele - vant to the main action as are the beginning and the end of `` Karma , '' does not for a moment keep the reader from sensing that it forms , actu - ally , acts one and five .

		Perhaps , in the field of dramatic art , two heads are no better than one .

		THE ECLIPSE OF
RUSSIA	LOCATION	.

		By Dr.
E. J. Dillon	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	is known to the American public through the `` Foreign Affairs '' of the `` Contem - porary Review , '' which he has been writing now for many years .

		There are few men who have followed the history and politics of
Russia	LOCATION	, and of the
Balkans	LOCATION	and
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	, with such thoroughness and with the advantage of such intimate contact .

		One does not hesitate to state that Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	knows
Russia	LOCATION	perhaps bet - ter than any other outsider .

		When he discusses the intrigues that went on in the government and .

		court of the former Czar we are not reading the notes of a purveyor of gossip , but the observations of a close student of international affairs .

		The `` predatory '' character of the old regime is shown up in a most convincing manner , and from the inside .

		For Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	himself says that he was a confidential adviser of the late Count
Witte	PERSON	, to whom his book is dedicated .

		At one time we thought that Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	had become for the mo - ment merely the troubadour of this very able Russian stateman he calls him
Russia	LOCATION	's `` unique statesman . ''


Witte	PERSON	was without question one of the ablest men in
Russia	LOCATION	, and also one of the most unscrupulous .

		The best evidence of the latter fact is that for the last ten years of his life he was `` isolated , '' no group in
Russia	LOCATION	having enough confidence in him to accept him even as a mem - ber after he had lost the leadership in the bureau - cracy .

		But Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	at several points seems to 220 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 19	DATE	admit the same thing , when he explains how
Witte	PERSON	became caught in the `` system , '' powerless to resist or to combat it .

		It is possible that one was unfair and unjust to
Witte	PERSON	, and that he was in fact a liberal .

		But the reviewer recalls the state - ment made to him personally by
Witte	PERSON	in
1907	DATE	to the effect that he had urged the Czar to grant the
Duma	LOCATION	because it was the only way out of the situation , adding that he did not believe in constitutionalism .

		Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	himself reflects this opinion of his close friend when he generalizes on the present Russian chaos .

		And here one should say frankly that this last work of Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	's , which is full of most fundamental facts which only he could give us , lacks perspective .

		It is entitled `` The Eclipse of
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	is an old and a disappointed man .


Russia	LOCATION	is now in chaos , and will remain so for some years to come .

		Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	will not see the working out of the great Russian problem .

		His close association with the
Russia	LOCATION	of the old regime , though he always protested against the blind reactionary policies of the `` predatory '' bureaucracy , makes it difficult for him to accept the present phase of Bolshevism , with its chaos and anarchy .

		Finally , he has not been `` used '' these last years , either in
Russia	LOCATION	or in the
Balkans	LOCATION	.

		The mistakes of British policy in both these places are now generally admitted .

		For this rea - son , perhaps , there is the touch of bitterness in the last writings of this well-known authority on the international relations in
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	.

		But again it must be emphasized that Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	gives us here a most valuable mass of material , much of it first-hand and heretofore unpublished , on the
Russia	LOCATION	of the old regime .

		The German influence in
Russia	LOCATION	's internal affairs , of which one has heard much but somewhat vaguely , is shown here by actual facts and `` documents . ''

		THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF MYSTI -
CISM	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Charles M. Addison	PERSON	.

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		PROBLEMS OF MYSTICISM AND ITS SYM - BOLISM .

		By
Herbert Silberer	PERSON	.

		Translated by Dr.
Jelliffe	PERSON	.

		Moffatt ,
Yard	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		In compiling a bibliography on mysticism for one knowing nothing about the subject but wish - ing to study it carefully , we should put the first of these books first and the Silberer volume last .

		`` The Theory and Practice of Mysticism '' is a good introduction to mysticism , stating in simple form what it is , what it has accomplished , and what are its possibilities for one sympathetic to its claims .

		It is a `` first book , '' and like many first books does not scratch deeply .

		Dr.
Silberer	PERSON	's book , which moves in the realm of Freudian psychoanalysis , is a significant con - tribution to the study of the psychology of mysti - cism .

		Its argument is that the creative uncon - scious , utilizing elements of a purposeless and irrational life of impulses that formed the sym - bolism of dreams , is found in the background of fairy stories , myths , alchemy ,
Rosicrucianism	PERSON	, Free Masonry , and religious mysticism .

		Mysti - cism , which struggles for union with divinity , is the most extensive and therefore psychically the most internal unfolding of the religious life ; it stimulates a much more powerful sublimation of impulses than the conventional education of man - kind .

		`` The object of religious worship is regu - larly to be regarded as a symbol of the libido , that psychological goddess who rules the desires of mankind , and whose prime minister is Eros . ''

		Thus the author , in finding at the heart of religion the titanic or suppressed psychic dross , takes a long step towards the sexualization of the universe .

		But even granting for a moment the author 's right to reduce all to the sex impulse and exclude consideration of the potent food impulse , this psychoanalytic unmasking of the impelling power can not prejudice the intrinsic value of mysticism .

		WILLIAM
PENN	LOCATION	, FOUNDER OF PENNSYL - VANIA .

		By
John W. Graham	PERSON	.

$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		From the account of
Penn	LOCATION	's life in the first volume of the `` Collected Works , ''
1726	DATE	-LRB- re - printed in `` Everyman 's '' -RRB- , eight years after his death , to Mrs.
Colquhoun Grant	PERSON	's interesting but inaccurate `` Quaker and Courtier '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	,
1907	DATE	-RRB- there have been some eleven biographies of the founder of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, besides a long list of monographs .

		The present volume de - pends upon no manuscript investigation ; the author is aware that
Albert Cook Myers	PERSON	is `` collecting in enormous trunks every scrap of matter written by or about
Penn	LOCATION	, '' and awaits with others its publication in fifteen or twenty monumental volumes by a committee in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		Yet
Graham	PERSON	's book is an intelligent and not ignoble contribution , distinctive as being written from the point of view of a thoughtful and gifted English Quaker of today , sympa - thetic to his sect and its history but like so many Quakers quietly and uncombatively appre - ciative of other outlooks on life , and distinctive too in its emphasis on
Penn	LOCATION	's multitudinous writ - ings and on
Penn	LOCATION	's so frequently misunderstood characteristics .

		Penn stands out as the founder of the most forward-looking , progressive , of the settlements .

		The `` Frame of Government '' drawn up by
Penn	LOCATION	was , in its reverence for humanity and in its democratic trust in the com - mon people , the practical expression of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	religious philosophy , and is instructively compared with the conservative constitution of the Carolinas devised by his friend , the political philosopher and academic aristocrat ,
John Locke	PERSON	.

		But for the present moment nothing of
Penn	LOCATION	's political or humanitarian achievement in prac - tice , nothing that he actually established for
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and thence for the
United States	LOCATION	,

		The con - cept of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	was fully devel - oped in

Penn	LOCATION	, the practical-minded mystic , the man who so often translated his spiritual visions into social facts , may yet be justified in this too for we will not doubt that men of his kind are about to be abroad in the world again .

		THE ROOTS OF THE WAR .

		By
William Stearns Davis	PERSON	, in collaboration with Will - iam
Anderson	PERSON	and
Mason W. Tyler	PERSON	.

		Cen - tury ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The main thesis of this volume is `` that the Pan-Germanists had gained control of the wills and purposes of the disposing personages in the Teutonic empires and had already prepared the magazine of explosives which now -LSB-
1914	DATE	-RSB- took fire . ''

		In support of this proposition the authors recount in considerable detail the long and tor - tuous story of international politics and European diplomacy from
July , 1870	DATE	to
August , 1914	DATE	.

		The story is told in twenty-four chapters , of which Professor
Davis	PERSON	has contributed eighteen and his collaborators three each .

		With the conclusions presented the reviewer has no fault to find ; he re - grets to say however that these conclusions are too often obtained at the expense of good taste and sometimes even of historical accuracy .

		A German historian once remarked that history should be written in anger , and there seems to have been a certain measure of wrath at the point of Professor
Davis	PERSON	's pen when he traced the `` roots of the war . ''

		Anger is often justifiable , but it rarely adds to the value of historical writ - ing .

		The chapter entitled `` the last years in the fool 's paradise '' seems to be written in decidedly bad taste .

		This is a violent and largely uncalled for attack on the `` pacifists '' who during the dec - ade preceding the war tried to impress mankind with the futility of war as a method of settling international disputes and to make impossible such a conflict as is raging in the world today .

		It is cheerfully admitted that the presumptions of the peace movement were largely mistaken ; but
Norman Angell	PERSON	's main contention , that war is after all a rather poor investment , has a great measure of truth in it as the Pan-Germanists are likely to discover when the present war is over .

		One is puzzled to know why attention should be called to the `` German antecedents , habits , and sympathies '' of a certain pacifist congressman , especially since Professor
Davis	PERSON	assures us that he was `` undoubtedly loyal to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The some - what sarcastic allusions to `` spectacled professors '' and `` fiction-mongers '' may perhaps be perfectly proper and apropos ; the author , who is a pro- fessor and also something of a novelist , doubtless appreciates more fully than most of us what frail vessels these types of intellectuals really are .

		FROM
SHAKESPEARE TO O. HENRY	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
S. P. B. Mais	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Mais	PERSON	's book is neither a disguised his - tory of literature nor a study in best sellers from the
sixteenth century	DATE	to the present , but merely a collection of essays dealing with more or less striking writers from
Shakespeare to O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	, of whom nearly all are the latter 's contem - poraries .

		One endeavor of the essayist is to bring his readers into close personal touch with the authors whose works he is criticizing , and in some cases he succeeds while in others he does not .

		The novelist
Samuel Butler	PERSON	in his `` Note - books '' affords excellent material for this treat - ment , and Mr.
Mais	PERSON	makes the most of it .

		We have a very attractive picture of
Butler	PERSON	with his delight in shocking the orthodox , his `` exhilarating irreverence , his amazing candour and entire absence of self - consciousness . ''

		There is however no such material at hand for a knowledge of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and when Mr.
Mais	PERSON	tries to make the * plays supply the lack , he falls into the trap that has caught many a prede - cessor .

		When he groups Hamlet ,
Vincentio	LOCATION	,
Orsino	PERSON	,
Prospero	ORGANIZATION	,
Macbeth	LOCATION	,
Posthumus	PERSON	, and
Richard II	PERSON	, `` as like in nearly all points to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself ... Shakespeare , the gentle , the passionate , the irresolute , '' we would counter by making a group of our own with lago , lachimo ,
Edmund	PERSON	,
Don John	PERSON	,
Richard III	PERSON	, and Angelo as like in nearly all points to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		And why should Mr.
Mais	PERSON	regard it as a reflection upon
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genius that he never depicted a man of action like Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	or
Frobisher	PERSON	?

		He showed a certain sympathy for the type when he gave us Petruchio ,
Henry IV	PERSON	,
Henry V	PERSON	,
Richard III	PERSON	, lago , and
Antony	PERSON	in ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		Not even
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is as multitudinous as life itself .

		The fact is , one can prove almost anything from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and disprove it .

		It is wiser to take him objectively and be content .

		Mr.
Mais	PERSON	has some very sympathetic com - ments and criticisms on modern verse .

		Particu - larly happy are his quotations from the unpre - meditated school verses of his pupils , who show their love for their master and their poetic sen - sitiveness .

		There are certain judgments scat - tered here and there throughout the book that one might object to .

		It is hard to agree en - tirely with Mr.
Mais	PERSON	when he says that
Mase	PERSON	- field 's `` Widow in the Bye Street '' is to be pre - ferred to `` The Everlasting Mercy , '' and that
O. Henry	PERSON	is `` a vastly diverting raconteur , poig - nant in his pathos , terrible in his tragedy , witty , urbane and kindly in his humour , '' or `` Uvhen he groups
Martin Tupper	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Longfellow	PERSON	as `` outstanding instances of versifiers . ''

		Why should Byron be sunk to this nethermost pit ?

		222 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 19	DATE	NOTES or NEW FICTIOX Mr.
Updegraff	PERSON	's first novel , `` Second Youth , '' received far too little appreciation .

		It was an unusually delightful extravaganza , skirting the edges of
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	and
Woodstock	LOCATION	, and displaying the amazing adventures of a refined bachelor silk-salesman who suddenly begins to see life .

		The story was done with an inimitably light touch , with an amusingness that scarcely ever faltered , and a deftness extraordinary for a first book .

		The question whether such a book promised us a writer of charm and taste has been answered decisively in its successor .

		In `` Strayed Revellers '' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- Mr.
Updegraff	PERSON	makes it unmistakably clear that he has no intention of developing this talent with which he began .

		The story starts amusingly enough with the determinedly truthful and wise young virgin
Clotilde	PERSON	, coming from her researches in the Village to impose herself on the life of her newly discovered father , a broken-down farmer of
Woodstock	LOCATION	.

		But the complications that fol - low get so tangled with the author 's views on the war as to make most of the chapters didactic where they are n't silly .

		His belaborings of the Village pacifists are a contribution to patriotism , but they tend to spoil the story .

		The trouble with that futile society of `` anti-war talk and free love '' which he scorns was that it endlessly discussed and analyzed things that should have been impulsive .

		Unfortunately Mr.
Updegraff	PERSON	does not escape the blight himself .

		He makes his Edna explain copiously why she feels like a transfigured heroine when her artist husband drops his successful painting and goes off to enlist .

		Clotilde 's grudging conversion both to war and love takes place in a dense steam of analysis .

		And her moonlight romance with the regenerated aviator-poet , on the eve of their mar - riage and his return to the front , simply swims in his opinions of the Germans , the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	, the pacifists and intellectuals ,
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, Truth , and Beauty .

		Though these people are saved for the book has a decided moral they sound suspiciously like the old Adam .

		Homer
Croy	PERSON	's `` Boone Stop '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is an unusual story .

		Its originality consists in a directness and strength so remarkable that they may even be mistaken for crudity .

		There is nothing in the book of the refinement of life which the average novelist regards as `` artistic '' or `` literary . ''

		It is a frank story of rude people who live in the
Ozarks	LOCATION	and are what they are de - spite the accepted canons of twentieth century `` culture . ''

		Cleveland Seed grew up in a family who knew no other social criterion than the teach - ing of `` The Word . ''

		Cleveland 's father accepted the Biblttt literally , even in matters of farming and family discipline .

		Whenever
Cleveland	LOCATION	broke through the taboo of religious precept , as he frequently did , the sting of the rod was sharp - ened by Biblical texts .

		In spite of this he lived the life of the normal `` child of Adam '' and his right to do so was tolerated , if not admitted , when his father 's revelation foretelling the end of the world brought forth nothing more horri - fic than a summer thunderstorm .

		It was after that incident that the Seed family moved to a mining village and
Cleveland	LOCATION	came in contact with the world .

		If you would be interested in the unvarnished life of an Ozark mining com - munity , you will enjoy this story .

		Sometimes the author 's training in the realm of motion pictures -LRB- he has written the classic treatise on that subject -RRB- inspires in him a nervous desire for incident and `` business , '' which is unnecessary in a story as full of character interest as this .

		The new objective literary method employed by some modern novel writers exposes the work - ings of the minds of men and women with piti - less realism and makes the reader grope , as indeed he must in life , to discover those reactions which are truly significant .

		Something of the same dis - cernment is required from the reader of Miss Sidgwick 's latest novel , `` Jamesie '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- : he has to dig out the story for himself from a mass of rather intractable mate - rial ; but if he has the patience to do so , he even - tually finds himself possessed of an insight into character and an understanding of conditions of life that no mere description or narration could have given him .

		The book takes the form of a correspondence between the members and friends of the household of the
Duke of Wickford	ORGANIZATION	, and much of the difficulty encountered by the reader is due to the inarticulateness of the British nature , faithfully portrayed in these letters , which show a realistic absence of literary style and frequently a refreshing absence of grammar . '

		The social setting is strikingly feudal , but it is a feudalism of so democratic a nature that , to the head of the family , the happiness of a child , the love affairs of a servant , the sickness of a horse are of hardly less importance than matters of vital public inter - est , and certainly have as much claim to his per - sonal attention .

		The characters in this book move against a background of serious national move - ments : we sense the suffrage disturbance in Eng - land , the unrest in
Ireland	LOCATION	, and the events in
Europe	LOCATION	which preceded the outbreak of the war ; but the story is chiefly concerned with the inter - play of character and the workings of the obscure forces of life which are revealed in the apparently unimportant incidents of daily living .

		And when the war does break out we feel that the interests of the writers of the letters are not greatly changed , `` that men and women are not so easily alterable , in or out of war ... It neither alters the good nor glorifies the bad : and the best it wastes steadily . ''

		Against this background of international misadjustment , and of social and domestic amenities and passions , moves
Jamesie	PERSON	, the little son of Lord
Iveagh Suir	PERSON	and his artist
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 223 wife ,
Bess Jamesie	PERSON	, whose short ill-spelt letters are woven into the correspondence like little golden threads .

		How the war affected
Jamesie	PERSON	shall not be told here , but as one reaches the end of the story one understands the note of sorrowful questioning which runs through it and culminates in the words of Gabriel du Frettay , the gallant French aviator : The cataract of a whole generation down the smooth chute to death is it worth it ?

		... Our children are not our own , in the sense of being slaves to our prejudices .

		Even now they are growing up , and granted we refrain from touching , they will ques - tion in time .

		How far are we to risk their displeasure , their bewilderment , their wonder , worst of all ?

		I can see him wondering , seeking a little already , in his first sunlight Jamesie ... It 's frightful , the mere thought of such judges watching us outside God of Battles , any sort but that !

		As war stories go ,
William J. Locke	PERSON	's `` The Rough Road '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is a remarkable tale .

		A year ago Mr.
Locke	PERSON	wrote a story of the war which was as unconvincing as it was lurid .

		But in this story there is the feeling of a man under whose feet the earth is solid in the presence of cataclysms .

		In the present tale , Mr.
Locke	PERSON	occupies himself with life as it emerges from the fog of war .

		For him life continues , evolves , and even finds achievement .

		The interest aroused by this story of a young English gentleman is cumulative .

		The earlier chapters , in which no more serious problems than the subtilties of an ivory and peacock sitting-room are encountered , impress the reader as being remote and thin .

		The predominance of scarlet these last four years has blunted our sensibilities to the more aesthetic tones .

		When young
Trevor	PERSON	was confronted with the scarlet of war he cringed .

		But he was forced to accept the scarlet color scheme because it was `` the thing to do . ''

		It is at this point that Mr.
Locke	PERSON	impresses us as being a genuine artist ; instead of occupying himself with the extrinsic glamours of officers ' uniforms and honors such as might be anticipated for so well-born a hero , he sloughs off convention and gets at the 1 real man underneath
Trevor	PERSON	's gentlemanly exterior .

		So long as
Trevor	PERSON	acted in accordance with his inbred sense of `` the proper '' thing he failed .

		Not until he came face to face with himself , as a human being no better and no worse than other human beings , did he make good .

		Even then he failed to win a decoration ; he did not even keep the love of the patrician to whom he had been engaged in the old days of ivory and peacock .

		But the reader puts aside the book with a welcome respect for human character and for Mr.
Locke	PERSON	as a writer .

		The prudish and the emancipated can agree upon the `` unpleasantness '' of Mr.
Norris	PERSON	's new book `` Salt , or the Education of
Griffith Adams	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		There is no savor to Mr.
Norris	PERSON	's new salt .

		A labored , mechanical style drags out this story of a young American 's career in school and college and business .

		The name of a
Boston Adams	LOCATION	is given to the excep - tionally tricky , petty , and unpromising youth .

		If the author 's motif is the decay of the
New England	LOCATION	stock , his portrayal of
Griffith Adams	PERSON	as a type is singularly unconvincing .

		If it is an exposure of the purposelessness of American education , he has failed , because most of his horror is reserved for the upper-class fraternity life .

		His researches into sex-psychology have a certain ugly plainness , which illuminates noth - ing , and his revelations of business corruption will startle no one , though his own breath is rather bated as he speaks .

		The story has none of the beauty of realism , for it is so completely without background .

		It is more like a selected chamber of war horrors .

		No life runs through the veins of pallid
Griffith	PERSON	nor through the society in which he lives .

		Good realism depends on a sense of the significance of all life .

		Mr.
Norris	PERSON	is utterly incapable of suggesting significance .

		It depends also on a robust , implicit , tacit feeling for the ideal , for what this so much frustrated and erring life might have been .

		But the author gives no hint whatever as to what his hero might have developed into if he had not become the savorless
Griffith Adams	PERSON	.

		He can not pretend that the book is a mere study in futility , for in the last chapter he gets
Griffith	PERSON	neatly con - demned in a second marriage , and as far as one can see , most unjustifiedly lets him walk `` into his rightful heritage . ''

		The only true unpleas - antness of fiction is falsity , and `` Salt '' is full of unpleasantness .

		Given a patriotic theme and a moderately good plot , such as characterizes
Freeman Tilden	PERSON	's `` Khaki '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , almost any author is assured of popular success today .

		The sig - nificant feature of this novel of the patriotic awakening of a
New England	LOCATION	village is the quality of the workmanship which Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	has put into what is essentially only an ephemeral story .

		Few people will remember a year from now that such as book as `` Khaki '' ever existed ; but those who read it will remember that Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	is a writer of ability , one who has the innate honesty of the self-respecting craftsman .


Maria Thompson Daviess	ORGANIZATION	writes with remark - able charm .

		It is this quality that differentiates her rather slight story `` The Golden Bird '' -LRB- Cen - tury ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- from the mass of women 's journal tales of fortunes made by lovely ladies through the simple device of raising golden eggs from the homely hen .

		She not only invests her amus - ing assortment of characters with likable person - alities , but she even succeeds in portraying the character of a rooster and making him an influ - ence on the lives of those fortunate enough to come within his sphere .

		The freshness and enthusiasm with which she writes quickly per - suade the reader to cast credulity to the winds and follow the Golden Bird to a happy ending .

		224 THE DIAL , -LSB-
September 19	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT BETWEEN THE DOCTRINAIRE NEGATIVISM OF the
St. Louis	LOCATION	platform and the
1918	DATE	Congres - sional programme of the Socialist party there is a fundamental difference in tone and method of approach which will be welcomed by every lib - eral .

		As far as its official programme for the fall campaign goes , the Socialist party has ac - cepted the war as a fact .

		The programme falls naturally into nine sections , and of these only the first three are primarily devoted to the interna - tional probems of war and peace .

		The remain - ing six deal specifically , as well as in general terms , with the domestic problems of reconstruc - tion .

		And even in the introductory three sections the programme has none of the intransigeant bitterness of the
St. Louis	LOCATION	declaration .

		The `` peace aims '' of the party are only a reaffirmation of the Russian formula of no annexations and no indemnities , to which has been added the new slogan : `` No economic nationalism , no war after the war . ''

		The party announces itself in general sympathy with the declared aims of the
Inter - Allied Conference	ORGANIZATION	, and of course protests against the refusal of passports to bona fide representa - tives of accredited labor and minority political parties .

		All this was to have been expected ; but it was not to have been expected that the temper of these demands and statements of belief should be so moderate and sanely balanced .

		Least of all was it to have been expected that in its fall Con - gressional platform the Socialist party should have swung the center of gravity over from pro- test against the continuance of the war to the issues of immediate and future domestic recon - struction .

		It is especially gratifying that the framers of the platform should at this particular time have chosen the sensible tactics of entering again the world of reality .

		Not only will the more constructive and popularly appealing pro- posals automatically become a kind of liberalizing influence on the platforms of the old parties but , best of all , there is again a chance for issues , in - stead of a futile quarrel about patriotism , to be injected into the campaign .

		By its original atti - tude the Socialist party was forced into a purely unfertile protective position .

		It had to and still , to too great an extent , has to defend itself from the charges of disloyalty .

		But if the cam - paign orators and party leaders can now concen - trate upon specific issues of reconstruction , the focus of public opinion about the party as a whole will be steadily , if imperceptibly , shifted .

		The members of the party will have a larger margin of freedom to meet constructive problems .

		They can begin to put some of their intellectual energy where it belongs on genuine economic and social questions .

		The world has need of every ounce of constructive thought today .

		We can not afford to waste real ability , even for the pleasure of call - ing bad names .

		And the marks of real ability are happily plain in the programme .

		It is not the place here to discuss the programme in detail .

		Certain features of it however are notable : a pro- posed international commission with executive and legislative as well as judicial powers to fix a uniform international fiscal and exchange system and to control investments in `` weak '' countries ; the full nationalization of railroads and other means of transportation , to be bought chiefly out of taxation and operating revenues ; the public ownership and control of every large - scale essential industry whose operations extend beyond the borders of a single state -LRB- coordinating to that end the present war industries and trade boards , the federal trade commission , and the federal food and fuel administrations -RRB- ; the demo - cratic control of industry by the workers , includ - ing a recommendation for shop committees and guaranteed employment ; politically , the abolition of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, with an executive responsible directly to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and to the people , and then the abolition of the power of the courts to declare acts of the legislature unconstitutional ; the pro- gressive income , inheritance , and unused land taxes ; the recommendation of public or free cooperative operation of farms ; public ownership of natural resources ; specific labor legislation and reform of criminal procedure and methods of reform ; the enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment .

		All this of course is a large order , and it is doubtful if but a small minority of the electorate will agree with it in toto .

		What counts however is the clearness and directness of the programme , together with its wide range , which embraces practically every issue open to political dispute .

		Finally , it is a Socialist party programme that for the first time in the history of the movement in this country is definitely and essentially American in its applicability .

		It reads as the product of home rather than foreign thought .

		It is flexible and pragmatic in the best sense .

		It wrestles with specific American prob - lems instead of attempting to enunciate pure a priori principles .

		It is a living document , not a doctrinaire creed .

		THE AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SYS - tem is facing the first grave crisis in its history .

		There have been other pedagogical storms , but they have all blown over .

		Great battles were fought over the introduction of natural science into the public schools , over the separation of his - tory and civics , over the substitution of modern languages for ancient tongues .

		And yet all these were trivial matters in comparison with the issue at hand today .

		Now the public schools are face to face with a real task the task of preparing millions of boys and girls for citizenship in a changing world of rising democracy .

		It is one thing to teach the principles of citizenship in a static society where ndthing changes and all is settled forever , where the village priest performs
1918	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAXi 225 the ancient rites , the housewife cards her wool , and the peasant plods about his weary tasks with scythe and flail .

		It is another thing to prepare for citizenship in a progressive democracy with staggering domestic and foreign problems , the decision of which must at last come home to the judgment of the people .

		Democrats , Republi - cans , Socialists , Presbyterians , Catholics , Poles , Swedes , and Yankees can let the village teacher use anybody 's text in arithmetic or in
Latin	LOCATION	; but what about the texts that deal with the vexing issues of American life ?

		Can pupils be prepared for democratic citizenship by arithmetic , gram - mar , and Latin ?

		By texts in history and civics that do not mention labor unions , strikes , the woman movement , poverty , Farmers ' Alliances , Non-Partisan Leagues , the
I. W. W.	PERSON	, single tax , socialism , municipal ownership ?

		Are these dreadful things to be mentioned in the presence of the children of the nation ?

		Or if mentioned , to be condemned , praised , or even given a fair hearing ?

		Prepare for citizenship ?

		Yes , and fill the schools with social dynamite ?

		Or are the children to be prepared by memorizing the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	and the Declaration of Independence ?

		Does that pre - pare , important as it may be ?

		Since the millions never go beyond the grade schools , must they renture out into a changing world with no knowledge of the burning issues which men and women face there ?

		Must they learn their les - sons first at the flaming forge of life where men beat out the weapons for the struggle for exist - ence ?

		Shall there be no historical background , no consideration in the schoolroom in advance ?

		We put this question squarely to perhaps the leading `` educator '' in
America	LOCATION	and he answered like a shot , `` No controversial subjects should be taught in our public schools . ''

		And yet a few nights later the same educator announced with a straight face that the first task of the public schools was the preparation of the millions for citizenship .

		Strange contradiction nothing con - troversial must be considered in our schools , and at the same time children must be prepared for citizenship in a democracy where even the foundations of social economy are in controversy whether we like it or not .

		This is the real crisis .

		The public schools will either serve the forces of science , scholarship , moderation , open-minded - ness , or like the universities they will shuffle and trundle along after a civilization that is made in spite of them .

		The choice is with the teachers .

		Have they the courage of initiative and leadership ?

		THE FALL ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW BOOKS this year will be necessarily shorter than for many years past .

		But it should be understood that the government regulations , asking for a reduction of twenty-five per cent , in the new titles after
October 1	DATE	, do not apply to im - portant scientific volumes or , for that matter , to practically any new book of genuine literary merit .

		The government regulations distinctly specify trade books , copyright reprints , toy books , juvenile , and non-copyright books .

		Books of research published under subsidy , for example , are exempted , as well of course as war-service books published for the
United States or Allied Governments	ORGANIZATION	, under subsidy .

		For the present , at all events , there is no intention on the part of the government to restrict the output of those publications which would naturally interest the intelligent reader .

		But it is inevitable that there should already be a practical retroactive effect to the regulation .

		Although publishers are , in gen - eral , accepting as many new books for publica - tion as previously , the manuscripts are being in - creasingly accepted with the understanding that their publication is to be deferred until after the war .

		As to the effect of the ruling on the pub - lishers ' business itself , Mr.
Roland Holt	PERSON	of
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	has put the case succinctly : Of course , like other businesses , we wish we did n't have the war to deal with .

		But what the government has done appears workable .

		One good feature of it is that the disadvantage it puts one firm to has to be met by all the others , too .

		There is no discrimination , so there is no real jolt to regular competition .

		POPULAR WAR-FICTION IN THE MAGAZINES and movies takes an ecstatic trend which leaves nothing to the imagination in the way of wish fulfillment .

		Writers think nothing of ending the war next month with the triumphal entry of General Pershing into
Berlin	LOCATION	-LRB-
Haig	ORGANIZATION	and Foch apparently delayed somewhere in the rear -RRB- .

		Ro - mances between American soldiers and lion - heartedly democratic German girls prove to be the bits of dynamite that blow up the Empire .

		American prowess stalks through
Europe	LOCATION	like a knight of the crusades , while the vigilant at home foil interminable desperate plots of an exquisite ingenuity that seems even beyond the power of a Hun .

		Such an exuberance of fantasy would destroy the morale of any other nation by con - vincing the mass of people who read it that their task is a mere matter of will .

		Having acquired these extravagant hopes , these apocalyptic visions of victory , they would be thrown into a corre - sponding dejection at the slowness of the actual progress and the prosaicness of the real victory .

		Intoxicated by these romances , they would hardly be able to recognize a victory when they saw it .

		But the American people have been so long accus - tomed to take their imaginative art , on every level , as mere dessert or recreation from life that they are well disciplined against harm in the present case .

		They get all the thrills they can out of their victorious dreams , but they do not com - pare them with real life .

		They go right ahead preparing for a long and arduous war , too canny to let their literary millennium interfere with their common sense .

Army	ORGANIZATION	and the Law By
GARRARD GLENN	PERSON	Associate Professor of Law ,
Columbia University 12mo	ORGANIZATION	, cloth 197 pages
$ 2.00	MONEY	net This book deals with the army in its relation to the laws governing the general public .

		It is written from the standpoint of one who is not a member of the forces , in an endeavor to formulate the rules of law which impose duties upon the civilian , and which also give him rights which the army in turn must observe .

		Several chapters are of particular interest under present conditions .

		The chapter on the constitution of the army contains an argument that compulsory service is not only constitu - tional in time of war , but would offend no re - publican tradition should it be continued in time of peace .

		The rights of the non-military citizen are considered , first as they exist in peace , and then as they proportionately shrink with the increasing exigencies of war .

		Finally , an examination of the rights of the citizen who dwells in a battle zone introduces the much-vexed subject of martial law at home .

		A FORTNIGHTLY Why Reconstruction ?

		.

		L/EFEAT
Germany	LOCATION	first ; reconstruction will take care of itself '' such is too frequently the attitude of Americans towards the proposal to begin plan - ning reconstruction today .

		It is an understandable attitude .

		The almost fatally necessary condition for any large social or popular action is that the general community intelligence shall be focussed on one thing at a time .

		To ask the popular mind to keep two objects in view simultaneously is almost like asking a child to get up and lie down at a single command .

		Dividing popular attention is like split - ting an army in two .

		Mass action derives its effect - iveness largely from the intensity of its purpose .

		Yet none of these observations , however true or pointed they may be in themselves , really applies to the actual facts ?

		s they are today .

		For reconstruction is not something to follow after the war ; it is part of the war itself .

		We ought not to say : `` We shall begin to plan for recon - struction as soon as a victorious peace is in sight . ''

		It is considerably nearer the truth to say that only because and in so far as we have already recon - structed our national life from top to bottom have we a right to be sure that a victorious peace will ever come in sight .

		And that process of reconstruct - ing our national life has already gone much deeper than mere changes in organization of our resources .

		It is psychological .

		We have begun to think in large-scale terms .

		We have begun to see the work - ings of cause and effect from an entirely new angle .

		The common man has become more vitally interested in the problems of economics and industry than were formerly the theorists of the universities .

		To shivering tenement-dwellers the question of coal distribution has become something more than an aca - demic problem .

		When victory in the field is seen to demand cold houses at home , the policy of the draft boards with respect to essential industries be - comes of lively personal interest to every coal-con - sumer .

		When the lesson of one lump of sugar at the breakfast table and months of wheatless days has taught us that patriotism involves much more than waving a flag , the rulings of the
Food Admin	ORGANIZATION	- istration are as interest-provoking as the baseball scores .

		In a word , waging a modern war is recon - struction in itself .

		Winning the war has proved not to be so simple as in the old days of romantic combat .

		It is a large-scale , corporate undertaking .

		Whether we know it or not , we are talking recon - struction every day .

		We are thinking it and work - ing at it .

		And there is a second reason perhaps less ma - terial , but certainly as insistent why we must begin at once to plan deliberately for reconstruction .

		We are committed as a matter of honor to a nevr world , a world of democracy in which wars will be made impossible , or at least more difficult than they have ever been in the past .

		Pledged to no selfish nation - alistic aims of our own , we have begun to realize that our task in this war is not merely to win peace , but to keep the peace after it is won .

		We know now that there can be no return to the status quo ante .

		And we are beginning also to realize ` that mere geographical readjustments are not fundamen - tal ; that we must create a new world industrially , financially , economically , just as certainly as a new world politically .

		This will demand every ounce of our energy for constructive planning .

		As a matter both of immediate necessity and future policy we can not postpone this planning until the peace con - ference meets .

		We can not enter the state of peace with the same degree of unpreparedness with which we entered the state of war .

		For the day that for - mal hostilities end , the war on the problems which will then face the world will begin .

		We dare not face them unprepared .

		All this is making us uneasy .

		We are beginning to ask questions .

		They are sharp and pressing ques - tions .

		Will the coal shortage , for example , continue during the winter of 1919-20 , as we know it is bound to do this next winter ?

		For how many years and to what extent will it continue after the signing of peace ?

		How can it be remedied ?

		Will state con - trol be extended or relaxed ?

		What will be the new fiscal system ?

		What shall be done with the returned soldiers ?

		What will be the state of indus - try ?

		There are hundreds of equally insistent ques - tions , each demanding an intelligent and foresighted 250 THE DIAL
October 5	DATE	answer , if peace is not to mean merely economic and industrial chaos .

		But before we can approach to anything like an answer for any of these questions , indeed before we can even explicitly formulate them , we need to take something of a survey of the mate - rials with which we already have and in increasing measure will have to deal .

		There is , first of all , the human material .

		It is pretty generally agreed that the returned soldier will dominate the civilian population .

		It is hardly likely that groups of intriguing business men or of poli - ticians will be able , so easily as in the past , to direct the entire flow of popular opinion and action .

		Now there are two distinct views about the returned sol - dier .

		One plausible view is that the soldier will be so fed up with conflict and strife that he will be glad to return to the quietest of civilian life ; that he will be content merely to hear the birds twitter in the tree-tops .

		Modern warfare , for the larger pro- portion of common soldiers after the training period is over , is often a long period of loafing interrupted by occasional flares of intense activity .

		Coupled with this is the indisputable fact that many men will be unwilling to return to the dull routine of clerical or factory life which they knew before the war .

		In other words , the men who come home will be both by habit and inclination potential loafers who can be exploited by the most unscrupulous dema - gogue .

		And in proof of this view its defenders point to the apathy of the Russian peasant soldiers since demobilization .

		Yet equally plausible are those who argue just the contrary .

		According to that view , men so long inured to violence will be willing to take a chance on anything .

		Observing that the state can spend incredible sums on destruction and yet continue as a going concern , the returned soldiers will fail to be impressed with the argument that social experiments cost too much ; after all , they will have just been through a rather reckless and costly social experiment themselves .

		As President
Wilson	PERSON	has himself said , they will not come back contentedly to the `` economic servitude '' which they knew before the war .

		And , ironically enough , the supporters of this view also point to
Russia	LOCATION	for con - firmation .

		The probabilities are however that both views are somewhat overemphasized .

		What we do know , when we strip off all glamour and myth , is that modern war is like a tremendously large-scale indus - trial enterprise , with the human risks appreciably greater than in ordinary industry .

		Everything is mechanical transportation , guns , aeroplanes , min - ing , signals , high explosives , food , even `` morale '' as organized in scientific campaigns in the news - papers .

		That habit of mind which Mr.
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	has so well exposed as the result of the common man 's coming into intimate contact with machine technology will probably be increased rather than lessened .

		It is a habit of mind which is sub - versive of the conventional views of national integ - rity , business freedom , and vested interests .

		It is both skeptical and inquiring .

		It will probably be bold .

		But it will encounter what the human spirit always encounters the facts of the world as they are .

		For the bare physical facts of the world as it will be on the conclusion of hostilities constitute the second set of materials with which we shall have to deal .

		Much will have been destroyed .

		The impov - erishment of resources will be real .

		Herds will have been killed off , and re-breeding will take anywhere from five to ten years .

		The statistics of world pro- duction in essential grains show an absolute rather than relative decrease for the last three years .

		The iron and coal and chemicals used for purely war purposes can never be recaptured .

		Furthermore , this condition of positive impoverishment will be heightened by the fact that the demand for the essen - tials will be notably increased people will not so willingly accept sacrifices as when an external enemy is attacking .

		As
Gambetta	PERSON	says , `` after danger is past , troubles begin . ''

		It is clear that after the war we shall have an increased need and an increased demand .

		Fortunately , there is also positive gain .

		The world will have an increased productive capacity such as it has never had before in its history
America	LOCATION	more than the rest .

		We have learned les - sons in the wastes of ordinary business competition , lessons in the pooling of interests , lessons in effect - ive `` speeding up , '' lessons in undemocratic control of industry -LRB- as a detriment to production -RRB- , lessons in the increased use of woman power , lessons in or - ganization .

		In spite of the drain of war and the removal of millions of workers to the firing lines , the foreign trade of
Great Britain	LOCATION	has increased rather than decreased .

		After the war , although we shall have paid a high price for it , we shall at least have learned some of the secrets of rapid and large-scale production .

		In all probability the period following the war will be a period of tremendous expansion and activity .

		Our chief business , if we are to remain faithful to the generous pledges under which we entered the war , is to make this heightened industrial and commercial activity avoid the folly of dividing into competing groups , to make it co - operative rather than nationalistically self-conscious and purposively narrow .

		It must be organized on
1918	DATE	an international basis or we merely repeat on an exaggerated scale the incentives to war which were characteristic of the nineteenth century .

		There will be many who will try to prevent this .

		In every country we can see the politicians , those in a dominant economic or industrial position , those with the aura of unearned prestige still about them , attempting to make what Mr.
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	has called so well the `` closed state . ''

		At the very time that so many leaders are telling us to concentrate all our energies on the war it is well to remember that schemes for industrial and commercial recon - struction are already in many instances faits accom - plis .

		Governments and commercial classes may preach nothing except war to the populace , but as a matter of fact much of their thought and atten - tion is absorbed in the problems of trade and finance after the war .

		The
British Union League	ORGANIZATION	is an example : it preaches protection , imperial preference , the development of `` key '' industries , a frank state socialism .

		The same forces in
France	LOCATION	back the gen - eral recommendations of the
Paris	LOCATION	Economic Con - ference .

		Even in our own country chambers of com - merce and similar bodies are laying nationalistic and , in some cases , imperialistic plans .

		Much of this proposed reconstruction contem - plates social legislation of a palliative sort , better housing conditions , and is sympathetic to reformist , as distinguished from radical , ideals .

		After all , the business men and industrial experts have the exact and detailed knowledge on which any scientific plan for reconstruction must be based , as even the Soviet government of
Russia	LOCATION	discovered and utilized .

		And it is part of the mythology of radicalism to picture all those in powerful positions as necessarily ma - licious .

		Often their conservatism is merely ignor - ance ; already business men are seeing beyond the individual industry to national organization , as eventually they must see through to international organization .

		Their advice and help will be in - valuable .

		And they possess a fund of genuine good will .

		Liberals however can not allow this planning to be done entirely by the interested classes ; nor will they .

		Business and industry will contribute their technical and scientific knowledge , but they can not be allowed to dictate policy , which must be adjusted in the interests of the whole community .

		Labor is more alive and intelligent than ever before , not readily succumbing to the old shibboleths .

		That can be plainly seen in the program of the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, and in the program generally of the Social - ists on the continent .

		Unless there is reconciliation , we shall find on one side the old-fashioned point of view , given an up-to-date state socialist vocabulary , and on the other the vision of internationalism vision , as its opponents call it , but an attitude really more consonant with the actual facts of large-scale industry , scattered raw materials , transportation , and international interdependence as they exist in
1918	DATE	.

		This struggle between conflicting points of view may be adjusted reasonably by acquiescence to the new order ; it may be bitter .

		During the period of dislocation following demo - bilization each side will try to catch the advantage .

		National passions will inevitably be played upon for the most part , one suspects , unsuccessfully .

		There will be the usual psychological let-down , such as accompanies the end of all wars , and a perfectly hu - man tendency to throw over all attempts for rational reorganization and to enjoy life while we may .

		The franker and bolder imperialists in all states will try to exploit the desire for national economic security as Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	is doing in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and to capture the control of a tired world .

		But many things will play against them .

		Anger at all sorts of profiteering is very real today ; much of it has been suppressed in the interest of national unity before the external enemy but it will flare up again with peace .

		When the reaction comes men will look back with more than the conventional horror to this war .

		Its emotional appeal is even now thin , as we have seen in its rather jejune expres - sions in literature and art .

		It is almost talked out .

		There are few who have talked to soldiers frankly who say that they detect any inclination on the part of the men who have been through the whole range of warlike experience to encourage a system which divides nations into jealous and competing groups .

		After the procuring of bread , the preservation of peace has come more and more to the worker to seem his primary interest .

		And there is a final and definitive point : the mechanical and technical facts of the modern world , with its emphasis on inter - national economic cooperation , can not be wished away .

		Ideas must eventuanlly conform and adapt themselves to them .

		A skeptical attitude towards reconstruction would perhaps be justified if there had not already been distinctly discernible a shift of interest away from the romantic and suicidal questions of national or political prestige to the more basic questions of organization and control of industry , the allocation of raw materials , the necessary peace-time interna - tional fiscal system and exchange of credits , the direc - tion of the flow of capital , the rates arrangements for the new international merchant marine .

		In the face of what the world is really like today , the 252
October 5	DATE	complete irrelevancy of the nineteenth century con - cepts of national sovereignty is becoming increasing - ly clear .

		It is not that direct frontal attacks have been made on these concepts .

		Interest has spon - taneously and unerringly shifted away from them .

		It has centered on new questions .

		And in
America	LOCATION	today these questions confront us not only as a matter of immediate interest in winning the military side of the war but as the even more important challenge of preserving the fruits of that victory .

		Some of the questions are unesca - pable : Shall federal control of transportation and other public utilities be abandoned after the war ?

		Have we any plan for the simultaneous and pro- portionate reduction of competitive armaments in all countries ?

		How shall the war debt be paid ?

		How can we make sure of markets for our products and at the same time avoid the risk of making other states jealous ?

		What is the future of our rapidly increas - ing merchant marine ?

		What are our plans concern - ing immigration ?

		How shall industry be reorgan - ized and what hereafter shall be the status of labor ?

		Shall the principle of priority rights be recognized in law and extended , or shall we return to the old laissez-faire doctrines of competitive business ?

		Shall the
War Labor Board	ORGANIZATION	, the
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	, the
Emergency Fleet Corporation	ORGANIZATION	, the Fuel and Food Administrations , the
Federal Trade Board	ORGANIZATION	be continued ?

		If so , who and what are to determine their policies ?

		How are our soldiers to be fitted into the new economic and industrial life when they return home ?

		What arrangements are we making for demobilization ?

		To what international political policies are we preparing to commit ourselves ?

		Are we willing to abandon some of our claims to com - plete sovereignty and have our investments in weak and disorganized countries , if not directed , at least subject to the control of an international authority ?

		These questions are insistent .

		Not only our own happiness in the coming strange days of peace depends upon our answer to them , but the happiness of those unknown generations for whom , as we are so often rhetorically told , all this anguish and horror are so freely given .

		These future generations may be grateful that we gave so generously of our lives .

		But they will profit from it only if today we give as generously of our intelligence .

		1918 THE DIAL 2 53 An Imaginary Conversation
GOSSE	PERSON	AND
MOORE	PERSON	M. .

		AID .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		My dear
Gosse	PERSON	, how glad I am to see you , and how well timed your visit is , you will acknowledge when I tell you that five minutes be - fore the door opened I left my writings you see them all scattered over the table and came to this fire -LRB- which , by the way , is n't wanted on a day like this -RRB- to dream of whom do you think ?

		of you , of course , and that two human beings as different as ourselves should have been friends for forty years .

		It must be nearly as long as that .

		GOSSE .

		Difference in temperament draw men together .

		Are we not formed as notes of music are For one another though dissimilar ?

		A late
spring	DATE	fire is responsible for many dreams ; but I should have preferred to hear that it had set you thinking of the art that has united us , rather than of superficial differences that failed to divide us .

		Not a day has passed these forty years without our meditating on the mystery of our art .

		With you it has been as with me .

		But 1 will not delay .

		I merely came ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		You must not go .

		This visit is most opportune .

		I 've been trying to write
this afternoon	TIME	and for many previous afternoons for the last fort - night , beginning the same thing over and over again and again and starting afresh .

		It was my literary perplexities , teasing difficulties , that set me dreaming of you , sitting pen in hand , your eyes fixed on a clear vision , transcribing it from time to time accurately and harmoniously , sentence rising out of sentence , paragraph out of paragraph .

		Have I not seen your manuscript , only a word altered here and there ?

		GOSSB .

		But if I do not change on paper , I change in my mind .

		I sit pen in hand until the sentence is completely formed , and any quality that my prose may have it gets from the pen .

		If I were to dictate as you do ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		My dictation is the cartoon , and the quality , as you call it , and rightly , comes when I be - gin to lick the sentences together .

		GOSSB .

		I could n't write that way .

		MOORE .

		To me it is incredible that a man should be able to arrange his composition beforehand and execute it sentence by sentence .

		Your method re - minds me of painting as it was done in
Paris	LOCATION	in the seventies piece by piece , leaving off in the middle of an eye , and finishing the
second half the next day	DATE	.

		The painter 's task , though difficult , was accom - plished upon a drawing ; but you are always , if I may so express myself , in mid-air , finding your way like the swallow .

		You find it , it is true , and I be - lieve you to be without chart or compass , since you say it .

		I believe as the pious Christian believes , be - cause it is incredible .

		GOSSE .

		I hold the road in my mind 's eye .

		MOORE .

		But the mind 's eye can not carry the various aspects of the road and the multiple inci - dents of the road .

		But why do I say `` can not '' ?

		My own mind alone is known to me , and every time I begin a fresh subject it seems as if I should never succeed in unraveling it .

		Our minds are as different as our lives have been .

		You married early in life , and a gulf divides the man that marries in the beginning from the man who decides in the beginning that he will remain a bachelor .

		Your life has been spent in your own home among your family , and in clubs .

		You look at this moment as if you had come from your club .

		You were edu - cated , and you know literature , Greek and Roman , French , German , besides a good smattering of Scandinavian .

		No lives were ever so different as ours , nor temperaments .

		It never happened to you to rush out after dinner to see a friend , or even to desire to do such a thing .

		Never have I known you to pay a casual visit before
today	DATE	.

		GOSSE .

		My wife begged of me ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		It was not then a desire to see an old friend that compelled you from the Athenaeum , that
august	DATE	abode of prelaity and literature .

		I am dis - appointed .

		I can see you coming through the portals with his Grace , noticing , as soon as you are in the air , that an acid little wind is blowing through the sunshine .

		You finger the lappet of his lordship 's overcoat , saying , `` Rather thin for the season , '' and having deposited his Grace in his carriage and waited till the rug was tucked about the episcopal breeches , you hailed a hansom .

		Did you not feel yourself to be somewhat of a hypocrite when you called out you did n't dare to call out `` 121 Ebury Street '' within hearing of his
Grace	ORGANIZATION	's coachman ?

		You lowered your voice as a man does on his way ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		I can not allow you to indulge your imag - ination any longer , though it is all very amusing .

		I must beg you to receive without delay my wife 's message .

		We have some distinguished visitors com - ing to see us on
Sunday	DATE	, and she will find it hard to forgive you if you do not help us to entertain them .

		Among them are ... 254 THE
DIAL Octobers MOORE	ORGANIZATION	.

		A Scandinavian critic and a Danish poet ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		I will not stay to hear you talk nonsense any longer about the nationalities of our visitors , which do not concern you at all , and I 'll go so far as to say that your remarks make me regret that I broke through my usual custom of communicating by letter rather than by word of mouth .

		For it is , as you say , not my custom to call without an ap - pointment , and what has happened
today	DATE	will not encourage me to repeat my experiment .

		MOORE .

		I 'm sorry indeed if my reckless imagi - nation is to deprive me of your company this after - noon , for never in my life did I need it more .

		Liter - ature needs your help , as you will see if you will forgive your volatile friend his levity , which , though incurable , is harmless .

		I beg of you to return to your chair , for I can not talk to you if you stand irate on the hearthrug fuming .

		Can I do more than apologize for having allowed my imagination to wander about the portals of the Athenaeum ?

		GOSSE .

		But I do n't belong to that club .

		MOORE .

		Then why be angry ?

		It is only reasonable to be angry at the truth .

		I shall be glad to entertain your friends to the best of my ability whatever their nationalities , if ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		You make my wife 's request conditional ?

		MOORE .

		I beseech you not to be so prickly .

		I make no conditions .

		I 'll come next
Sunday	DATE	to tea even though I can not persuade you to stay to help me .

		Only this do I ask , that you will allow me to tell you that the subject I have been trying to write for the last fortnight arose out of one of the subtlest of your critical remarks , for me the most significant single sentence you ever wrote , or that any man wrote , a sentence that captured and has held me ever since , driving me at last to the creation of the idea , an essay .

		Half an hour of your time is all I ask for , and your own thought having caused the need you can hardly refuse me half an hour of your time .

		Our art calls to you .

		GOSSE .

		You have certainly set me wondering what was the epigram , maxim , aphorism , apotheism , or truism that has caused all the trouble with which I see the dining-room table littered .

		MOORE .

		You wrote , but when you wrote the sentence that captured my imagination I can not tell you it must have been in some essay or preface ; a casual remark you seemed to consider it , for you did not develop the thought ; I wish you had , for had you done so you might have removed some of the errors with which literary criticism is beset ; but , no , you just said , as if the remark was of no par - ticular importance , that English genius had gone into poetry .

		And it was this remark thrown out casually that fired my imagination .

		A seemingly unending perspective opened up before me .

		Ger - many , I said , expresses herself in music ;
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	in the plastic arts ;
England	LOCATION	, as
Gosse	PERSON	says , in poetry .

		Our poetical literature is the most beauti - ful , but outside of poetry English genius has accom - plished little or nothing .

		GOSSE .

		You would n't go so far as to say that English genius has accomplished nothing in prose .

		MOORE .

		English genius has certainly found abundant expression in the essay .

		Landor ,
Pater	PERSON	, De Quincey ,
Lamb	LOCATION	.

		You know how I have yielded to these writers , and yourself has demurred on more than one occasion to my unorthodox faith that more human souls rise out of Landor 's Imaginary Con - versations than out of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		Our conversation became strained as the conversation frequently became between Bishop
Parker	PERSON	and
Andrew Marvel	ORGANIZATION	.

		You remember the extraordinary inrush of character at the words `` I shudder . ''

		At these the Bishop rises into our consciousness , a spiritual entity ; in all
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is there anything so swift and telling ?

		But we must keep to the sub - ject of this discussion , that English prose narrative is the weakest part of our literature .

		GOSSE .

		With the exception of one or two master - pieces .

		MOORE .

		I can not allow that there are any master - pieces in English prose narrative , for masterpieces are written only by first-rate minds , and I think you will agree with me that only the inferior or shall we say ?

		the subaltern mind has attempted prose narrative in
England	LOCATION	.

		GOSSE .

		If we waive the smaller prose narratives of Elizabethan times , we come upon a very remark - able narrative ,
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	.

		But I see your point .

		Defoe sold his pen willingly to whomsoever could afford to pay for the writing of political pamphlets , lampoons , scurrilous novels , literary gar - bage of all kinds ; but you must remember that a man ceases to be a hack writer as soon as he writes a masterpiece .

		MOORE .

		I had not intended to speak of
Defoe	PERSON	.

		Fielding seemed to give my essay a better start , for in
Tom Jones	LOCATION	we find the family , and in the drawing - room for the first time .

		Defoe was , as you say , a hack writer , and the theme of my essay is that in - ferior writers seized upon English prose narrative as a means of getting money ; and the fact that De - foe was inspired during the first half of
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	does not impugn or cast a doubt on the validity of my theme .

		If he 'd been inspired from start to finish , the matter would be different .

		Eng -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 255 lish fiction never finishes gallantly ; the writers swerve across the course or bolt out of it , or stick out their toes turn it up , as the phrase goes .

		For - give this description in racing parlance .

		English fiction is a hackney ; French and Russian narrative shows more breeding .

		This can hardly be denied .

		GOSSE .

		I certainly do not deny it .

		MOORE .

		It would seem then that my essay must begin with
Defoe	PERSON	; not with
Defoe	PERSON	but with
Defoe	PERSON	's last word ,
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, the most English of all books .

		We are islanders ; Crusoe was one .

		Our business is the sea .

		Crusoe was constantly occupied going to and fro from a wreck .

		We are a prosaic people , what the French could call terre a terre .

		Nobody was more terre a terre than Crusoe .

		Eng - land seems to have expressed herself in her first narrative uncommonly well .

		You see , my dear
Gosse	PERSON	, that this conversation is already beginning to bear fruit .

		It must be fifty years since I read
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, but the construction of the first part of the story is so regular that it seems to me as if I could read the book in memory .

		The going back and forth on a raft to get food ; the finding of the fowling pieces and cordials .

		How often did he mention that he had discovered a case of cordials ?

		I used to wonder what cordials were , and why he attached so much importance to the finding of them , for I come of a family that has been sober for many generations .

		It seems to me that I remember his house and the building of the boat , and the current that nearly carried him out of sight of the island , for the boat could not be steered out of the current till he hoisted a sail .

		It was difficult for a child to comprehend how a sail that carried him more swiftly from the island than the current was doing could at the same time enable him to steer out of the cur - rent .

		He was almost out of sight of the island when he put up the sail , and it was with a great relief that I read that the boat answered the helm as soon as her speed exceeded the speed of the current .

		The unfortunate
Stevenson	PERSON	, who tried to write books of adventures , merely wrote a succession of accidents , but in
Robinson Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	every incident is necessary ; and every one is shapen perfectly , and fits into its place : at the right moment we are told that
Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	's powder and shot began to run short , so instead of shooting the goats , he trapped them ; the wild goats became tame and gave him milk , and from the milk he may have made butter and cheese I 've forgotten .

		But he certainly made himself a suit of clothes out of goat skins , and what is wonderful in this adven - ture story is the moral idea man alone with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Defoe may have gotten the desert island from
Juan Fernandez	PERSON	, but he got the unforgettable incident , the footprint on the sand , out of his own mind , and the subsequent discovery that cannibals had been on the island and indulged in a cannibal feast .

		In consider - ing the beauty of the subject that chance dropped in front of
Defoe	PERSON	-LRB- true that it dropped in front of many besides
Defoe	PERSON	-RRB- , it may occur to us that for full justice to be done to it a man who was at once a poet , a philosopher , and a great descriptive writer was needed ; but on consideration doubts will soon begin to arise if this be so , and we begin to think that perhaps the story gains by an unaffected ab - sence of the grand style .

		The first part of the story could not be improved , but the end is a sad spectacle for us men of letters the uninspired trying to con - tinue the work of the inspired .

		GOSSE .

		It is quite true that very few people con - tinue the book after Crusoe leaves the island , and your description of the uninspired trying to continue the work of the inspired must be accepted , I think , as a just criticism and judgment of the book 's end ; and I suppose I must allow that if a man can not carry a book from start to finish without allowing his narrative to drop away he can not be looked upon as a genius of the first rank .

		MOORE .

		The man of talent may be inspired , but the moment of inspiration gone by , he writes like a dolt .

		GOSSE .

		Not so a man of genius ; he always writes well ; he never gives the show away .

		My apologies for the colloquialism so necessary for the occasion .

		I see you look upon the end of
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	as a complete failure .

		MOORE .

		An end that nobody reads can not be looked upon as else than a failure , and the true end seems so obvious that I am puzzled .

		After the evangelization of
Friday	DATE	I 've forgotten if
Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	taught
Friday	DATE	his catechism and his prayers ; if he did n't , the oversight is incomprehensible ; but if we begin by supposing that he did not miss this very English point , Crusoe would begin to consider his own life in relation to
Friday	DATE	.

		GOSSE .

		He did not miss the evangelization .

		MOORE .

		I am sincerely glad to hear it .

		After
Friday	DATE	had been instructed in the doctrine of the Atonement , the thought would cross Crusoe 's mind that his life and the savage 's would shape out into an admirable romance ; but he would be deterred from writing the book for a long time , thinking that no one would ever read it , not even
Friday	DATE	.

		GOSSE .

		Pens and ink and paper are not available on a desert island .

		MOORE .

		There was a wreck .

		GOSSE .

		The wreck had gone to pieces long ago .

		True , he might have saved a good deal of writing material from the first wreck .

		But the dislike to 256 THE DIAL
October 5	DATE	pass out of this life without leaving some record of our passage through it is one entirely alien to the character of
Robinson Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	.

		You would make him into an artist .

		Defoe was particularly careful to avoid this mistake , for he explains , as you would have seen if you had read the end of the book , that
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	does not write his story till he has exhausted all the occupations he can devise .

		It is not till he has tied up the last fruit tree that he sits down to write his story .

		MOORE .

		A timeworn literary trick that betrays the hack writer .

		Let us avail ourselves , if needs must be , of it on the island ; and accepting
Defoe	PERSON	's own subterfuge , I say that the taming and instruc - tion of
Friday	DATE	being completed there remains little daily work for Crusoe .


Friday	DATE	does the work , and finding that the afternoons fall languid , Crusoe be - gins to dream , and before long his life rises up before him , and from afar .

		Another ship , he says , will come sooner or later , and he 'd just as lief be read after his death as before .

		Crusoe should die before
Friday	DATE	, for some admirable pages might be written on the grief of the man
Friday	DATE	, intermingled with fears lest his kindred should return and eat him
Friday	DATE	, not Crusoe ; and
Friday	DATE	, true to his evangeli - zation , would bury Crusoe with all the prayers he could remember .

		GOSSE .

		But who would write this ?

		You can not have two pair of eyes on the island .

		MOORE .

		Crusoe must not meet with sudden death , rather an accident among the cliffs that would allow him to continue his memoirs from time to time .

		I would have the last page of the manuscript relate Crusoe 's anxiety for
Friday	DATE	, who he foresees will die of grief , and
Friday	DATE	's last act , the placing of the manuscript in the cave hard by the grave , which would Le necessary for the completion of the stery , for it is the manuscript that explains to the captain of the next ship that visits the island the presence of the skeleton by the grave .

		The captain 's reading the manuscript would have given
Defoe	PERSON	an opportunity to evoke a new soul , the captain 's .

		How the poor savage must have grieved for his savior and master !

		`` Like a dog , '' he mutters as he turns the last page .

		GOSSE .

		I can see that a good deal is to be said in favor of entrusting you with the task of pro- viding new ends to old masterpieces .

		MOORE .

		If we begin to put jokes on each other we shall never arrive at the end of our task , which is a long one , a review of the history of prose narra - tive in
England	LOCATION	.

		GOSSE .

		Your end strikes me as admirable , but it would require a greater writer than
Defoe	PERSON	to execute it , and I 'm glad you were not by to sug - gest it .

		MOORE .

		Why ?

		GOSSE .

		I 'm afraid the new wine would have burst the old bottles with that end in view he might not have succeeded in writing the story .

		MOORE .

		You must not think that I 'm providing a definite plan for the completion of the story .

		I 'm only throwing out hints .

		But there can be no doubt that
Defoe	PERSON	would have done better had he kept Crusoe on the island .

		And it would be amusing to write the end on the lines I have suggested , doing for
Defoe	PERSON	what
Wagner	PERSON	did for
Gluck	PERSON	and what
Liszt	PERSON	did for many writers .

		Why should the ar - rangements of masterpieces be limited to music ?

		Why should we not rearrange literary masterpieces ?

		GOSSE .

		The rearrangement would not prove acceptable .

		MOORE .

		It would , if the rearrangement were better than the original .

1918	DATE	THE DIAL 2 57 Wanted : A
Wagner	PERSON	for the Movies HE PHOTOPLAY is the one truly popular art-form today .

		Into ten thousand magic caverns , out of the afternoon sunlight or out of the flare of the great -LRB- or little -RRB- white ways of modern earth , go stream - ing the millions of its devotees once -LRB- or twice -RRB- every twenty-four hours all the year through .

		No one needs to be reminded of its popularity .

		But many need to be reminded that it is one of the arts ; for in current speech it is simply the `` movie - industry , '' and in current print we have the profes - sional trade journals , the press-agent write-ups in the dailies , or at best the special departments in a popular monthly or so , with gossip and pictures of favorite stars .

		In all this there is nothing of principles of criti - cism , no creative guidance , for spectator or film com - pany .

		Yet a few wise men , who see deeper and farther , have already set down something of what we need if out of this popularity is to develop an appreciation of the art of the photoplay both in it - self -LRB- as it is and as it may and should become -RRB- and as the means to a finer , more popular appreciation of the elder arts .

		Muensterberg in The Photoplay -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	,

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	,
1916	DATE	-RRB- fresh from his experiences , as student , in drawing and painting -LRB- now doing a rousing business as poet and trouba - dour -RRB- emphasized in an un technical manner some of its elementary relations to the plastic arts and to architecture , and glowed with a vision of its ex - pansive and uplifting social uses in days to come .


Victor O. Freeburg	PERSON	's The Art of Photoplay Mak - ing -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	,
1918	DATE	;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , as art criticism , is in advance of both not essentially in accuracy of analysis , but in its much greater detail and scope , particularly in its thorough working-out of laws well known and universal in other arts -LRB- as unity , balance , rhythm -RRB- in all their photoplay manifesta - tions of static and fluent composition .

		Indeed Mr.
Freeburg	PERSON	's book would form almost as excellent an introduction to painting , sculpture , dancing , and literature , especially dramatic literature , as to the art of the photoplay , characterized moreover , as its style is , by an unusual deftness in the phrasing of important , though often very elusive , moments of thought .

		Both
Lindsay	PERSON	and
Freeburg	PERSON	speak from intimate knowledge of many movies and many of the pro < - fessional movie-people ; but , as the former says in a note to the present writer , `` my book begins and ends with the director .

		Freeburg begins with the scenario ... the true starting point .

		When I wrote my book the scenario was practically non - existent . ''

		So rapid has been the growth of the new art-form .

		But how much growth there must still be before the still surviving circus elements the gaudy , the sensational , the acrobatic , the senti - mental , the megaphonic , the hodge-podge of mean - ingless events and poster signs are altogether elim - inated , or at least relegated to a `` movie melodrama '' that shall have as little standing with photoplay art as stage melodrama has with stage art .

		The diffi - culty is not alone with the box-office standard of successful photoplays .

		The production of a photo - play , in its technical complexity , requires many hands and many minds .

		There must always be film com - panies , and these must always be `` managed '' ; and mechanical problems of physics and practical prob - lems of business will always interplay with problems of this art , however far this art may develop .

		But much greater harmony of imagination , taste , and aim is possible and desirable than seems now to exist .

		If one creative mind can not devise the scenario , ar - range the sittings , coach the actors , turn the crank , and cut and fit the celluloid films , there can still be cooperation through subordination when the sce - nario-writer has , like the dramatist or opera-com - poser , mastered the peculiar instrumentalities of his medium and can look for intelligent sympathy and imaginative help in the `` studio '' then at last worthy of its old time art-connotations .

		Until very recently scenario-writers have not understood the medium in its artistic limitations ; and directors have not under - stood the medium in its artistic possibilities ; and often enough neither has understood either .

		One might say the ideal would be a mind at once creative and directive one controlling master-spirit throughout , a spirit like
Wagner	PERSON	at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	.

		Such a spirit however would , for practical purposes , have to be born within the studio itself ; but the photoplay studio , however dedicated to art , must always be in addition too much of a workshop factory , office , garage to become a likely birthplace of such a spirit .

		R. FARRER in The Monarchy in Politics -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- has not trodden so securely this dimly lighted path that the trail will not have to be blazed a second time .

		He is , to be sure , a diligent student and he has produced a capital volume of constitu - tional anecdota .

		But he has not been able to seize , in any save the dimmest fashion , the real import of his subject .

		He has not grasped the ramifications of his problem .

		There are few students , indeed , to whom his volume will not be useful ; and that amorphous species , the general reader , will find it an admirable book for a dull
winter	DATE
evening	TIME	.

		But there its value ends .

		Yet it is a great subject ; and if Mr.
Farrer	PERSON	has not himself reflected upon it , he has provided ample materials for reflection .

		The mere collection of his facts dissipates , for instance , that notion so fondly cherished by the constitutional historians that after the accession of Victoria the Crown counted for little or nothing in political relations .

		No one of course denies its power in the age when
George III	PERSON	deliberately aimed at the erection of a patriotic kingship to which
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	should be a sub - servient instrument .

		If he failed , the path of pol - itics is in that half-century strewn with the wrecks of those men and institutions he dragged with him in his failure .

		Neither the eldest nor the mildest of his sons exercised anything like his influence ; though some famous words of
Canning	ORGANIZATION	to
Marcellus	PERSON	-LRB- which Mr.
Farrer	PERSON	does not quote -RRB- show us that it was not from lack of desire .

		All this is common - place of the history books ; it is when he comes to deal with Queen
Victoria	PERSON	that Mr.
Farrer	PERSON	has a new perspective to offer .

		He brings out quite clearly the pressure exerted by the Queen in foreign pol - itics .

		That pressure has its good side , as when she urged arbitration in the
Alabama	LOCATION	case ; it has its evil side , as when she began to develop an overzealous sense of personal prestige in the Crimean War .

		It is noteworthy that she was always on the side of large military preparations and that she was so blind to the problem of military efficiency as to in - sist on the - retention of the
Duke of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	at the
Horse Guards	ORGANIZATION	.

		In domestic politics her in - fluence was almost always against the forces of lib - eralism .

		She regarded
Cobden	PERSON	as a mean agitator , and for years she could see no service in Mr.
Bright	PERSON	's career to justify the offer of that privy councilor - ship that is today thrown about like a ninepin .

		She kept Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	from the Cabinet because he scrutinized with a careful eye the expenditure upon the more minute members of her family .

		She followed the speeches made by Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	in the nobler part of his career with an angry hostility .

		Her attitude to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	is well summarized in that last tragic episode ` when even his resignation could not induce her to ask for his advice .

		Of course it follows that she loved Disraeli , for - the latter 's orientalism cast about her imperial pomp .

		No one praised the Prince Consort with the same excess as he did ; and men still living can remember those marvelous days when
Belgravia	LOCATION	prepared to stomach a Jewish adventurer as the successor of a German prince .

		There are , of course , the good sides to the Queen and we must never forget them .

		She threw the halo of respectability about the Crown at a time when it was suffering from what may not unjustifi - ably be termed moral debility .

		Anyone who com - pares the
Creevey Papers	ORGANIZATION	with the
Greville Memoirs	ORGANIZATION	will realize that the center of moral gravity has shifted .

		The Queen replaces
Wesley	PERSON	and
Wilber	PERSON	- force in the religious heart of her people .

		She was always attentive to business .

		She seems to have cared deeply about several popular needs , such as housing .

		Towards the close of her reign mere ex - perience had given her advice a sanction to which few others in the kingdom could pretend .

		But there is no sign in her of any remarkable ability .

		She had no real knowledge of the popular forces at work .

		Her attitude to the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	was that of a jealous child who will not let her play - mate read her book over her shoulder .

		On all the dominant issues she seems to have been wrong .

		She was in fact exactly what one would expect in a personage who is trying to preserve the prerogatives of royalty in an age to which they were unsuited .

		That does not mean that she was unpopular ; save for a few years during the early period of Chartism and in the middle part of her widowhood , when she gave to the mausoleum at Frogmore the tears that her country needed , she was deeply loved ; and from
1887	DATE	she was regarded with something like veneration by the whole of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Even the
Kaiser	PERSON	, who is not apt to worship , seems to have come under her spell or sway .

		But a dispassionate analysis of her reign does not lend itself to favorable comment upon a monarchical system .

		It does not seem possible to doubt that a monarch entails a court and a court an aristocracy ; and these in their time prevent , by the privileges they necessarily deposit , the career that is really open to the talented .

		English foreign policy would not have been left to the men of family if English gov -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 259 ernment had been republican .

		The army would not have become so largely a social machine were it not that the younger sons of the aristocracy can not all go into the Church .

		The prestige of Anglicanism would have been real instead of factitious , for the support it derives from the headship of the Crown is undeniable .

		The radicalism of the eighties would have been far more successful if the destruction of Dilke had not left Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	an easy victim to the sinister forces that a court can so well manip - ulate .

		The whole point is that the system is on all hands bound up with dead or dying traditions that it preserves as embalmed corpses .

		It prevents a full and free discussion of social realities .

		It preserves the idea of status which is so fatal to the progress of liberalism .

		It provides a rallying-point for the forces of reaction .

		How true that is anyone can see who examines the history of the Ulster crisis .

		The Unionist party deliberately perverted a sup - posed royal preference to selfish party ends , and the cause of liberty suffered as a consequence .

		Nor can anyone have watched the structure of royalist
Europe	LOCATION	without remarking how the alliance of families affects in dangerous fashion the whole back - ground of international relations .

		Obvious too is the false standard of achievement it creates .

		Poets laureate , court painters are the bywords of the satirist , but there is a whole area to annex thereto of the eager search for the trumpery social privileges that hedge a king about .

		A royal family can dignify Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, but not Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		It can dec - orate Sir
James Barrie	PERSON	, but it must look askance at Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		It will lunch with tamed labor leaders like Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	, but it will not invite Mr.
Keir Hardie	PERSON	to its garden parties .

		And the exiles of half the most welcome revolutions find support and a resting-place on the grounds of their relationship .

		All this does not mean that a republic is free from this social falsity .

		The court at
Washington	LOCATION	is less select perhaps , but it is equally real ; only it is the more satisfactory since it changes at least every eight years .


Boston	LOCATION	is not the only place which prides itself on birth : I have been introduced to the first families of
Duluth	LOCATION	.

		But when the follies of every society that counts any prestige other than mind and heart are set on one side , the fact remains that there is an important social freedom possible in a republic which is not achieved even in the freest of monarchic systems .

		There is an accessibility in the ruling powers , a possibility of basic change , which is beyond even the thought of kingship .

		I do not doubt the value of symbols , but the point about kingship is that it does not belong to the symbols worthy of acceptance .

		The divisions it introduces are unrelated to merit , and they are therefore unworthy divisions .

		A great book has one day to be written on the compatibility of any form of hereditary rule with representative govern - ment ; until it is written I think the experience of
France	LOCATION	and
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	throws the burden of proof on those who stand by the ancient
HAROLD J. LASKI	PERSON	.

		Philosophy by
Magic IT	ORGANIZATION	is AN extraordinary thing to happen to a doc - tor 's thesis that it should be published as a timely book over forty years after it was presented to the academic authorities .

		The fact is nevertheless that
Emil Boutroux	PERSON	's The Contingency of the
Laws of Nature	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Open Court ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is more timely today than when he presented the thesis at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	.

		There may have been a time when men seemed as completely the sport of the cosmic weather as they seem
today	DATE	, but if so it is a fact we know by report , not by experience .

		We have , it is true , always con - tended with restrictions ; plans have gone wrong , projects have failed , and for the philosophically minded there was always the question of evil and the defeat called death .

		But within certain bounds we could map out a program of life .

		It was not altogether nonsense to declare : I am the master of my fate , I am the captain of my soul .

		There were limits to our autonomy , but we had rope .

		Now since the great scourge swept upon us out of the troubled East there is for the mass of men not even the illusion of self-determination , and those higher up appear free perhaps because seen from a distance .

		An inscrutable necessity in things seems pushing tumultuously on to its tragic ends , regardless of the havoc to human beings and to civil - ization .

		Is the universe a machine in which the human drama represents a cog in a wheel ?

		Is the present conflict the inevitable denouement of an eternal fate ?

		And is the future as unalterable as the present is , and the past was ?

		Is the very struc - ture of the universe , as well as the order of events , the actualization of undeviating necessity ?

		This is the question considered in The Contingency of the
Laws of Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Unfortunately the author 's manner of presenta - tion , familiar to those who have attended philosophi - a6o THE DIAL
October 5	DATE	cal seminars , is such that the book can have only a very limited number of readers .

		The subject , to be sure , is itself difficult .

		But , as
William James	PERSON	used to say , men like to hear deep things tajked about even if they do not understand what is being said .

		It gives them the problematic thrill .

		And something of the meaning seeps through if men can only be got to listen or read .

		To get them to read this volume however will not be an easy matter , especially if they begin with the first chapter instead of the last .

		And I am not speaking of those who have acquired the movie-mind or the
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post power of concentration , but of people who read for mental growth and discipline rather than for emotional in - toxication .

		Indeed , few but those specially trained in higher technical philosophy will be able to follow the argument of the book .

		And thus a suggestive discussion of a subject which is of peculiar interest to our time will get only a small fraction of the attention it deserves .

		It is unfortunate that the doc - tor 's thesis was not entirely rewritten .

		M. Boutroux 's approach to the problem is meta - physical .

		He argues that as stability is no more fundamentally characteristic of the world than change , so is necessity no more ultimate than con - tingency or freedom .

		Things persist , but so do they progress or degenerate .

		In the universe there can be distinguished several worlds , superposed on one an - other : the world of pure being , the world of notions , the world of matter , the living world , and the thinking world .

		Now in each case it is impossible to derive the higher world from the lower .

		There is always something new in the higher world , some - thing which can not be shown to be the elaboration of anything present in the lower world .

		No logic , for example , can show that any given form of being was the necessary resultant of the preceding state possibility for in that state there is nothing to account for the particular form which being assumed .

		In the same way no manipulation of matter and motion , as science conceives them , can be made to yield bodies or things ; that again demands some - thing besides matter and motion .

		Similarly no aggregation of physical and chemical particles will result in a living being , which is not a collection but a hierarchal system .

		And so , once more , with the thinking world , in which case the new element is consciousness .

		Consciousness can not be deduced from physiological processes or reflex actions , no matter how complicated .

		Nor can any combination of sensations give rise to the experience of the unity known as self .

		In each step from nonentity to being , from being to the world rationalized under such concepts or notions as genus and species , from this to the world of matter , of bodies , of living be - ings , of men in each step is involved what the author calls the act ; that is to say , an expression of creative spontaneity .

		The amount of creativeness , and hence of contingency , is small in the lower worlds but ever greater in amount as we come up the ladder , until in man we have a being who not only dominates himself but the world at large .

		At the bottom of the ladder there is much necessity and little contingency ; at the top , much contingency and little necessity .

		And the universe is saved from chaos by the fact that all the various orders or worlds are aiming to realize one ideal , which consists `` in drawing nearer to God , in resembling Him , each after its kind . ''

		God , as the final but absolutely free cause , guarantees both order and freedom .

		The best symbol then of the ultimate reason of things is the moral deed .

		As for Kant , so for Bout - roux , the practical reason , not the theoretical rea - son , lays bare the nature of reality .

		Spontaneous activity in conformity with an ideal absolutely worthy of realization is symbolic of divine essence .

		Necessity of a sort there is , but not a driving from behind by something already there ; it is being at - tracted by something ahead , a something as yet un - realized , which may indeed never be realized .

		All beings tend to become enamored of the form they have once assumed and so to become fixed .

		Thus arise properties , forces , instincts , habits .

		But the ideal which impelled to activity in these planes can do so again , just as the vision of an ideal may lead a man to break through a network of habits to find a higher expression of his potentialities .

		The com - plete triumph of the ideal , in the shape of the good and the beautiful , would do away with the laws of nature , strictly so called , and would replace them by the free flight of human wills towards perfec - tion , by the `` untrammeled hierarchy of souls . ''

		Well what shall be said of the value of such a book ?

		It is not easy to arrive at a just estimate .

		Its emphasis is undoubtedly right .

		The author does not counsel us to accept the world as it is , but to create the world we want .

		And he breaks with the historians who find in an over-simplified reading of the past a configuration of future possibility .

		Moreover he insists upon experiment as `` the eternal source and rule of science '' and the hope of progress .

		And yet one closes the book as one leaves a magician : the thing was done , but it was after all a trick .

		The author has demonstrated that necessity is an illusion , and he has done it over a range of being one had hardly taken into consideration , and yet one remains in doubt about even such a simple matter as human freedom .

		Besides , what is gained by demonstrating metaphysical contingency if all the while we remain caught in the fell clutch of circumstance ?

		We want
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 261 some one to speak with authority on the possibility of a social state less unfriendly than ours to indi - viduality and initiative ; which will give more chance than we at present dream of to such creative possi - bilities as men actually possess ; in which a premium shall be put upon spontaneity and uniqueness , rather than on acquiescence and conformity .

		And finally , remembering how autocratic God is generally re - ported to be , one may be pardoned for not becoming enthusiastic about a freedom which ' has its beginning and end in him .

		A Literary Swashbuckler JLo ONE who does not `` get to read everything , '' and who thus fails in familiarity with certain tracts in the wide field _ of current fiction ,
Wyndham Lewis	PERSON	'
Tarr	PERSON	-LRB- Knopf ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- may seem rather a nasty mess .

		Yet even a bubbling kettle can be viewed , circumspectly , as a work of art ; and one may perhaps succeed in handling pitch , cautiously , without being defiled .

		On page 226 our author says : `` Tarr had been the real central and absorbing figure , all along , of course , but purposely veiled ... as
Kreisler	PERSON	had been of no importance , though propped up in the foreground . ''

		Thus do the two heroes seem to one of the two heroines .

		But they do not seem so to the reader .

		Tarr to a large extent is but a bulle - tin board for the posting of art-epigrams ; the lime - light is on him at the start but he soon fades into the background or vanishes into darkness to emerge only at the end , where he tries to take on the attri - butes of a human creature by oscillating rather vilely between the two women .


Kreisler	PERSON	, on the other hand , has no need to try to be a human creature ; he is one , however repellent .

		This trans - position of the protagonist prejudices the form and even the direction of the book , and makes it hang lopsided on its hinges .

		Tarr is an elaborate , driving , and confident study of art-life and of `` sex '' in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		But art is minimized save when
Tarr	PERSON	himself bursts into occasional pronunciamientos , and sex is played up throughout .

		This may be necessary for holding the attention of the average sensual reader ; yet art , as anybody knows who has come close to its pro- duction , really does involve thought , industry , tech - nique , processes .

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	might as well have made his people rounders and prostitutes to start with and stopped there .

		His `` art '' cuts mighty little ice .

		For his own good reasons his artists are mostly German : he seems to acknowledge , obscurely , a certain affinity for that race .

		His
Kreisler	PERSON	, the bankrupt and truculent Prussian painter or sculptor one hardly makes out which is a creation of vividness and mark : he will survive as the quin - tessence , expressed in one individual , of the spirit and temper that have kept the world in anguish for the past four years .

		The author in his preface states that the book was begun eight years back , and that his despicable hero was not produced for the gratification of primitive partisanship aroused by the war .


Kreisler	PERSON	becomes thus a marvel of independent observation and of divination ; for the ordinary reader he is , indeed , the book .

		The two women are also Germans .

		One of them , a lymphatic sentimentalist , is handsomely done .

		The other , with Russian affiliations and American education , reminds you , in her ineffectiveness , of
Paul Bour	PERSON	- get 's earlier cosmopolites .

		She is scarcely more of a success than
Tarr	PERSON	himself .

		All these people are turned out from the inside , with an immensity of specious intuition and investigation ; but `` the Frei - herr
Otto Kreisler	PERSON	'' as the author loosely puts it the `` well-behaved , '' the gentleman with a `` uni - versity education , '' and the `` member of an honour - able family , '' is the only one of the set who fully comes through .

		And `` What a set ! ''

		as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	said of the Godwins and
Shelleys	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	finds it necessary to express his views by means of an incessant peppering of italics and an eccentric system of punctuation .

		The more viewy he is , the more numerous the italics and the more wayward the punctuation .

		Yet when he gets away from his views and hits the narrative stride he writes pure novel : his superfluous typographical dec - orations drop away and his page looks as sensible as anybody 's .

		This is particularly the case with the chapters dealing with
Kreisler	PERSON	's challenge , duel , and suiqide .

		The duel is like no other book duel ever encountered .

		It has unlimited vividness , orig - inality , and drive , and seems to promise Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	as a possible novelist of `` premiere force '' after all .

		To sum up : The novel , for all its meticulous care in the matter of book-divisions , has some uncer - tainty of form and of goal .

		Its characterization is confident and pretentious , rather than sound .

		The physiognomy of the average page is annoying .

		Here and there one finds , necessarily , a lack of mere verbal decorum .

		The preface calls upon the artist 's 262 THE DIAL
October	DATE	5 fellow citizens to allow him more freedom to de - velop his visions and ideas and to permit him to economize time by not having to circumvent the facts of existence .

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	has written several pages with his eye doubtless on the English censor , but the deft training imparted by
Paris	LOCATION	has taught him how to `` circumvent , '' even if not to use the facts as `` simply and directly '' as he would have wished .

		In fine ,
Tarr	PERSON	is skittishly brilliant , indecorous , brash , bursting with vitality a possible sign in the heavens for the younger generation , but somewhat unbridled and absurd to the older .

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	appears to know his
Paris	LOCATION	his , not mine , thank God .

		Nor yours , I hope .

		His presentation of it is full of swank and swagger his own favorite words .

		Most of the time he seems as militant and arrogant as his own Prussian painter -LRB- or sculptor -RRB- , a literary swashbuckler , a D'Artagnan of the pen .

		His book is a dashing and bizarre experiment , yet holding solid hopes for the future .


HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		Who Pays for War ?

		IAXI CES ARE said to be unescapable , and this is especially true in war time .

		The matter of interest however is who really bears the burden of a tax , and the further question concerning the reality of any scientific basis for taxation .

		One school of econo - mists says that no absolute rule or norm for taxation exists , and that taxation is not exact but is only a question of pulling the feathers with the least amount of squawk from the bird .

		On the other hand many economists assert that taxation can and should be put on a scientific basis and that it is not merely empirical .

		The question is not merely an academic one , because touching a man 's pocketbook is touching a tender spot .

		A striking feature of public finance in recent years has been the remark - able growth of public expenditure by national , state , and local bodies .

		The phenomenon has been world - wide and has been caused not only by increased preparation for war and by the burdens of past wars , but also by increased public improvements , outlays for sanitation and health , education in pub - lic schools and universities , parks and playgrounds , to mention only a few out of the many causes .

		To this has been added the greater burden of the pres - ent war and the immediate need of adequate finances .

		Our money and
the State	ORGANIZATION	, by
Hartley Withers	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , which grew out of a course of lectures delivered at the
London	LOCATION
School of Eco	ORGANIZATION	- nomics , is marked by the same lucidity , sanity , and logic of expression found in the author 's other books on public finance .

		The volume is a small one , but its value is in inverse ratio to its size .

		The extension of governmental spending is brought out and defended in the first chapter .

		The state is not merely a police officer ; it should provide not only for public justice and defense but for the public good in general .

		The most distinct and orig - inal part of the book is found in the discussion of the comparative advantages of borrowing and taxa - tion .

		The adroit politician advocates borrowing because taxation would make his policy or himself unpopular .

		By borrowing , the public thinks it avoids taxation and thus hands on to posterity the task of finding the money that is required for present needs .

		`` Posterity , '' says a recent bank circular , `` will chiefly benefit from this struggle for freedom and should pay its part . ''

		This is largely a delu - sion .

		Says Mr.
Withers	PERSON	: We can not hand its burden on to posterity .

		It has to be paid for now by somebody , and all wars have always been paid for during the time in which they were fought and finished up .

		War can not be carried on with goods produced or work done either by our ancestors or by our posterity .

		The goods consumed in war shot , shells , rifles , food , clothes , horses , motor-lorries , wagons , ships and everything else have to be new and up to date , and , apart from the store of them with which the contending nations began , are made and produced as the war goes on .

		As they clearly have to be in existence before they can be used it is obvious that they can not be produced by posterity .

		The British army can not eat the bread that is going to be sown in
1930	DATE	, or wear boots made out of hides whose original owners are yet unborn .

		Whatever posterity produces will belong to posterity for its own use , and nothing that we do now can deprive posterity of a single ear of wheat that it sows and grows .

		The point is that the sacrifice is a present one because
$ 500	MONEY	paid for bonds means less for other things , and interest and principal must be paid by the bondholder as taxpayer ; and not only that , but higher prices for all necessities ensue because of inflation .

		The borrowing system gives the citizen the choice of paying up his share of the war cost now by subscribing to a loan , and afterwards being taxed to pay himself interest and to pay himself back , or of paying nothing at the time when the loan is issued , and being made to pay regularly thereafter interest and redemption money to those who did subscribe .

		By borrowing money for war purposes a
Government	ORGANIZATION	sets up a roundabout process by which the war , in so far as it is paid for by this means , is paid for three times
1918	DATE	263 over .

		First , it is paid for as it goes on by citizens who subscribe to the loans ; then it is paid for by the citizens as a whole , who provide the money needed for this pur - pose , plus interest , by taxation ; and the
Government	ORGANIZATION	finally hands the money back to the original subscribers , or their estates .

		Goods and services in war are destroyed and there is nothing to show for them , and so the sacrifice is made by the present and not the future .

		War is certainly the worst purpose for which the bor - rowing system can be used , because in war time , especi - ally when war is on a stupendous scale as now , taxation -LRB- 1 -RRB- is easily raised , -LRB- 2 -RRB- is little if any hindrance to in - dustry , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- produces a beneficial effect on the con - sumption of the community .

		Moreover war , especially when on a stupendous scale , is certain to be followed by a period of dislocation and uncertainty in which industry should be as free as possible to contend with the difficul - ties that face it , and should therefore be as little as possible burdened by taxes that have to be paid to debt - holders .

		Practical necessity may make borrowing wise , but such issuance of bonds should be relative to taxation .

		The cost of the Civil War , for instance , is said to have been doubled by the issuance of greenbacks and bonds , and the bill was not paid by posterity .

		Another chapter is devoted largely to the income tax as an ideal tax because it is based on ability to pay .

		Mr.
Godfrey N. Nelson	PERSON	, in his book The In - come Tax -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- , presents a study of that tax on the side of law and accounting , and of the practical application of the provisions of the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral Income Tax Act , the War Income Tax Act , and the War Excess Profits Tax Laws , together with the Corporation Capital Stock Tax Law and rulings thereon , the Federal Estate Tax , Excise and miscellaneous war taxes , and the
New York State	ORGANIZATION	Income Tax statute applicable to manufacturing and mercantile corporations .

		A supplementary pamphlet dealing with the Income Tax and the Excess Profits Tax has been added , and the work is a most authoritative statement of present phases of taxation , especially of war taxes .

		The value of the work lies in the fact that its author has prepared , and advised with regard to , many income tax returns of corporations and individuals .

		This experience is used in the presentation of the various income laws and in the elucidation of various
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	decisions .

		Successive chapters are devoted to the Income Tax as applied to individuals , withholding tax , income tax as applied to partnerships , income taxes applica - ble to corporations , war excess profits tax , deprecia - tion , and bookkeeping suggestions .

		This volume will be found a practical guide to the intricacies of the income and war tax laws .


GEORGE M. JANES	PERSON	.

		Strong Timber WH rHEN
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	's
Chicago	LOCATION	Poems appeared two years ago , most of the official votaries and ves - trymen in the temple of the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	raised their hands in pious horror at this open violation of their care - fully enshrined sanctities .

		In the name of their beloved Past , they prepared a bill of particulars that bristled with charges as contradictory as they were varied .

		They were all united however on one point
Sandburg	PERSON	's brutality .

		In this they were correct .

		And without hastening to soften the acknowledgment , I should like to reprint a short passage from
J. M. Synge	PERSON	's Poems and Translations to amplify the admission .

		In a preface to his brief and astringent verses , a preface that might stand as the credo of the new spirit in our literature ,
Synge	PERSON	wrote : In these days poetry is usually a flower of evil or good ; but it is the timber that wears most surely , and there is no timber that has not strong roots in the clay and worms ... Even if we grant that exalted poetry can be kept successful by itself , the strong things of life are needed in poetry also , to show that what is exalted or tender is not made by feeble blood .

		It can almost be said that before verse can be human again , it must learn to be brutal .

		In
England	LOCATION	,
Masefield	PERSON	was the first of the mod - erns to fulfill this prophecy and , with half a dozen racy narratives , he took a generation of readers out of the humid atmosphere of libraries and literary hothouses .

		He took them out into the coarse sun - light and the unchaste air .

		He brought back to verse that blend of beauty and brutality which is poetry 's most human and enduring quality .

		He rediscovered the rich and almost vulgar vividness that is the lifeblood of Chaucer and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, of
Burns	PERSON	and Rabelais , of
Horace and Heine	PERSON	, of Swift and
Villon	PERSON	and all those who were not only great artists but great humanists .

		He brought a new glamour to poetry ; or rather he brought back the oldest glamour , the splendid illusion of a raw and vigorous reality .

		And so
Sandburg	PERSON	.

		With a more uncovered di - rectness , he goes straight to his theme .

		As in
Chicago Poems	LOCATION	, the first poem of his new volume Cornhuskers -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.30	MONEY	-RRB- brims with an up - lifted coarseness , an almost animal exultation that is none the less an exaltation .

		I was born on the prairie , and the milk of its wheat , the red of its clover , the eyes of its women , gave me a song and a slogan .

		Here the water went down , the icebergs slid with 264 THE DIAL
October	DATE	5 gravel , the gaps and the valleys hissed , and the black loam came .

		Here between the sheds of the
Rocky Mountains	ORGANIZATION	and the
Appalachians	LOCATION	, here now a morning star fixes a fire sign over the timber claims and cow-pastures , the corn-belt , the cotton-belt , the cattle ranches .

		Here the grey geese go five hundred miles and back with a wind under their wings honking the cry for a new home .

		Here I know I will hanker after nothing so much as one more sunrise or a sky moon of fire doubled to a river moon of water .

		The prairie sings to me in the forenoon and I know in the night I rest easy in the prairie arms , on the prairie heart .

		These are the opening lines of Prairie , a wider and more confident rhythm than
Sandburg	PERSON	has yet attempted .

		The gain in power is evident at once and grows with each section of this new collection .

		The tone in
Cornhuskers	ORGANIZATION	has more depth and dig - nity ; the note is not louder , but it is larger .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	Poems there were times when the poet was so determined to worship ruggedness that one could hear his adjectives strain to achieve a physical strength of their own .

		One occasionally was put in mind of the professional strong man in front of a mirror , of virility basking in the spotlight , of an epithet exhibiting its muscle .

		Here the accent is less vociferous , more vitalizing ; it is a summoning of strong things rather than the mere stereotypes of strength .

		Observe the unusual athletic beauty of Leather Leggings , Always the Mob , The Four
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, and this muscular Prayers of Steel : Lay me on an anvil , O God .

		Beat me and hammer me into a crowbar .

		Let me pry loose old walls .

		Let me lift and loosen old foundations .

		Lay me on an anvil , O God .

		Beat and hammer me into a steel spike .

		Drive me into the girders that hold a skyscraper to - gether .

		Take red-hot rivets and fasten me into the central girders .

		Let me be the great nail holding a skyscraper through blue nights into white stars .

		These and a dozen others seem a direct answer to
Whitman	PERSON	's hope of a democratic poetry that would express itself in a democratic and even a distinctively American speech .

		He maintained that before
America	LOCATION	could have a powerful poetry our poets would have to learn the use of hard and powerful words ; the greatest artists , he insisted , were simple and direct , never merely `` polite or obscure . ''

		`` Words are magic ... limber , lasting , fierce words , '' he wrote in an unfinished sketch for a projected lecture .

		`` Do you suppose the liberties and the brawn of These States have to do only with delicate lady-words ?

		with gloved gentlemen-words ? ''

		Later he said , `` American writers will show far more freedom in the use of names .

		Ten thousand common and idiomatic words are growing , or are today already grown , out of which vast numbers could be used by American writers words that would be welcomed by the nation , being of the national blood . ''

		.

		No contemporary is so responsive to these limber and idiomatic phrases as
Sandburg	PERSON	.

		His language lives almost as fervidly as the life from which it is taken .

		And yet his intensity is not always raucous ; it would be a great mistake to believe that Sand - burg excels only in verse that is heavy-fisted and stentorian .

		What could be quieter and yet more vigorous than the suggestive Interior , the calm irony in Malice to None , the solemn simplicity of Grass , or the strange requiem note in Cool Tombs ?

		When
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	was shoveled into the tombs , he forgot the copperheads and the assassin ... in the dust , in the cool tombs .

		And
Ulysses Grant	PERSON	lost all thought of con men and Wall Street , cash and collateral turned ashes ... in the dust , in the cool tombs .

		Pocahontas ' body , lovely as a poplar , sweet as a red haw in
November	DATE	or a paw-paw in
May	DATE	, did she won - , der ?

		does she remember ?

		... in the dust , in the cool tombs ?

		Take any streetful of people buying clothes and groceries , cheering a hero or throwing confetti and blowing tin horns ... tell me if the lovers are losers ... tell me if any get more than the lovers ... in the dust ... in the cool tombs .

		This creative use of proper names and slang -LRB- which would so have delighted Whitman -RRB- , this interlarding of cheapness and nobility is
Sandburg	LOCATION	's most characteristic idiom as well as his greatest gift .

		And it is this mingling that enriches his heritage of mingled blood ; the rude practical voice of the American speaks through a strain of ruder Swedish symbolism .

		Beneath the slang , one is aware of the mystic ;
Cornhuskers	ORGANIZATION	shows a cosmic use of pene - trating patois ; it is
Swedenborg	PERSON	in terms of State Street .

		This mysticism shines out of Caboose Thoughts ,
Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	,
Southern Pacific	ORGANIZATION	,
Old Timers	ORGANIZATION	.

		And it is always a more extended and musical spirituality than the earlier volume ; the new collection may not be more dynamic , but it is more lyric .

		The struggles , the social criticism , the concen - trated anger , and the protests are here as prom - inently as in
Chicago	LOCATION	Poems , but they assert them - selves with less effort .

		The war has temporarily harmonized them ; they are still rebellious , but somehow resigned .

		The chants of revolt are seldom out of tune with
Sandburg	PERSON	's purely pictorial pieces .

		Both are the product of a strength that derives its inspiration from the earth ; they are made of tough timber ; they have `` strong roots in the clay and worms . ''

		THE DIAL
CLARENCE BRITTEN GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS SCOFIELD THAYER HELEN MAROT	PERSON	WN JUNE 6 WE ANNOUNCED THAT WITH THIS issue THE DIAL would begin weekly publication .

		Since
June	DATE	, however , the paper shortage has become so acute that we do not feel justified in making the change at this time .

		We are merely changing from semi-monthly publication , with one issue each in
July	DATE	and
August	DATE	, to a straight fortnightly basis twenty-six numbers a year for which the old subscription rate of
$ 3	MONEY	will continue in force as long as soaring production costs permit .

		And at the same time , we are making every other effort to cooperate with the
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	in the saving of paper by cutting off exchanges , dropping departments , reducing the size of type , invading the margins .

		In fewer pages the new DIAL will carry more text than before .

		If at first it meets the eye strangely c'est la guerre .

		I.NATIONS REVEAL THEIR METTLE EVEN MORE IN time of victory than in time of defeat .

		All of us on the side of the Allies , and especially we Americans , should realize that in all probability the next year will bring us face to face with the great moral issue of this war .

		No longer is there any doubt of Ger - many 's defeat .

		As
Marshal Foch	ORGANIZATION	has so graphically expressed it , `` we have reached the summit of the war and are now going down the slope perhaps slowly at first , but it will be like a ball rolling down hill , which gathers speed as it goes . ''

		The
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	may go through this coming winter , but unless reinforced by millions of men and tons of material from
Russia	LOCATION	, they will not go through an - other .

		And the likelihood of their deriving any effective assistance from
Russia	LOCATION	is slim .

		It is no longer ourselves , as
General Haig	ORGANIZATION	said in the dark days of the
spring	DATE	offensive , but the Germans who are fighting with their back to the wall .

		Conse - quently while less than ever a time to slacken , by ever so small a degree , our military efforts , so less than ever is it a time to slacken our plans for the permanent and effective organization of that kind of peace which , as President
Wilson	PERSON	said in his answer to
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, we have already so clearly described .

		We entered this war with high motives ; the real treason to those who have died in it and to the many more of our own who must die in it is not , as too many excited civilians are even now telling us , the abandonment of the weak mo - tive of revenge but the abandonment of those ideals which look forward to a more decent system of inter - national relations .

		Question any of our own men on the way to
France	LOCATION	, question any
Tommy	PERSON	or any poilu who has spent a year in the trenches do they fight with a consuming hatred of the entire German people and of anything and everything German ?

		They do not .

		They fight with a consuming hatred of the whole system of unscrupulous military aggres - sion of which the German autocracy happens at the moment to be the most dangerous and obvious ex - ample .

		They intend to destroy this autocracy and they will destroy it , unless the German people should themselves do it first .

		They realize , as
Burke	PERSON	real - ized about
America	LOCATION	when we were waging our war for independence , that an indictment can not be drawn up against a whole people that their job is not to exterminate
Germany	LOCATION	but to bring her to a mood wherein she can be a peaceable and law - abiding member of the society of nations .

		This is in no sense a plea for `` easy treatment '' of
Germany	LOCATION	at the peace conference , nor will it be interpreted as such except by those who already have lost what little heads they had to lose .

		There will be no com - promise on principles .

		But the principle on which first of all there will be no compromise will be the principle of democratic international cooperation and the destruction of the idea of the `` balance of power . ''

		Let us not fail to learn from the mistakes of our enemies .

		Germany could not stand the acid test of victory , or , to put it accurately , what she fondly imagined was victory .

		When
Russia	LOCATION	lay helpless before her she abandoned all pretenses of adhering to the liberal resolution of the Reichstag and concluded the shameful treaties of Brest-Litovsk and
Bucharest	LOCATION	.

		She could not restrain her greed in what she believed the hour of her triumph .

		And the consequence of it has been her downfall .

		Her moral defeat was recorded in the
spring	DATE	of this year .

		Some day not far distant
Germany	LOCATION	will lie helpless before us .

		In that hour of triumph let us remain true to the ideals which inspired us when we entered the war .

		Let us support President
Wilson	PERSON	in his de - termination that only even-handed justice shall be accorded to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Let us not be beguiled by the siren voices of those , intoxicated with a sense of our power , who would re-create the old system of inter - national anarchy in new form and make a mockery of those high and generous ideals of a new order for the furtherance of which we are today giving in such unstinted measure .

		266 THE DIAL
October	DATE	5
ATA	ORGANIZATION	RECENT CONFERENCE OF EDUCATORS IN THIS country a guest from
Great Britain	LOCATION	was astonished to learn that the study of German in several of our elementary and high schools had been abandoned .

		He was bewildered by the evident patriotic pride with which this curtailment of the study of modern languages was related by those who had been most instrumental in effecting it .

		Questioned himself , he said that his own children in
England	LOCATION	had begun the study of German before the war began and that it had never occurred to him to make them stop .

		On the contrary , he had because of the war itself rather encouraged them to continue the study .

		For the war could end in only one of two possible ways either in a stalemate and something like a negoti - ated peace , in which case it was imperative to have a knowledge of the German language in order to understand what new plans for political and com - mercial aggression
Germany	LOCATION	might be planning ; or in a victory to be followed by a more friendly and rational system of international relations , in which case it was equally imperative to have a knowledge of the German language in order that the new amity might become a reality instead of a sham .

		These considerations seem to us unanswerable .

		It is well to remember that neither in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, nor
Italy	LOCATION	has there been any campaign against the study of German .

		Our allies are hardly so naive as to imagine that one can destroy one 's enemy by resolutely refusing to understand him .

		They also realize that however the war ends , the German people are still going to exist .

		They are going to be a fact , and an important fact .

		We have got to learn how to live with them , and even if the worst comes to the worst and they are allowed to live only on sufferance , we shall have to understand their mood and temper if we wish effectively to forestall any new intrigues against the peace of the world .

		In fact from no point of view can the present hysterical campaign against the study of German be described except as the outcome of provincialism and folly .

		It is therefore gratifying to see already the beginnings of a reaction .

		We understand that many of our officers are now studying German under direct sanc - tion of the War Department .

		The public too is becoming dubious about the wisdom of preparing ourselves for the after the war period by refusing to understand those who in all probability will be our chief commercial and industrial competitors .

		A recent letter in
The New York Times	ORGANIZATION	from
Maurice Frances Eagan	PERSON	is symptomatic of this change in point of view .

		He writes : The Americans can afford to neglect no foreign language ; and to refuse to make ourselves masters of the language of our enemies is as illogical as it is impractical ... When all
Berlin	LOCATION	was singing the Hymn of Hate and `` strafing ''
England	LOCATION	, The Times of
London	LOCATION	and even
The National Review	ORGANIZATION	were displayed in the hotels and Shake - speare played to crowded houses .

		The Germans wanted to know more of the psychology of their foes ... Is the future diplomatist to be hampered because German is `` barred '' ?

		Is the Teutonic spirit to be so tamed that it will not be necessary to understand it ?

		Canst thou brook the leviathan by pretending that it is dead ?

		The war ought to teach us that we have too long rejoiced in our insular ignorance of foreign peoples and affairs .

		But the final answer to the controversy was given by a private in one of our camps who was discovered diligently poring over a German grammar .

		`` What 's the idea ? ''

		asked one of his pals .

		`` Want to learn how to make love to the German maidens after we cross the Rhine ? ''

		`` Hell , no , '' was the brusque retort .

		`` I want to tell the
Kaiser	PERSON	just what I think of him in his own language . ''

		W HEN HISTORY SUMS UP THIS WAR IT WILL NOT be the ferocity of the German submarine campaign that will be remembered so much as its fatuity .

		Na - tional pride can survive a reputation of brutality , but it can not so easily live down a reputation of colossal and abject failure .

		The inability of the submarine to prevent the transportation of an Ameri - can army to
France	LOCATION	will be remembered by the world long after specific atrocities are forgotten .

		The German submarine will take its place with the Spanish Armada and
Napoleon	PERSON	's retreat from Rus - sia as a symbol of ruthless and humiliating defeat of the pride and folly of imperial power .

		And such a defeat covers a government with ridicule just in proportion to the magnitude of the attempt .

		The Germans have tried , they have boasted , they have prophesied , and the American transports have sailed over the seas almost as if the U-boats were no more than the porpoises which play beside the foaming vessels .

		And many of these ships that have sailed over again and again are the largest and finest of the Germans ' own merchant marine .

		Irony heaped upon ridicule !

		That
Germany	LOCATION	should have built the mighty and indispensable fleet that should carry over her last and freshest hordes of enemies !

		His - tory , to the eternal discomfiture of the German people , will fix in legend the fact that while the great German ships were bearing an American army to
France	LOCATION	, the German submarine was engaged in sinking fishing-smacks and coal-barges off the coast of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		KNGLISH DISCUSSION OF THE KING 'S BIRTHDAY Honors for Literature -LRB- to borrow the terminology of prize contests -RRB- has received an amusing post - script from

		Mr.

C. K. S.	PERSON	and Welsh blood is doubtless no disqualification .

		It is said Dr.

		No wonder Mr.

		1918 THE DIAL 267 Foreign Comment A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRIKE I HE STRIKE of the
London	LOCATION	policemen had its amusing and `` human interest '' side , and it was de - cidedly unfortunate that merely this side seemed to impress the American newspapers .

		The strike it - self was soon over , due to the surrender of the Gov - ernment , and presumably it has been as soon for - gotten .

		A fundamental issue however was raised and the more alert of the English press were quick to perceive this issue .

		It is stated succinctly in The Manchester Guardian of
September 2	DATE	: We put aside for the moment the question of the semi - military character of the police or of any special under - takings that they give .

		We will regard them only as carrying on an essential industry .

		Their strike and its immediate success is the most complete demonstration yet given of a new power in our industrial system .

		This is the power of the workers in any industry which is not only essential but urgent to hold up the public and com - pel surrender .

		An industry may be essential in the long run , but we may get on for a good while without it .

		We could not very well do without knives , but we could stand a strike of knife-grinders for a considerable time without minding it very much .

		But there is a group of industries on which daily life depends , and which can not be sus - pended for a single day without making everyone feel it .

		Such is municipal lighting ; such , as we found the other day in
Manchester	LOCATION	, is street-cleaning ; such is transport by tram , tube , ` bus , or train ; such is the milk supply ; such , finally , the police .

		Services of this kind have been in the past and perhaps are still sometimes in the present monop - olized by private people or great companies , who are thus able to make the public pay highly , and that some - times for inefficient service , but who at least have no in - terest in the sudden suspension of the service .

		Now the progress of combination is rapidly putting the control of them into the hands of the workers , who collectively have just the same motives for getting as much as they can out of the public , and who have in their hands the weapon , not to be wielded by the capitalist , of sudden and absolute stoppage .

		The workers still command a great measure of public sympathy , for in general they have much leeway to make up in the improvement of their conditions , and they in turn tend to sympathize with and support their fellow-workers .

		But in germ the entire method contains within itself the possibility of a grip on the life of the community by a comparatively small sec - tion of ^ workpeople , and the same principle being ex - tended it will be found that power , and with it privilege and pay , is passing not from the capitalist to the worker , for which there is much to be said , but , in every industry and every department , from the body of employers and employed to that particular section of the employed whose work is the essential urgency .

		This is the New Privilege , and the struggle with it seems likely to complicate the whole course of that social evolution of democracy which has been in rapid progress throughout the war .

		How shall this situation be remedied ?

		The writer in The Guardian suggests that a system of dealing with grievances be devised similar to the system of the
Whitley Industrial Councils	ORGANIZATION	, which contemplates a representation of both employees and employers -LRB- in this case the state -RRB- on a board where the deciding vote is cast by some disinterested judge .

		He points out that many disputes can not be settled by trade action alone , for they concern the entire community .

		And he concludes with these words of warning : Democracy in
England	LOCATION	has made a gigantic stride during the war , and will look to much fuller approaches to economic equality when peace returns than anything that contented it in
1914	DATE	.

		Parliament may deal with the situa - tion , and only a body representing the democracy as a whole can deal with it adequately .

		But if
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, re - elected under abnormal conditions , is filled with the old type of politician , the problem will be taken up by the trade unions and the attempt will be made to force vio - lent and partial solutions by successive strikes .

		If
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment can or will find out how to give to the returning soldiers and sailors an effective share in the
England	LOCATION	that they have saved , well and good .

		If not , power will pass from
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	to the strikers .

		The New Statesman -LRB- in its issue of
September 7	DATE	-RRB- reflects the general attitude of the English public in its congratulations to the police on their victory : We regret that the police were compelled to strike , but be heartily congratulate them upon their victory .

		Their grievances were manifold , and if , after years of `` vic - timization , '' stern refusal , and procrastination , they de - cided that nothing but a strike could bring the authorities to reason , they had plenty of grounds for their belief .

		A very brief , and on the whole very orderly and good - tempered demonstration , was all that was necessary .

		It was too late to try to hit at the
Union	ORGANIZATION	once more by wholesale dismissals ; the public and the newspapers -LRB- though shocked -RRB- were uniformly sympathetic with the strikers ; Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	was staggered to find , quite suddenly , that a force he believed to live in Paradisal content was thoroughly discontented ; and the Govern - ment made a swift climb-down .

		Before the strike the minimum wage was 30s. , with a war bonus of 12s .

		and a 2s .

		6d .

		allowance for children ; the total has now been increased by 13s .

		There is also to be a non-contributory pension for widows .

		Recognition has not been accorded in terms , but the
Union Executive	ORGANIZATION	were met by Mr.
George	PERSON	as the men 's representatives , and ex-P.C .

		Thiel , provisional organiser of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and delegate to the
London	LOCATION
Trades Council	ORGANIZATION	, is to be restored to the post from which ' he had been dismissed for taking part in `` an un - authorised association . ''

		This means that if `` recognition '' has not been given in words , it has been given in all save words .

		The Nation -LRB- in the issue of the same date -RRB- rather makes fun of The Guardian for its concern , but hastens at once to admit the seriousness of the situ - ation : Only The Manchester Guardian and The Morning Post seemed deeply shocked by this dramatic announcement of our guardians that they were men and workers , and not mere tools of
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Following close upon the heels of a period of strikes in munition , transport , and other semi-public services , this incident deserves more serious attention than it has received .

		In peace-time its sudden occurrence in
London	LOCATION	would have caused the utmost con - sternation in the breasts of law-abiding citizens .

		But m the stress and turmoil of these times it has served for little more than a momentary diversion .

		We even doubt whether authority feels deeply wounded by the complete - ness of its surrender , or has learnt its lesson .

		What should that lesson be ?

		In the final paragraph of the article
The Nation	ORGANIZATION	gives its own general conclusion , wherein the possi - bilities of strife in the future after the war are resolutely faced and the saner preventives given : 268 THE JDlAi
October 5	DATE	What is wanted is a radical and reasonable revision of discipline , and the dismissal of all juggling pretences that the discipline of any service , public or private , deprives the servants of the reasonable rights of self-determina - tion in the terms of their employment .

		And , in the last resort , it will be well , and for the public interest when a wider conception of that interest is taken , to allow the right to strike , as a safety valve in the economic system .

		For , less than ever after this war and its economic conse - quences , will it be possible to find men of so servile a disposition that they will bind themselves to continue working upon terms which appear to them unjust and grievous without quick and effective means of redress .

		We fully admit the perils which lie in the submission of economic issues to the final arbitrament , even of the passive kind of force implied in a strike .

		The large - scale example of war will have made a deep and per - haps a dangerous impression upon the conduct of in - dustrial strife .

		There will be some disposition every - where among strongly placed workers to use to the ut - most the pull which their place of vantage gives them .

		There are those who envisage the world of labor follow - ing the example of capital in bringing about a distribution of wealth based on forceful pulls , the share of which for any group of workers will be determinfd by the strength of their union and the quantity of damage or danger they can inflict by the temporary withdrawal of their services .

		If the future of the world of states is left in the grip of competing militarism , we admit some likelihood that the image of this brutality and injustice will be reflected in the smaller patterns of internal economic strife .

		But , given a better and more peaceable international situation , we entertain brighter hopes of the organization of our industries and public services , set upon a basis of disci - pline which shall be substantially self-discipline , and carrying an acceptance of fair conditions because the methods of arranging them are fair , and because pub - licity can operate effectively to check extravagances in the apportionment of wages , salaries , and profits in public and private work .

		Communications EXCLUSIVE AMERICANISM OIR : I HAVE just been fingering the family album .

		It was the communication from Mr.
Vachel Lind	PERSON	- say in your last issue that called my mind from its feverish pursuit of current events back to the calm atmosphere of the
American Tradition	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have been sitting in the attic , amid the relics of the good old days , in silent communion with the spirits of my colonial forbears , calling up the fine old treasures of
New England	LOCATION	folklore and visualizing the rugged form and puritanic features of those grand old men of the stern and rock-bound conscience .

		However , I find my natural enjoyment of these long neglected associations somewhat tempered by remorse .

		With what chaste horror would these red - blooded ancestors of mine regard the return of the prodigal were they aware of the vicissitudes through which he had been led into the snares of Socialism , with its attendant evils of the `` foreign accent , '' the tactless impropriety of unceasing propaganda , and the indiscriminate application of its rub-elbows de - mocracy to all manner of men , without the respect - able exercise of good taste !

		I am convinced that I should not find such a ready welcome from my flesh-and-blood forefathers as I can arbitrarily claim from their respected shades .

		Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	compels me to believe this , for what he does not know about American Socialism is easily outweighed by his ob - vious saturation with American tradition .

		What we want , says Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	, is a nice , rea - sonable , well-bred radicalism and internationalism .

		Moreover it is possible to get exactly what we want , quite simply and without unladylike insistence .

		First we must Americanize our concepts and take the struggle for their realization out of the hands of all save those of the good old native stock .

		This ac - complished , all we need to do is to Americanize the world 's international thought , and map out an in - ternational federation based on the American con - stitutional model .

		I suppose all Socialists ought to welcome with acclaim Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's new revelation .

		For after all , the end is of chief concern , and not the means , provided these are honorable .

		And why devote long endeavor to the upbuilding of an international mass solidarity , a spiritual bond between the world 's peoples , when by simply putting the job in the right hands and following the prescription we can create the clay structure of a new world order , which , warmed by the breath of the living American spirit , will glow at once into throbbing life ?

		The obvious answer is that the matter is not so simple , either with regard to the performance or the performers .

		If the performance is to be a suc - cess , it must partake of the adaptability of true in - ternational wisdom rather than the stubbornness of particularistic pride , and the vision of the social pioneer rather than the traditionalistic astigmatism of the professional historian .

		Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	views the past with a vision almost telescopic .

		Our so-called
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, in its immediate performance , was nothing more than a war of secession from a tyrannical overlord , fo - mented by a large and active group of liberty-loving seditionists .

		The revolution sought by radicals to - day promises nothing less than a sweeping elimina - tion of existing social and economic values , and a world-wide substitution therefor of true human re - lationships without artificial constraints and un - folding in the sunlight of political , social , and eco - nomic freedom .

		And it is this gigantic and delicate undertaking that Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	would entrust to the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution !

		The valuable papers read before these societies , the mon - uments and tablets set up , the family traditions told to a few hold precedents for an absolutely non-Germanic , non-Marxian internationalism and radicalism .

		These precedents meet every channel of precedent in the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can mind and the Democratic and Republican parties , and yet are not disgustingly Anglo-Saxon .

		I am moved to ask by what right of precedent does Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	thus circumscribe what he chooses to call `` the American mind '' ?

		From the very be - ginnings of the little commonwealths that joined to form this nation ,
America	LOCATION	has been distinct for the
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 269 cosmopolitan character of its population .

		Strictly speaking , there has never been here such a thing as a pure native stock .

		The `` American mind , '' far from being the heritage of a privileged few , has ever been the composite will of a proudly cosmopolitan people .

		Revolutionary tendencies belong in the category of acquired , rather than inherited , characteristics .

		The very people who take most pride in their revo - lutionary ancestry are often those to whom a truly revolutionary idea is a veritable bete noir , and to whom every genuine revolutionary is anathema .

		If Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	would indeed have the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution assume the role of administrators of radical ideas , he could best serve that end by exerting himself to rouse them from their comfortable complacency in the status quo into a perception of vital social needs .

		So long as city librarians can testify that those about whom Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	is inclined to sneer are the country 's most faithful students of economics , history , art , litera - ture , sociology , and political science , while `` assimi - lated '' Americans are avidly consuming volumes of tawdry fiction , we can not honestly be put out of countenance because they have `` arrogated '' to them - selves the leadership of progressive social forces .

		The little newcomers one can hear in any urban schoolroom , singing , with innocent untruthfulness , `` Land where my fathers died , '' are no less destined to be the creators of a rich and characterful public opinion than are the exclusive possessors of colonial pedigrees .

		The simple , constructive way to eliminate the hyphen - ated revolutionary is by
American Revolutionary	ORGANIZATION	anecdote , carefully and correctly told in a way that will appeal to all hot-blooded Americans ... The Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution have accumulated these stories by the thousand , printed and unprinted , and have not the least notion how useful they are right now .

		Sic !

		One thing may be counted on : if the Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution ever find they are in possession of literature useful in actual revolutionary propaganda , historical rec - ords will suffer a sudden paucity of `` carefully and correctly told '' Revolutionary anecdote !

		The panacea for the class struggle is `` the Ameri - can system , ruthlessly applied . ''

		Thus by a species of beneTolent schrecklichkeit , the universal use of the lawn mower , the
Ford	ORGANIZATION	car , and the
Saturday Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	,
America	LOCATION	will automatically and un - consciously melt into a homogeneous society of nouveaux riches .

		The remedy for international disorder is a
United States of the World	LOCATION	, with a World Constitution though , to be sure , no provision is made for the dis - position of that
august	DATE	body of potentates known as
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		However there is sufficient strength in the analogy to prohibit a light dismissal of it .

		It is not so much with Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's analogy that I am at odds just now as it is with his naive faith in the possibilities of any fiat scheme whatso - ever , lacking the support of popular international solidarity .

		Few men today question the desirability of a league of nations .

		And yet - the exact character of that association is a matter fraught with vast social consequences for good or ill .

		Shall we wake to find ourselves committed to an ex-presidential League to Prevent Peace or a League to Spank In - cipient Revolutions a mere league of governments ?

		Or may we hope to achieve an association of nations bound by `` friendship , the only cement that can hold the world together '' a league of peoples ?

		If the latter is what we truly desire , it behooves all true apostles of liberal principles , like THE DIAL , to reject Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's advice , so far as that advice would deprive American public opinion of any salu - tary element it can profitably utilize .

		We need the fresh reaction of honest newcomers to our sacred white cows and our golden-calf economics .

		And especially is it to be hoped that American Socialism , even if not perfectly attuned to the heart throbs of the living
American Tradition	ORGANIZATION	, may yet make an indispensable contribution to that popular interna - tional solidarity which alone can prevent a fiat association of nations from becoming dangerously top-heavy and acting as a constant brake on inter - national dynamics .

		At any rate , may a kindly disposed
Providence	LOCATION	render the American public immune from smug an - cestor worship and from a conception of democracy which goes about as deep as that of the ingenuous Irishman who was heard to exclaim : ``
Shure	PERSON	, wan man is jist as good as another , an ' betther , too ! ''

		MORE ADVICE ABOUT POLICY I ^ IR : I HAVE read and twice re-read Mr.
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	's Word of Advice appearing in your issue of
September 5	DATE	, but I must confess that what he is driving at is not at all clear .

		On one view it ap - pears mere verbiage padding a single idea , and on another it appears to be a lot of ideas muddled up together and insufficiently treated .

		If the single idea be to set the editor of THE DIAL on a new trail , then I hope the editor will not worry himself about it , as the policy of THE DIAL is about as good and as sane as it could be and requires no revision whatever .

		THE DIAL has as fine and clear a grasp of the events of which it treats as any paper published .

		Right through , from the literary com - ment to the world movements , the aim is , to me , obviously consistent and apparent .

		If the second view of Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's letter be adopted that it consists of several ideas then I dare not trouble you with my comments .

		I can see so much that could be said in traverse and refutation that it would be a sin to waste your time on reading what might be written in that connection .

		By
Maurice Parmelee	PERSON	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Criminology , the latest contribution from the facile pen of Professor
Parmelee	PERSON	, is a companion volume to his Poverty and Social Progress .

		It is a readable , comprehensive statement of the present status of the science of criminology .

		The book is well got up , with a very satisfactory bibliography , which - the author modestly calls a `` partial '' bibliog - raphy .

		In this he sacrifices pedantic completeness to good judgment in selection .

		As in his other works , Professor
Parmelee	PERSON	emphasizes the biological factors which are concerned in the production of those social disorders summed up in the term `` criminology . ''

		Naturally , with so large a subject presented in so brief a form , topics are here and there passed over more cursorily than the reader might wish ; but the references to the literature will inform him where he may find more complete and detailed accounts .

		As an introduction to the study of criminology this book may be recommended to those who are un - familiar with the subject ; while for the more experi - enced workers it will be useful as a concise resume of the manifold aspects of the science .

		TROM BAPAUME TO
PASSCHENDAELE	LOCATION	.

		By
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.


Philip Gibbs	PERSON	did not stint in giving of his spirit to the work of setting down day by day a record of war 's bloody pageant .

		In the introduction to this volume of his despatches recounting the Battle of
Arras	LOCATION	, the blowing up and capture of
Messines Ridge	LOCATION	, and the muddy toil of the Battles of Flanders all in
1917	DATE	he speaks of the broad view of war , as it is revealed to a witness like himself , being al - most as wearing to the spirit as the closer view which soldiers have .

		That is because he did not anesthetize himself to the terrors he lived among , and take re - fuge , like so many other correspondents , in a sport - slang of war which debases the supreme tale of hu - man valiance and agony to the level of a football contest .

		Not that he is insensible to the thrill of courage and of victory .

		On every page almost is a record of incredible intrepidity .

		`` But apart from human courage , the ugliness and foulness of war grow greater month by month , and if anybody speaks to me of war 's romance I will tell him of things I have seen today and yesterday and make his blood run cold .

		For the sum of human agony is high . ''

		His consciousness always of the awesome tragedy of a world in strife made the serene moments he ex - perienced especially poignant and brought forth pages of singular elevation and beauty .

		Witness his picture of the armies marching to the `` white edge of the dead land '' through `` green woods set upon hillsides where the sun plays upon the new leaves with a melody of delicate color-music , and spreads tapestries of light and shade across sweeps of grass - land all interwoven with the flowers of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		He saw Zola 's ploughman , and a Field of the Cloth of Gold carpeted with daisies and buttercups .

		If war can become anything but vulgar and filthy it is in the eyes of such a man as
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	, who has walked past the `` whimper of these blind boys '' through `` graveyards of Youth '' with a heart bleed - ing for all human souls who have to endure what war brings .

		For war , to
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	as to every decent man , is a `` foul tragedy to young life , '' and his pages , exalted as they are with his sense of beauty and his praise of heroism , are a steadfast memorial of its horrors .

		IHE PSYCHOLOGY OF CONVICTION : A Study of Beliefs and of Attitudes .

		By
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		It is the deeper psychological trends and tend - encies which attract Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's attention .

		To chart the whole sea of past human thought would be a task too great for one small volume , so he has selected a number of `` cases '' as illustrations of the factors which enter into beliefs and convictions .

		Everyone is familiar with the `` cases , '' but they must have the critical analysis of the psychologist in order to be valuable as `` exhibits . ''

		After two introductory chapters on the psychology of conviction , belief , and credulity , the author devotes nine chapters to the `` cases . ''

		One of these chapters deals with the Ante - cedents of the Study of Character and Tempera - ment .

		The other chapters are : The Will to Be - lieve in the Supernatural ; The Case of
Paladino	LOCATION	; Fact and Fable in Animal Psychology ; Malicious Animal Magnetism ; The Democratic Suspicion of Education ; The Psychology of Indulgence , Alcohol and Tobacco ; The Feminine Mind ; and Militarism and Pacifism .

		While the central theme is constantly in the mind of the author , nevertheless the reader feels a strong temptation to become interested in the principles in - volved in the different chapters .

		This tends to transpose the volume into a series of essays more or less unrelated .

		Most of the chapters have appeared in periodical form , and although they have been re - vised and rewritten in the interest of a greater unity of presentation , it is rather a difficult task for the reader to subordinate his interest in such topics as The Democratic Suspicion of Education , The Feminine Mind , or Militarism and Pacifism to his interest in the rather more subtle theme of the psychology of conviction and belief .

		Professor Jast - row 's book is concerned with the human background and the human tendencies that make for the beliefs which different men hold on the problems treated .

		Whether a man is a pacifist or a militarist depends upon his psychological make-up , the accident of his birth , his training , his associates , his immediate and vital interests , or even the character of his digestion ; but treating such an absorbing subject one is apt to

		PRINCIPLES OF OCEAN TRANSPORTATION .

		By
Emory R. Johnson	PERSON	and
Grover G. Huebner	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		That part of Professor
Johnson	PERSON	's `` Ocean and Inland Water Transportation , ''
1906	DATE	, which deals with ocean transportation has been greatly enlarged and entirely rewritten .

		The result is a very read - able general textbook , describing the shipping in - dustry as it is today types of ships and their meas - urement , freight and passenger service , rates , pools , port facilities , maritime canals , navigation laws , state aid , and so on but with almost no attention to labor .

		The authors ' aim is exposition merely .

		They rarely express an opinion ; although a bias against government ownership of shipping is allowed to appear and leads them to hope that the present
Shipping Board	ORGANIZATION	operation of American vessels will be discontinued after the war .

		Furthermore they recommend `` liberal '' subsidies to establish private steamship lines on the most important trade routes , and payments to naval reservists .

		They also are in favor of repealing that section of the Seamen 's Act which provides that at least
seventy-five per cent	MONEY	of the crew must be able to understand any order given by an officer , on the ground that the Japanese may still hire inexpensive Japanese crews while we may not .

		But discussion of the reasons in favor of the section is , too obviously , omitted .

		In a subsequent edition the chapter on marine insurance should con - tain some mention of the important `` protection and indemnity '' insurance .

		PROPHETS OF DISSENT .

		By
Otto Heller	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Summarily one may characterize Professor
Hel	PERSON	- ler 's examination of
Maeterlinck	LOCATION	,
Strindberg	LOCATION	,
Nietz	PERSON	- sche , and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	as a probing of mysticism , diabol - ism , egotism , and quietism .

		The publishers , with an eye doubtless to our immediate interests , will have it that all these philosophies have somehow been illumined by the war ; but if we except
Nietzsche	PERSON	, and possibly
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, their relevance is not over - whelmingly obvious .

		Even Tolstoy 's case is doubt - ful , in spite of his formidable hostility to killing .

		In taking over the Christian philosophy , and especially the Sermon on the Mount ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	embraced a sys - tem of ideas that , by an historical accident , had failed to achieve a workable political doctrine , and his em - phasis on the virtue of non-resistance can hardly be said to offer us much help in the present emergency .

		As for
Nietzsche	PERSON	, his violence at least brings him into the picture .

		Naturally Professor
Heller	PERSON	repudiates the vulgar notion that
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	should be held re - sponsible for the madness of the German Junkers .

		His philosophy was far too profound and subtle to be intelligible to the
Hindenburgs	PERSON	and the Ludendorffs that surround the All Highest , and if they really found any inspiration in his solitary speculations it must have been in a sufficiently diluted popular ver - sion .

		If any one doubts what
Nietzsche	PERSON	would have thought of the German war party of the moment , let him turn to those early volumes in which the philoso - pher unleashes all his exasperation in denouncing the puerile imbecilities that sprang out of the
Franco	LOCATION	- Prussian War .

		Nietzsche was less , perhaps , than any other man of his time the dupe of that insane nationalism which has shaped the thinking of young
Germany	LOCATION	.

		If one was intellectually mature , one was simply a `` good European . ''

		In the last resort the ideal he held up , while doubtless the product of a limitless romanticism and wilful in essence , was never one that can be achieved by a group of insane beasts , however blond .

		Professor
Heller	PERSON	has not assumed in the reader an exhaustive knowledge of the writers he discusses , but his book presents a sat - isfactory , if rather elementary , outline of their sev - eral contributions to modern thought .

		LEGISLATIVE METHODS IN THE PERIOD BE - FORE
1825	DATE	.

		By
Ralph Volney Harlow	PERSON	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		Until quite recently the standard treatises on his - tory and politics traced the beginning of parties in the
United States	LOCATION	to the division between the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eralists and Anti-Federalists ; but the substantial foundations of party organization and machinery were thought to have developed in the conventions , committees , and caucuses which became prevalent throughout the several states from
1820	DATE	to
1840	DATE	.

		It is only through separate studies and monographs however that the study of parties and party methods has now been carried back to the Colonial and Revo - lutionary periods .

		We can begin to understand the significance of the complaint of
John Adams	PERSON	that in Revolutionary times the
Boston Caucus Club	ORGANIZATION	met in the garret of
Tom Dawes	PERSON	and that there `` selectmen , assessors , collectors , firewards , and representatives are regularly chosen before they are chosen in town meeting . ''

		Sufficient information is available to make it clear that party organizations both formal and informal were in active operation throughout the later Colonial period and with a varying degree of effectiveness continuously participated in the man - agement of public affairs .

		To the group of studies on party practices in the beginning of the American government Mr.

Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, '' a book that is setting everyone talking that will be one of biggest sellers .

		Homer
Croy	PERSON	is an author with a sense of humor and has told the story of Cleve Seed with a naive humor that is fresh and new .

		274 THE DIAL
October 5	DATE	Among the interesting conclusions drawn from the evidence examined by the author are that the Colonial legislatures were evolving a standing com - mittee system at the time that this system was de - clining in the procedure of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and that the state legislatures muddled along doing most of the business in regular assembly sessions or in committee of the whole , using special committees only to deal with special problems or to put bills into final form for passage , until as the result of experi - ence they were obliged to adopt a standing committee system .

		For
Congress	ORGANIZATION	a period of uncertainty and indefiniteness is found in which the whole
House	ORGANIZATION	participated freely in all acts of legislation , followed by executive domination under the leadership of
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Jefferson	PERSON	, and then by the growth of the
House	ORGANIZATION	into an independent and responsible legis - lative organ directed by standing committees and guided by the growing power and prestige of the Speaker .

		The relation of the formal committee system and the party machine to such extra-governmental de - vices as the caucus and the junto is sufficiently de - scribed to give somewhat of a shock to those who look to the early decades of American government as the `` good old days '' when the public service was free from party strife and corrupt practices .

		It is to be regretted that more consideration is not given to these extra-governmental agencies .

		The evidence must of course be sought in the fugitive literature of the time , but some of the records which would give very interesting sidelights seem not to have been included in the author 's investigations .

		In fact too much reliance is placed upon formal records , such as legislative journals , to give an adequate account of the power and influence of parties as working forces in the formative period of the American gov - ernment .

		In the main the readily available sources as to legislative committees and procedure have been carefully examined and discriminatingly used , and the work is a useful addition to a somewhat neglected branch of political history .

		LAND 'S END .

		By
Wilbur Daniel Steele	PERSON	.

		Harper ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		In .

		his introduction to this collection of ten stories Mr.
Edward J. O'Brien	PERSON	claims for their author an artistic significance in the rank of Synge and Con - rad .

		Indeed he rather prefers Mr.
Steele	PERSON	for his `` sensitive fidelity to the more abiding romance of ordinary life ... The rich human embodiment of the stories assures them a place in our literature for their imaginative reality , their warm color , and their finality of artistic execution . ''

		But in prepar - ing our minds for a writer of such large seriousness and distinction he is riding to a fall of disappoint - ment .

		When you find that four out of the ten are mystery stories with carefully elaborated `` creeps , '' you feel a little cheated out of your abiding romance .

		And you are not mollified at the strained and un - common emotion of most of the others , at the opera - singer in Land 's End who is cured of her neurosis by following the bell that calls off the stormy beach , or at the ghostly family in the fog in Ked 's Hand .

		Mr.
Steele	PERSON	is a very competent writer , but you wonder if his admiring critic has not confused a theatrical sense with narrative art .

		The clever - ness with which the stories are composed does not remove the sense of motives ' having been strained for .

		And the settings are strangely familiar , the sea of unrelieved horror and greediness , the fisher - folk , the abandoned ship .

		The strangeness of the themes only brings the conventionality of the back - grounds into greater relief .

		A genuine artist would have reversed this process and charmed us with simpler motives that glowed in a setting of original quality .

		This manner of story-telling , in which Mr.
Steele	PERSON	is as good as any of his fellow craftsmen , is beginning to seem a little old-fashioned .

		The pro- fessional `` short-story '' has become an artificial and wearisome thing .

		Art is going to be more demand - ing .

		It is unfortunate that Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	should try to confuse our minds , and particularly about a writer who can be enjoyed so honestly not as an artist but as an admirable `` professional '' of the old school .

		JLIEART OF
EUROPE	LOCATION	.

		By
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Surely no one is better fitted than Mr.
Cram	PERSON	to deal with the topic which he has chosen for the key - stone of his Heart of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		As one of the leading church architects of
America	LOCATION	, certainly as one of those who have had a great deal of practical experi - ence in the erection of ecclesiastical buildings , Mr.
Cram	PERSON	ought , in outlining the architectural history of the cathedrals and town halls of that limited area which is the scene for most of the battled fields of the Western front , to know whereof he speaks .

		And had he confined his exposition to that knowledge , his volume would have had a truer , and therefore a deeper , significance .

		Even the fact that he felt too keenly , too intensely , about the architectural devasta - tion which has been one of the extreme by-products of an inexcusable ruthlessness , could have been for - given him .

		The sentimentality , the metaphorical analogies , the very title of the book all are symp - toms of an outraged sensibility which , though they make trivial and disappointing reading matter , may be traced to a personally experienced , apperceptive artistic emotion .

		The sorrowful anger felt by even the layman over the irreparable destruction of the cathedral at
Rheims	LOCATION	is inevitably augmented as the realization of all that
Rheims	LOCATION	epitomized and sym - bolized increases .

		One who has made the study of it and similar masterpieces the eager interest of a lifetime may be expected to view its annihilation with poignant dismay .

		But restraint , even in artistic

New York Suggestions of Modern Science Concerning Education	ORGANIZATION	By
HERBERT S. JENNINGS	PERSON	,
JOHN B. WATSON ADOLF MEYER	PERSON	and
WILLIAM I. THOMAS	PERSON	'' This course of lectures is as stimulating a contribution to educational the - ory as it is a gratifying picture of science in action . ''

		The New Republic . ''

		The book is replete with direct and indirect suggestions concerning that problem so much with us nowadays namely , how to direct education into channels that shall more nearly conserve and develop the best capacities of children .

		No special system of pedagogy or of educational change is proposed , but many underlying facts , some of them only recently acquired through research , are offered for the upbuilding of a better pedagogic su - perstructure .

		In these times of assault on humanism and on other parts of the method and content of modern education it well behooves us to look deeper into some of the fundamental aspects of body and mind .

		This , then , is the book that must be widely read and appreciated . ''

October 5	DATE	wrath , would bring its reward of increasing sym - pathy in the reader : one prefers voicing one 's own regrets .

		And not only has Mr.
Cram	PERSON	too volubly and inartistically laid bare his own , as well as
Europe	LOCATION	's , heart ; he has also attempted a correlated and explanatory historical background which fails to serve either purpose .

		Even a subsidiary survey of what was once called the `` medieval to modern '' epochs may no longer concern itself with genealogi - cal citations .

		As an effort to furnish an unfamiliar audience with historical facts for its artistic heritage , his aim is intelligent .

		As a helpful method of under - standing certain origins of the arts and crafts , as a scholarly explanation of the evolution of Church and Town from the varicolored lives of too remote societies , it achieves no success .

		But the many ex - cellent photographic reproductions of what will al - ways remain the high-water marks of a medieval in - heritance , as well as the unquestionably sincere pro- test against the acts of an enemy who is no more a respecter of creations than of persons , do something to redeem the volume .

		11 OURS OF
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		By
Paul Scott Mowrer	PERSON	.

		Dutten ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		As war-correspondent Mr.
Mowrer	PERSON	was close to death 's most sordid horrors and life 's tragic monot - ony .

		Yet he celebrates
France	LOCATION	in poems equally ap - plicable to any charming countryside , where sleepy fish and flowery sunsets intrigue the quiet heart .

		But Mr.
Mowrer	PERSON	is less the poet than the journalist of nature .

		He wins her with a phrase , bestows an adjective like a light kiss , hums a little song , and goes his untroubled way .

		In poems otherwise un - distinguished he has evocative lines like these : the sun Groping golden through the branches ... The great rocks heave their shoulders up from the out - ward-setting tide Like a shoal of black sea-monsters feeding shoreward side by side .

		He speaks of the Bois des Buttes , where the lilies - of-the-valley in unresisting multitudes have won The bloody glades , the long disputed dells ; and of the fishermen who `` complain contentedly . ''

		Everywhere there are evidences of his skill in word selection , his sense of dramatic contrast , which yet does not quite give the rich tumult , the fine fire of poetry .

		Perhaps unwittingly , he is betrayed by echoes .

		Rupert
Brooke	PERSON	and
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare , most of all , sound in these lyric whimsies , these deli - cate ghost-whispers .

		But something Mr.
Mowrer	PERSON	's own is still apparent in his work .

		It is more than anything else a feeling for balance , a thoughtful weighing of some aspect of nature against a nearer , human vision , or of some human tragedy against the large indifference of time .

		When he escapes senti - mentality , as he does not always succeed in doing , the poet 's apperceptions are nice .

		Looking neither toward our hazy beginnings nor toward our dark end , the poet sees with a less clouded vision than others the immediate if doubtful way .

		Thus he beholds the youth who go out to die , well knowing that to the things they leave behind there is no re - turn youth that asks only a justification of its sac - rifice : `` Not death we fear , but death 's futility . ''

		One feels , reading some of the later lyrics , that
Paul Mowrer	PERSON	is aware of that other fear , of life 's futility , but that he is sure that life differs from death by just its intrinsic significance .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY The Modern Point of View and the New Order i .

		THE INSTABILITY OF KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF A \ S is TRUE of any other point of view that may be characteristic of any other period of history , so also the modern point of view is a matter of habit .

		It is a trait which is common to modern civilized peoples only in so far as these peoples have come through substantially the same historical experience and have thereby acquired substantially the same habits of thought and have fallen into somewhat the same prevalent frame of mind .

		This modern point of view therefore is limited both in time and space .

		It is characteristic of the modern historical era and of such peoples as lie within the range of that pe - culiar civilization which marks off the modern world from what has gone before and from what still prevails outside of its range .

		In other words , it is a trait of modern
Christendom	LOCATION	, of
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	civilization as it has run within the past few cen - turies .

		This general statement is not vitiated by the fact that there has been some slight diffusion of these modern and
Western	LOCATION	ideas outside of this range in recent times .

		By historical accident , it happens that the modern point of view has reached its maturest formulation and prevails with the least faltering among the French and English-speaking peoples ; so that these peoples may be said to constitute the center of dif - fusion for that system of ideas which is called the modern point of view .

		Outward from this broad center the same range of ideas prevail throughout
Christendom	LOCATION	, but they prevail with less singleness of conviction among the peoples who are culturally more remote from this center increasingly so with each farther remove .

		These others have carried over a larger remainder of the habits of thought of an earlier age , and have carried them over in a better state of preservation .

		It may also be that these others , or some of them , have acquired habits of thought of a new order which do not altogether fit into that system of ideas that is commonly spoken of as the modern point of view .

		That such is the case need imply neither praise nor blame .

		It is only that , by common usage , these remainders of ancient habits of thought and these newer preconceptions which do not fit into the framework of West-Euro - pean conventional thinking are not ordinarily rated as intrinsic to the modern point of view .

		They need not therefore be less to the purpose as a guide and criterion of human living ; it is only that they are alien to those purposes which are considered to be of prime consequence in civilized life as it is guided and tested by the constituent principles of the mod - ern point of view .

		What is spoken of as a point of view is always a composite affair some sort of rounded and bal - anced system of principles and standards , which are taken for granted , at least provisionally , and which serve as a base of reference and legitimation in all questions of deliberate opinion .

		So , when any given usage or any line of conduct or belief is seen and approved from the modern point of view , it comes to the same as saying that these things are seen and accepted in the light of those principles which mod - ern men habitually consider to be final and suffi - cient .

		They are principles of right , equity , pro- priety , duty perhaps of knowledge , belief , and taste .

		It is evident that these principles and standards of what is right , good , true , and beautiful will vary from one age to another and from one people to another in response to the varying conditions of life inasmuch as these principles are of the nature of habit although the variation will of course range only within the limits of that human nature that finds expression in these same principles of right , good , truth , and beauty .

		So also it will be found that something in the way of a common measure of verity and sufficiency runs through any such body of principles that are accepted as final and self-evi - dent at any given time and place in so far as this habitual body of principles has reached such a degree of poise and consistency that they can fairly be said to constitute a stable point of view .

		It is only be - cause there is such a degree of consistency and such a common measure of validity among the com - 290
October 19	DATE	monly accepted principles of conduct and belief today , that it is possible to speak intelligently of the modern point of view , and to contrast it with any other point of view which may have prevailed in the Middle Ages or in pagan antiquity .

		The Romans were given to saying `` tempora mutantur , '' and the Spanish have learned to speak indulgently in the name of `` costumbres del pais . ''

		The common law of the English-speaking peoples does not coincide at all points with what was in - def easibly right and good in the eyes of the Romans ; and still less do its principles countenance all the vagaries of the Mosaic code .

		Yet , each and several , in their due time and institutional setting , these have all been tried and found valid and have approved themselves as securely and eternally right and good in principle .

		Evidently these principles , which so are made to serve as standards of validity in law and custom , knowledge and belief , are of the nature of canons , established rules , and have the authority of prece - dent .

		They have been defined by the attrition of use and wont and disputation , and they are accepted in a somewhat deliberate manner by common con - sent and are upheld by a deliberate public opinion as to what is right and seemly .

		In the popular apprehension , and indeed in the apprehension of the trained jurists and scholars for the time being , these constituent principles of the accepted point of view are `` fundamentally and eternally right and good . ''

		But this perpetuity with which they so are habitually invested in the popular apprehension , in their time , is evidently only such a qualified perpetuity as be - longs to any settled outgrowth of use and wont .

		They are of an institutional character , and they are endowed with only that degree of perpetuity that belongs to any institution .

		So soon as a marked change of circumstances comes on a change of a sufficiently profound , enduring , and comprehensive character , such as persistently to cross or to go be - yond those lines of use and wont out of which these settled principles have emerged then these prin - ciples and their standards of validity and finality must presently undergo a revision , such as to bring on a new balance of principles , embodying the habits of thought enforced by a new situation , and express - ing itself in a revised scheme of authoritative use and wont , law and custom .

		In the transition from the medieval to the modern point of view , for ex - ample , there is to be seen such a pervasive change in men 's habitual outlook , answering to the compul - sion of a new range of circumstances which then came to condition the daily life of the peoples of
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		In this mutation of the habitual outlook between medieval and modern times , the contrast is perhaps most neatly shown in the altered standards of knowl - edge and belief , rather than in the immediate domain of law and morals .

		Not that the mutation of habits which then overtook the Western world need have been less wide or less effectual in matters of conduct ; but the change which has taken effect in science and philosophy , between the fourteenth century and the nineteenth , for instance , appears to have been of a more articulate character , more readily defined in succinct and convincing terms .

		It has also quite generally attracted the attention of those men who have interested themselves in the course of historical events , and it has therefore become something of a commonplace in any standard historical survey of modern civilization .

		It will also be found true that the canons of knowledge and belief , the principles governing what is fact and what is credible , are more intimately and intrinsically involved in the habitual behavior of the human spirit than the habitual elements of human behavior in other bearings .

		Such is neces - sarily the case , because the principles which guide and limit knowledge and belief are the ways and means by which men take stock of what is to be done and by which they take thought of how it is to be done .

		It is by the use of their habitual canons of knowledge and belief that men construct those canons of conduct which serve as guide and stand - ards in practical life .

		Men do not pass appraisal on matters which lie beyond the reach of their knowl - edge and belief , nor do they formulate rules to govern the game of life beyond that limit .

		So , congenitally blind persons do not build color schemes , nor will a man without `` an ear for music '' become a master of musical composition .

		So also , `` the medieval mind '' took no thought and made no provision for those later-arisen exigencies of life and those later-known facts of material science which lay yet beyond the bounds of its medieval knowledge and belief ; but this `` medieval mind '' at the same time spent much thought and took many excellent precautions about things which have now come to be accounted altogether fanciful things which the maturer insight , or perhaps the less fertile conceit , of a more experienced age has disowned as being palpably not in accord with fact .

		That is to say , things which once were convinc - ingly substantial and demonstrable , according to the best knowledge and belief of the medieval mind , can now no longer be discerned as facts , according to those canons of knowledge and belief that are now doing duty among modern men as conclusive stand - ards of reality .

		Not that all persons who are born within modern times are thereby rendered unable to
1918	DATE	THE DIAL know and to believe in such medieval facts , for ex - ample , as horoscopes , or witchcraft , or gentle birth , or the efficacy of prayer , or the divine right of kings ; but , taken by and large , and in so far as it falls under the control of the modern point of view , the delib - erate consensus of knowledge and belief now runs to the effect that these and other imponderables like them no longer belong among ascertained or ascer - tainable facts , but that they are on the other hand wholly illusory conceits , traceable to a mistaken point of view prevalent in that earlier and cruder age .

		The principles governing knowledge and belief are primary and pervasive , beyond any others , in that they underlie all human deliberation and com - prise the necessary elements of all human logic .

		But it is also to be noted that these canons of knowledge and belief are more immediately exposed to revision and correction by experience than the principles of law and morals .

		So soon as the conditions of life shift and change in any appreciable degree , experi - ence will enforce a revision of the habitual standards of actuality and credibility , by force of the habitual and increasingly obvious failure of what has before habitually been regarded as ascertained fact .

		Things which , under the ancient canons of knowledge , have habitually been regarded as known fact as , for instance , witchcraft or the action of bodies at a distance will under altered circumstances prove themselves by experience to have only a supposed reality .

		Any knowledge that runs in such outworn terms will turn out to be futile , misleading , meaning - less ; and the habit of imputing qualities and be - havior of this kind to everyday facts will then fall into disuse , progressively as experience continues to bring home the futility of all that kind of imputa - tion .

		And presently the habit of perceiving that class of qualities and behavior in the known facts is therefore gradually lost .

		So also , in due time , the observances and the pre - cautions and provisions embodied in law and custom for the preservation or the control of these lost im - ponderables will fall into disuse and disappear out of the scheme of institutions , by way of becoming dead-letter or by abrogation .

		Particularly will such a loss of belief and insight , and the consequent loss of those imponderables whose ground has thereby gone out from under them , take effect with the pass - ing of generations .

		An imponderable is an article of make-believe which has become axiomatic by force of settled habituation .

		It can accordingly cease to be an imponderable by a course of un - settling habituation .

		Those elders in whom the ancient habits of faith and insight were ingrained , and in whose knowledge and belief consequently the imponderables in question had a vital reality , will presently fall away ; and the new generation , whose experience has run on other lines , is in a fair way to lose these articles of faith and insight by disuse .

		It is a case of obsolescence by habitual disuse .

		And the habitual disuse which so allows the ancient canons of knowledge and belief to fall away , and thereby cuts the ground from under the traditional system of law and custom , is reenforced by the ad - vancing discipline of a new order of experience , which exacts an habitual apprehension of workday facts in terms of a different kind and thereby brings on a revaluation and revision of the traditional rules governing human relations .

		The new terms of workday knowledge and belief , which do not con - form to the ancient canons , go to enforce and stabil - ize new canons and standards , of a character alien to the traditional point of view .

		It is , in other words , a case of obsolescence by displacement as well as by habitual disuse .

		This unsettling discipline that is brought to bear by workday experience is chiefly and most immedi - ately the discipline exercised by the material condi - tions , the exigencies that beset men in their everyday dealings with the material means of life , inasmuch as these material facts are insistent and uncom - promising .

		And the scope and method of knowledge and belief which is forced on men in their everyday material concerns will unavoidably , by habitual use , extend to other matters as well , so as to affect the scope and method of knowledge and belief in all that concerns those imponderable facts which lie outside the immediate range of material experience .

		It results that , in the further course of changing habituation , those imponderable relations , conven - tions , claims , and perquisites that make up the time - worn system of law and custom will unavoidably also be brought under review , and will be revised and reorganized in the light of the same new prin - ciples of validity that are found to be sufficient in dealing with material facts .

		Given time and a sufficiently exacting run of experience , and it will fol - low necessarily that much the same standards of truth and finality will come to govern men 's knowl - edge and valuation of facts throughout , whether the facts in question lie in the domain of material things or in the domain of those imponderable conventions and preconceptions that decide what is right and proper in human intercourse .

		It follows necessarily because the same persons , bent by the same dis - cipline and habituation , take stock of both and are required to get along with both during the same lifetime .

		The scope and method of knowledge and valuation will control the thinking of the same in - dividuals throughout , at least to the extent that any given article of faith and usage which is palpably at 292 THE DIAL
October	DATE	cross purposes with this main intellectual bent will soon begin to seem immaterial and irrelevant , and will tend to become obsolete by neglect .

		Such has always been the fate which overtakes any notable articles of faith and usage that belong to a bygone point of view .

		Any established system of law and order will remain securely stable only on condition that it be kept in line or brought into line to conform with those canons of validity that have the vogue for the time being ; and the vogue is a matter of habits of thought ingrained by every - day experience .

		And the moral is that any estab - lished system of law and custom is due to undergo a revision of its constituent principles so soon as a new order of economic life has had time materially to affect the community 's habits of thought .

		But all the while the changeless native proclivities of the race will assert themselves in some measure in any eventual revision of the received institutional sys - tem ; and always they will stand ready eventually to break the ordered scheme of things into a para - lytic mass of confusion if it can not be bent into some passable degree of congruity with the par - amount native needs of life .

		What is likely to arrest the attention of any stu - dent of the modern era from the outset is the pe - culiar character of its industry and of its intellectual outlook , particularly the scope and method of mod - ern science and philosophy .

		The intellectual life of modern
Europe	LOCATION	and its cultural dependencies differs notably from what has gone before .

		There is all about it an air of matter-of-fact , both in its technology and in its science , which culminates in a `` mechanistic conception '' of all those things with which scientific inquiry is concerned , and in the light of which many of the dread realities of the Middle Ages look like superfluous make-believe .

		But it has been only during the later decades of the modern era that this mechanistic conception of things has begun seriously to affect the current sys - tem of knowledge and belief , and it has not hitherto seriously taken effect except in technology and in the material sciences .

		So that it has not hitherto seriously invaded the established scheme of insti - tutional arrangements the system of law and cus - tom which governs the relations of men to one another and defines their mutual rights , obligations , advantages , and disabilities .

		But it should reason - ably be expected that this established system of rights , duties , proprieties , and disabilities will also in due time come in for something in the way of a revision , to bring it all more nearly into congruity with that matter-of-fact conception of things that lies at the root of modern civilization .

		The con - stituent principles of the established system of law and custom are of the nature of imponderables , of course ; but they are imponderables which have been conceived and formulated in terms of a different order from those that are convincing to the modern scientists and engineers .

		Whereas the line of ad - vance of the scientists and engineers , dominated by their mechanistic conception of things , appears to be the main line of march for modern civilization .

		It should seem reasonable to expect , therefore , that the scheme of law and custom will also fall into line with this mechanistic conception that appears to mark the apex of growth in modern intellectual life .

		But hitherto the `` due time '' needed for the adjust - ment has apparently not been had , or perhaps the experience which drives men in the direction of a mechanistic conception of all things has not hitherto been driving them hard enough or unremittingly enough to carry such a revision of ideas out in the system of law and custom .

		The modern point of view in matters of law and custom appears to be somewhat in arrears , as measured by the later ad - vance in science and technology .

		But just now the attention of thoughtful men centers on questions of practical concern questions of law and usage brought to a focus by the fla - grant miscarriage of that organization of Christen - dom that has brought the war upon the civilized nations .

		The paramount question just now is what to do to save the civilized nations from irretriev - able disaster , and what further may be accomplished by taking thought so that no similar epoch of calami - ties shall be put in train for the next generation .

		It is realized that there must be something in the way of a `` reconstruction '' of the scheme of th : ngs ; and it is also realized , though more dimly , that the reconstruction must be carried c * it .

		> vith a view to the security of life under such conditions as men will put up with , rather than
Vrith	PERSON	a view to the impeccable preservation of the received scheme of law and custom .

		All of which is only saying that the constituent principles of the modern point of view are to be taken under advisement reviewed and , conceivably , revised and brought into line in so far as these principles are constituent elements of that received scheme of law and custom that is spoken of as the status quo .

		It is the status quo in respect of law and custom , not in respect of science and technology or of knowledge and belief , that is to be brought under review .

		Law and custom , it is believed , may be revised to meet the requirements of civilized men 's knowledge and belief ; but no man hopes to revise the modern system of knowledge and belief to bring it all into conformity with the time - worn scheme of law and custom of the status quo .

		1918 2 93 Therefore the bearing of this stabilized modern point of view on these questions of practical con - cern is of present interest its practical value as ground for a reasonably hopeful reconstruction of the war-shattered scheme of use and wont , its pos - sible serviceability as a basis of enduring settlement , as well as the share which its constituent principles have had in the creation of that status quo out of which this epoch of calamities has been precipitated .

		The status quo ante , in which the roots of this growth of misfortunes and impossibilities are to be found , lies within the modern era , of course , and it is nowise to be decried as an alien , or even as an unforeseen , outgrowth of this modern era .

		By and large , the stabilized modern point of view has gov - erned men 's dealings within this era , and its con - stituent principles of right and honest living must therefore , presumptively , be held answerable for the disastrous event of it all at least to the extent that they have permissively countenanced the gtowth of those sinister conditions which have now ripened into a state of world-wide shame and confusion .

		How and how far is this modern point of view , this established body of legal and moral principles , to be accounted an accessory to this crime ?

		And if it be argued that this complication of atrocities has come on , not because of these principles of conduct which are so dear to civilized men and so blameless in their sight , but only in spite of them , then what is the particular weakness or shortcoming inherent in this body of principles which has allowed such a growth of malignant conditions to go on and gather head ?

		If the modern point of view these settled principles of conduct by which modern men col - lectively are actuated in what they will do and in what they will permit if these canons and stand - ards of clean and honest living have proved to be a fatal snare , then it becomes an urgent question : Is it safe , or sane , to go into the future by the light of these same established canons of right , equity , and propriety that have been tried and found wanting ?

		Perhaps the question should rather take the less didactic form : Will the present experience of calam - ities induce men to revise these established principles of conduct , and the specifications of the code based on them , so effectually as to guard against any chance of return to the same desperate situation in the calculable future ?

		Can the discipline of recent experience and the insight bred by the new order of knowledge and belief , reenforced by the shock of the present miscarriage , be counted on to bring such a revision of these principles of law and custom as will preclude a return to that status quo ante from which this miscarriage of civilization has resulted ?

		The latter question is more to the point .

		History teaches that men , taken collectively , learn by habitu - ation rather than by precept and reflection par - ticularly as touches those underlying principles of truth and validity on which the effectual scheme of law and custom finally rests .

		In the last analysis it resolves itself into a ques - tion as to how and how far the habituation of the recent past , mobilized by the shock of the present conjuncture , will have affected the frame of mind of the common man in these civilized countries ; for in the last analysis , and with due allowance for a margin of tolerance , it is the frame of mind of the common man that makes the foundation of society in the modern world .

		And the fortunes of the civilized world , for good or ill , have come to turn on the deeds of commission and omission of these advanced peoples among whom the frame of mind of the common man is the finally conditioning circum - stance in what may safely be done or left undone .

		The advice and consent of the common run has latterly come to be indispensable to the conduct of affairs among civilized men , somewhat in the same degree in which the community is to be accounted a civilized people .

		It is indispensable at least in a permissive way , at least to the extent that no line of policy can long be pursued successfully without the permissive tolerance of the common run ; and the margin of tolerance in the case appears to be narrower , the more alert and the more matter-of - fact the frame of mind of the common man .

		294 THE DIAL
October 19	DATE	Reconstructing American Business J .

		HERE is a special reason why the American business man is particularly interested in planning for the period after the war .

		Today he is virtually a stranger in his own domain .

		Whichever way he turns , whatever phase of business he looks at , all is changed under the strangely pallid mercury lamp of war .

		His old familiar market places and grooves of activity , in fact the very atmosphere in which he was accustomed to work , seem lurid , hectic , altered .

		Slowly his consciousness is becoming aware that business not only will not be , but can not be , what business was before the war .

		Is there any wonder then that everywhere busi - ness men are groping , thinking , and planning con - cerning the time after the war ?

		For a year or more business buried itself in the task of prepara - tion for war .

		The great war-time business ma - chine which resulted swallowed up , to a large ex - tent , the peace-time business machine .

		But having finally put the great war machine into successful and resultful operation , the live business man , as is his wont , is thinking of the next big job , which he knows is after-war adjustment rehabilitation of the peace-time business machine , a monster job .

		How does he know this ?

		Because he is on the front line here at home in the industrial part of warfare , which no one now doubts is the vital sup - porting platform for any modern military effort .

		He sees that factories , offices , workers , executives , money , equipment , material , and transportation have quite as definitely , if not as literally , as the soldier or sailor himself , discarded their regular work and gone across the sea to fight .

		The sense of radi - cal change , of reversal of aim and effort , and of the purely temporary nature of the strange new war task , is just as great with the manufacturer and business man as with the soldier , performing actions he had never even dreamed of performing , in a land he had never expected to see and expects to quit as soon as he `` licks the Kaiser . ''

		Being a planner and an organizer , and by nature of his occupation a student of risk and a preparer for the practical future , the business man , even in the midst of the war , is becoming restless at the outlook he faces .

		Responsibility weighs upon him for the maintenance of a strong and steady indus - trial pace easy enough now , but what of the day to come ?

		Labor , even though now too fully pre - occupied with its unprecedented wages to worry much over the future , naturally looks to him to pro- vide a continuation of the present condition of plenty of work at good wages .

		The prospect of the return of the soldiers makes the business man as uneasy as a hostess who knows a troop of hungry guests are coming soon and is not sure whether she will have enough for them to eat .

		The guests are taking it for granted that there will be plenty , but the hostess knows that it can not happen without much planning and work in advance .

		If the feast is not to prove a disappointment or worse , a famine there can be no delay , and certainly no shirking .

		The directors of labor , like the hostess , will never be forgiven if they fail .

		Their excuses will sound very silly .

		When such men get together at a club and talk it over , as they so often do now , what is their process of thought and action ?

		They face five hard and terrifically challenging facts : -LRB- 1 -RRB- That on the day
Germany	LOCATION	invaded
Belgium	LOCATION	and started the great war , there was in
America	LOCATION	a surplusage of about 300,000 railway cars stand - ing idle ; that American industry was running at only about 60 per cent capacity ; and that there were many thousands of men idle , with many municipal and national efforts to alleviate un - employment .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- That now , through `` war orders , '' we have speeded up industry to an extent which has in - creased our annual volume of manufacture from about
$ 25,000,000,000	MONEY	to about
$ 46,000,000,000	MONEY	; utilizing every human being male , female , halt , or lame who could be impressed into service ; raising the enormously grave question of whether we can hope to keep this pace on the cessation of war orders , and of what will happen if we ca n't keep this pace .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- That approximately 18,000,000 people have changed their peace-time occupations in whole or in part , and will need to go through a readjust - ment after the war .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- That labor has become accustomed to some - what inflated war-time standards of wages and living , and will -LRB- from the point of view of the business man -RRB- present a very serious psychological problem in itself when necessity calls for re - establishment of levels more normal .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- That as soon as the war aim is achieved there will be on the one hand a natural relaxation of what has been and is an almost perfect national unity of aim and effort , and on the other hand ; either too much or too little of government con - trol over business , with the result that muc
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 2 95 confusion , conflict of selfish individualistic , politi - cal , class , and sectional interests , discouragement of vital organizing ability , and chaos may follow .

		To be quite blunt , the set of five factors outlined above is proving sufficient to create a formidable amount of pessimism , an actual fear of an after - war panic .

		Those business men who are not in - veterate optimists , who are not `` bulls on their coun - try 's future , '' say that we are certain to have a very severe depression , do what we will , because private orders can not at once supersede government v \ ar orders in the volume necessary to keep the wheels whirring at anything like their present pace .

		More optimistic minds pin their faith to the in - teraction of compensating economic forces through - out the world ; in business language , the substitution of rebuilding and restocking orders for war orders .

		It has been estimated that the destruction on land in
Europe	LOCATION	amounts to at least
$ 250,000,000,000	MONEY	; while Dr.
Dernberg	PERSON	in
Germany	LOCATION	estimated the de - struction of ships and goods at sea in one year alone -LRB-
1917	DATE	-RRB- as
$ 6,225,000,000	MONEY	.

		Europe therefore needs from 300 to
500 billion dollars	MONEY	' worth of material ; while , in addition , general commercial stocks are low all over the world .

		These factors will assur - edly require top-speed production for a period of years to bring them back to normal .

		Such is the theory and the faith , but there is a veritable storm cloud of criss-crossing factors economic , transpor - tational , political , strategic , and military which casts the haze of uncertainty and danger over the first year or two after the war .

		And those first years are admittedly the critical ones .

		No one doubts that after several years , when demobilization and readjustment will be general and complete , there will be unprecedented prosperity for
America	LOCATION	.

		It is the vital interim between the first au - thentic hint of peace and the time when the world is in full operation again on a peace basis that gives pause to thinking business men .

		The more analytical , constructive minds wish to leave nothing to faith or feeling , but are keen for constructive action to be begun at once aggres - sively , intelligently , with a - sure practical touch and no fumbling , political log-rolling , delay , or inexpert dallying .

		They have that business imagination which has made
America	LOCATION	what it is , and they have the confidence and the energy to forge their imagina - tion into reality .

		They would apply the tools of organization and analysis to the situation and force the problem to an issue now , with definite , many - departmented plans of action to take care of each individual one of the great strains we shall be under .

		They want the splendid coherence and breadth of operation of the great war business machine to be utilized as a great peace business machine and what is quite as important , operated , as now , by business men with experience and skill enough to get results from such heavy-duty mechanism .

		It is a real fear which business men have that when the war ends we shall , on a false conception of completion of patriotic duty , relinquish our high - pitched effort and our integration of national strength , and place in control again that type of executive which our first war effort proved we can - not trust to do big-scale work .

		Added to this is the fear that these very men who have responded to the war call to lead successfully our industrial mobiliza - tion at considerable personal sacrifice will not con - tinue their services to the country during recon - struction .

		Now that I have depicted as well as I can the state of mind of business regarding the after-war situation , it may be interesting to inquire what prac - tical program business is working for and what practical preparations for after the war it is making .

		What government action would business like to see ?

		Three or four national or partly national organizations of business men , as well as individual business organizations , and of course many far - sighted individual business men , have gone on record either in discussions , resolutions , or interviews .

		There is a vigorous call for a special cabinet Min - istry of Reconstruction , or a special
After-the-War Planning Commission	ORGANIZATION	, composed of broad-gage busi - ness men assisted by experts .

		The fact that Eng - land has had a
Ministry of Reconstruction	ORGANIZATION	headed by
Lord Balfour	PERSON	, with a total of eighty-five specialized committees , at work since
1916	DATE	to say nothing of reconstruction commissions in all other Allied coun - tries has served to lend emphasis to this demand by business men .

		As for the Weeks resolution calling for a com - mission of Congressmen six Democrats and six Republicans it does not have the approval of busi - ness men generally , for the very obvious reason that it proposes authority to rest with a group of partisan legislators .

		Why should the legislative branch of government undertake a work purely executive in character ?

		How would the
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	have fared headed by six Republican and six Demo - cratic Congressmen ?

		Yet , in the view of business men , it is quite as vital that a Reconstruction Min - istry or
Commission	ORGANIZATION	be operated after the fashion of the
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	with one man control , and that man a business man .

		Above all it is hoped that the after-war planning will not be blighted by the political jealousies of parties jockeying for ad - vantage and prestige .

		The fact that the Adminis - tration 's
Overman	PERSON	bill , calling for a commission , 296
October 19	DATE	not Congressional , is closer to the ideas of business men than the Weeks bill does not mean that the business man 's interest is a partisan one .

		As a mat - ter of fact there is doubt whether either bill will meet the requirements as business men see them .

		The concrete phases of reconstruction in which business men are interested , and which they believe should be separately and individually covered by committees or bureaus , are the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- demobilization -LRB- 2 -RRB- factory conversion -LRB- 3 -RRB- export development and international com - mercial policy -LRB- 4 -RRB- merchant marine -LRB- 5 -RRB- fuel , food , and vital materials -LRB- 6 -RRB- transportation -LRB- 7 -RRB- price stabilization -LRB- 8 -RRB- commercial and industrial research and sta - tistics -LRB- 9 -RRB- labor and employment management -LRB- 10 -RRB- post-war financing -LRB- 11 -RRB- government control -LRB- 12 -RRB- allotment and raw-material conservation -LRB- 13 -RRB- housing -LRB- 14 -RRB- distribution -LRB- 15 -RRB- sales-management -LRB- 16 -RRB- administrative efficiency -LRB- 17 -RRB- cost analysis -LRB- 18 -RRB- consumption efficiency -LRB- 19 -RRB- public administrative efficiency -LRB- 20 -RRB- retail and wholesale -LRB- 21 -RRB- publicity -LRB- 22 -RRB- industrial education -LRB- 23 -RRB- repatriation -LRB- 24 -RRB- occupational fitness and psychology -LRB- 25 -RRB- woman in industry -LRB- 26 -RRB- credit conservation and control -LRB- 27 -RRB- tariff -LRB- 28 -RRB- agriculture -LRB- 29 -RRB- priority and coordination -LRB- 30 -RRB- special and miscellaneous If such a group of thirty committees looks for - midable to anyone , let the eighty-five committees and boards of
Great Britain	LOCATION	be remembered .

		There is immediate and practical work for every one of the above named committees , whose joint efforts could be unified by a priority and coordination com - mittee , as indicated .

		Business is very earnestly interested in everything pertaining to the development of our export trade , because in its serious desire to find markets that will take care of the surplus
$ 20,000,000,000	MONEY	fac - tory production over peace times , it sees that we must sell huge quantities abroad .

		Before the war we held about
5 per cent	MONEY	of the world 's trade ; and if we had , in
1914	DATE	, desired to operate our factories at their full peace-time production , it would have been necessary to get
35 per cent	MONEY	of the world 's ex - port trade .

		Now , with our huge added factory capacity , we should have to add almost all the world 's export trade to our own consumption to equal our present production capacity .

		In other words , we have arrived at that astounding moment in our economic history when we have capacity for satisfying not only most of our own needs but in addition the export needs of almost the entire world .

		Of course we shall not get anything like all the trade of the world we are mere children in the handling of foreign trade .

		But as a first step busi - ness has welcomed the Webb bill permitting com - bination for export a necessary thing since Eng - land and
Germany	LOCATION	are planning to use this tool very fully .

		We should also be sending a number of eco - nomic commissions abroad to individual countries to develop facts about the situation and make personal our expected business relationship .

		Next , business is now getting behind the
Sims	PERSON	bill calling for a national trademark , so that the very great good will which our stand in the war has been devel - oping for the
United States	LOCATION	in all parts of the globe may not only be made of trade advantage to us , but also that there may be a safeguard against mis - representation either by unscrupulous American firms or foreign imitators .

		On our new merchant ma - rine , under the stars and stripes , it is proposed that only such American goods shall be carried as have the same integrity back of them that our war actions have had back of them .

		Since we are a young country in export , it is vital that American goods be so marked , particularly since it is a well-known trick of
Germany	LOCATION	to palm off goods as American .

		Individual business men are naturally at work on reconstruction problems according to their own judgment of what is to come .

		Take the problem of the munitions manufacturer who before the war did a
$ 12,000,000	MONEY	annual volume of business and who now , because of war inflation , does a
$ 60,000	MONEY	, - 000 volume .

		He has built about fifty acres of addi - tional floor space , has added many thousands of new workers .

		The first concrete move for peace will bring cancellation of his orders , and then he will need to make something else .

		He is busy working out what that something else shall be .

		So , of course , are other manufacturers ; and the result is that in - tense effort to increase the consumption of these articles will follow after the war .

		Other business men who handle stocks of goods are everywhere agreeing that they must be caught by peace with only a minimum of goods on hand , as prices will
1918	DATE	297 quite certainly fall .

		Still other business men are frankly `` putting their houses in order '' for the ex - pected peace-time pressure , carefully studying effi - cient methods , installing every plan and system for economy and efficiency , preparing their post-war sales and advertising campaigns .

		Over a year ago the chief executive of a large mid-western concern told me that he permitted no war-time matter to come to his desk only after-war matters .

		The same is true of many other big executives .

		Many entire lines of industry have had to put them - selves on a highly economical basis , because of war pressure on raw materials .

		Through the agency of the
United States Chamber of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	100 industries have unified themselves , so that a national committee from each has power to bind the industry for any action deemed necessary by the War In - dustries
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Astonishing unity for the elimina - tion of waste has been achieved through such con - certed effort .

		Thirty million yards of woolens have been saved by the agreement of textile interests upon styles .

		The height and color even the price of shoes , the content of food products , and the sizes of tires have been agreed upon as war-time economy measures .

		These are now not only expected to be - come permanent after-war economies , but trade abuses and wastes not yet eliminated are planned to be eliminated when the coming of peace provides time and further incentive .

		The reduction of large numbers of models is certain to be made a reconstruc - tion as well as a war policy by hard-headed business men .

		A manufacturer of saws once made 3,500 dif - ferent models ; today he makes 500 .

		A plow-maker once made 2,000 models ; now he makes 25 .

		Paint manufacturers once made about 100 different colors ; now they have agreed upon 32 .

		In short , the war has acted , in the industrial sense , as a forced attendance at a school of necessity which has developed remarkable peace-time econo - mies and efficiencies which are still in the bud and which during reconstruction days will blossom forth into their real value and power .

		Business knows this , and is keen to apply the new-found lore .

		Those with business vision believe that the changes in the temper of business men themselves and their newly developed power for coordinated action spell a new upward trend in business after the war which will very likely achieve fresh marvels of na - tional progress .

GEORGE FREDERICK	PERSON	.

		An Imaginary Conversation
GOSSE	PERSON	AND MOORE II .

		GOSSE .


Don Quixote	PERSON	is another masterpiece that ends unsatisfactorily .

		MOORE .

		I 'm glad you mentioned
Don Quixote	PERSON	.

		Defoe called him to your mind , for
Cervantes	PERSON	too was a literary hack , writing many comedies , autos , and poems , unworthy trash till he stumbled upon a subject which he wrote as well as it could be writ - ten till he came to the end of his inspiration .

		The coming to the end of one 's inspiration is always pathetic , and for Cervantes the loss was doubly cruel , for it came suddenly and went suddenly , like a wind .

		A fine wind it was while it lasted ; a finer never blew peradventure , not excepting the wind that carried the plays along Hamlet and
Lear	PERSON	.

		Cervantes sailed out of harbor in a grand gale .

		Who lives that does not sometimes think of the Castilian gentleman , exalted by a long reading of the literature of knight-errantry , discovering armor in a garret and repairing the helmet with brown paper on wire ?

		GOSSE .

		- Admirable , thrice admirable is the de - scription of the knight himself .

		Nor do I think that it is going too far to say that never in literature has so perfect a correspondence been found between the spirit and the flesh .

		And all you who have sought for this correspondence will accept the knight of the rueful countenance as the unparalleled ex - ample in which the flesh or lack of flesh proclaims the soul .

		MOORE .

		Turgenev described a fitting envelope for the spirit of Bazaroff , but
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	's conception is small compared with the world-wide figure of the knight riding forth by himself in the first instance , and then returning in search of an esquire .

		As we watch the twain riding side by side through the highlands we seem to be looking upon some great sculpture of
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	.

		Never was the world so wide before nor gestures so eternal .

		GOSSE .

		And we seem to be listening to Shake - speare himself , who was a contemporary ; and this sets me thinking that perhaps the special quality of their humor was not the insular possession of Eng - land , but belonged to the great century that pro- duced these two men .

		They could not have known each other , and yet ... But I must not allow our conversation to drift into Shakespearean con - troversy .

		You said that never was the world so wide before nor gestures so eternal .

		MOORE .

		As in the first adventures when the 298
October 19	DATE	knight charged the flock and afterwards the wind - mill .

		And is it not thrilling to remember that they were on their way to the inn in which
Don Quixote	PERSON	was enrolled by the innkeeper ?

		And indeed I can not keep myself from mentioning the vigil undertaken at the instigation of the innkeeper .

		Think of it !

		or of telling you that it was the innkeeper who sent the knight home in search of an esquire .

		The don returns with
Sancho	PERSON	mounted on an ass was ever before an imagination so epical ?

		And how splendid the blanketing of Sancho in the inn and the account of the evil-smelling slut stealing by mistake into the knight 's bed , and he lying between sleeping and waking , dreaming of
Dulcenea	LOCATION	, instead of into the bed of the lusty waggoner who had been looking forward to her all that day for many weary miles .

		After reading these pages I lay immersed in genius , like a medieval saint in God , the host still melting on his tongue ; and I continued in ecstasy till the twain reached an almost savage landscape so ad - mirably described .

		The time must have been late in the
afternoon	TIME	, for there still lingers in my mind a memory of peaks brilliant against the sun setting , and my ear still holds like a shell
Don Quixote	PERSON	's voice telling
Sancho	PERSON	that he wishes to strip himself naked and stand upon his head , and
Sancho	PERSON	begging the knight to refrain , saying that the sight of his master 's naked rump in the air will bring up his stomach .

		GOSSE .

		You will allow me to interrupt you for a moment .

		The credit of introducing landscape into fiction has always been granted to
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		But your mention of the rugged landscapes in
Cervantes	LOCATION	puts it into my mind that the honor of introducing landscape background into fiction really belongs to
Cervantes	PERSON	.

		I remember the landscape you allude to ; it is brushed in with the energy of
Salvator Rosa	ORGANIZATION	.

		MOORE .

		It is indeed , and many others .

		But I would remind you that yourself deprecated the in - troduction of Shakespearean controversy into our talk ; and you did well , and I did ill when I spoke of Egyptian and Assyrian sculpture , for the land - scapes through which the knight and his escort fol - low their adventures are superterrestrial .

		We have left our miserable little planet for a larger one ,
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	maybe , and the book drops from our hands in amazement when the Don throws his heels into the air .

		Cervantes ' last inspiration no , the last is Sancho turning in the saddle , and catching sight of the knight 's shanks above his shirt ; he drops into reverie , falls to considering his relation , for he is on his way back to recount the knight 's last exploits to
Dulcenea	LOCATION	.

		The book should have ended here , for God him - self could not have invented adventures more won - derful than those that have been .

		I have forgotten if the meeting with the gang of convicts ,
Don Quix	PERSON	- ote 's charge , and the subsequent misunderstanding , and the severe beating he receives as soon as he has freed them from their chains , comes just before or just after
Sancho	PERSON	's departure .

		For the sake of a clear division between the inspired and the unin - spired Cervantes , I would have it come before .

		But it may come in the next division of the story , Nature being the real author and Cervantes no more than her mouthpiece .

		Nature is good at detail , but lacks rhythm ; she lingers and spoils the harvest with an aftermath .

		It may come in the next division ; yet I do not see how it can , for we are introduced to new characters , and stories are told that no one re - members Moorish maidens who became Christians and such like .

		A faint memory lingers in me of a curate .

		Do you remember ?

		GOSSE .

		My unfortunate memory , oh , my un - fortunate memory .

		MOORE .

		There is no reason for being disheart - ened , not this time , for it may be doubted if even Mr.
Fitzmaurice Kelly	PERSON	could give any lucid account of these stories , though he refused to collaborate with me in an edition that would exclude all extraneous matter and follow closely the fortunes of the knight and his esquire .

		He was right , for his closer study of the book than mine had revealed to him , let us hope , the truth that the original inspiration was too wonderful to be continued by gods or men ; and henceforth
Cervantes	PERSON	, the hack writer , turns the handle of his hurdy-gurdy , setting
Don Quixote	PERSON	and his esquire dancing to the old tune
Don Quixote	PERSON	starting out on some new adventure ,
Sancho	PERSON	holding up his hands .

		GOSSE .

		It has often been said that a finer and nobler nature begins to appear in the knight in the second part ; and I do not think that this is untrue to nature , for if we contain any grain of good it ripens as we live .

		MOORE .

		The change in the knight , if there be any change , does not help us to any new appreciation of him ; and I say this though I know in saying it I am at variance with
Turgenev	PERSON	, who drew the attention of the
Moscow	LOCATION	students to the death of
Don Quixote	PERSON	, trampled to death by a herd of swine , and to the last words of the chivalrous knight .

		I will not ask you what they are ; I too have forgotten them , and only remember that `` though all things pass away , even beauty , chivalry , and truth , good - ness remains . ''

		A stupid paraphrase doubtless , but a beautiful idea it is , truly , that he who had fol - lowed goodness all his life long should find his death at last under cloven hooves .

		But the herd of swine is introduced into the story casually a casual thought introduced into a casually composed sequel in which
Sancho	PERSON	becomes a pour of proverbial wis -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 299 dom , while the knight rides wrapped in meditation , like Falstaff ; for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, too , intellectualized his knight , thereby puzzling the mummers who try to portray him .

		But , as you said just now , we must not allow Shakespearean controversy to beguile us from our search for a first-rate mind expressing it - self in English prose narrative .

		GOSSE .

		As that is our quest , it seems to me that I can not do better than to ask you to put a precise meaning on the words `` a first-rate mind . ''

		Kant 's mind was first rate , but it was not the sort of mind that instigates works of art ; and it has often oc - curred to me that something more than mere mind is necessary to produce the pictures shall we say ?

		of Manet and
Degas	LOCATION	.

		Yet a mind is visible in their works .

		MOORE .

		I wonder if we can differentiate between the mind and the instincts of the mind ?

		If we can , I should prefer to say that instincts of the mind are discernible in the works of the great masters .

		But I 'm always apprehensive of metaphysical quicksands and mists , and before putting down the helm I will remark that the artist 's instinct is the sail that car - ries the boat along , and his reason the rudder that keeps the boat 's head to the wind ; without a rudder the sail loses the wind .

		The simile seems to hold good .

		An instinct will carry the artist some dis - tance , but if he have not reason he will drift like the rudderless boat , making no progress at all .

		GOSSE .

		As good an explanation as we shall get of something that will always remain a mystery .

		If I may continue your thought for you I would say that works in which reason plays too large a part do not satisfy us .

		MOORE .

		Our instincts are deeper than our rea - son , and it is pleasant to remember that art rises out of our primal nature , and that the art that never seems trivial is instinctive .

		GOSSE .

		If I may do so without seeming egotisti - cal , I would remind you that I have touched on the same point in my History of English Literature , saying that
George Eliot	PERSON	seems trivial , especially in the books in which she was anxious to seem pro- found .

		MOORE .

		Quite so .

		Manet was never anxious , and did not waste time at keyholes like
Degas	PERSON	, but said if not aloud , to himself we are original or we are n't ; but we do not become original by sending away the model who weighs eight stone , and calling in the butcher 's wife who weighs twenty-nine and asking her to strip and stand in front of a tin bath , or by painting one cheek of the wife 's backside green and the other blue , like
Bernard	PERSON	.

		GOSSE .

		You would regard
George Eliot	PERSON	as a trivial writer , and
Sterne	PERSON	as serious ?

		MOORE .

		Of course I should ,
Gosse	PERSON	; you 're help - ing me ; I can not find words to tell you how much , and my essay seems to be coming .

		You 're not go - ing ?

		I will not hear of your going ; back to your chair , for you 're helping me even more than I ex - pected you would , and I expected a great deal of help from you .

		You are helping me , putting the words I want into my mouth , that the English novel is silly , illiterate , sentimental , erudite , and pompous by turns ; but serious , never !

		How true !

		And how could it be else , for in the seventeenth century we were living in moated castles defended by retainers who dined with their chief in banqueting halls , rais - ing or lowering the drawbridge as the occasion re - quired ; life was too unsettled to admit a literature whose subject must always be , perhaps to a large extent , a description of social life ; and it would seem that social life was thrust somewhat too sud - denly upon
England	LOCATION	, drawing-rooms or salons hav - ing arrived from
France	LOCATION	, unintroduced by any suf - ficient prose literature .

		But without regard for this lack of preparation the drawing-rooms insisted on being entertained , and they took what they could get
Tom Jones	ORGANIZATION	.

		I am beginning to see my essay : there was no standard , and it was out of the en - thusiasm of our first drawing-rooms that the belief arose which soon developed into a tradition , that
Tom Jones	PERSON	shall be accepted as the classic example of English prose narrative .

		GOSSE .

		Born of the Georgian house .

		MOORE .

		Yes , born of the Georgian house of the Georgian drawing-room .

		GOSSE .

		You could n't find a better springboard .

		MOORE .

		I 'm glad you think so , and I hope you will allow me to continue talking a little longer .

		You 've no idea what a help you are .

		GOSSE .

		Proceed .

		MOORE .

		I read
Tom Jones	PERSON	in the influence of the tradition that I have just mentioned , and ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		I hope you have n't neglected to look into the book again , for if you have n't I can not help you .

		MOORE .

		Yes , I 've looked into the book , and it seemed more lifeless than it did twenty years before , when I read it for the first time .

		It is now an old and withered tree , whitened branches and gaping trunk ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		Ready to fall , having aged almost out of recognition in the last twenty years .

		An excellent impression of a decaying masterpiece ; but something more than an impression is necessary in an essay .

		MOORE .

		I can only write my own feelings , and shall have to say that at the end of the first hundred pages the book fell across my knees and set me ask - ing myself how our forefathers had managed to read a book without a glimpse of the world without us , 300 THE DIAL
October 19	DATE	or any account of the world within us .

		It is dif - ficult ,
Gosse	PERSON	, to write vividly about an entirely empty book , vague , like a fog , yet without mystery , and so impersonal that we begin to doubt the existence of the author , and in self-defense have to urge our - selves out of the belief that the book proceeded from some curious machine , a lost invention of the eight - eenth century .

		But machinery was in its infancy in
1750	DATE	; a living man must have written it or dic - tated it !

		The theory that it was gabbled into a phonograph is untenable .

		Even so , the imperson - ality of the book would surprise us , so empty are the pages of all traces of preferences and aversions .

		Since I have begun I must tell all ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		Fielding seems to me to have been without sensibility of any kind , mental or physical ; and his book is therefore the most personal and at the same time the most impersonal ever written .

		Mr.
Alworthy	PERSON	, the first person we meet in the book , says nothing that brings him even superficially before us , and we are told nothing about him , though he is the owner of the Georgian house in which the first scenes are laid , and the pivot on which the story turns .

		We drop the book to consider this strange reticence , and come to believe that the author felt it would be difficult for him to set before the reader a man so trans - parently conventional that he could not be even sus - pected of having begotten a child , and shrank from a task which , even if it were successful , might weary the reader , to fall back upon a simpler plan of ex - position , saying to himself : `` The obvious is always the best , and I will call the gentleman Alworthy ; the name will allay suspicion even in the most prone to suspicion . ''

		A daring interpretation , I admit it to be , of Fielding 's mind during the composition of the first part of his notable novel , which you may accept or ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		Forgive me for interrupting you , but I would not have you fall into the mistake of finding fault with an eighteenth century author for not writing naturalistically .

		MOORE .

		I think my words were : `` Without a glimpse of the world without us , '' and to these I might have added , without even such glimpses as we get from
Jean Jacques	PERSON	.

		In
Tom Jones	PERSON	we are in a fieldless , treeless , flowerless planet ; but even Fielding 's absence from natural description would not matter if the book were not passionless .

		Any sudden movement of passion or feeling would pro- voke our sympathy , and we should see in our imag - ination the sun lighting up the middle distance and the rain cloud above it .

		A description of
Manon	PERSON	is not to be found in the text , but
Manon	PERSON	is always before our eyes , for Abbe Prevost realized
Manon	PERSON	intensely .

		But Fielding , in his attempt to describe
Sophia	LOCATION	, proves himself to be as insensible to the magic of human life as he is to that of nature .

		GOSSE .

		It is probable that Fielding succeeded better with men than with women , and you will not deny that
Squire Western	ORGANIZATION	is a very real person and one very typical of the eighteenth century .

		MOORE .

		Squire Western goes his own gait and speaks his own lingo ; we see and hear him ; but if I may say so without seeming to disparage Fielding needlessly ,
Squire Western	ORGANIZATION	is too obvious to be con - sidered highly ; he is hardly more worthy of esthetic criticism than the caricatures of Gilray and Row - landson .

		I would not mitigate a merit , but I would have it understood that nature draws so well some - times that even a very bad draftsman can not miss a likeness .

		There can be little doubt that
Squire Western	ORGANIZATION	is a rough sketch from life , and the inven - tion of the different episodes in the book is so poor that I am inclined to believe that the one good one , the
Squire	PERSON	's relinquishment of his pursuit of Sophia to follow a pack of foxhounds that crossed the road in pursuit of a fox , was like the
Squire	PERSON	himself taken from life .

		GOSSE .

		But you admire
Rowlandson	PERSON	?

		MOORE .

		Yes , I admire
Rowlandson	PERSON	till some - body speaks of
Goya	ORGANIZATION	.

		GOSSE .

		And you know
Thackeray	PERSON	's opinion that since
Tom Jones	PERSON	nobody had dared to paint the portrait of a man in fiction , meaning , I take it , that Fielding was the first to tell us that a young man might be truly in love with
Sophia Western	PERSON	and yet commit an act of impropriety with
Molly Seegrum	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		A knowledge which he might have gath - ered from observation of his bull terrier ; and my reproach is that Fielding has not attempted to dif - ferentiate between dogkind and mankind , and that he does not seem aware that it is necessary to do so , even in his own mind .

		GOSSE .

		Have you nothing to say in praise of Fielding 's style ?

		MOORE .

		He writes with gusto , a quality we sel - dom meet with in modern literature , perhaps be - cause we are becoming more thoughtful ; and he keeps it up like an actor who knows he is playing in a bad play .

		GOSSE .

		But you have not told me how you ex - plain away
Thackeray	PERSON	's preference for
Tom Jones	ORGANIZATION	.

		MOORE .

		I find the examination of my own mind so difficult that I can not for the moment undertake to examine
Thackeray	PERSON	's .

		The best plan will be to try to believe that he spoke casually .

		GOSSE .

		Now I must reprove you for a lack of seriousness .

		For nearly two hundred years Fielding has held undisputed sway as our prime novelist .

		MOORE .

		We shall meet others in the course of
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 301 our literary inquisition whose reputations seem as unmerited as Fielding 's .

		I know I feel that the prospect is a little alarming , but we have lighted our lanterns and are looking about for a serious writer .

		Let us get on .

		GOSSE .

		But how shall we recognize him should we meet him ?

		MOORE .

		Now ,
Gosse	PERSON	, you are inventing diffi - culties that do not exist ; and I must reprove you , for was it not you that put forward
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	as typical examples of the serious and trivial in literature ?

		and with these in mind we shall not miss a really serious writer if our * lights should flash him into view .

		A little patience is all I ask ,
Gosse	PERSON	; other examples will be discovered later , but we may not anticipate them , for I am eager to remind you that in your History of English Litera - ture you speak of the `` extreme '' beauty of
Sterne	PERSON	's style , and the adjective pleases me ; I can not tell you why , but it seems to me to discover the truth , or some of it , and I would merely add that no writer has come down so unchanged as
Sterne	PERSON	.

		GOSSE .

		And I welcome the addition .

		I 'm glad that we agree about
Sterne	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		But , my dear friend , we are always agreed , except when you speak of
Sterne	PERSON	's unseemly life ; a sad remark that is of yours , and if Imay be permitted to say so , lacking point ; for we could not have
Sterne	PERSON	's style without his unseemly life , we accept the one for the sake of the other , just as we accept the unseemliness of Christianity in practice for the sake of the words of Jesus , overlooking the Bishop of
London	LOCATION	, who ...
GOSSE	ORGANIZATION	.

		I 'm afraid you do n't know the Bishop of
London	LOCATION	.

		MOORE .

		My writings have placed me , alas , under interdiction , and so have yours ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		You men - tioned that you are not a member of his club , but neglected to say that you would have been if you had not written a masterpiece .

		The truth ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		GOSSE .

		The
Athenaeum Club	ORGANIZATION	is becoming weari - some , and I must insist that we return to
Sterne	PERSON	without delay .

		I 'm glad that you approve of my adjective , but why it should have taken your fancy so completely I can not imagine not at this moment .

		MOORE .

		You say that his selected elements at - tract the imitation of some more or less analogous spirit , meaning thereby that his selected elements attract an analogous spirit to imitation , a criticism that has a special interest for me , for before I read a line of
Tristam Shandy	ORGANIZATION	or The Sentimental Journey the newspapers began to say that the prose of Hail and Farewell recalled
Sterne	PERSON	.

		That my best pages should recall the worst in The Senti - mental Journey , if it be possible to discern a page less inspired than its fellow in an inspired work , pleases me to hear , for we may be pleased by flattery without being duped by flattery ; and , my curiosity awakened by constant references to
Sterne	PERSON	while this book was under review , I abstracted a little red book from the library of a common friend , saying to myself , `` Many empty days lie before me , and though I can not read in a railway train I may be able to read on board a ship . ''

		And I read despite the drumming of the screw , raising my eyes from time to time from the exquisite page to the beauti - fullest of seas , regretful that I was not reading on board a felucca , lateen rigged .

		The French critic you quote who compared
Sterne	PERSON	to one of the little bronze satyrs of antiquity , in whose hollow bodies exquisite odors were stored , seems to me to have wandered near to the truth , inasmuch as The Senti - mental Journey recalls antiquity , perhaps more than any other book of the modern world .

		Like a transla - tion of some small Latin or Greek work , it read to me Daphnis and
Chloe	PERSON	, or The Golden Ass , or which other , I ask , for I am without erudition , as many of the ancients were , but I have the eyes of the ancients , I think .

		GOSSE .

		I should like to hear why The Senti - mental Journey reminds you of classical literature .

		Just a feeling ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		A feeling , certainly , but no vague one ; it is his sense of touch which never fails him , rather than his speech which often does , that carries my thoughts back to the flowers and leaves and gar - lands and pilasters and white butterflies of the city disinterred , only known to me through photographs and
Mary Hunter	PERSON	's dining-room which came from
Venice	LOCATION	.

		Italy never lost her paganism , and the disinter - ment of
Pompeii	LOCATION	was , in a sense , unnecessary .

		Italy never forgot her antiquity , nor could she forget it her coasts washed on either side by the bluest of seas .

		I longed for a felucca , lateen rigged .

		Its half-dozen rough Italian sailors would not have seemed out of harmony with the legended sea , the birthplace of all our beautiful European gods , as were the passengers who , despite my admonitions , passed through the Straits of
Messina	LOCATION	, forgetful of Proserpine gathering flowers on the plain of
Enna	LOCATION	.

		I spoke to them of rugged Polyphemus peering over some cliffs and discerning
Galatea	LOCATION	in the foam ; I besought them to remember
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, who , disguised in the form of a bull , carried Europa away ; and then , turning as a last resource to a more human story , I spoke of Dido weeping on the shores of the African coast .

		302 THE DIAL
October 19 GOSSE	DATE	.

		Did you try to win the sympathies of the passengers with your theory that art is touch ?

		MOORE .

		Why not ,
Gosse	PERSON	?

		All audiences are good .

		I would sooner speak to Bishops than remain silent for six days .

		Of course I tried to interest the passengers in the legends of the bluest and beauti - fullest of seas .

		I spoke of `` bitter '' Media , Swin - burne 's best adjective , or one of his best .

		GOSSE .

		But you did n't hold forth to the pas - sengers as you are holding forth to me , did you ?

		MOORE .

		It is strange , and much stranger than you would think for , to find oneself cut off from all communication with one 's ideas ; for on board the ship that took me there was nobody of my kin , nobody who knew me or my writings , or who had read any book that we had read , or seen any pictures that we had seen a strange sense of estrangement that can be likened to an island and savages , with this difference , that the passengers and myself spoke the same language , but a language alienated from ideas does not amount to much ; and you will ap - preciate my alarm when I tell you that the nearest thing to intellectual sympathy I could find on board that ship was a man who explained his invention for building piers out of concrete .

		It appears to have been successful somewhere in
India	LOCATION	, and he was on his way to lay down more boxes of concrete .

		His account of his invention interested me , for there was nothing else to listen to and The Senti - mental Journey is , unfortunately , not a long book .

		Only one other spoke to me ; I 've forgotten what his occupation in life was , but his ignorance was amusing betimes .

		`` What is that book you 're read - ing ? ''

		he asked , one day .

		I anwered , `` The Senti - mental Journey , '' and began to tell him at once of my surprise and delight in coming upon the famous phrase `` God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb . ''

		`` A phrase , '' I said , `` that many believe to be in the
Gospels	LOCATION	.

		It sounds like Jesus .

		It is n't , however , nor is it
Sterne	PERSON	's , but a French proverb heard by him from a half-witted shepherdess .

		The French phrase is not given by
Sterne	PERSON	; it is hard to discover it in our English version and the proverb seems to have become forgotten in
France	LOCATION	, but
Sterne	PERSON	's ver - sion started it on a new life in
England	LOCATION	; ` God tem - pers the wind ' is better than ` God measures the wind , ' which may be the French proverb .

		But it was nbt this improvement that gave the proverb immortality I say mistranslation , for a shepherdess would not be likely to speak of a shorn lamb .

		In the French proverb it is the ` yoe ' that is shorn . ''

		I spell the word phonetically ,
Gosse	PERSON	, for I prefer the word as shepherds pronounce it .

		`` Sterne changes ` yoe ' into lamb , thereby bringing a little pathos into the proverb ; and we being a sentimental people , '' I was saying to the passenger when he interrupted me , `` Do you really mean to tell me that he said ` God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb ? ' ''

		`` Yes , '' I answered .

		`` Which shows , '' the passenger replied derisively , `` that he knows no more about lambs than he does about pheasants .

		A howler it was when he said that pheasants ate mangel-wurzels , but this is a worse one .

		Who ever heard of shorn lambs ? ''

		My absent-minded companion imagined that I was speaking of
Lloyd George !	PERSON

		It was
Lloyd George	PERSON	, he thought , who said `` God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb , '' and it seemed useless to point out his mistake to him .

		1918 THE DIAL 303 Reconstruction at Work HEN THE Industrial Councils were recom - mended in
March 1917	DATE	by the
Interim Committee	ORGANIZATION	and accepted by
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, collective bargaining between employer and employed became , it now appears , a corporate part of
England	LOCATION	's industrial in - stitution .

		At the time of the recommendation the Councils seemed nothing more than a logical ex - tension of the trade union movement , or a measure of the strength of the movement in
England	LOCATION	.

		But in these days of rapid change and illuminating dis - closures , the Industrial Councils , eighteen months after their recommendation , with many already in the first stages of organization , bear a portentous aspect in relation to the after-the-war development of foreign trade .

		From the reports received here , the unqualified endorsement of the Councils comes from the em - ployers or from those who assume the responsibility of industry .

		Industrial Reconstruction : A Sym - posium on the Situation After the War and How to Meet It , edited by
Huntley Carter	PERSON	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , reveals an amazing hospitality of employers , statesmen , and economists to the revolutionary ideas back of the Councils ; that is , to -LRB- a -RRB- the substitution of a national organization of industry in place of the present practice of competition between individual business men within the Empire and to -LRB- b -RRB- the di - vision of industrial management between elected representatives of organized employers and organ - ized workers .

		The Symposium was published orig - inally by The New Age before the recommendations of the
Whitley Committee	ORGANIZATION	were presented to
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment .

		It may be interesting to Americans to note that public opinion on industrial reorganization was formulated and in fairly concrete shape before any government recommendations were issued .

		While neither the Industrial Councils nor the principles of reorganization as offered by employers in this book represent the Guild Socialism of The New Age , I think it is fair to acknowledge that the con - cept of self-government in industry , as opposed to the bureaucratic or autocratic management which the Industrial Councils seem to reflect , is largely due to the more or less single-handed work carried on for a decade by the
Guild Socialists	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the employers , Mr.
A. J. P. Benn	PERSON	, who has contributed with singular clarity to the Symposium , is the author of a remarkable little book
The Trade of Tomorrow	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- which elaborates the Industrial Councils idea .

		The ma - chinery that Mr.
Benn	PERSON	recommends for the setting up of Trade Councils , as he calls them , is a
Ministry of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, appointed for the purpose of fostering and facilitating the self-advancement of British trade * , The principal duty of the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	would be the promotion and regulation of Trade Councils within the different industries in accordance with the interest of Empire ; that is to say , the interest of
England	LOCATION	.

		He proposes that these Trade Councils consist of elected representatives from employers ' trade associations and from trade unions ; that one - third of the members be drawn from each source representing equally the state , capital , and the wage workers .

		He proposes that the government refer to these Councils all matters relative to the par - ticular industry they represent .

		He provides in his plan for an industrial franchise to be granted every citizen , so that each man and woman would have a voice in the three branches of national administra - tion : the
Imperial Government	ORGANIZATION	, the Local Govern - ment , the
Industrial Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		He would give the unions of wage earners and the associations of employers semiofficial status and admit industry , to use his own words , to a place in the Constitution .

		But why , Americans may ask , are British em - ployers urging labor to perfect the unions and share in the direction of industry ?

		Why are employers proposing to surrender apparently eager to sur - render in part their precious prerogative ?

		With a directness which characterizes the book Mr.
Benn	PERSON	gives this unequivocal answer : There can no longer be doubt that every trade must present a united front to foreign competition .

		The strug - gle of the future in the foreign market will be between German goods , American goods , Japanese goods and British goods , and that competition will be sufficiently severe without further competition between individual British manufacturers .

		In fact , if the present system re - mains unaltered , the British manufacturer does not stand a chance against the foreigner .

		As a reason for calling in the
State	ORGANIZATION	on the proposed national reorganization of British trade , Mr.
Benn	PERSON	holds : The interest of the
State	ORGANIZATION	in trade is that we should supply such goods instead of the German , the American , or the Japanese , and the question for the
State	ORGANIZATION	to answer is : How are these things to be done and who are the people to do them ?

		-LRB- Italics mine -RRB- Again he says : While on the subject of export it may be interesting to notice what is happening at the moment on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The European war has given to American exporters great opportunities for expansion , and as British manufacturers know to their cost , full advantage has been taken of those opportunities ... To sum up this question of export , the position is that
Ameri	PERSON	- can trusts have done extremely well , that German cartels have done better , and that British cooperation , if it can be brought about , will do best .

		34 THE DIAL
October 19	DATE	On this proposition of British cooperation finan - ciers and British employers and British statesmen seem to be in substantial agreement .

		And British cooperation means the alignment of representatives from capitalists and labor organizations .

		As the foreign trade situation calls for `` a united front , '' there is nothing for it except to cut across class and unite on national lines .

		The only question in the minds of those who carry the responsibility for main - taining British trade is not whether British capital and labor shall combine for the trade war , but how the unity shall be effected .

		The answer is the In - dustrial Councils as recommended by the
Whitley Commission	ORGANIZATION	, endorsed by the British Trade Con - gress , by the
Gartner Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, and other organi - zationsor the Trade Councils as evolved by Mr.
Benn	PERSON	.

		The machinery which Mr.
Benn	PERSON	has de - scribed in his book is being established in many in - dustries before the soldiers return from the field .

		The principles of national reorganization of in - dustry , represented in this British plan , avoid state administration of industry and the evils of Prussian bureaucracy by throwing the responsibility on the representatives of those actually involved in the pro- motion and fabrication of manufactured goods .

		When
Germany	LOCATION	invaded modern industry it was un - hampered , as Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	shows in his Imperial Ger - many , by pioneer technology and pioneer organiza - tion methods .

		It started after the Franco-Prussian war with the experience of
England	LOCATION	to go on , with unencumbered ground for organization .

		A
Prus	PERSON	- sian state guarded the territory , supervised its culti - vation in the interest of the Empire by erecting , as we know , a huge scheme of bureaucratic manage - ment and direction .

		England because of the world war is now taking advantage of the experience of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is avoiding the cumbersome , unwieldy machinery of a bureaucratic organization ; and under the supervision of the state , with a national in place of a private concept of industry , it plans a reorgani - zation of trade on a basis of representative govern - ment .

		While the internal organization is repre - sentative , the intention of organization is imperial .

		British statesmen , employers , and economists re - linquish their industrial imperialism at home to se - cure their imperial place abroad .

		The competition between English business men is to give place to British competition in the trade of the world .

		This competition requires a solid British front ; it requires solidity in the ranks as well as the solidarity of the captains .

		It is a transfer of national militancy from the battlefield in
France	LOCATION	to world commerce .

		Although the Councils represent the determina - tion of British capital to maintain leadership in world affairs , the adoption of Industrial Councils as a scheme of organization can not rest on whether or not they are promoted for imperial purposes .

		It may happen that the present political strength of the British Labor party , with its opposition to foreign trade war , will cause a modification in policy .

		The party declared in its program : `` We disclaim all idea of economic war ... We believe that nations are in no way damaged by each other 's eco - nomic prosperity and commercial progress . ''

		The intention of British capital , or the capital of other countries , to fight for supremacy in foreign markets can not however be met by a continued dis - organization of industry within the nations , so that a judgment on the formation of Industrial Councils must be made irrespective of motives .

		The defeat of empires of trade as well as their victory requires national organization strong enough to support and promote a world economy .

		Legitimate criticism of the Industrial Councils as a scheme of national organization relates to whether or not the councils are efficacious as agencies of pro- duction , and whether they are or are not efficacious as an agency of industrial self-government .

		It is on these two points that criticism must focus and a judgment be given .

		Whether or not they are effici - ent as agencies of production will depend in the long run upon whether they are successful in eliminating the industrial sabotage which is an inherent feature of any system of autocratic management .

		The most illusive and the most destructive sabotage is the ab - sence of will to produce , the enervation which ac - companies ^ interest in productive enterprise .

		Mr.
Benn	PERSON	undertakes to meet this in part by the decen - tralization of organization within each industry .

		Will that decentralization however go far enough to make it possible for each worker consciously and intelligently to articulate his work with the whole scheme of production and actually to participate through his work in the policy of management ?

		The adoption in
England	LOCATION	of this representative form of industry nationally organized , in place of the state socialism of
Germany	LOCATION	, was in recognition of the fact that British labor could only be intrigued in plans for increased productivity and national service through some fulfillment of the interest of each individual worker concerned either through some material interest or in an awakening of his intellectual interest in the enterprise by his participa - tion in the management .

		The weakness of the scheme is in its building on the principle of repre - sentative government and not on the participation of the individuals in the actual management .

		Rep - resentative government , unfortunately , is as near as Anglo-Saxon imagination has envisaged self - government ; but the difficulty in accepting represen - 191 35 tation in industry through officials , in place of some articulated functioning of the whole group of par - ticipants , is that under representation the will of the participants is not secured .

		We can make this as - sertion with confidence .

		We have had our experi - ence in political life and in our voluntary organiza - tions .

		Neither the citizen , nor the member of a union , nor the member of any other association is stimulated merely by his membership and his voting privilege into such continued activity as daily labor requires .

		We bewail the indifference of the citizen and chide him for not taking his share of the burden , but the institution continues after a fashion and we are satisfied because it is not in form an autocracy .

		In the case of industry , however , the present point of reorganization will be lost if there is not obtained from the worker an unflagging interest .

		Having said so much by way of warning against the expectation that any substitute , such as repre - sentation through the appointment of officials , will suffice to arouse the intelligent interest or even the interest of wage earners in wealth production , I want to say with equal emphasis that no other scheme has been proposed which is fraught with the same possibilities for realizing the participation , the actual participation , of the worker in the adventure of creating wealth .

		Whether these Councils are suc - cessful in eliciting the interest and the will of the people to produce depends upon whether the leaders are at present more interested in their own participa - tion in the Councils as representatives than they are in bringing about through shop organization an actual and continued participation of the workers in promotion and management .

		Supplementary re - ports of the
Whitley Committee	ORGANIZATION	, which I have not seen , indicate , I understand , that methods of works or shop management have been considered .

		Strange as it may seem to the average worker , who has only an infinitesimal knowledge of the in - dustry of which he is a part , modern efficiency methods of production open up the possibilities of a real articulation for intelligent human effort in the associated life of twentieth century industry .

		If what is now called scientific management were de - veloped in shop and carried forward , through the workers ' own experimentation ; and if with their understanding of the situation and with their ap - proval it were made to true up all stages of fabrica - tion , evaluation , and distribution , the workers ' in - terest in production would have opportunity to develop .

		If participation , actual intellectual par - ticipation , of workers in the enterprise and adven - ture is chimerical , so then is the expectation that in day-by-day labor a continuous will to produce can be secured .

		It may be that the Industrial Councils would be successful in increasing output by means of the rep - resentative scheme of government , as the tendency of organization in industry has been to decrease warfare and suspend production on account of lock - outs or strikes .

		I have no doubt that many who speak for the Councils have no more than this in mind .

		But men like Mr.
Benn	PERSON	are after a momen - tum which is born of a free will to work .


J. R. Clynes	PERSON	,
Food Commissioner	ORGANIZATION	and member of the
Whitley Committee	ORGANIZATION	, sounds a warning to those who are expecting the Councils to bring industrial peace .

		His minority comment , signed by him and four others , is : While recognizing that the more amicable relations estab - lished by industrial councils or trade boards between capital and labour will afford an atmosphere generally favourable to industrial peace and progress , we desire to express our view that a complete identity of interests between capital and labour can not be thus effected , and that such machinery can not be expected to furnish a set - tlement for the more serious conflicts of interest involved in the working of an economic system primarily governed and directed by the motives of private profit .

		There is some objection expressed by labor men who have contributed to the Symposium to the lying - down together of the lion and the lamb ; but the principles embodied in the Whitley Report have been twice endorsed by the
Trade Unions Congress	ORGANIZATION	and , from what information I get second-hand , the organization of the Councils is proceeding with - out serious opposition from labor , and evidently in many cases with labor 's active cooperation .

		It is clear that labor has no concrete scheme in opposition to the Councils .

		Up to the present that is , up to the time of the war the trade unions had been concerned , for the most part , with pro- tecting wage workers against capitalist aggression .

		Wage workers had not been concerned with the actual work of promoting production .

		Perhaps the most forceful contribution made in
Huntley Carter	PERSON	's Symposium has come from Mr.
John Hilton	PERSON	, of the
Gartner Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, in his advocacy of joint coun - cils of employers and employees in the administra - tion of industry : This , or any other more desirable arrangement , is only possible on one condition : that organised Labour definitely abandons its negative or defensive or obstructive attitude , and takes the initiative .

		When Labour comes to regard industry as its personal concern -LRB- instead of merely labour -RRB- , aims at producing in advance of anyone else its own suggestions for industrial improvement , discovers for itself possible time-saving methods and devices , and threatens to strike if they are not introduced , takes it upon itself to reprimand managers who are incompetent or too easy-going , insists on wasteful competition between kin - dred firms ceasing , makes technical education a personal matter , insists on doing good work , whatever anyone may say then
Labour	ORGANIZATION	will come into its own and a new indus - trial order will be on its way .


HELEN MAROT	PERSON	.

		3 6 THE DIAL
October 19	DATE	A Pointless Pointillist I F ONE MIGHT conceive , in the heliotrope future , any Ph. Demon so inspired as to set about compiling a list of dull books by interesting authors , one could hardly doubt that
Ezra Pound	ORGANIZATION	's Pavannes and Di - visions -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- would be his first entry .

		An incredible performance !

		Somehow , one has had all these years -LRB- for alas , Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's indiscretions can no longer be called the indiscretions of youth -RRB- the impression that this King-Maker among poets was quite the most mercurial of our performers .

		One associated with his name the deftest of jugglery , sleights of mind without number , lightning-like ter - giversatility , and a genius for finding the latest pro- cession and leading it attired in the most dazzling of colors .

		Of course , Mr.
Pound	PERSON	has himself been at some pains to encourage us in this view .

		As a publicist he has few equals .

		But surely it has not been entirely a deception !

		And neverthe - less he comes now upon us with
Pavannes	PERSON	and Di - visions `` a collection , '' says Mr.
Knopf	PERSON	, `` of the best prose written by Mr.
Pound	PERSON	during the last six years '' and therewith threatens , if we are not care - ful , to destroy our illusions about him forever .

		For , regrettable as is the confession , the outstand - ing feature of this book of prose is its dullness .

		One reads more and more slowly , encountering always heavier obstacles , and short of a major effort of the will -LRB- and a kind of amazed curiosity -RRB- one finally stops .

		Intrinsically therefore one may say at once that the book is without value .

		If one is to examine it carefully , one does so for quite another reason ; namely , because Mr.
Pound	PERSON	is himself an interesting figure observe his portrait in this vol - ume , so elaborately and theatrically posed a curious representative of homo sapiens , and without any doubt a poet who has -LRB- sometimes severely -RRB- in - fluenced his fellow poets .

		Pavannes and Divisions shall be to us therefore what the soliloquies of the patient are to the psychoanalyst .

		If we pass over the unoriginal parts of this book the clever translation of
Laforgue	LOCATION	, and the well - selected dialogues of
Fontanelle	LOCATION	, amusing but nuga - tory and if we listen with concentrated attention to the Mr. Pound who chatters to us , alternately , in the lumberingly metrical and crudely satirical doggerel of L'Homme
Moyen Sensuel	PERSON	, or the dis - jointed and aimless prose of the essays and fables , what emerges from this babble ?

		A portrait , sharp - featured as Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's frontispiece , but how in - finitely more complex a portrait which surely not even a Vorticist could compass .

		One is reminded , indeed , of Mr.
Sludge	PERSON	, so inextricably the most sterling platitudes and the most brazen quackeries -LRB- no doubt believed in -RRB- are here commingled .

		Add to this that Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, like a jack-in-the-box , takes a naive delight in booing at the stately ; that he has the acquisitive instincts of the jackdaw -LRB- with a passion for bright and shining objects , particularly those spied from a very great distance -RRB- ; that he is unhappy unless he can be rebelling at something or somebody -LRB- even at himself of the day before yes -
terday	DATE	and this is healthy -RRB- ; and finally that as a poet he has genius , and has given us more than a handful of beautiful lyrics and one begins to per - ceive that Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's middle name should have been not
Loomis	PERSON	but Proteus .

		Those to whom Mr.
Pound	PERSON	is a thorn in the flesh will say that it is amazing that the poet of Cathay should , in
Pavannes	LOCATION	and Divisions , reveal himself so hopelessly as of third-rate mentality : those who are charitable will say that if a poet is to live he must also be a jour - nalist .

		There is no chance for an argument , since one can not possibly tell how seriously Pavannes and Divisions is intended .

		But if one can not read Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's intentions , his accomplishment is obvious and disillusioning .

		If a poet must be a journalist , let him be a good one !

		And this Mr.
Pound	PERSON	is not .

		For in point of style , or manner , or whatever , it is difficult to imagine anything much worse than the prose of Mr. Pound .

		It is ugliness and awk - wardness incarnate .

		Did he always write so badly ?

		One recollects better moments in his history and one even now finds him , as in the first paragraph of his paper on
Dolmetsch	PERSON	, making a music of prose .

		For the secret of this decay one must turn , as in all such cases , to the nature of the man 's mind , since style is not a mere application or varnish but the unconscious expression of a nature .

		And here is encountered one of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's chief character - istics , one that has from the very beginning been steadily growing upon him and it might be added steadily strangling his creative instinct .

		This characteristic is his passion for the decisive .

		His strokes are all of an equal weight and finality .

		On the sensory plane this first manifested itself , no doubt , as a desire for the single and brilliant image .

		In logic or dialectics it became a passion for the point , glittering and deadly .

		In the field of esthet - ics it has revealed itself as a need for espousing the out-of-the-way and remote and exceptional , so as to add a sort of impact and emphasis to personality by * a solitariness of opinion : it is more striking to play a tune on the Chinese p ` i-pa than on the banjo .

		On these several planes this instinctive appetite has
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 307 become more and more voracious , more and more exclusive , until finally it has reached a point where it threatens to leave Mr. Pound little else .

		His poetry has become imageless through excess of image image too deliberately sought .

		His prose has become pointless and merely fatiguing because of his effort to point every sentence : it has become a sort of chevaux de frise , impossible to walk through .

		These are failures which , one would think , the artist in Mr. Pound would have fore - seen .

		In prose it is a failure made all the more complete by the fact that the pointillist style was the last style for which he was intellectually fitted .

		Without the patience for careful analysis , or the acumen and precision and breadth for scientific in - vestigation , this method makes of him merely a subjectivist pedant , a tinkling sciolist , and what is more amazing for the man who wrote Cathay an apostle of the jejune and sterile .

		For so intent has Mr. Pound become on this making of points and cutting of images that he has gradually crystallized from them a cold and hard doctrine , a doctrine of negative virtues , aimed primarily against esthetic excess but in the upshot totally inimical to that spontaneity and opulence without which art is still - born .

		In short , Mr.
Pound	PERSON	has become , as regards style , a purist of the most deadly sort .

		So absorbed has he become in the minutiae of esthetics , so fe - tichistic in his adoration of literary nugae , that he has gradually come to think of style and filigree as if the terms were synonymous .

		This is the more lamentable because his esthetics , as revealed in his prose , are by no means subtle .

		One can not rear a palace of filigree : nor can one compose a Hamlet or a
Tyl Eulenspiegel	ORGANIZATION	entirely of velleities and evanes - cent nuances .

		Young authors , let us grant with Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, must learn to be artisans before they can complete themselves as artists .

		But at the point where purism stifles exuberance and richness -LRB- the intense confession of the sub-conscious -RRB- and at the point where , as an esthetic measure , it prefers the neatly-made to the well-felt or the profoundly - thought , it becames obviously vicious .

		It is the critic 's license to overrefine his point for the sake of emphasis , and this perhaps , in the present case , we have clearly done .

		To restore the balance somewhat we should add that , though by no means profound , Mr.
Pound	PERSON	is provocative and suggestive in his essays on the troubadours and the Elizabethan translators , and refreshing in his papers on
Dolmetsch	PERSON	and
Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	.

		After all , is he perhaps , in his prose , deliberately a journalist ?

		... And we remember with gratitude that he is a poet .

		CONRAD AIKEN : Fashions - of the Peacemakers .

		TXLTHOUGH war is an institution of civilization , its mood is not natural to lives of civilized men .

		It creates a tension of feeling and action which seri - ously perverts the normalities of existence , impart - ing to them all qualities of intoxication and shrill - ness .

		These qualities are unknown among persons actually engaged in the business of warfare , save at the very beginning .

		Soldiers , sailors , and admin - istrators are too absorbed in doing things to accu - mulate that mass of fancy and feeling which are the register of wishes unsatisfied and action untaken .

		Their emotional life consequently exhibits a nor - mality altogether lacking in that of civilians , for whom the interlude between impression and action is so very , very much longer than it is for the mili - tary , because they have so much more leisure to accumulate feelings and to think thoughts .

		Much of the ordinary civilian `` war work , '' much of the obstructive crowding to `` get into the game '' is the altogether automatic attempt to find relief from this uncomfortable condition .

		Everybody is uneasy unless he is `` doing something '' different from the normal , even though the daily adventure of his normality is the most useful action he can under - take for the winning of the war .

		This is as true of the laborer as of the leisure classes of `` conspicu - ous consumers '' from which are recruited the bulk of the prominent patrioteers .

		But the leisure classes , just because they have leisure , are of course most conspicuous both in the accumulation of feeling and in the fussy `` war work '' which drains it off .

		It shows itself in the fashions of their dress , in their talk , in the ritual and red tape of their committees .

		It shows itself mostly in the fact that the end aimed at is often so insignificant in value beside the means used .

		When th ^ s occurs the end is only an excuse for using the means , and the means is a relief from the strain of feeling .

		The knitting of socks and sweaters by hand , where machines would do it so much more swiftly and excellently , is an obvious case in point .

		Another , not so obvious , is the mak - ing of books , particularly of peace books .

		In the making of peace books , however , additional factors , almost imperceptible in the making of socks , become quite apparent .

		These factors are the special interests or idiosyncrasies of the author and what 3 o8
October 19	DATE	is usually known as mind or intelligence .

		Where these exist , they appear invariably together .

		In - telligence is general , impersonal , the register made on the consciousness of the writer by the structure and articulation of the things he is writing about .

		It is passive , realistic , and the cause of the general agreements between men .

		Idiosyncrasy is idio - syncrasy , the quality and flavor of personality , and it supplies the mental material which incarnates in - telligence , which turns intelligence into a working engine .

		The power which causes the engine to turn out a peace book is the discommoding intoxication and shrillness of the war-mopd .

		The interest in such books , considered as real confrontations of the controllable causes and prob - lems and cures of war , depends entirely upon the degree in which they actually envisage these things in their order and movement upon the degree , in a word , in which intelligence is freed from the dis - torting influence of emotion and idiosyncrasy and reveals the anatomy of the situation as it is in itself .

		But such a liberation of intelligence can usually not be attained in war time .

		Peacemaking books are usually written as katharses of the tensions of war .

		They usually aim to rationalize its emotions and to put them in a cosmic setting which will endow them with the aspect of that normality which they have upset .

		And the settings will vary with the ideational idiosyncrasies of the writers .

		Their proposals will offer fashions , but not the true style of peace .

		Hence monographs like
The Basis of Durable Peace	ORGANIZATION	, by Cosmos -LRB- Scribner ; 30 cts . -RRB-

		, or The Economic Basis of an Enduring Peace , by
C. W. MacFarlane	PERSON	-LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , tend to be the exception rather than the rule .

		Cosmos thinks in terms of history and of international law .

Hague	LOCATION	tribunal .

		Its sanctions must lie , not in such arrangements as are proposed by the League to
Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	, but in the public opinion of the civilized world .

		Mr.
MacFarlane	PERSON	finds his remedy for war in quite other data .

		He regards business and industry , not politics and law .

		His book is mainly a description of the French and Belgian need of a share of
Germany	LOCATION	's enormous surplusage of fuel , and a proposal for a redistribu - tion of the earth 's surface by a return of
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	to
France	LOCATION	and an expropriation of the German coal lands west of the
Rhine	LOCATION	, with a com - pensating free hand to
Germany	LOCATION	in
Asia Minor	LOCATION	.

		The principle underlying this redistribution , neither clearly conceived nor expressed , is that of the equal - ity of economic opportunity for all peoples .

		, is to pass into a new dimen - sion .

		Relevant and near data are conspicuously absent .

		There is rhetoric and there is passion .

		Idi - osyncrasy is in play .

		The German is very cordially hated , and the hatred and the war of which he is the cause are somehow to be rationalized and abol - ished .

		Each writer must fit them into his own idiosyncratic system .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	' cosmic solvent is biology .

		Hence war is for him a biological phe - nomenon , and the peculiar perversity it shows in human `` warfare-by-arms '' is due to the fact that there is a disharmony between a brain originating in a quadrupedal organism and the biped it is running .

		After some centuries there will be an adjustment and that sort of war will end .

		Mr.
McLeod	PERSON	, again , is a Christian of some kind or other .

		He thinks that the only way to stop war is to change human nature .

		He declares that nothing can change hu - man nature except the gospel of Jesus Christ .

		If you reply that the gospel has been a longish time at the business , he answers that Jesus nowhere prom - ised that it would be a short time : `` unlike mechani - cal , spiritual forces work slowly . ''

		Then too the church , to which Jesus committed his gospel , has been perfidious and has mistaken its vocation , which is to make bad men good .

		With this Mr.
Keller	PERSON	, who is a sociologist , could not agree at all .

		He says that war is its own panacea against itself , and that the changes of society are impersonal , mechanical , automatic struggles , and result in ever larger group - ings which must end finally in an international `` peace-group . ''

		This war is a conflict between the `` international code '' that is , the rules of behavior of decent nations and the German code , which is a denial of the same .

		`` Societal '' law requires that this decaying code shall be utterly stamped out .

		Germany must be thoroughly whipped if an inter - national `` peace-group '' is to come about .

		We must not falter at the finish .

		The mechanism of the `` vast process '' of `` societal evolution '' requires it .

		Each of .

		these three writers has his own fashion of securing peace .

		His appeal can be only to those of his own idiosyncrasy .

		For in fashion , motley 's the only wear of motley natures .

		Some wear monochrome .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		1918 THE DIAL 309 The Morality of Sacrifice IHE FIRST YEAR of
France	LOCATION	's agony in the war was brightened by a crowd of bellicosely romantic young officers , as Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	calls them , who laid down their lives for their country in a chivalrous and passionate gesture that will keep their names alive .

		There is already a literature of the letters and journals which they wrote in the crash of battle and under the tension of anticipated death .

		Their spirit of `` superhuman severity which comes from being wholly consecrated to duty '' in - spired their friends as being the last flare of a tradition which went back to the aristocratic ideal - ism of the later courts under the old regime .

		This theme Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has taken up in his Three French Moralists -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , in which he has ad - miringly traced this uncritical and yet self-conscious military mysticism to the maxims and personal models with which the genius of La Rochefoucauld , La Bruyere , and
Vauvenargues	PERSON	have molded this fragment of the spirit of
France	LOCATION	.

		With his love for honor and the things of the soul , says Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	,
La Rochefoucauld	ORGANIZATION	rescued the spirit of
France	LOCATION	from the degradation and senseless brawls of the Fronde .

		With his feeling for democracy and for the grace - lessness of riches in a world of the impoverished and ignorant , La Bruyere prepared the way for the later humane trends of the `` enlightenment . ''

		And with his passion for `` la Gloire '' and his tolerance of hu - man frailty , Vauvenargues brought morality down to earth , and at the same time set a pure and sensi - tive personal ideal that proved irresistible to the finer youth of his time .

		These writers , with their austere wisdom , their chiseled reflections , started a moral tradition that has ever since profoundly af - fected whatever of French youth identified itself either by heritage or sentimentally with the aristo - cratic classes .

		And it is `` the last emphemeral beauty of this feeling '' the `` reflection of the glow which blazed in the hearts of young intellectual officers at the very beginning of the war '' that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has tried to catch and commemorate in his present essays .

		He regrets that it is now gone : `` there is nqw no feather worn in the cap , no white gloves grasp the sword . ''

		If the fervor and emotion are still there , they are `` at the bottom of the heart . ''

		For we know that the old gallantry has been sweated and blown out of
France	LOCATION	as it has been blown out of the other countries in the massacre of war .

		It is the common man of Le Feu who now sets the tone with his superhuman travail and patience .

		It is the day of the proletarian virtues , of the tradition of `` le peuple , '' of the mass struggles for freedom and for creative instead of servile labor that strain which has continued side by side in
France	LOCATION	with this tradi - tion of gallant sacrifice and of the sweetness of dying for one 's country .

		Against the background of this new spirit Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's theme has a certain archaic pathos .

		Our interest shifts from this old morality of sacrifice to the spirit of those moralists themselves three writers who will always intrigue us and whose minds can never lose their sanative sting .

		We ask ourselves : Are they really responsi - ble for the shaping of the later tradition of patriotic chivalry ?

		It is not so easy to engender Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's young heroes of
1914	DATE	directly from their writings .

		Some - thing has mixed the strain .

		Now the first reading of La Rochefoucauld is to most of us as much of a shocking experience as the first icy bath .

		He leaves the mind extremely suspicious whether there is any idea or cause worth dying for in a world where all the virtues and vices trail back to amour propre .

		Would he not have said that this `` magnificent com - bination of logic and violence , '' which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	describes as culminating in the resolute sacrifice of war , was the extremest form of self-love ?

		Would he not have said that `` duty '' was the form in which the individualist intelligent soul accepts the inevita - ble that is to annihilate him ?

		.

		Can you not imagine him putting it something like this ?

		The free spirit is never so free that it is not subtly in the power of its own society among which it lives .

		In crises such as war , where the nation is called upon by its leaders to act in unison and face privation and death in defense of what they call its sacred honor , the indi - vidual is suddenly confronted with the irresistible power of that society .

		Suffering and death at the hands of the enemy , or suffering and death at the hands of one 's coun - try 's institutions these are the stern alternatives pre - sented to the free spirit To the individual this sudden menace from what has been hitherto a benevolent pro- tecting herd must be intolerable if he once recognizes it .

		How can my spirit accept coercion in any such form ?

		It is the most wanton affront imaginable to my integrity , to my amour propre , to my sense of personal independ - ence .

		Yet unconsciously I know that it is insane to resist .

		I am so much entangled in the emotions of my society that the idea never comes fully to my consciousness that I might even resist .

		So in order to render palatable to my deepest amour propre this immitigable coercion , I make it my own .

		I go to meet it , I embrace it , I call it `` duty , '' and I maintain that it was my desire all along .

		The world has only demanded of me what I was pas - sionately eager to give .

		My `` thy will be done '' thus becomes the intensest form of personal pride .

		It is I , / .

		310 THE DIAL
October	DATE	who am laying down my life not fate or God or mis - fortune or my ruler who is snatching it from me .

		Under the guise of `` duty '' the bitter inevitable becomes my own imagined intensest will !

		In other words , does n't the technique of this classic French moral psychology disintegrate the mo - tives of that gallantry which it had its share in creating ?

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is no psychologist .

		He se - renely ignores the question whether La Rochefoucauld would not have remorselessly stripped the glamour from what
Nietzsche	PERSON	would call the `` detour to sui - cide '' commemorated in this book .

		But the result is that the book falls into two parts : one , his beauti - ful tributes to the young idealists who died so joy - fully ; and the other , his charming monographs on the three moralists .

		Vauvenargues he makes espe - cially his hero in the argument linking this modern gallantry to the old moralists .

		And it is true that this most unfortunate yet sweetest of lives racked by every evil of disease , loneliness , and poverty , yet shining with the most winning clarity of mind and of gracious spirit is an unforgetable model for youth .

		He is the writer who said , as Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	loves to remind us : `` The earliest days of
spring	DATE	have less charm than the budding virtue of a young man . ''

		But actually in his maxims
Vauvenargues	PERSON	is far closer to La Rochefoucauld than to the mys - ticism of the modern French youth .

		Take reflec - tions like these : Men are persuaded only by fear and hope .

		The short duration of life is able neither to dissuade us from its pleasures nor console us for its pains .

		The art of pleasing is the art of deceiving .

		We have neither the force nor the opportunities to accomplish all the good and all the evil we project .

		The suavity of these sentences does not save them from a certain cutting edge that reminds us only of the impish and cynical duke of the court of Louis XIII .

		In his Counsels to a Young Man
Vauvenar	PERSON	- gues adds : We rarely judge things by what they are in themselves ; we blush not for vice but for dishonor .

		And in that light irony which is perhaps the highest wisdom he tells his friend that it is the essence of the mind to deceive itself ; the heart has also its errors .

		Before we are ashamed at being weak , we should be less unreasonable if we blushed for being men .

		The psychology of Vauvenargues is altogether witty and revealing , but is it not too penetrating to produce at first hand an unreserved frenzy of patri - otic mysticism ?

		These great moralists of the past were the most ruthless of realists .

		Their lucid in - telligence makes not altogether congenial the rhe - torical flourishes and uncomplicated sentiments of young men like the poet who `` bid his comrades describe him to his father and mother as ` tombe au champ d'honneur et mort joyeusement pour son pays . ' ''

		It is true that
Vauvenargues	PERSON	died uncom - plainingly at thirty-two from disease contracted years before , during the horrors of a winter retreat in one of those idiotic campaigns of Louis XV 's government .

		But the
State	ORGANIZATION	to him was something incalculable like the weather .

		He reserved his pas - sion for the personal life of conduct , tastes , and sentiments .

		It was upon the individual that his mind played , and the individual whom he dissected and encouraged with such delicacy and highminded - ' ness .

		`` Glory '' to him was more than victory , more than sacrifice .

		It was the cultivation of a high per - sonal excellence that should meet a calm and con - vinced approval reflected in the society among which one lived .

		If these moralists , in their terrible love of truth , their passion for sincerity , represent the truest aris - tocracy of mind , then in this military mysticism of
1914	DATE	there is something softer than they , less tri - umphant , less pure .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	himself suggests for this last gallantry of
France	LOCATION	a less remote source .

		He speaks of the relief that the war brought to her youth in a `` new comprehension of the unity of life . ''

		`` War had become , '' he says , `` what dogmatic re - ligion is to a weak soul tossed about by waves of doubt . ''

		In that younger generation `` life had been producing upon their consciences a sense of compli - cations , a tangle of too many problems .

		Now they might , and did , cheerfully relinquish the effort to solve them . ''

		Was their tangle perhaps due to their evasion of just those resolute democratic currents of their time that now are triumphing ?

		So that the nationalism and religion on which they had to fall back could teach them only to die and not to live ?

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is even less of a sociologist than he is a psychologist .

		His purpose is not to make us wonder how a moral tradition that began with the sternest facing of life , and with working out into polished wisdom the ex - perience of courageous minds , could end in a spirit that courted death in war because its vision was too weak to untangle the world that confronted it .

		He wants only to make us feel the esthetic charm of that sacrifice .

		And he is right and beautifully persuasive .

		He has paid his tribute of love to the gallant soldiers , and he has given us essays on the great moralists which are the flower of a familiar and informing criticism .

		RANDOLPH
BOURNE	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL
CLARENCE BRITTEN GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS SCOFIELD THAYER HELEN MAROT	PERSON	JUoES AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION SUPPORT THE idea of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	?

		To many the ques - tion itself may seem impertinent skepticism in view of President
Wilson	PERSON	's clear and persuasive exposi - tion , in his recent Liberty Loan speech , of our com - mitment to the creation of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	as our central and dominating purpose in this war .

		But we raise the question only to help in making sure that the answer will be in the affirmative .

		Just because the President has made the creation of such a League of supreme importance and rightly so it is the part of wisdom to recognize the forces which are subtly and openly attempting to make the idea mere empty rhetoric .

		It is folly for liberals blandly to assume that a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will come into existence by a sort of spontaneous political genera - tion ; in fact , the fight for it has just begun .

		And with the close of formal hostilities the struggle will become genuine .

		Perhaps the subtlest form of attack is the current form damning with faint praise .

		Today everybody believes in a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	precisely because nobody takes it seriously .

		But tomorrow or the day after we shall have to take it seriously , because President
Wilson	PERSON	will compel us to .

		Will everybody believe in it then when it is a reality rather than a pleasant gesture towards Utopia ?

		We have no assurance .

		Public opinion today probably supports it almost in proportion to its failure to understand what a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	implies .

		It has all the war-time prestige of the President himself behind it .

		But when peace comes , those who during the war have so ill restrained their contempt for the President will vent all their suppressed spite on his programme for rehabilitation of the world 's shattered political and economic structures .

		Worst of all , the acceptance by
Germany	LOCATION	of the idea will be used against it , for whatever issues from that unhappy country for some time to come will be tainted with suspicion .

		There will be ingenious fanatics ready to prove that , whatever happens , the world remains full of horrible dangers to the soil and happiness of these
United States	LOCATION	, and that we must under any circum - stances remain armed to the teeth .

		The re - actionaries will control a large section of the public press and they will exploit this advantage to the utmost .

		Great financial and industrial interests will instinctively rally to the defense of all the eco - nomic and trade advantages which the war has brought us , and they will drag with them large sec - tions of the thoughtless labor which sees in these in - creased advantages increased wages for itself .

		Un - like the European reaction , whatever liberalizing effect our returned soldiers may have on political issues will come too late to modify radically the nature of that momentous treaty of peace which will be signed long before the last soldier is demo - bilized .

		Furthermore , although the logic and fact of international economic interdependence may strike the intellectual as the merest of ratiocinative a b c , the emotions which cluster around our tra - ditional isolation still exist in some measure .

		Most of our statesmen and official public leaders will re - linquish the notion of complete national sovereignty only with their dying breath ; as long as they can they will play on these emotions they know no others .

		All this is the black side of the American picture .

		Against it we can put only President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		But if he has to play a lone hand , if he has to try to incorporate his program with his own country apathetic where not hostile , how great are his chances of success , even with the peoples of other countries behind him ?

		It seems to us his chances are slim chances on which no American liberal can afford to rely .

		It is a pity that liberal opinion in this country has too often been identified with anti-war opinion , and thus to a great extent discredited sometimes with the seeming approval of departmental Tories .

		Recrimination now how - ever is petty .

		The issue is immediate and urgent .

		Shall President
Wilson	PERSON	have whole-hearted support from American opinion when he attempts to put through his liberal program for a League of Na - tions ?

		The answer rests with the liberals , who today seem to be hypnotized into thinking that every - thing is coming out all right anyway .

		But every - thing is not coming out all right unless we fight for it .

		Already the attack against a League of Na - tions has formally begun in the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	and in such typically militaristic newspapers as
The New York Tribune	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even among certain intel - lectuals of the
John Bassett Moore	PERSON	type the ancient wisdom plucks up courage to inform us that man does not change , except possibly for the worse , and that therefore to hope to abolish conflict by any such ` shaky machinery as a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is merely an amiable illusion characteristic of all wars .

		It is high time for the counter attack to begin .

		312 THE DIAL
October 19	DATE	UNFORTUNATELY MOST PEOPLE IN
THE UNITED States	LOCATION	still believe it is possible for us to maintain an industrial machinery which is competent for our purposes without bothering about that intensive cul - tivation of industrial enterprise which was necessary in
Germany	LOCATION	and is now imperative in
England	LOCATION	.

		We still believe that we stand a chance of competing successfully for foreign markets and of retaining our war trade prizes without the reorganization that other nations are attempting .

		We are still domi - nated by the laissez-faire tradition .

		Consequently the real difficulty in reorganization and in selecting leadership for fundamental social change is inherent in the situation .

		Business men , for instance , want a business man to head any government after-the-war planning commission which may be created .

		Their qualification , to them of course self-evident , is their experience in promoting business .

		In the world before the war , promoting business and producing wealth were one and the same thing , and so were promoting business and producing profits .

		Today we are told , as Mr.
Frederick	PERSON	tells us on another page , that the business man is changing and his vision extending .

		It is hinted that he wants to produce for the good of society which must mean that he wants to produce for those who most need goods , and to sell at the lowest possible cost con - sistent with social economy .

		If this is the sort of business man the war has evolved , he should by all means be given the leadership in industrial organiza - tion .

		Certainly if President
Wilson	PERSON	has the ap - pointment of a
Reconstruction Commission	ORGANIZATION	and names a business man as leader , the appointee will have to be one of the new variety .

		If the President wins out in his stated policy , this appointee of neces - sity would be a man who sees the trade of tomorrow in terms of world instead of business economy , na - tional or private .

		Although we fully recognize the sincerity of those who believe in this new type of business man , shall we be thought ungenerous if we still maintain a certain skepticism concerning the completeness of the regeneration ?

		But , you say , will not labor supply us with the necessary leader - ship ?

		We recognize certain qualifications of the labor man which are not keenly appreciated by the business man .

		The labor man is more conscious than others of where industry , under the direction of business , has failed .

		The situation as a working and living proposition , for the mass of people who came under the direction of business , was about as iniquitous as any scheme of management that could be devised .

		And a consciousness of that fact is the first requisite for leadership in any social reorganiza - tion that will fulfill the high standards of the com - mon life which the President insists shall animate the rebuilding of our institutions .

		But we are pain - fully conscious that labor in
America	LOCATION	, organized and unorganized , has shown no disposition to direct the industrial renaissance which is to follow the war .

		It is obsessed by the thought that it must hold to what it has , and all energy is diverted to that end .

		Now if in the situation itself , if both in the business and labor world , the chances seem slim for the evo - lution of effective leadership , where are we to turn ?

		The leaders of any Federal reconstruction com - mission will after all be able to go only as far as unofficial organized public opinion and public action demand .

		That opinion is beginning to express itself .

		A business man 's convention on the subject of re - construction is all to the good .

		It is to be hoped that there will be a great national labor convention devoted to the same subject not a convention end - ing in futile resolutions , but a convention , through committees , of continuous performance .

		The In - stitutes of Architecture , various Chambers of Com - merce have established the
American City Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, which plans to tender the services of its committee to the government and to work on reconstruction measures .

		The ban against talking anything but war is lifting .

		Even the newspapers are beginning to report reconstruction activity .

		IHAT MORALE is IN ANY WAY WEAKENED BY TALK of reconstruction after the war is today an exploded myth .

		The pretty political race between the Over - man and Weeks resolutions for a committee on reconstruction problems is only the public and for - mal recognition of what has long been recognized privately .

		Perhaps the thinnest argument against talk about after-the-war problems was the argument that such discussion tended to divert soldiers ' minds from the severe immediate tasks of fighting .

		As a matter of fact almost the first thing the common soldier thinks about is what is going to happen to him after the war .

		A recent letter to The
New York World	LOCATION	, headed When the Soldiers Come Back to Work , illustrates our meaning : To the Editor of The World : In the issue of The World of
Sept. 22	DATE	appears a note under the heading After the War , in which the writer says : `` Following the usual conditions that obtain after a war , they will have to become tramps and beggars . ''

		He refers to our army and navy boys .

		After the war our boys will not have to become tramps or beggars , as labor of all kinds will be in demand .


G. A. R.	PERSON
New York	LOCATION	,
Sept. 25	DATE	Does this mean that the boys who come back are have good positions or be bossed by the slackers who have stayed home from war and taken the good positions ?

		Or are they to have their old jobs back or better ones ?

		A Man in the
U. S. Regulars	ORGANIZATION	.

		It ought to be obvious that no single fact can be more comforting to the man in the ranks than the known fact that plans are being made for his return home .

		The knowledge that he is coming back to a job , that the government does not intend to cast him adrift on the uncertain industrial world im - mediately following the war , stimulates and en - I
1918	DATE	THE DIAL courages the soldier even more than a laudatory paragraph in his home town newspaper .

		Further - more it makes him feel that he is a part of a social organization which regards his permanent welfare as as important as his fitness for service .

		Recon - struction plans of a genuine and far-reaching kind are the best possible aids to the soldiers ' morale .

		They are better men for these plans and better fighters .

		They have the dignity which comes to every man who is made to feel that he is of lasting social value .

		From the temper of the letter which t we quote it can be seen that reconstruction plans for the returned soldier must be a reality and not a sham .

		He will not tolerate mere grudging pat - ronage .

		J.HE RECENT ORDER OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT permitting soldiers to write for publication , because with the new draft `` practically all the literary talent of the country has been called into the service , '' has already evoked amused comments from some of our newspapers .

		Of course what impresses the editors ; of the daily press is that section of the order read - ing : `` Soldiers will not be permitted , however , to act as regular newspaper correspondents , nor to criticize conditions .

		Their output must contain nothing re - lating to the military profession , the war , or to current events . ''

		`` Under the absurd ` freedom ' of - fered by the new edict , '' remarks The
New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	petulantly , `` such works as Under Fire and In
Flanders Fields	ORGANIZATION	, or the memorable lines , I Have a Rendezvous With Death , would be impossible . ''

		The
Globe	ORGANIZATION	is correct .

		If an American soldier were to write a book like Under Fire , it would not only be impossible to get the volume published it would be dangerous even to try .

		But what strikes us par - ticularly in the new order is the assumption that most of the literary talent of the country has been called into service .

		Has the War Department for - gotten that almost fifty per cent of the literary talent in this country is revealed by our women writers ?

		And why were the claims of the writers between the ages of 21 and 31 of less urgency than those between the ages of 31 and 45 , and 18 and 21 ?

		Is -LSB- maturity of style and thought the test of literary talent ?

		We must confess that there are times when we wish the War Department 's assumption were founded on clear fact , and that it was literally true that practically all of the literary talent of the coun - try had been called into service , meaning by `` service '' military service in the strictest sense .

		For the truth is that literary talent never seemed to exist in such melancholy profusion as it does today .

		Never were pamphlets so abundant .

		Our Vigilantes and our
Defense Leagues	ORGANIZATION	and our Security Leagues seem to have no difficulty in finding all the literary talent they need .

		Hitherto quiet Cabinet members have become authors and writers of special articles .

		Every department in
Washington	LOCATION	resounds with the click 3f the typewriters of the publicity men .

		Thousands of `` stories '' are produced every day .

		Probably the War Department does not regard these products as literature : its standard of literature is set high .

		Literature consists of novels and plays and poetry written , of course , with no reference to the ephem - eral and uninteresting present but solely and se - verely in the light of the eternal verities .

		With so meticulous an order of excellence demanded ,
The Globe	ORGANIZATION	's suggestion remains sound .

		It advises our soldier writers to disport themselves with such pleas - ing effusions as An Ode to a Wild Thyme and An Epic on
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	.

		IHE COMING OF PEACE WILL BRING TO OUR SYSTEM of wealth production further changes than those which the war has already induced .

		But for the present at least it is unlikely that these changes will be as drastic as those that are taking place in Eng - land .

		They will be in the nature of revisions .

		Americans generally are not yet fully aware that fundamental reorganizations of our economic life are imperative : consequently we have no guarantee that the direction which these inevitable revisions will take may not be reactionary instead of pro- gressive .

		During the coming year THE DIAL hopes to indicate what direction is actually being taken and also , of course , what direction we consider de - sirable .

		Already we can see the outlines of what the desirable direction must be .

		We hope to record an increasing interest in wealth production as a national matter , in contradistinction to wealth pro- duction as a mere private adventure in gain , also an interest in wealth production as an international in contradistinction to a national concern .

		We further hope that labor organizations will work together with production efficiency managers toward a demo - cratic control of industry , and forestall state adminis - tration .

		In any case our interest in reconstruction will center not only in immediate problems , such as demobilization , but in the more permanent problems of organization : in labor status , trade union func - tion , industrial leadership , determination of cost of production , price , wage rates , the relation of in - dustry to the state and the function of the state it - self , the standardization of products , and the `` ra - tioning '' of essential trades .

		We shall be partic - ularly interested in the economic aspect of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, in the working out of machinery which contemplates the establishment of international banking and credit , in the distribution of goods on the basis of world economy , in an international merchant marine and waterways commission , and in the abolition of import duties .

		We shall also give attention to the reorganization of the schools , from the kindergarten to the universities , and to the ex - perimental work which the school and psychological laboratories are now undertaking .

		As economic problems underlie and give point to political prob - lems , we shall give the former somewhat fuller con - sideration .


October 19	DATE	Foreign Comment THE PRECIPICE Who today remembers Lord
Grey	PERSON	's warning to Prince Lichnowsky , late in
July 1914	DATE	, that a gen - eral European war might well produce `` another 1848 '' ?

		Perhaps the German autocrats today re - member it as their armies retreat and their people mutter their criticism of the war as `` the great swindle . ''

		But certainly few thought in those days and even fewer in
America	LOCATION	today think that the dire prophecy can possibly have any application to Eng - land .

		England of all countries , we feel , has too much political good sense ever to resort to the ex - pensive expedient of revolution in order to bring about imperative social changes .

		The political framework is elastic enough to permit of infinite adaptation : it is the admiration of more volatile peoples .

		Even under the pressure of war our con - ventional conceptions have not fundamentally changed , and the stories of English workers being on the whole better clothed and fed and housed than ever in
England	LOCATION	's peace-time history have been ac - cepted as a surprising but indubitable paradox of the great war .

		But in a remarkable editorial in the
September 14	DATE	issue of The
London	LOCATION	New Statesman that moderate journal asks some very disturbing questions .

		The editorial is called , ominously enough , The Precipice .

		For
1918	DATE	`` another 1848 '' would mean , the journal says , -LRB- as has been seen in
Russia	LOCATION	-RRB- not thrones alone that would be upset perhaps not thrones at all but that mysterious framework of the social order which contrives , in this country as in others , that nine-tenths of the accumulated wealth should be `` owned '' by one-tenth of the population , with the result that two-thirds of the population find themselves re - stricted , for their means of livelihood , to something like one-third of the common product annually .

		The rent and interest abstracted from each year 's product , irrespective of any contemporary service rendered by their recipients , account , perhaps , for something like another third , whilst the profits and salaries of the relatively small class which actually manages our concerns for us , or renders profes - sional services of one or other kind , probably amount to as much more .

		The net effect of the war , The New Statesman goes on , has been on the whole to aggravate the in - equality in the distribution of wealth as between the four-fifths of the population , on the one hand , who are spoken of as the masses , and the one-fifth of the population , on the other , who constitute the middle and upper classes .

		And it is the general principle of inequality which is exciting the present labor unrest in
England	LOCATION	.

		If we could take the manual working , wage-earning class as a whole , we might perhaps compute that there was , in the aggregate , now no diminution of their total real in - come , measured in commodities , as compared with that of five years ago .

		The data for any exact estimate do not exist .

		But it is not aggregates or averages that mat - ter to the individual or the particular group , just as the fairness and humanity of some , or even of a great ma - jority , of the employers fail to atone for the harshness , inconsiderateness , or tyranny of the worst of them .

		Where the shoe pinches there will be the pain .

		And what the wage-earning class is more than ever aware of is that it is , fundamentally , the monstrous inequality in the distri - bution of wealth , and the social autocracy which it per - mits , that is the cause of the wage earner 's penury .

		This conviction is reinforced by a sense of injustice and unfair treatment which is far more widespread and far more acute than optimistic observers drawn from the govern - ing class ever realise .

		The wage-earners , rightly or wrongly , feel that they have been `` done . ''

		The long - drawn-out struggle between the
Government Depart	ORGANIZATION	- ments , the employers and the Trade Unions , over the suspension of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	conditions , the `` dilution '' of skilled labour , the replacement of men by women , the successive war bonuses and advances has whether justi - fiably so or not produced the impression that the wage - earners have been cheated , and that they are destined to be further cheated ... Of course everyone recognizes that the social order can not be radically changed during the war itself , even though the governing classes are ad - mittedly at the mercy of the organized wage-earners .

		Unity will somehow or other be maintained as long as hostilities continue .

		But what of those days just around the corner ?

		It is when peace comes that we shall get to the verge of the precipice .

		The social pyramid , already topheavy , will find dumped upon it the immense load of war-debt , and the very considerable charge involved in Social Re - construction .

		Apparently no one outside
the Labour Party	ORGANIZATION	dares to face what will have to be done .

		Labour and the New Social Order the very explicit programme of
the Labour Party	ORGANIZATION	which describes how the task can be accomplished constitutionally , without `` Bolshevism , '' in fact , according to all the wisdom of the most orthodox economists , is so far unanswered , and without rival .

		Will either Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	or Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	tell us , in emula - tion of the
Labour Party	ORGANIZATION	, how they propose to discharge the war-debt , rebuild the social machinery , and maintain the
Standard of Life	ORGANIZATION	how they intend to secure the neces - sary increase in the production , not of profits , but of commodities and services , and at the same time provide anything like a genuine equality of opportunity , alike in home , health , education and the conditions for the train - ing and exercise of faculty without putting an end to that permanently unequal distribution of personal wealth which is involved in unrestricted inheritance , and to the colossal annual waste involved in the idle lives and sterilised brains that inevitably accompany the existence of a rentier class .

		BOYCOTTING
GERMANY	LOCATION	At a time when the proposal for boycotting Ger - many commercially after the war seems to be win - ning considerable popular support in this country , we can profit by examining the views of those who in the countries of our Allies have suffered incalcu - lably more from German military aggression than we so far have .

		Liberal opinion in
England	LOCATION	is al - most unanimously against the proposal .

		The Con - gress of Trade Unions , representing the reasoned labor opinion of that country , voted against it .


M. Albert Thomas	PERSON	, in many ways the most conservative of the French Socialists , has-r-in his recent discus - sion of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	in the columns of
The London Daily Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	cogently put the philo -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 3 * 5 sophical reasons for not excluding
Germany	LOCATION	from the League , even if the Hohenzollerns should not be deposed .

		The clearest and most forceful argument against the exclusion of
Germany	LOCATION	however is the argument presented by
The Manchester Guardian	ORGANIZATION	.

		The emotional appeal of the proposal is simple .

		Shall the guilty go unpunished ?

		But as The Guard - ian points out , it will be precisely the guilty and no other who will profit by the boycott :
Germany	LOCATION	under a boycott will resume military prepara - tions the moment peace is concluded .

		The people will not accept the offer of immunity from the boycott on con - dition of revolution .

		The very challenge will make them give up all talk of internal revolution .

		The dynasty will be safe , and all the people will feel that they must fight again for the bare necessities of a modern industrial and commercial existence .

		The paradoxical result of the de - sire to punish the guilty will be to preserve the most guilty , the heads of the nation , from punishment .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	felt justly that the economic question is part of the general problem of peace .

		If we fail to make the peace we want , then we shall relapse into a state of com - petition in which every effort will be made in both camps to strengthen their own and weaken the opposite party .

		To such a state of things the boycott is appropriate .

		If , on the other hand , we get the peace we desire , as we mean to do , then it must be a peace with all the conditions of permanence that is , a peace which contains no conditions against which one side is bound by the very necessities of its existence to revolt .

		Happily , President
Wilson	PERSON	in his speech of Sep - tember 27 put
America	LOCATION	squarely behind the policy of not boycotting
Germany	LOCATION	except specifically `` as the power of economic penalty by exclusion from the markets of the world may be vested in the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	itself as a means of discipline and control . ''

		Communications THE NATION 'S PROBLEM SIR : I am hopeful that the early recognition by THE DIAL and other intellectual forces of the coun - try of the necessity for hard thinking on the problem and social possibilities of reconstruction after the war will lead to the visualizing of this opportunity in a big way .

		One of the most hopeful things in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is the official reports which have al - ready been issued and the general attitude on the subject on the part of the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	,
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and organized agencies .

		There seems to be a realization that the soldier , the worker , and the civilian will never go back to the old order and that only through a big-visioned program of the state can the prob - lems be worked out .

		The problem is none the less acute in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It involves , aside from the mechanics of rehabilitation of the soldier and the worker , a mobilization of thought on education , on industry , on transportation , on farming on the kind of society we want for the future .

		Shall we send the soldier back to his old job in the mill and the mine ?

		shall we permit him to shift for himself ?

		shall we accept the old philosophy of individualism ?

		or shall we consciously build a new kind of state , aiming at industrial and economic liberty , the en - larging of the opportunities of the workers , the crea - tion of a partnership with capital , and especially the development of a big program of internal im - provements , including a nation-wide transportation system , the reclamation of waste lands , the develop - ment of hydro-electric power for the railroads , indus - trial , and social needs , the opening up of monopolized lands and forests , and the development of a new kind of agriculture that will make the back-to-the-land movement as alluring to the soldier and the worker as it is desirable ?

		America came to the end of an era just before the outbreak of the war , an era that began with the early colonists and ended with the enclosure of all of the lands and resources of the nation .

		We were ripe for a new political and social movement that would make permanent the best traditions of the country and would reopen the owned but only touched resources of the country to the present gen - eration a generation condemned by necessity to the position of wage-earner , tenant , or agricultural worker by the ending of that freedom of access to the land which has been the characteristic feature of
America	LOCATION	since the first settler landed in
New England	LOCATION	three centuries ago down to the enclosure of the public domain .

		The problem is thus an economic one .

		It is also educational .

		And it can only be carried through by the nation .

		It is an obligation not only to the soldier but to the future that the reconstruction which follows shall be directed by a definite ideal of what democracy should mean to a free people .

		FAMILY-ALBUM AMERICANISM SIR : Mr.
Devere Allen	PERSON	does not realize how much I like the tone , if not the substance , of his article in THE DIAL of
October 5	DATE	.

		If he had writ - ten my letter , I might have written his , with a few changes .

		In some of these matters the tone is essen - tial , and goes farther into legislation than he realizes .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	is apparently an American , of the old school , with a family album .

		As such I welcome him to the ranks of the American radicals .

		We need more such , to overcome the present overwhelm - ing majority of hyphenates .

		I hope he brings all the live people that are in the album with him , and puts them in control of all our fire-eating societies .

		They do not need to be Daughters and Sons of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Simply to have been in some - body 's family album is sufficient .

		Few of our really sizzling leaders of political thought have been in
America	LOCATION	long enough for that achievement .

		Some of them have not even waited to get their photo - graphs upon the parlor mantles , or into the local papers , experiences I deem essential to a genuine political insight .

		316 THE DIAL
October 19	DATE	* Notes on New Books THE SUNNY SOUTH AND ITS PEOPLE .

		By
C. W. Johnston	PERSON	.

		Rand McNally ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		As a compilation of facts regarding numerous towns and villages south of
Mason	PERSON	and
Dixon	PERSON	's line , this book can truthfully be said to have a modi - cum of reference value , but so hidden are the data among inconsequential observations , inappropriate comments , and futile rhetoric that the reader must exercise extraordinary forbearance .

		The author 's asides are sententious and often amusing , taking the form of homilies on honesty , diatribes against tip - ping , and justification of war .

		Of Fortress
Monroe	PERSON	he says : `` Fortress
Monroe	PERSON	is located on a beautiful body of water
Hampton Roads	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is very old and fully a mile long . ''

		That is a fair indication of what the book is like .

		HANDBOOK OF FURNITURE STYLES .

		By
Wal	PERSON	-
ter A. Dyer	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Here is a brief and admirable manual on furni - ture periods , and one which quite satisfactorily ful - fills its author 's desire to meet the need for a `` primer of a fascinating and useful study . ''

		Without any attempt to be exhaustive it contrives to cover the field with much skill , both in the selection and ar - rangement of material and in the choice of illustra - tions to supplement the text .

		Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	succeeds in a lucid exposition of the various periods , showing what influences brought them into existence and what other influences caused them to be displaced .

		To those who are familiar with the field , the book may bring nothing new , but within the scope of its intention ' it is well executed .

		The author has avoided the dangers of too much elaboration and the equally deplorable error of sketchiness .

		Not only does he survey the historical periods , but in the last chapter he does not hesitate to bring American styles right down to date .

		One is pleased to find him disposing of mission furniture in half a sentence .

		The volume includes a brief bibliography , and a table of styles showing the sovereigns , the leading craftsmen , structural details , and significant pieces .

		THE HEART OF
ALSACE	LOCATION	.

		By
Benjamin Vallotton	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It is impossible to imagine a more effective piece of propaganda for the Alsatian cause than this novel by a Swiss who spent twelve years in
Alsace	LOCATION	.

		He does not press his point or rail against the German rulers .

		But he pictures in innumerable incidents , and with the most sensitive feeling for the charm of the country , the life of suppressed passion which those villagers live that retain all their old fondness and loyalty to
France	LOCATION	.

		It is not so much brutal oppression that these Alsatians experience from their uncongenial overlords as the endless spying and fer - reting , the endless vigilance of a German machine faithful to its dogged conception of power and blinded by its own strength .

		The story revolves around the work of a young schoolmaster who comes to an Alsatian village from
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		He meets the families of the notables , both the petty German functionaries who preach a continual Deutschtum , and the old stock with German names but with an incorrigible adoration for
France	LOCATION	.

		Their occasional excursions to some French village over the border are like breaths of fresh air .

		And when the war comes , the great tragedy is that some of the youth have been absorbed into the German military ma - chine and are either lost in the snows of
Poland	LOCATION	or fighting against their beloved
France	LOCATION	.

		What the initial invasion of the French into
Alsace	LOCATION	meant to the inhabitants of the villages in the path of the long-desired liberation is told in touching letters from some of the young French soldiers who had relatives there .

		The long drama of forty-four years is rounded out by this jubilant restoration .

		They were only a few villages , but they were the symbol of release from the hateful regime that heretofore they could only ridicule and mildly insult but never oppose .

		Yet there is a note of tenderness in the book , as if to imply that the barriers between these plain French and German people of
Alsace	LOCATION	are large - ly the artificial product of government , and that when governmental justice has been done , all may enjoy in a new friendliness that lovely land .

		MEMOIRS OF MERCY ARGENTEAU .

		Trans - lated and edited with an introduction by
George S. Hellman	PERSON	.

		2 vols .

		Putnam ;
$ 10	MONEY	.

		Two brief manuscripts left by Count Mercy d'Argenteau , and never before printed , have been translated and published in these two beautiful vol - umes .

		The memoirs do not make a continuous ac - count of the author 's life , but deal with two distinct periods in his career the period of his service in the household of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, and the period of his service under
King William of Holland	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first volume is the less important of the two , being no more than a sketchy and conventional relation of unimportant episodes and incidents .

		It adds nothing to our knowledge of
Napoleon	PERSON	, and will be of use only to the biographer , if ever one is needed , of this diligent but politically negligible servant of the Emperor .

		The second volume has a greater historical value .

		It is concerned chiefly with the author 's unavailing ef - forts , in
1830	DATE	, to bring the stubborn Dutch king to adopt a policy in dealing with
Belgium	LOCATION	that might conceivably have prevented the Revolution .

		Students of the Belgian Revolution , and students of the
July Revolution	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, will find this volume of some use .

		The introductions by Mr.
Hellman	PERSON	, nearly as long in the case of the first volume as the memoir itself , give all necessary information about the author and his manuscripts , and place a far higher estimate upon the services of the one and the value of the other than thev deserve .

		1918 THE DIAL 3 1 ?

		WISCONSIN PLAYS : Second Series The Feast of the Holy Innocents , by
S. Marshall Ilsley	ORGANIZATION	; On the Pier , by
Laura Sherry	PERSON	; The Shadow , by
Howard Mumford Jones	ORGANIZATION	; We Live Again , by
Thornton Oilman	ORGANIZATION	.

		Introduction by
Zona Gale	ORGANIZATION	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		No other band of workers in our little theaters has justified higher expectations than the
Wisconsin Dramatic Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their productions managed , staged , and acted by enthusiastic , serious-minded amateurs have deserved and have won the support of all classes of their public .

		The wholesome educa - tional influence of these productions for a better appreciation of good drama has been effectively sec - onded by the public meetings of the Society , by its publications , by lectures held under its auspices .

		The policy of encouraging new playwrights , especially
Wisconsin	LOCATION	playwrights , is a definite expression of the hope that our little theaters will be schools for American dramatists .

		In the first , fine meaning of the word the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Dramatic has been `` popular '' both in its aims and its achievements , and a host of sympathetic friends all over
America	LOCATION	look to this distinctly
Middle West	LOCATION	organization for guidance and inspiration .

		The disappointment of these admirers in the Second Series of the
Wiscon	PERSON	- sin Plays will be great .

		Instead of fulfilling our high expectations , three of the four plays in this volume confirm the most skeptical fears of sundry unfriendly critics of the little theaters .

		They are not only commonplace in conception , but also immature in expression , and even faulty in construction .

		Perhaps it is most just to consider them as examples of exercises from the | primary grade in the school of play-writing , but only a doting parent could find in them any promise for the future .

		The single play of distinction in the book is The Shadow .

		There is a real thought behind this pretty little fantasy , and Mr.
Jones	PERSON	has most skilfully woven the atmosphere of his autumnal woods setting into the allegory of Memory .

		The final effect achieved is worthy of warmest praise , and it is to be hoped that the play will be popular with competent little-theater companies .

		The signal success of
The Shadow	ORGANIZATION	emphasizes the fact that it is the only play of this volume that is not realistic in spirit and local in genre .

		In view of the romantic tendencies of the little theaters this may not be a coincidence .

		At least Mr.
Jones	PERSON	points a way by which little-theater playwrights may avoid provin - cialism and the deadly lack of dramatic interest provided they possess his imagination and charm of expression .

		SIMBA .

		By
Stewart Edward White	ORGANIZATION	.

		Double - day , Page ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	.

		After two voyages to the land of
Livingstone	PERSON	and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
White	PERSON	has become sufficiently at home in
Africa	LOCATION	to invite his readers to go along with him .

		Among the savage tribes that inhabit what he calls the last frontier of the race , and who `` grinned ami - ably , and promised lavishly , and sat in the sun , '' it is the fortunes of the lad Simba which make the story .

		A splendid young fellow of whom any civili - zation might be proud , he progresses from the naked village boy sucking a sugar-cane in the first chapter to become gunbearer to
Cunningham	PERSON	, the great ele - phant hunter , and to meet the white man 's civiliza - tion in the coast towns .

		Naturally the mingling of whites and blacks gives opportunity for considerable chiaroscuro effect .

		The book is one of vivid con - trasts .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's genuine appreciation of the native African precludes that jocose condescension , customary in the usual writer of southern travels .

		His sense of humor however can not overlook the ubiquitous race of medicine men , nor the perplexities of European officials in the fade of local traditions and taboos .

		Unexpectedly , though frequently enough , one comes upon a turn like the following which flashes up a whole scene .

		In stumbling upon his first herd of browsing elephants Simba `` listened with something approaching awe to the thunder-like rumblings of digestion . ''

		And the first newly ar - rived white tourists looked to him `` anaemic , blood - less , like grubs dug out of a log . ''

		If Mr.
White	PERSON	must be compared to
Kipling	LOCATION	, it is to the
Kipling of Kim	ORGANIZATION	, with its rich sympathies , rather than to the caustic writer of Plain Tales .

		LES DESSOUS DU CONGRES DE
VIENNE	LOCATION	.

		By Commandant
Weil	PERSON	.

		Payot ,
Paris	LOCATION	; 20 f .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	has been the recipient latterly of many uncomplimentary remarks from our American publicists , official or unofficial .

		In some cases there seems to have been a little uncertainty as to when the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was held , or why , but as the rigor of the proffered condemnation of its conduct has not thereby been abated , no ethical injury has been done our people .

		Indeed the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has tended to supplant the French Revolution , at least temporarily , as a term of general opprobrium .

		It is perhaps just as well that our diplomatic millenarians have not known the things revealed in these two portly volumes , or the clamor of outraged morality might have become excessive and rather trying .

		Commandant
Weil	PERSON	has produced a fresh , interesting , and valuable work .

		He has patiently ransacked the archives of
Vienna	LOCATION	and has faithfully transcribed nearly three thousand letters , reports , and memo - randa concerning the activities of the innumerable diplomatic agents of high or low degree who con - verged upon
Vienna	LOCATION	in the
summer of 1814	DATE	, only to leave it , when they had done their utmost , a few days before
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		The documents here printed fill fifteen hundred pages and they are derived from the
Austrian Ministry of Police and Censorship	ORGANIZATION	, over which presided , in
1814	DATE	and
1815	DATE	, a most urbane and competent man ,
Baron Hager	PERSON	, who deserves 3 i8 THE DIAL
October	DATE	mention even in an age rendered illustrious by a
Fouche	ORGANIZATION	.


Hager	PERSON	was a sublimated chief of police and he performed his duties to the king 's taste , or rather to the taste of the Emperor ,
Francis II	PERSON	.


Francis	PERSON	was the host to all the highnesses and notables who thronged his capital during the many months of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and it must be said that he met the demands of the situation in large and lavish fashion .

		No monarch was ever more imperially hos - pitable .

		Endless were the amusements and diver - sions provided by the Court of
Vienna	LOCATION	to those who had crowded within its gates , and almost endless was the expense , blithely contracted by a state which was practically bankrupt .

		But while open-handed and profuse in social ways , neither
Francis	PERSON	nor his minister , Prince
Metternich	PERSON	, was off his guard .

		Each was reasonably sophisticated .

		The host knew that he had with him a miscellaneous set of guests whom he had not himself selected but who had been thrust upon him .

		Consequently he instructed his police to keep a sharp watch over them all , from the Emperor of
Russia	LOCATION	down to the charge d'affaires of the most insignificant German principality .

		The Austrian secret police , presided over by
Baron Hager	PERSON	, shadowed everyone connected with the Con - gress , using means known to the profession to get information as to the goings and comings , the do - ings and sayings , the intentions and connections of all these agents engaged in the diplomatic hurly - burly .

		It was an espionage of the high-born , as elaborate as it was ingenious and ubiquitous .

		The laws of hospitality did not preclude the opening of letters by the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	, the filching of documents from the persons of special messengers , the placing of government spies as servants in the houses of the diplomatists , in the desire to find out what all these people were up to .

		The methods were as shameless as they needed to be , no more .

		Every morning all this information arranged , docketed , classified was laid before the Emperor by
Baron Hager	PERSON	, and the Emperor enjoyed it .

		It was his idea of statecraft and it was within the range of his intellectual powers .

		This is the material that has now been published by Commandant
Weil	PERSON	.

		It makes very curious and interesting reading .

		It is really a source-book in the intrigues , rumors , slanders , scandals , the backbiting , and eavesdropping characteristic of the mighty and their hangers-on at a great international assembly .

		Virtue itself escaped not calumny in that happy age .

		These volumes present the seamy side of history , and as history has that side , it may as well be looked at serenely and intently .

		They also present much that is not seamy .

		They give us a kind of gossip de luxe connected with great persons , great problems , and a great historic occasion .

		They enable us a little to see history in the process of making .

		The process is not complete ; the materials are fragmentary and not always of the most authentic quality ; yet of such stuff are the annals of our race , in part , made up .

		Mr.
Weil	PERSON	has produced a vivid book and he has proved himself a model editor , sparing no pains to give the reader every possible aid to a comprehension of the documents .

		His biographical and historical notes are numerous , adequate , and illuminating , and they must have been the product , in very many cases , of extensive and difficult research .

		Such painstaking thoroughness is entitled to the reader 's lively grati - tude .

		OVER THE THRESHOLD OF WAR .

		By
Nevil Monroe Hopkins	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		There is one rather thrilling description among these reminiscences that shows the author under fire .

		Although a minor diplomatic officer , he had taken advantage of being registered with the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	to see what was being done at the front , and he arrived during the retreat from
Mons	LOCATION	.

		Fortunately for him , he was with a battery that was able to re - pulse a German attack , and he lived to tell the tale in a book that otherwise is as commonplace in sub - ject matter as it is sumptuous in format .

		Mr.
Hop	PERSON	- kins ' observations are at least an indication , how - ever , that he had a remarkably interesting though not altogether comfortable time watching frenzied Americans trying to get the first boat home , Ger - man airplanes raiding
Paris	LOCATION	, infuriated Parisians smashing German shops , and many other urban and suburban activities incident to the beginning of the great war .

		His experiences also included a trip to
Berlin	LOCATION	and the conquered portion of
Belgium	LOCATION	, and the inevitable arrest as a suspected spy .

		To most Americans
Portugal	LOCATION	is an unknown land * Lately , impelled in great measure because of trade possibilities with
South America	LOCATION	, our ignorance of things Spanish and South American has been some - what lessened ; we are beginning to discover , with no little surprise , that the continent to the south of ours , despite the many handicaps under which authorship labors , has produced a surprising array of literary creators .

		As to
Portugal	LOCATION	and
Brazil	LOCATION	however we are as much in the dark as ever .

		We do not realize the great distinction between the Spaniards and Portuguese , nor the significance of a better under - standing of the latter .

		Were it from a purely com - mercial point of view alone this is an error ; for
Brazil	LOCATION	, the language of which is Portuguese , forms an appreciable part of
South America	LOCATION	and has devel - oped a most interesting literature of its own .

		It is of minor importance that Mr.

King Dinis	PERSON	-LRB- 1261-1325 -RRB- , Nun ' Al - varez -LRB- 1360-1431 -RRB- , Prince Henry the Navigator -LRB- 1394-1460 -RRB- , Vasco da Gama -LRB- 1460 ?

Castro	PERSON	-LRB- 1500-1548 -RRB- .

		The various accounts read much like a connected historical narrative , since the men chosen represent successive steps in the evolution of the Portuguese nation .

		One receives a marked impres - sion of certain national characteristics rude bravery , deep pride , indomitable persistence .

		`` And some - thing of their spirit survives in the
Portugal	LOCATION	of to - day , '' Bell tells us , `` ready to reappear at a crisis more of it , perhaps , than is generally imagined . ''

		To a modern , of course , in all these virtues there is a large admixture of vices ; and it is easy to note , although Mr.
Bell	PERSON	seeks to place no emphasis upon the point , what a distinctly commercial background lurked behind the historical conquests .

		The portraits are done in soft , even colors ; there are no violent contrasts ; one can easily imagine that the dust of the ages has gathered on the canvases and given them a strange mellowness .

		Mr.
Bell	PERSON	may be sure that a small but enthusiastic public will welcome another series , and yet another .

		The scant literature in English about matters Portuguese is a slight to the European nation and a discredit to ours .


England	LOCATION	, whence comes this book , is fast remedying the defect , chiefly through the admirable work of such writers as
A. F. G. Bell	PERSON	and
George Young	PERSON	.

		PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA AND THE WAR .

		By
Hereward Carrington	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		That the war is for many of the belligerents a reversion to a primitive state of mind , leaving only the primal instincts and the intensity of action necessary for self-defense , is a thesis which Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	illustrates in his accounts of the psychol - ogy of the soldier .

		That the same process goes on in a revival of credulity and the rebirth of cruder beliefs is a thesis that singularly escapes him .

		A more baneful book , spreading darkness where even a feeble light would throw a glimmer of guidance , it is difficult to imagine .

		The `` normal '' part gives some account of Teutonic lack of insight , and some interesting instances of the change of mind and heart in the transformation of civilians into soldiers , and in the removal from shop or office to the trenches .

		The `` supernormal '' part is a top-heavy assemblage of the occult applied to war .

		It in - cludes everything uncritically prophecies , premoni - tions , spirit-communications , apparitions , coinci - dences , and all the rest of the telepathic artillery , which is as shell-proof as it is reason-proof and can be riddled to a frazzle and yet stay whole .

		Surely we could have been spared this in war time ; and doubtless one does it too much honor to give it notice .

		Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	has taken part in exposing mediums and warns his readers against fraud ; yet there are always black swans , and these carry him floating to the regions where common sense does not reach .

		Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	devoted a book to
Eusapia Palladino	PERSON	as the `` blackest '' of the swans .

		When she proved to be of the same color as the rest of her tribe Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	-LRB- apparently -RRB- retained his faith , indeed enlarged it , so that now his appetite for marvels knows no bounds .

		To set forth this mixture of credulity and obscurantism as science is an insult and an injury .

		It suggests the necessity for
Hoover	PERSON	- izing on paper and print : the mental food-commis - sioner is a growing need .

Dorothy Can	PERSON	- field .

		Holt ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		It is as if some newspaper reporter , unusually sen - sitive to qualities and values , had listened to many people telling of themselves refugees , American war workers for sweet snobbery 's sake , homeless and maimed French soldiers and had set down with fidelity eked out by imagination what they had said and something of the way they said it .

		That is the impression one has of Mrs.
Fisher	PERSON	's book .

		At times she is the interpreter of French ways to Americans .

		Her Notes From a French Village are a record of French communal living , of high-enclosed gardens , of deep-rooted customs as a soldier boy from
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia ,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, or
Virginia	LOCATION	might see them .

		Ir a parable , too , she has contrasted the French savor of life and feeling for individuality and quality - things in life which must be taken leisurely wit American insistence upon vast change for its o \ sometimes meaningless sake .

		The parable has fir spots of detail , as in the words of the old Frenchman , among his roses , spoken to a restless American visi - tor : `` My friend , humanity as a whole will never be more than the lives of its individuals are worth , and takes many , many things to make individual lives worth while .

		It takes a mixture , and it needs , among other elements , some quiet , some peace , some leisure , some occupation with things of pure beauty like my roses , some fellowship with great minds of the past . ''

		Sometimes Mrs.
Fisher	PERSON	turns romanticist and imag - ines a Lord and Lady Bountiful , in
Paris	LOCATION	on their honeymoon , who do nothing but understand every - one 's wants and give vast sums of money just where they are most desperately needed .

		Again there are studies from life at the rear , in which she reports simply her conversations with the French soldier on furlough from the hospital or the trenches .

		There are several studies in realism : the story of the soldier who returned to his home to find it in ruins ; L Pharmacienne who turned from her life of domesti comfort to sweeping up the wreckage of her hus -

		A college professor is quoted as having said , with characteristic inaccuracy , that Mrs.
Fisher	PERSON	's book is the finest American work of fiction since the war .

		There is too much that is typical in her book , too much that could be and has been corroborated in the way of experience .

		Mrs.
Wheeler	PERSON	has here in some four hundred pages demonstrated the truth of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's epigram .

		It is an excellent and conscientiously thorough demonstration , whose principal fault is that very few of its readers will have the good fortune to be relatives , friends , or contemporaries of the author .

		For these reminis - cences are of the type whose appeal is restricted : both the general reader and the seeker for daring and highly individualized literature will experience a certain impolite dissatisfaction with the various and exceedingly innocent relics presented to his gaze by this woman whose family , as she herself confesses , was a hundred years behind the times .

		COLETTE BAUDOCHE .

		By
Maurice Barres	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Frances Wilson Huard	PERSON	.


$ 1.50	MONEY	.


Maurice Barres	PERSON	, who under the mask of his sophisticated and highly intellectualized modern cul - ture conceals the El Greco-esque features of a tenth century crusader , here gives us a theme very well suited to his unctuous and pontifical soul
Lorraine	PERSON	after the German occupation .

		The book , which one fears to call a novel , was written originally in
1908	DATE	, with the intention of combating the false optimism wherewith
Europe	LOCATION	was contemplating the after - effects of the Franco-Prussian War .

		It is now warmed over for American readers also to com - bat a false optimism ?

		Briefly the book is an attempt to symbolize the conflict of two opposed cultures .


Colette Baudoche	PERSON	, a native of
Lorraine	LOCATION	, lives with her grandmother in the old family residence in
Metz	LOCATION	.

		Both women are consecrated to their simple household duties ; both are continually remember - ing or dreaming about 1 ` ancien regime and regarding with a faint but insistent contempt everything Ger - man .

		To their house there comes , in search of rooms ,
Frederick Asmus	PERSON	a big , naive , enthusiastic , and conscientious Prussian professor .

		Filled with the desire to reconcile the lumbering automatism of his fatherland with the evasive and delicate move - ments of
Lorraine	LOCATION	's native culture , this pedagogue seeks in every way to gain the esteem of his hostess and her pretty granddaughter .

		The narration of these attempts takes up practically the whole book , and the author loses no opportunity for making the invidious comparison .

		Lorraine versus
Germany	LOCATION	: character , plot , description , even dialogue all are rigorously subordinated to this conception .

		It is done with great subtlety , and one admires the au - thor 's literary gymnastic , his powers of description , and his ability to portray the psychology of conqueror and vanquished .

		Nevertheless a reader sensitive to the artistic in literature becomes bored with the tone of advocate that runs through the pages : he begins to wish that everything were not so palpably , so ir - reconcilably either German or French ; and at the last , when
Colette	PERSON	, under the influence of the reli - gious ceremony in honor of the French heroes of

October 19	DATE	mus , he finds the work almost comic .

		Such a reader will close the book , saying : `` This is a homily in the grand style , a work written by one of those intellects which , descended from the medieval scholastics , have overcome the disease of religious theology only to fall into a kind of secular theology , full of a strange twi - light mysticism and vehemence .

		There is splendor in this theology , as in all things that are abstracted away from the crudities and contradictions of mere human existence : so long as men find necessary the idea of self-sacrifice this splendor of nationalistic idealism will also be necessary .

		Neverthe - less ... '' Nevertheless
Maurice Barres	PERSON	, for all his defects , is a powerful spokesman for a great mass of the French people .

		As a spokesman he naturally would no longer be able to impress or convince as an indi - vidual : his words and thoughts , like the dyer 's hands , must be subdued to the color they work in .

		For
Barres	PERSON	this color is
France	LOCATION	.

		As we watch him this one-time `` Enemy of the Laws , '' this `` Cultivator of Self '' pursuing the road which perhaps has al - ways been the one road for him , we can say , using his own words as applied to
Germany	LOCATION	, `` Nothing arouses our irony more than a master in whom we recognize real inferiorities . ''

		We will join him in this irony : we will place him among the conquerors of literature .

		WINGS IN
THE NIGHT	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Alice Duer Miller	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	is clearly a twentieth century prod - uct .

		She is ready to use the most everyday events as poetic material .

		She is deeply interested in the liberal movements which , before the war , were con - sidered symbolic of our progressive civilization .

		But she is not sufficiently practiced in poetic expression to be mistress of its finer subtleties .

		While her sub - jects are almost all novel , or at least modern in their setting , her models of technical excellence are to be found in the nineteenth century .

		And even their relative simplicity occasionally betrays her .

		The difficulty with most of Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's work is that the propagandist in her gets the better of the poet .

		It is not that her desire for freedom and her scornful protest against stupid custom and cupidity are not fit for poetry .

		It is rather that her train - ing as playwright and novelist has sharpened her sense of contrast and climax , and at the same time blunted the fervor which is the core of poetry .

		Her lyrics are clever rather than intense , pointed rather than poignant .

		For instance , there are the lines addressed to a certain gentleman who is opposed to woman suffrage on the score that `` women are often tempters to sexual sin and delight in it . ''

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	has small patience with this secure and self - righteous male , and her reply is none the less trench - ant for being calm .

		But a conviction , however ethically sound and profoundly believed , is not in itself the stuff of which poetry is made .

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	is at her best in the lower intensities .

		Her smiling scorn * bf meek conventionality is evinced in the History of a Minute .

		It is one of the sharp - est things in the book , both in its depiction of the `` lady with butter-colored hair '' and in the smooth terseness of its expression .

		Certain qualities stand out in Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's verse : a simplicity of diction , an ardent sincerity , a psy - chological acuteness .

		Her technique is obviously imperfect , and one has too often the feeling that she has fabricated rather than created a poem .

		But her gifts are not common , and a stronger passion , a firmer reliance on her sense of drama may together bring her far beyond the merely agreeable achieve - ment of the present volume .

		THE A FORTNIGHTLY The Approach to a League of Nations I N OFFICIAL communications regarding the war , the phrase `` Associated Governments '' frequently oc - curs .

		The mere fact that the
United States	LOCATION	is not technically an
Allied Government	ORGANIZATION	is doubtless the reason for the use of the phrase .

		It does not how - ever take a forced interpretation to find something significant in the term .

		`` Allies '' is filled with impli - cations of union for offense and defense .

		It is charged with the militaristic significance of the old order ; it conveys precisely that which the foreign policy of the
United States	LOCATION	has always avoided .

		For we have never been the `` Ally '' of any power .

		The term `` Associated '' suggests , on the contrary , the new order .

		It suggests union for the sake of com - mon ends and interests .

		Although military neces - sity gave it birth , its overtones are of the modern world of industry and commerce of voluntary cooperation among equals to attain results which concern all alike .

		The contrasting phrases may be used to indicate the two approaches to the future
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, one rooting in political needs , the other in economic necessities .

		The older conception was not only an expression of purely political traditions , but these traditions were inseparably connected with those military considerations which are the inevitable out - growth of a world of independent sovereign states whose sole official combinations with one another must perforce be directed , defensively or offensively , against some other combination of states .

		Not even Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	has ever said anything harsh enough about the delusions of those who would cultivate unpreparedness for war in a political world so con - stituted that the sole legally integrating factor among different nations is combination with respect to war .

		The earlier conception of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	as an arrangement whose main , if not sole , purpose was to `` enforce peace '' exhibits the same preoccupation , the same belated ideas .

		Those who are skeptical about the possibility of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, those who dwell upon all the difficulties which have to be met , generally carry over into their discussions legal-mindedness which reflects the old military-political system .

		And many of those who argue for it still ignore all the lessons of the war and revert to the notion of a combination whose chief trait would be an extension of the old
Hague Tribunal	ORGANIZATION	, provision for legal arbitrament plus agencies of conciliation , and , when needed , for enforcement of decisions by combined arms against a recalcitrant state .

		Yet if the war has made any - thing clear it is that such a scheme deals with effects not causes , symptoms not forces ; that it is negative not constructive , and doomed to fail , at some critical moment when most needed .

		The real problem is one of organization for more effective human association and intercourse .

		The newer poli - tics signify the social mind carried into questions of human relationships , while the older politics meant the formulations of the legal mind concerned with defense and litigation .

		Every statesman of the world today , every political thinker , can be categorically placed according as his plans and ideas are formed primarily in the negative terms of protection against opposition and threatening danger , or in the positive terms of association for realization of common inter - ests .

		Every passing day -LRB- and every passing year of the future -RRB- will make it clear that what distin - guishes President
Wilson	PERSON	from the other statesmen of the epoch is his prompt recognition that , given the conditions of modern life , no adequate defense and protection of the interests of peace can be found except in a policy based upon positive cooperation for interests which are so universal as to be mutual .

		This means that a system of ideas and activities which expresses contemporary industry and com - merce is being substituted for the ancient system which ignored and despised business and magnified the ethics and politics of dignity , honor , aggression , and defense .

		It is no accident that the formulation of the new order came from this country , which by the fortune of history and geography escaped most completely from the ethics of maintaining a status of established dignity , and which has com - mitted itself most completely to the ethics of indus - try and exchange .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's propositions have commended themselves to the average Amer - ican as a simple and almost matter of course , al - though unusually eloquent , statement of the very axioms of our own life .

		Only courtesy , the urgent need for American assistance , and a slowly grow - ing perception of the essential truth of what he says 342
November	DATE	a perception largely compelled by the increasing influence of industrial workers in the older countries have veiled their alien and `` idealistic '' character in the European countries .

		For the latter are con - trolled by the older ideas of personal alliance , instead of by the newer ideas of association in common activities .

		A
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	whose main purpose is to enforce peace by an extension of legal mechanisms of controversy and litigation is idealistic and academic .

		It would work in periods of recuperation and quies - cence ; it would break down , in all probability , when confronted with problems of national expansion and a redistribution of the centers of effective power .

		Taken by itself , it represents simply a consecration of the politics of the particular balance of power which obtains at a given time .

		But an organization of nations which grew out of common everyday necessities , and which operated to meet the common - place needs of everyday life with respect to food , labor , securing raw materials for the reparation of a devastated world , and so on an organization which grew out of wants and met them would , once formed , become so indispensable that speedily no one could imagine the world getting on without it .

		It would go of itself ; it would possess the only final sanction of any human institution satisfac - tion of acknowledged needs and furtherance of ur - gent interests .

		It would generate in time any legal and political formulations and mechanisms which were needed to take care of the controversies and conflicts of interest that would still arise .

		But there is all the difference in the world between a system of courts , laws , decisions , and coercive en - forcements which rests upon an organized system of wants and satisfactions , and which gives that sys - tem added security , and a system which , taking no constructive care for common interests , spasmod - ically attempts to keep peace by bringing into play legal devices .

		It is a commonplace that the present war has re - vealed the primacy of economic and industrial con - cerns in even military affairs .

		It is not so frequently observed that it is this primacy which has already brought into being a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	of a type not contemplated by those who have urged one on legal grounds .

		Every day the `` Associated Govern - ments '' are dealing with questions of the distribution of shipping , raw materials , food , money and credit , and so on .

		Nobody who thinks believes that these problems will be less pressing after peace .

		On the contrary , they will become more urgent in some respects .

		For there will be the danger of a disastrous competition among nations now compelled by war exigencies into a coalescence .

		New prob - lems of the distribution of labor , immigration , pro- duction for exportation will emerge .

		To anni - hilate or reduce the agencies of international reg - ulation which already exist would be an act of in - credible wantonness .

		Not to stabilize and expand their scope would be one of almost incredible stu - pidity .

		But given such an agency of international regulation , defined and authorized by the Peace Con - ference itself , and there exists in effect a new and international type of government .

		Can anyone be - lieve that once such an agency were in existence it would not inevitably tend to be employed for all sorts of new purposes not expressly contemplated in its original constitution ?

		Its very utility for recog - nized needs would render it natural to enlarge its functions to deal with future perplexities of inter - national import .

		A
Hague Tribunal	ORGANIZATION	, a legal order - ing of international disputes , growing out of and depending upon an international organization of this positive and constructive sort , would not be spas - modic , negative , artificial , and in important matters always too late .

		It would play the same constant role which domestic courts play in internal conflict of interests .

		1918 THE DIAL 343 The Economic Guarantees of Peace J.O SECURE the kind of guarantees that will assure a stable peace must become labor 's immediate pre - occupation .

		This means that the working-class parties must study the existing structure of interna - tional relations to discover two things : first , upon what problems necessity dictates cooperation among the nations , either because of actual deficits in the world 's supply of provisions or because of the palpa - ble inefficiency , gross waste , and expense of a world system of competitive industry ; and second , what types of international organization already exist to cope with these difficult matters .

		Only with these facts in view will the nations be prepared to answer the great question : What shall the League of Na - tions do to make the keeping of peace not merely desirable but absolutely essential to the livelihood of each member of .

		the League ?

		In order to show , before attempting an answer to these questions , that labor has already grasped the idea of necessity plus common sense as the only ef - fective basis of world organization , it is only neces - sary to refer to the
Inter-Allied Labor War Aims	ORGANIZATION	.

		In pointing out the likelihood of a wheat shortage after the war , this document declares that `` sys - tematic arrangement , on an international basis , of the distribution of the world 's foodstuffs is impera - tive in order to prevent the most serious hardship and even possible famine in one country after an - other '' -LRB- Italics mine . -RRB-

		Recognition of world-wide self-interests as the driving force in the creation of world organization could hardly be more explicit ; and this recognition gives practical value to a further review of the progress of international action dur - ing the war .

		The relation of this review to the pos - sibility of permanent peace proposals will be most clear if we consider in turn the several problems over which international dealings in the past have caused trouble and even warfare .

		These problems are -LRB- 1 -RRB- the purchase of raw materials , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the sale of goods into foreign markets , -LRB- 3 -RRB- the sale of credit in foreign lands , -LRB- 4 -RRB- the export of capital for de - velopments in foreign lands by foreign capitalists , and -LRB- 5 -RRB- the movements of population between coun - tries caused by varying living and working stand - ards .

		Confining ourselves here to the first four of these problems , let us see to what extent existing efforts to meet them suggest a method for peace-time treatment .

		The war has forced the extension of purchasing between the Allied nations to a tremendous scale .

		In order to secure adequate supplies of all sorts of commodities from peas to potash , the several gov - ernments have themselves taken over much of the buying .

		As Mr.
Hoover	PERSON	pointed out in a recent ad - dress , `` the European governments have been com - pelled to undertake the purchase of their supplies both for civil and military purposes .

		There has grown up an enormous consolidation of buying for 120,000,000 European people , a phenomenon never before witnessed in the economic history of the world . ''

		In order that there should be no competi - tive bidding in this gigantic buying enterprise the Allied countries have undertaken to fix prices on cer - tain articles ; and these prices are effective in this country not only for the buyers from foreign govern - ments but for domestic buyers as well .

		`` We find ourselves , '' says Mr.
Hoover	PERSON	, `` in the presence of a gigantic monopoly of buying , just as potent for good or evil as any monopoly in selling , and in many in - stances either making or influencing prices .

		There - fore , not through any theory , but through actual physical fact , the price made by this gigantic buyer dominates the market . ''

		The purpose of this control is to secure a distribu - tion on a basis of prior need and fair price to sup - ply essential goods to the Allied countries at a cost not inflated by profiteering .

		To accomplish this the Allies have created a number of Inter-Allied Pur - chasing Commissions under the
Commission Inter	ORGANIZATION	- nationale de Ravitaillement .

		On one or another of these commissions nine of the nations are repre - sented ; and they have negotiated and fixed prices for at least twenty-five indispensable war commodities .

		In this country , as special agencies of this organiza - tion , there are the Allied Provisions Export Com - mission and the commission for the purchase of munitions .

		In each case the members of these com - missions buy only after conference with this country , in order that the price and the distribution of sup - plies may be fair to all .

		Obviously this sort of international dealing about goods and price fixing involves within each country a considerable degree of control over industry .

		Price fixing and commandeering of supplies become more and more frequent , until it is hard to appreciate how widely the net of governmental control is now spread .

		It is facts of this sort which prompt the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	to urge : We ought not to throw away the valuable experience now gained by the government in its assumption of the im - portation of wheat , wool , metals , and other commodities , and in its control of the shipping , woolen , leather , clothing , boot and shoe , milling , baking , butchering , and other industries .

		The
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	would think twice before it sanctioned any abandonment of the present profitable cen - 344 THE DIAL November 2 tralization of purchase of raw material ; of the present carefully organized `` rationing , '' by joint committees of the trades concerned , of the several establishments with the materials they require ; of the present elaborate sys - tem of `` costing '' and public audit of manufacturers ' ac - counts ; of the present salutary publicity of manufacturing processes and expenses thereby ensured ; and on the in - formation thus obtained ... of the present rigid price fixing .

		And in our country , to make permanent the pres - ent degree of coordinated action and public regula - tion , the people will have to demand the retention of the
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	and the extension of the powers of the
Federal Trade Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		The practicability of controlling large scale purchase in the public interest has been established beyond dis - pute , complicated though the problem is .

		We know that each commodity has its distinct problems ; must be treated as a separate , although related , factor .

		We know that enormous savings can be effected if , instead of requiring each great national purchaser of coal or cotton , of locomotives , steel rails , shoes , or beef to go into the open market and pay what he must , we set up joint agencies of purchase and price fixing .

		Only in this way can distribution take place without extortionate profiteering and with a closer correspondence between the amount of supplies and their fair apportionment in relation to needs .

		The fact that the raw materials and goods con - cerning which there have been international negotia - tions are for war purposes , in no way weakens the case for the continuance of such control when the war ends .

		There will after the war be the same need for conference and agreement upon the fair allocation of raw stuffs that there is today .

		The need in the future , as now , will be created by a de - sire for equally fair treatment for all members of the society of nations ; by a desire for a fair price for all purchasers ; by a desire to eliminate contention over the amount and the cost of raw stuffs that shall be sold and removed not only out of the countries now industrially developed but out of the `` backward '' countries as well .

		Whether the governments con - tinue to be the principal purchasers or whether this function reverts to large private corporations , the nations can , if they will , continue to control the extractive industries for social ends .

		They can with the same effectiveness as at present , and with equally beneficial results in removing causes of international controversy , see to it , for example , that
Germany	LOCATION	has access to coal and iron ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	to wheat and cotton ,
Japan	LOCATION	to iron and cotton .

		When we remember the extent to which the Central Powers have been cut off from sources of raw materials , it is easy to picture the desperate attempt that will be ma de is already being made by capitalists in all the industrial nations to get the fullest possible share of these materials wherever they are to be found .

		And this attempt will produce nothing but con - fusion and more bitterness if the peace terms or the administrative machinery of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	provide no formal international apportionment of universally needed goods .

		The problems that surround the sale of goods in the markets of the world have an international in - terest for selling agents and workers alike .

		The selling organization must be assured of protection to trade-marks and patents , of favorable financial rela - tions among the nations , of access to markets on equal terms with salesmen of all other countries .

		The workers demand assurance that goods are not being exported when they are needed at home , and that markets are not being forced in a way that puts an artificial pressure on them for `` cheap labor . ''

		The workers are opposed to any invidious `` trade warfare . ''

		Yet all the indications point to the re - newal and development of competitive selling on a larger scale than ever before .

		In
England	LOCATION	the Brit - ish Export Corporation and the British Empire Pro- ducers ' organization are only two of the great agencies planning to push English trade after the war .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	the
Imperial Ministry of Eco	ORGANIZATION	- nomics has established the
Export Trades Company , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	, `` the purpose of which will be to revive the export business in enemy countries . ''

		And an Im - perial
Commission	ORGANIZATION	for the Transition is , according to
The London Post	ORGANIZATION	, `` engaged in collecting statis - tics about supplies of raw material and in making estimates of the requirements in these by German industries . ''

		In our own country there has been no less activity .

		The passage of the
Webb Export Trade Bill	ORGANIZATION	has legalized exporters ' associations in which the manu - facturers of any article can join to unite in foreign sales campaigns .

		`` International '' corporations , cre - ated to sell goods and credit and to export capital , are commanding some of the most able brains in the country .

		The
National Foreign Trade Council	ORGANIZATION	had an impressive and enthusiastic convention in
April	DATE	and no national trade association meets this year without discussing at length its plans for `` after the war . ''

		Of itself this further trade expansion is no cause for regret or anxiety .

		The more intensive becomes the world 's economic interdependence , the more reluctantly will any nation draw out from it and into the unendurable isolation which war inevit - ably imposes .

		Nevertheless the aggressive efforts for markets will give rise to delicate situations and strained relations , even if all the doors of the world 's ports are flung wide open .

		Opportunity for con - ference and adjustment between representatives of the trading nations is essential if the world is to hold
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 345 even remotely to labor s demand for the development of each nation 's resources `` for the benefit not only of its own people , but also of the world . ''

		There must , in obedience to this dictate , be some world con - trol of export , some supernational decision as to the limits beyond which the cultivation of markets shall not be pressed .

		And there is evidently need for another
Berne Trade-Mark Convention	ORGANIZATION	to settle upon further protective measures in regard to trade - marks and patents .

		A further example of the way in which a common need points the way to a common organization is afforded in the gold exchange situation , which be - comes greatly complicated as the volume of trade increases in every direction .

		Speaking in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, Mr.
C. E. McQuire	PERSON	of the
International High Commission	ORGANIZATION	said that commercial relations could be effectively promoted by administrative agreements in regulation - of financial transactions : The
Central Executive Council	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- undertook to furnish a basis for a treaty providing for an international gold clearance fund ... Thereby any gold transactions may be expeditiously and inexpensively settled without the actual transportation of gold .

		This draft treaty is under consideration in a number of coun - tries and in one has reached the preliminary stages of negotiation .

		That mutually satisfactory relations among the nations also demand some regulation of shipping is becoming increasingly clear .

		For war pur - poses the
Inter-Allied Shipping Committee	ORGANIZATION	is allocat - ing tonnage , both neutral and Allied , to the various countries , and by this dictation is automatically reg - ulating the kind and amount of export and import between the nations .

		Yet in addition to this we have an elaborate system of licensing all exports from the
United States	LOCATION	, and there is a growing list of embargoed imports .

		All of which is undertaken with special and immediate ends in view ; but it is of no little value for us to realize that these several agencies of public control may all be pointing toward some method of after-war world regulation of ex - ports , selling agencies , and shipping sold goods .

		Nor can we be blind in this situation to the crit - ical part that tariffs may play in upsetting the nor - mal course of commodity exchange .

		The elaboration of preferential and reciprocal tariffs can obviously work great mischief in the world trade situation ; can , and probably will , keep alive animosities that need no fostering .

		To the solution of the tariff problem
America	LOCATION	should come with humility .

		We have never been able to set our own house in order in these matters .

		Yet we have made a beginning ; we have a
Tariff Commission	ORGANIZATION	, purely advisory in function to be sure , whose duty it is to know the difference between costs at home and abroad .

		Why not go this idea one better and create a
World Tariff Commission	ORGANIZATION	to which the whole subject shall be turned over for study , pending the results of which no preferential tariffs shall be instituted without the approval of all the nations ?

		It is when we come to consider the sale of credit and the export of capital , however , that we see the major occasion for a conflict of interest whether among the capitalists of the several nations or among the nations themselves it is hard to say .

		The ad - justment of spheres of influence and investment areas has carried with it in the past either a parade of force or a commencement of hostilities .

		Yet far from contemplating any withdrawal from these areas after the war , the financiers who play the game on a world scale are planning greater enterprises than ever .

		Their source of greatest profit is not the sale of goods but the sale of credit or in its latest phases the sale o-f goods on terms that require the purchase of credit to finance the purchase of goods .

		And it is this organized source of profit derived from a close interrelation of the sale of goods and credit which will be abandoned with greatest reluctance and with the fiercest opposition .

		Moreover there are inexorable forces in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	which require the export of surplus capital to develop every sort of industry in com - munities economically less mature and productive .

		In the absence of control over export of American capital , its owners are almost sure to find greater profit in industry abroad than at home .

		Every in - crease in income taxes , the retention of the excess profits tax , every wage increase these will all tend to lessen profit at home in comparison to that obtain - able in countries exercising little regulation .

		The extended flow of capital abroad will tend to keep the rate of interest up at home which will add to the overhead burden on the workers .

		Yet if the opposite course is pursued the same result will ob - tain .

		Without domestic regulation capital will make big returns ; it will not squander the entire surplus in luxuries ; it will turn to foreign countries for further chances of investment .

		Whatever we do at home , the export of capital promises to continue on a greater and greater scale .

		There is only one way to secure protection for the public interest in this situation .

		We should control the export of capital and control the terms of its use in other countries .

		That both of these things can be done is one of the things we have learned from the war .

		Our
War Finance Corporation	ORGANIZATION	will have considerable influ - ence in determining the direction of the flow of capi - tal ; and American control of the German invest - ments in this country has already demonstrated pos - sibilities in regulating the use of `` alien '' capital in a 34-6
November 2	DATE	, foreign country .

		To undertake these two jobs on a supernational scale will be a colossal enterprise but it is the enterprise above all others which will pro- mote international harmony .

		After the war the fis - cal problems of the world will in the public interest demand handling democratically and `` in the grand manner . ''

		I am dealing here in almost cursory fashion with problems of literally staggering size .

		Let no one minimize the seriousness of any undertaking which contemplates the building up of international gov - ernment .

		Yet the world can obviously proceed no faster than we can get our minds around these problems .

		It is this fact which supplies a legitimate excuse for oversimplification .

		The difficulties are unquestionably amazing in their complexity , baffling in their interrelation , and appalling in their magni - tude .

		But this very fact supplies the best possible reason for the sort of pluralistic treatment I have been giving the subject of world organization .

		I am advocating functional organization ; and this means the consideration of problems singly , each upon its merits and in relation to vital needs .

		The less wieldly absolutes the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, the World Parliament assume under realistic analysis a more practical form .

		They frighten us less with their vague enormity .

		The world becomes broken up into the many aspects it really has .

		And as we view the growth of concrete and going international bodies during the war , we realize that world forces are capable of manipulation and control .

		We begin to see that labor 's insistence upon guarantees of per - manent peace may be less Utopian than they appear .

		ORDWAY TEAD .

		The Technique of Polyphonic Prose M , .

		iss LOWELL can always be delightfully counted upon to furnish us with something of a literary nov - elty .

		She has a genius for vivifying theory .

		No sooner , for example , had she uttered the words `` Free verse ! ''

		-LRB- which previously in the mouth of Mr. Pound had left us cold -RRB- than we closed about them as a crowd closes upon an accident , in a passion of curiosity ; and if ultimately some of us were a little disappointed with the theory more shrewdly inspected , we could be thankful at least that it had left us
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	's poems .

		So now , with the pub - lication of Can Grande 's Castle -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- `` four modern epics , '' as the publishers term them Miss
Lowell	PERSON	bids fair to stampede us anew under the banner of `` polyphonic prose . ''

		This is an astonishing book ; never was Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's sheer en - ergy of mind more in evidence .

		Viewed simply as a piece of verbal craftsmanship it is a sort of
Roget	ORGANIZATION	's Thesaurus of color .

		Viewed as a piece of historical reconstruction it is a remarkable feat of documenta - tion , particularly the longest of the `` epics , '' the story of the bronze horses of
San Marco	LOCATION	.

		Viewed as poetry , or prose , or polyphonic prose or let us say , for caution 's sake , as literature well , that is another question .

		It is a tribute to
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	's fecundity of mind that one must react to her four prose-poems in so great a variety of ways .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	has always been outspokenly a champion of the theory that a large part of an artist 's equipment is hard work , patient and unimpassioned craftsmanship .

		This is true , and
Miss Lowell	PERSON	's own poetry can always be counted upon to display , within its known and unchangeable limitations , a verbal , an esthetic , and even a metrical craftsmanship of a high order .

		Whether viewed technically or not , her work is always , and particularly to an artist , intriguing and suggestive : this much one can safely say in ad - vance .

		When we begin however to assume towards her work that attitude which consists in an attempt to see the contemporary as , later , through the per - spective of time , it will appear to posterity , we change our ground somewhat .

		Novelty must be dis - counted ; and exquisite tool-work must be seen not as if through the microscope but in its properly ancil - lary position as a contributing element in the artist 's total success or failure .

		This is in effect to judge as we can of the artist 's sensibility and mental char - acter not an easy thing to do .

		The judge must see over the walls of his own personality .

		Fortunately esthetic judgment is not entirely solipsistic , but is in part guided by certain esthetic laws , vague but none the less real .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	asserts in her preface that polyphonic prose is not an order of prose .

		Let us not quarrel with her on this point .

		The important questions are : first , its possible effectiveness as an art form ; and second , its effectiveness as employed through the temperament of
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	.

		She says : Metrical verse has one set of laws , cadenced verse another , polyphonic prose can go from one to the other in the same poem with no sense of incongruity .

		Its only touchstone is the taste and feeling of its author ... Yet , like all other artistic forms , it has certain fundamental
1918	DATE	THE_DIAL 347 principles , and the chief of these is an insistence on the absolute adequacy of a passage to the thought it em - bodies .

		Taste is therefore its determining factor ; taste and a rhythmic ear .

		But all this is merely equivalent to saying that any expression of the artist is inevitably self-expression , `` as if one threw the nerves in patterns on a screen . ''

		The real touchstone of a work of art is not , ulti - mately , the taste or feeling of the author -LRB- a singu - larly unreliable judge -RRB- but the degree to which it `` gets across , '' as they say of the drama , to , let us say , an intelligent audience .

		And here one may properly question whether in their totality Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's prose-poems quite `` get across . ''

		They are brilliant , in the esthetic sense ; they are amazingly rich and frequently delightful in incident ; they are unflaggingly visualized ; they are , in a manner , triumphs of coordination .

		And yet , they do not quite come off .

		Why is this ?

		Is it the fault of
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	or of the form ?

		A little of each ; and the reasons are many .

		Of the more ob - vious sort is the simple but deadly fact that without exception these four prose-poems are too long .

		Not too long in an absolute sense , for that would be ridiculous , but too long , first , in relation to the amount and nature of the narrative element in them , and second , in relation .

		to the manner , or style , in which they are written .

		Parallels are not easy to find ; but one can perhaps not outrageously adduce
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's Herodias and Salambo as examples of success in what is very much the same , not form , but tone of art .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	, like
Flaubert	PERSON	, attempts a very vivid and heavily laden reconstruction of strik - ing historical events .

		No item is too small to be re - created for its effect in producing a living and sensu - ous veridity .

		But there are two important differ - ences .

		In Flaubert this living sensuousness is nearly always subordinated to the narrative , is indeed merely the background for it ; whereas for
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	this sensuous reconstruction is perhaps the main intention .

		And furthermore , whereas
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	employed a prose of which the chief purpose was that it should be unobtrusively a vehicle ,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	employs a prose bristlingly self-conscious , of which an important purpose is stylistic and coloristic brilliance .

		The defects that arise from these two differences are very serious .

		They combine to rob
Miss Lowell	PERSON	of the fruits to which sheer adroitness of craftsman - ship might otherwise have entitled her .

		Put briefly , these poems are over descriptive .

		When one con - siders their length , the narrative element is much too slight ; and not only that , it is too disjointed .

		Narrative description , even though able , is not enough .

		In Sea-Blue and
Blood-Red Miss Lowell	ORGANIZATION	introduces a really narrative theme narrative , that is , in the sense that it involves real dramatis per - sonae , in the persons of Nelson and Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	and in consequence the reader 's interest is a good deal better held .

		It would be still better held how - ever if the protagonists had been conceived less as gaudily sheathed mannequins , gesticulating fever - ishly in a whirl of colored lights and confetti , and more as human beings .

		It is intended to show them as puppets , of course , but that effect would hardly have been diminished by making them psycholog - ically more appealing .

		In
Hedge Island	LOCATION	, Guns as Keys , and Bronze Horses the unifying themes are still more tenuous : the supersession of the stagecoach by the train ,
Commodore Perry	PERSON	's voyage to
Japan	LOCATION	, the travels of the four horses of
San Marco	LOCATION	.

		All of them are acute studies of societal change .

		One feels in all of them the impressiveness of the con - ception , but in the actual execution the impressive - ness has partially escaped .

		One is , in fact , less often impressed than fatigued .

		And this fatigue , as above intimated , is due not merely to the lack of humanly interesting narrative -LRB- as would be added by the introduction of a char - acter or group of characters who should enlist our sympathies throughout -RRB- but also to the nature of the style which
Miss Lowell	ORGANIZATION	uses .

		For here
Miss Lowell	PERSON	, led astray by love of experiment , has made , in the opinion of the present reviewer , a series of fundamental errors .

		The style she has chosen to use , whether regarded with a view to rhythm or to color-distribution , is essentially pointillistic .

		Now Miss
Lowell	PERSON	should have known that the pointillistic style is , in literature , suited only to very brief move - ments .

		A short poem based on this method may be brilliantly successful ;
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	has herself proved it .

		A long poem based on this method , even though sustainedly brilliant , and perhaps in direct ratio to its brilliance , almost inevitably becomes dull .

		In her preface Miss
Lowell	PERSON	says that she has taken for the basis of her rhythm the long cadence of ora - torical prose .

		In this however she is mistaken .

		She has an inveterate and profoundly temperamental and hence perhaps unalterable addiction to a short , ejacu - latory , and abrupt style a style indeed of which the most striking merits and defects are its vigorous curt - ness and its almost total lack of curve and grace .

		This is true of her work whether in metrical verse , free verse , or prose ; it is as true of
The Cremona Violin	ORGANIZATION	as of The Bombardment .

		This style , obvi - ously , is ideal for a moment of rapid action or ex - treme emotional intensity .

		But its effect when used passim is not only fatiguing , it is actually irritating .

		Its pace is too often out of all proportion to the pace of the action .

		One feels like a horse who is at the 348
November 2	DATE	same time whipped up and reined in .

		The restless - ness is perpetual , there is no hope of relaxation or ease , and one longs in vain for a slowing down of the movement , an expansion of it into longer and more languid waves .

		One longs , too , for that deli - cious sublimation of tranquillity and pause which comes of a beautiful transition from the exclamatory to the contemplative , from the rigidly angular to the musically curved .

		This misapplication of style to theme manifests itself as clearly on the narrowly esthetic plane as on the rhythmic .

		Here again one sees a misuse of pointillism , for
Miss Lowell	ORGANIZATION	splashes too much color , uses color and vivid image too unrestrainedly and too much at the same pitch of intensity .

		The result is that the rate of esthetic fatigue on the reader 's part is relatively rapid .

		So persistent is Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's coloristic attitude , so nearly unvaried is her habit of presenting people , things , and events in terms of color alone , that presently she has re - duced one to a state of color blindness .

		Image kills image , hue obliterates hue , one page erases another .

		And when this point has been reached one realizes that
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	's polyphonic prose has little else to offer .

		Its sole raison d'etre is its vividness .

		One wonders , indeed , whether Miss
Lowell	PERSON	has not overestimated the possibilities of this form .

		It is precisely at those points where polyphonic prose is more self-conscious or artificial than ordinary prose where it introduces an excess of rhyme , as - sonance , and alliteration that it is most markedly inferior to it .

		Theory to the contrary , these shifts from prose to winged prose or verse are often so abrupt as to be incongruous and disturbing .

		But disturbance as an element in esthetic attack should be subordinate , not dominant the exception , not the rule .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's polyphonic prose is a perpetual furor of disturbance , both of thought and of style .

		Again , refrain should be sparely used , adroitly va - ried and concealed ; and the counterpoint of thought , if it is not to become monotonous , must be a good deal subtler than it is , for instance , in Bronze Horses .

		All these artifices are used to excess , and the upshot is a style of which the most salient char - acteristic is exuberance without charm .

		`` Taste '' and `` rhythmic ear '' too frequently fail .

		And one is merely amused when one encounters a passage like the following : Such a pounding , pummelling , pitching , pointing , piercing , pushing , pelting , poking , panting , punching , parrying , pulling , prodding , puking , piling , passing , you never did see .

		It is hard to regard this as anything but tyronism .

		These are the main features of the artistic incom - pleteness of
Can Grande	ORGANIZATION	's
Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		One could ana - lyze it further , of course one thinks , for example , of Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's habit , when tempted to use a simile , of comparing the larger thing to the smaller , as the sea or the sky to a flower ; the effect of which is not at all what is intended , and very unpleasant .

		A simile may be successful in point of color , and yet fail because of its ineptitude on another plane , as by suggesting rigidity when liquidity is desired , or mi - nuteness when it is desired to suggest spaciousness .

		But this is elementary , a minor point , and it is time to return to our starting place , and to reiterate what has perhaps in this prolonged analysis been lost sight of ; namely , that even what is relatively a failure for
Miss Lowell	ORGANIZATION	is none the less brilliant , and would suffice to make the reputation of a lesser poet .

		Can Grande 's
Castle	ORGANIZATION	is a remarkable book , a book which everyone interested in the direction of contemporary poetry should read , whether for its own sake or for its value as the test of a new form of art .

		As each wave rose , I saw a crown By eager upstretched hands pulled down ; As each crown sank , confused cries And tempest thunders tore the skies .

		Where the green wave had reared its head Were pools of crimson blood instead ; But from each blood-encrusted wave Uprose a spirit , shining , brave ; The joy of peace was in his eyes , His wings were shot with changing dyes ; And in his wake the waters ran And made a pathway for each man Each man and all that are to be , No longer bound , but glad and free .

		1918 THE DIAL 349 The Modern Point of View and the New Order ii .

		THE STABILITY OF LAW AND CUSTOM I N so FAR as concerns the present question , that is to say , as regards those standards and principles which underlie the established system of law and custom , the modern point of view was stabilized and given a definitive formulation in the eighteenth century ; and in so far as concerns the subsequent conduct of practical affairs , its constituent principles have stood over without material change or revision since that time .

		So that for practical purposes it is fair to say that the modern point of view is now some one hundred and fifty years old .

		It will not do to say that it is that much behind the times , be - cause its timeworn standards of truth and validity are a very material factor in the make-up of that estab - lished scheme of things which is commonly spoken of as `` our time . ''

		That such is the case is due in great part to the fact that this body of principles was stabilized at that time and has therefore stood over intact , in spite of other changes that have taken place .

		It is only that the principles which had been proved and found good under the conditions of life in the modern era up to that time were at that time held fast , canvassed , defined , approved , and stabil - ized by being reduced to documentary form .

		In some sense they became the written constitution of civilized society from that time forth , and so became inflexible , after the fashion of written constitutions .

		In the sight of those generations who so achieved the definite acceptance of these enlightened modern principles , and who finally made good their formal installation as self-balanced canons of human con - duct , the principles which they so arrived at had all the sanction of Natural Law impersonal , dispas - sionate , indefeasible , and immutable ; fundamentally and eternally right and good .

		That generation of men held `` these truths to be self-evident '' ; and they have continued so to be held since that epoch by all those people who make up the effectual body of modern civilization .

		And the backward peoples , those others who have since then been coming into line and making their claim to a place in the scheme of modern life , have also successively been accepting and -LRB- passably -RRB- assimilating the same enlightened principles of clean and honest living .


Christendom	LOCATION	, as a going concern of civilized peoples , has continued to regulate its affairs by the help of these principles , as being a competent formulation of the aspirations of civilized mankind .

		So that these modern princi - ples of the eighteenth century , stabilized in docu - mentary form , have stood over in immutable per - fection until our time a monument more enduring than brass .

		These principles are of the nature of habits of thought ; and it is the nature of habits of thought forever to shift and change in response to the chang - ing impact of experience , since they are creatures of habituation .

		But inasmuch as they have once been stabilized in a thoroughly competent fashion in the eighteenth century , and have been drafted into fin - ished documentary form , they have been enabled to stand over unimpaired into the present with all that stability that a well devised documentary formula - tion will give .

		It is true , so far as regards the conditions of civilized life during the interval that has passed since these modern principles of law and custom took on their settled shape in the
eighteenth century	DATE	, it has been a period of unexampled change swift , varied , profound , and extensive , beyond ex - ample .

		And it follows of necessity that the prin - ciples of conduct which were approved and stabilized in the
eighteenth century	DATE	, under the driving exi - gencies of that age , have not altogether escaped the complications of changing circumstances .

		They have at least come in for some shrewd interpretation in the course of the nineteenth century .

		There have been refinements of definition , extensions of applica - tion , scrutiny and exposition of implications , as new exigencies have arisen and the established canons have been required to cover unforeseen contingencies ; but it has all been done with the explicit reservation that no material innovation shall be allowed to touch the legacy of modern principles handed down from the
eighteenth century	DATE	, and that the vital system of
Natural Rights	ORGANIZATION	installed in the eighteenth century must not be deranged at any point or at any cost .

		It is scarcely necessary to describe this modern system of principles that still continues to govern human intercourse among the civilized peoples , or to attempt an exposition of its constituent articles .

		It is all to be had in exemplary form , ably incor - porated in such familiar documents as the American Declaration of Independence , the French Declara - tion of the Rights of Man , and the American Con - stitution ; and it is all to be found set forth with all the circumstance of philosophical and juristic scholar - ship in the best work of such writers as
John Locke	PERSON	,
Montesquieu	LOCATION	,
Adam Smith	PERSON	, or
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has 35 THE DIAL
November	DATE	2 all been sufficiently canvassed , through all its dips , spurs , and angles , by the most competent authorities , who have brought their best will and their best abilities to bear on its elucidation at every point , with full documentation .

		Besides which , there is no need of recondite exposition for the present purpose , since all that is required by the present argument is such a degree of information on these matters as is familiar to English-speaking persons by common notoriety .

		At the same time it may be to the purpose to call to mind that this secular profession of faith enters creatively into that established order of things which has now fallen into a state of havoc because it does not meet the requirements of the new order .

		This modern plan specifically makes place for certain untoward rights , perquisites , and disabilities which have in the course of time and shifting circumstance become incompatible with continued peace on earth and good-will among men .

		There are two main counts included in this mod - ern eighteenth century plan which appear unre - mittingly to make for discomfort and dissension under the conditions offered by the New Order of things : national ambition , and the vested interests of ownership .

		Neither of the two need be con - demned as being intrinsically mischievous .

		Indeed , it may be true , as has often been argued , that both have served a good purpose in their due time and place ; at least there is no need of arguing the contrary .

		Both belong in the settled order of civilized life ; and both alike are countenanced by those principles of truth , equity , and validity that go to make up the modern point of view .

		It is only that now , as things have been turning during the later one hun - dred years , both of these have come to yield a net return of hardship and ill-will for all those peoples who have bound up their fortunes with that kind of enterprise .

		The case might be stated to this effect , that the fault lies not in the nature of these un - toward institutions , nor in those principles of self - help which underlie them , but in those latter-day facts which stubbornly refuse to fall into such lines as these forms of human enterprise require for their perfect and beneficent working .

		The facts , partic - ularly the facts of industry and science , have outrun the provisions of law and custom ; and so the scheme of things has got out of joint by that much , through no inherent weakness in the underlying principles of law and custom .

		The ancient and honorable prin - ciples of self-help are as sound as ever ; it is only that the facts have unwarrantably not remained the same .

		Such , in effect , has been the view habitually spoken for by many thoughtful persons of a con - servative turn , who take an interest in concerting measures for holding fast that which once was good , in the face of distasteful facts .

		The vested right of ownership in all kinds of property has the sanction of the time-honored prin - ciples of individual self-direction , equal opportunity , free contract , security of earnings and belongings self-help , in the simple and honest meaning of the word .

		It would be quite bootless to find fault with these reasonable principles of tolerance and security .

		Their definitive acceptance and stabilization in the eighteenth century are among the illustrious achieve - ments of Western civilization ; and their roots lie deep in the native wisdom of mankind .

		They are obvious corollaries under the rule of Live and Let Live an
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	version of the Golden Rule .

		Yet in practical effect those vested rights which rest blamelessly on these reasonable canons of tolerance and good faith have
today	DATE	become the focus of vexa - tion and misery in the life of the civilized peoples .

		Circumstances have changed to such effect that pro- visions which were once framed to uphold a system of neighborly good-will now run counter to one an - other and work mischief to the common good .

		Any impartial survey of the past one hundred and fifty years will show that the constituent principles of this modern point of view governing the mutual rights and obligations of men within the civilized nations have held their ground , on the whole , with - out material net gain or net loss .

		It is the ground of
Natural Rights	ORGANIZATION	, of self-help and free bargaining .

		Civil rights and the perquisites and obligations of ownership have remained substantially intact over this interval of a hundred and fifty years , but with some slight advance in the way of Live and Let Live at certain points , and some slight retrenchment at other points .

		So far as regards the formal stipula - tions in law and custom , the balance of class in - terests within these countries has on the whole not been seriously disturbed .

		In this system of
Natural Rights	ORGANIZATION	, as it has worked out in practice , the rights of ownership are paramount ; largely because the other personal rights in the case have come to be a matter of course and so have ceased to hold men 's attention .

		So , in the matter of the franchise , for instance , the legal provisions more nearly meet the popular ideals of the modern point of view today than ever before .

		On the other hand the guiding principles in the case have undergone a certain refinement of interpretation with a view to greater ease and se - curity for trade and investment ; and there has , in effect , been some slight abridgment of the freedom of combination and concerted action at any point where an unguarded exercise of such freedom would
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 35 1 hamper trade or curtail the profits of business for the modern era has turned out to be an era of busi - ness enterprise , dominated by the claims of trade and investment .

		In point of formal requirements , these restrictions imposed on concerted action `` in restraint of trade '' fall in equal measure on the vested interests engaged in business and on the work - ing population engaged in industry .

		So that the measures taken to safeguard the natural rights of ownership apply with equal force to those who own and those who do not .

		`` The majestic equality of the law forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges or to beg on the street corners . ''

		But it has turned out on trial that the vested interests in business are not seriously hampered by these restric - tions , inasmuch as any formal restriction on any concerted action between the owners of such vested interests can always be got around by a formal coali - tion of ownership in the shape of a corporation .

		The extensive resort to corporate combination of owner - ship , which is such a marked feature of the nine - teenth century , was not foreseen and not taken into account in
the eighteenth century	DATE	, when the con - stituent principles of the modern point of view found their way into the common law .

		The system of
Natural Rights	ORGANIZATION	is a system of personal rights , among which the rights of ownership are paramount ; and among the rights of ownership is the right of free disposal and security of ownership and of credit obligations .

		The same line of evasion is not available in the same degree for concerted action between persons who own nothing .

		Still in neither case , neither as regards the owners of the country 's wealth nor as regards the common man , can these restrictions on personal freedom of action be said to be a serious burden .

		And any slight mutilation or abridgment of the rule of self-help in their economic relations has been offset by an increasingly broad and liberal construction of the principles of self-direction and equality among men in their civil capacity and their personal relations .

		Indeed the increasingly exacting temper of the common man in these countries during this period has made such an outcome unavoidable .

		By and large , in its formal vindication of personal liberty and equality before the law , the modern point of view has with singular consistency remained in - tact in the shape in which its principles were stabilized in the eighteenth century , in spite of changing circumstances .

		In point of formal com - pliance with their demands , the enlightened ideals of the eighteenth century are , no doubt , more com - monly realized in practice today than at any earlier period .

		So that the modern civilized countries are now , in point of legal form and perhaps also in practical effect , more nearly a body of ungraded and masterless men than any earlier generation has known how to be .

		In this modern era , as well as elsewhere and in other times , the circumstances that make for change and reconstruction have been chiefly the material circumstances of everyday life circumstances af - fecting the ordinary state of industry .

		These have changed notably during the modern era .

		There has been a progressive change in the state of the indus - trial arts , which has materially altered the scope and method of industry and the conditions under which men live in all the civilized countries .

		Accordingly , as a point of comparison , it will be to the purpose to call to mind what were the material circumstances , and more particularly the state of the industrial arts , which underlay and gave character to the modern point of view at the period when its constituent prin - ciples were found good and worked out as a stable and articulate system , in the shape in which they have continued to be held since then .

		The material conditions of industry , trade , and daily life during the period of transition and ap - proach to this modern ground created that frame of mind which we call the modern point of view , and dictated that reconstruction of institutional arrange - ments which has been worked out under its guidance .

		Therefore the economic situation which so underlay and conditioned this modern point of view at the period when it was given its stable form becomes the necessary point of departure for any argument bearing on the changes that have been going for - ward since then , or on any prospective reconstruc - tion that may be due to follow from these changed conditions in the calculable future .

		On this head , the students of history are in a singularly fortunate position .

		The whole case is set forth in the works of
Adam Smith	PERSON	, with a comprehension and lucidity which no longer calls for praise .

		Beyond all other men
Adam Smith	PERSON	is the approved and faithful spokesman of this modern point of view in all that concerns the economic situation which it assumes as its material ground ; and his description of the state of civilized society , trade , and industry , as he saw it in his time and as he wished it to stand over into the future , is to be taken without abatement as a com - petent exposition of those material conditions which were then conceived to underlie civilized society and to dictate the only sound reconstruction of civil and economic institutions according to the modern plan .

		But like other men ,
Adam Smith	PERSON	was a creature of his own time , and what he has to say applies to the state of things as he saw them .

		What he de - 352 THE DIAL
November	DATE	scribes and inquires into is that state of things which was to him the `` historical present '' ; which always signifies the recent past , that is to say , the past as it had come under his observation .

		As it is conventionally dated , the Industrial Revo - lution took effect within
Adam Smith	PERSON	's active life - time , and some of its more significant beginnings passed immediately under his eyes ; indeed it is re - lated that he took an active personal interest in at least one of the epoch-making mechanical inventions from which the era of the machine industry takes its date .

		Yet the Industrial Revolution does not lie within
Adam Smith	PERSON	's `` historical present , '' nor does his system of economic doctrines make provision for any of its peculiar issues .

		What he has to say on the mechanics of industry is conceived in terms de - rived from an older order of things than that ma - chine industry which was beginning to get under way in his own lifetime ; and all his illustrative in - stances and arguments on trade and industry are also such as would apply to the state of things that was passing , but they are not drawn with any view to that new order which was then coming on in the world of business enterprise .

		The economic situation contemplated by
Adam Smith	PERSON	as the natural -LRB- and ultimate -RRB- state of in - dustry and trade in any enlightened society , con - ducted on sane and sound lines according to the natural order of human relations , was of a simple structure and may be drawn in .

		few lines ne - glecting such minor extensions and exceptions as would properly be taken account of in any ex - haustive description .

		Industry is conceived to be of the nature of handicraft ; not of the nature of mechanical engineering , such as it has in effect and progressively come to be since his time .

		It is de - scribed as a matter of workmanlike labor , `` and of the skill , dexterity , and judgment with which it is commonly applied . ''

		It is a question of the skilled workman and his use of tools .

		Mechanical inven - tions are `` labor-saving devices , '' which `` facilitate and abridge labor . ''

		The material equipment is the ways and means by manipulation of which the work - man gets his work done .

		`` Capital stock '' is spoken of as savings parsimoniously accumulated out of the past industry of its owner , or out of the industry of those persons from whom he has legally acquired it , by inheritance or in exchange for the products of his own labor .

		Business is of the nature of `` petty trade , '' and the business man is a `` middle man '' who is employed for a livelihood in the distribution of goods to the consumers .

		Trade is subsidiary to industry , and money is a vehicle designed to be used for the distribution of goods .

		Credit is an expedient of the needy ; a dubious expedient .

		Profits -LRB- includ - ing interest -RRB- are justified as a reasonable remunera - tion for productive work done , and for the labor - saving use of property derived from the owner 's past labor .

		The efforts of masters and workmen alike are conceived to be bent on turning out the largest and most serviceable output of goods ; and prices are competitively determined by the labor-cost of the goods .

		Like other men ,
Adam Smith	PERSON	did not see into the future , beyond what was calculable on the data given by his own historical present ; and in his time that later and greater era of investment and financial enterprise which has made industry subsidiary to business was only beginning to get under way , and only obscurely so .

		So that he was still able to think of commercial enterprise as a middle-man 's traffic in merchandise , subsidiary to a small-scale industry on the order of handicraft , and due to an assumed pro- pensity in men `` to truck , barter , and exchange one thing for another . ''

		And what he could not help seeing of the new order of business enterprise which was coming in was not rated by him as a sane out - growth of that system of Natural Liberty for which he spoke and about which his best affections gath - ered .

		In all this he was at one with his thoughtful contemporaries .

		That generation of public-spirited men went , per - force , on the scant data afforded by their own his - torical present , the economic situation as they saw it in the perspective and with the preconceptions of their own time ; and to them it was accordingly plain that when all unreasonable restrictions are taken away , `` the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord . ''

		To this `` natural '' plan of free workmanship and trade all restraint or retardation by collusion among business men was wholly obnoxious , and all collusive control of industry or of the market was accordingly execrated as unnatural and subversive .

		It is true , there were even then some appreciable beginnings of coercion and retardation lowering of wages and limitation of output by collusion between owners and employers , who should by nature have been com - petitive producers of an unrestrained output of goods and services , according to the principles of that modern point of view which animated
Adam Smith	PERSON	and his generation ; but coercion and unearned gain by a combination of ownership , of the now familiar corporate type , was virtually unknown in his time .

		So
Adam Smith	PERSON	saw and denounced the dangers of unfair combination between `` masters '' for the ex - ploitation of their workmen , but the modern use of credit and corporation finance for the collective con -
1918	DATE	353 trol of the labor market and the goods market of course does not come within his horizon and does not engage his attention .

		So - also ,
Adam Smith	PERSON	knows and denounces the use of protective tariffs for private gain .

		That means of pilfering was familiar enough in his time .

		But he spends little indignation on the equally nefarious use of the national establishment for safeguarding and augmenting the profits of traders , concession - aires , investors , and creditors in foreign parts at the cost of the home community .

		That method of tax - ing the common man for the benefit of the vested interests has also grown to more formidable propor - tions since his time .

		The constituent principles of the modern point of view , as accepted , advisedly or by oversight , by
Adam Smith	PERSON	and his generation , supply all the legitimation required for this lar - cenous use of the national establishment ; but the means of communication were still too scant , and the larger use of credit was too nearly untried , as contrasted with what has at a later date gone to make the commercial ground and incentive of im - perialist politics .

		Therefore the imperialist policies of public enterprise for private gain also do not come greatly within the range of
Adam Smith	PERSON	's vision of the future , nor does the `` obvious and simple system '' on which he and his generation of thoughtful men take their stand comprise anything like explicit declarations for or against this later-matured chicane of the gentlemen-investors who have been managing the affairs of the civilized nations .


Adam Smith	PERSON	's work and lifetime falls in with the high tide of eighteenth century insight and under - standing , and it marks an epoch of spiritual achieve - ment and stabilization in civil institutions , as well as in those principles of conduct that have governed economic rights and relations since that date .

		But it marks also the beginning of a new order in the state of the industrial arts , as well as in those ma - terial sciences that come directly in touch with the industrial arts and which take their logical bent from the same range of tangible experience .

		So it happens that this modern point of view reached a stable and symmetrical finality about the same date when the New Order of experience and insight was beginning to bend men 's habits of thought into lines that run at cross purposes with this same stabilized point of view .

		It is in the ways and means of in - dustry and in the material sciences that the new order , of knowledge and belief first comes into evi - dence ; because it is in this domain of workday facts that men 's experience began about that time to take a decisive turn at variance with the received canons .

		A mechanistic conception of things began to displace those essentially romantic notions of untrammeled initiative and rationality that governed the intellec - tual life of the era of Enlightenment which was then drawing to a close .

		It is logically due to follow that the same general principles of knowledge and validity will presently undergo a revision of the same character , where they have to do with those imponderable facts of human conduct and those conventions of law and custom that govern the duties and obligations of men in society .

		Here and now , as elsewhere and in other times , the stubborn teaching that comes of men 's experience with the tangible facts of industry should confidently be counted on to make the outcome so as to bring on a corresponding revision of what is right and good in that world of make-believe that always underlies any established system of law and custom .

		The material exigencies of the state of in - dustry are unavoidable , and in great part unbending ; and the economic conditions which follow immedi - ately from these exigencies imposed by the ways and means of industry are only less uncompromising than the mechanical facts of industry itself .

		And the men who live under the rule of these economic exigencies are constrained to make their peace with them , to enter into such working arrangements with one another as these unbending conditions of the state of the industrial arts will tolerate , and to cast their system of imponderables on lines which can be understood by the same men who understand the industrial arts and the system of material science which underlies the industrial arts .

		So that , in due course , the accredited schedule of legal and moral rights , perquisites , and obligations will also pres - ently be brought into passable consistency with the ways and means whereby the community gets its living .

		But is is also logically to be expected that any revision of the established rights , obligations , per - quisites , and vested interests will trail along be - hind the change which has taken effect in the ma - terial circumstances of the community and in the community 's knowledge and belief with regard to these material circumstances ; since any such revision will necessarily be consequent upon and conditioned by that change , and since the axioms of law and custom that underlie any established schedule of rights and perquisites are always of the nature of make-believe ; and the make-believe is necessarily built up out of conceptions derived from the accus - tomed range of knowledge and belief .

		Outworn axioms of this make-believe order become supersti - tions when the scope and method of workday knowl - edge has outgrown that particular range of precon - ceptions out of which these make-believe axioms are 354
November 2	DATE	constructed ; which comes to saying that the under - lying principles of the system of law and morals are therewith caught in a process of obsolescence `` depreciation by supersession and disuse . ''

		By a figure of speech it might be said that the community 's intangible assets embodied in this particular range of imponderables have shrunk by that much , through the decay of these imponderables that are no longer seasonable , and through their displacement by other figments of the human brain a consensus of brains trained into closer consonance with the latter-day material conditions of life .

		Something of this kind , something in the way of depreciation by displace - ment , appears now to be overtaking that system of imponderables that has been handed down into cur - rent law and custom out of that range of ideas and ideals that had the vogue before the coming of the machine industry and the material sciences .

		Since the underlying principles of the established order are of this make-believe character that is to say , since they are built up out of the range of con - ceptions that have habitually been doing duty as the substance of knowledge and belief it follows in the nature of the case that any reconstruction of insti - tutions will be made only tardily , reluctantly , and sparingly ; inasmuch as settled habits of thought are given up tardily , reluctantly , and sparingly .

		And this will particularly be true when the reconstruction of unseasonable institutions runs counter to a settled and honorable code of ancient principles and a stub - born array of vested interests , as in this instance .

		Such is the promise of the present situation , and such is also the record of the shift once made from medie - val to modern times .

		It should be a case of break or bend .

VEBLEN	PERSON	.

		An
Imaginary Conversation GOSSE AND MOORE III	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		OORE .

		Why here 's tea ,
Gosse	PERSON	; you 'll have a cup with me ?

		GOSSE .

		You 've detained me already a long while , and my wife is expecting me with your message that you have kindly promised to come and entertain our visitors .

		MOORE .

		But , my dear friend , you promised to hear me out , and just as we arrive at the interesting part of the story you say you must go , puzzling me rather than helping me , throwing a rope to a drown - ing man and withdrawing it before he reaches the bank .

		There are
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's Rasselas and Gold - smith 's Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	to speak about , but these works need not detain us long ; neither is sig - nificant of the novel of family life that was prepar - ing Rasselas not at all , The Vicar of
Wakefield	ORGANIZATION	barely so .

		And the next writer of notoriety , if not of importance , is one of whom I know little , his titles only and some passages , and shall be beholden to you for some information regarding
Roderick Random	PERSON	,
Peregrine Pickle	ORGANIZATION	, and
Humphrey Clinker	PERSON	titles that do not make show of the poetic , serious literature we are in search of , presaging rather abundant horseplay and obscene jests .

		GOSSE .


Smollett	PERSON	did n't avoid either .

		But have you never read
Smollett	PERSON	?

		MOORE .

		To say that I have read him would be untrue , and to say that I have not read him would be nearly as untrue .

		My memory of him is gusto and plenty of it , and an outlook on life ` in strict conformity with his style .

		GOSSE .

		Smollett is no doubt a most unseemly writer ; but in view of the influence he exercised and still exercises on the English novel , I would have you consider him more carefully than you seem in - clined to do , for
Smollett	PERSON	was not only the trans - lator of
Gil Bias	PERSON	but the master builder of this special kind of novel of adventure .

		It came to him from
Spain	LOCATION	, a country he says he had traveled and knew inside out and from end to end .

		I should be inclined to regard this as an overstatement , and to think that the spirit and form alike of
Don Quixote	PERSON	escaped him .

		The picaresque novel ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		Before we go any further will you tell me in what the picaresque novel consists ?

		GOSSE .

		I think I can define it .

		In the picaresque novel the reader is entertained by a quickly changing spectacle scenes tacked together , it hardly matters how loosely , the object of the writer being to amuse the reader with what is passing before his eyes , regardless of what has happened before and what may happen afterwards .

		In one chapter we are in a thieves ' kitchen , and in the next we are taken across the street to hear a young man paying court to a young woman or to watch couples assembled for dancing or any other spectacle that may please the lively fancy of the author to exhibit for our pleasures .

		A thing that I 'd like to draw your at - tention to is that
Gil Bias	PERSON	passed through
France	LOCATION	without leaving , I may say , a trace on French litera -
1918	DATE	355 ture a point that criticism has very strangely passed over in silence , or very nearly in silence to influence our literature profoundly ; and it would be interesting , so it seems to me , if you were to trace this influence adown the long road leading from
Smollett	PERSON	to
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		It penetrated into
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		We find it in Lever and Lover , in
Handy Andy	LOCATION	for instance .

		MOORE .

		All you say moves me so deeply that I can not fail to remember it , and my contribution to the criticism advised by you will be that what did happen might have been predicted .

		A great psychol - ogist of races who was a great esthetician as well would have been able to say : `` The French , having a sense of synthesis , will not be attracted to the picaresque novel ; but the English , being without this sense , will be drawn to it like flies to a honeypot . ''

		And now , is there anybody between
Smollett	PERSON	and
Walter Scott	PERSON	worthy of our consideration ?

		GOSSE .

		Nobody of importance , none that may impede the flights of your fancy .

		MOORE .

		Then I 'll pick up the story of the novel where I left it : the Georgian house created a demand for drawing-room entertainment , and Fielding fell in with the humor of our first drawing-rooms acci - dentally .

		He was followed by
Johnson	PERSON	and Gold - smith , who wrote stories , hoping of course that their stories would please somebody ; the desire of an audience does not imply willingness on the part of the author to write anything he thinks the public will buy ;
Smollett	PERSON	may have made a good deal of money by writing , but he wrote to please himself , I think in the main .

		Literature had not yet become a trade .


Walter Scott	PERSON	made it one .

		A hideous name , a name for an ironmonger or a grocer .

		I hope you 're susceptible to names ,
Gosse	PERSON	, and believe them to be potent influences in the development of men 's lives , for I do ; and if you do n't , you 'll begin to feel as I do at the sound of the name of
John Milton	PERSON	, a name that rings out like a musical motive with all the career of the man in it ; whereas
Walter Scott	PERSON	is a flagrant example of the evil influence of a name , the
Walter	PERSON	being responsible for the faint romantic flavor and the
Scott	PERSON	for the stern man of business who sands the sugar .

		His name was always anti- pathetic to me ; even in the days when I listened to my father reading The Lay of the Last Minstrel aloud I could not keep out of my mind the image of an amiable grocer counting the jingling couplets off on fingers full of sand and sugar .

		I do not say that I may not have articulated and developed the primi - tive image later in life , but my aversion from
Scott	PERSON	at the age of ten so alarmed my father that I fancy , from something my mother said to me , that about this time his talk expatiated in fear lest he had caused the birth of a boy who not only did not care to listen to The Lay of the Last Minstrel but liked
Marmion	PERSON	even less and preferred the billiard table to The Lady of the
Lake	LOCATION	.

		He certainly brought a volume of
Burke	PERSON	's speeches to the billiard room and laid it before me , pointing out a particularly dull passage on which he challenged me to produce a gloss ; and although it was always impressed upon me that children must tell the truth , the confession that
Macaulay	PERSON	was as antipathetic to me as
Burke	PERSON	seemed to aggravate the offense .

		You too ,
Gosse	PERSON	, suffered from your father 's ideas ; we all do , and having written more juvenile poetry than I , and kept up a closer interest in poetry than I have been able to do , you can tell more explicitly how you suf - fered from your father 's literary appreciations .

		You have not forgotten , none of us have , how impressed our parents were by the prices paid to
Scott	PERSON	for poems ; and I think that you mention in your History of English Literature that 1,000 was paid for The Lay of the
Last Minstrel	LOCATION	and 4,000 for
Marmion	PERSON	.

		GOSSE .

		Abbotsford was an expensive place to keep up .

		MOORE .

		And it was kept up by living in sin al - ways , unintermittent sinfulness , as is proven by the
Waverley Novels	ORGANIZATION	.

		A great sinning house it was , and
Scott	PERSON	continued to sin against the
Holy Spirit	ORGANIZATION	after the crash as before ; indeed the crash seems to have taught him nothing , for he tried to write off his debts , thereby accepting the morality of the grocer as applicable to the artist , a mischievous sur - render to the false doctrine that there is but one morality adapted to all circumstances an absurd thesis which can not be upheld in view of the dif - ferent codes enjoined upon the priest and the soldier .

		That these are in conflict nobody will deny if he be allowed time to reflect , and there are still some amongst us who on being driven into a corner will concede that the grocer must not make love to the tallow chandler 's wife , it being certain that by so doing he will lay himself open sooner or later to a charge of sanding the sugar .

		It is upon such shades as these that the vast social structure is built up , as a friend of mine foresaw fully the other day when he withdrew his manuscripts and refused to have any further dealings with his agent who had put his wife aside to live with his clerk .

		The agent was answered rightly in my opinion when he re - proached the novelist with having done likewise ; the morality of the artist , said the novelist , is not to be confused with the morality of the agent .

		The agent being the intermediary between the artist and the public must be a man of irreproachable morals .

		Do n't you see ?

		Of course the poor man saw , but the spell of Aphrodite was upon him .

		356 THE DIAL
November 2 GOSSE	DATE	.

		`` Lo the white implacable Aphrodite . ''

		But we 're straying from the questions at issue .

		MOORE .

		Only from
Scott	PERSON	to the literary agent .

		Abbotsford !

		A literary agent would have rejoiced in the vocables : ``
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, '' he would say , `` is a name to conjure with '' ; and I can hear him in imagination muttering on the terrace , `` Sir
Walter	PERSON	must have money to keep it up , and by a judicious management of the serial rights from
New Zealand	LOCATION	it can be done , and it must be done , for the public likes its author to live in towers . ''

		There were towers ,
Gosse	PERSON	, at
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, or
Scott	PERSON	's literary agent would not have allowed him to take the place .

		I have for - fotten the architecture but there must have been towers , for nothing else but the upkeep of the towers could have compelled a man to continue rhyming the romantic page
morning after morning	TIME	.

		GOSSE .

		But are you sure that in speaking about
Scott	PERSON	you have not dropped into subterfuge , evasion , or -LRB- shall I say it ? -RRB-

		humor ?

		I seem to miss the fine direct simple thinking you regret never having met in an English novel .

		I would ask you , in your own interest , mind you , so that when you sit down to write your essay it shall be with a clear mind em - bracing every aspect of your intricate and difficult subject , if some of what I believe to be a sincere aversion from
Scott	PERSON	's poems and novels -LRB- I presume the novels fail to please you almost to the same ex - tent as the poems -RRB- may not be attributed to Abbots - ford and
Scott	PERSON	's attempt to live on literature as the barons of the Middle Ages lived upon forays .

		You do not think that the free mind so essential to liter - ature could be maintained in
Abbotsford	LOCATION	?

		You think , and far be it from me to say that you do not think rightly , that better literature is as a rule pro- duced by them that lived from garret to garret ; and that the obscure life and death is often followed by an apotheosis .

		MOORE .

		I never liked the name , a big armchair name that seems to forecast the poems and the novels .

		GOSSE .

		And that being so , is it not true that we are prone , all of us , myself as well as you , to take a further step and to affirm that the writer who makes money writes for money ?

		MOORE .

		The works of our successful authors do not allow us to believe that they wrote to please themselves , and to do them justice they do not pre - tend that their works could interest anybody who is not more debased than themselves .

		GOSSE .

		I am not certain that what you say is true ; but an inquiry would lead us far from the task in which we are engaged , nor should we ever arrive at any clear knowledge of the psychology of success - ful authorship through inquiry , for the authors we have in mind could not tell us even if they would .

		We can only know the successful author through our common humanity ; and I am inclined to think that everybody writes to please himself , and that although the writer may know his books are not so good as the books on the shelves above him , he will continue to take pleasure in his own work , with a sigh of regret perhaps that it is n't better .

		It is pos - sible that you yourself heave a sigh after reading Landor 's dialogue between
Helen	PERSON	and Achilles , but for that you do not destroy your manuscript , and this being so you should be able to put yourself in the position of the most inferior writer amongst us and understand that he too , as much as
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, writes as well as he can and takes pleasure in it .

		MOORE .

		I believe you 're right .

		I remember a friend in the old days saying to me , `` I know that I could not write like
Ibsen	PERSON	and I would n't if I could . ''

		He was a successful dramatist who ... GOSSE .

		Who liked to please his public just as you like to please yours .

		MOORE .

		You 're a better psychologist than I thought for ,
Gfosse	PERSON	, and your last admonitions con - tain signs and traces of the mind that wrote Father and Son .

		GOSSE .

		Every man writes what pleases him to write , nor is the choice given to us .

		Scott could not breathe the pure air of
Mount Ida	LOCATION	calm heights where the intellect sits enthroned .

		MOORE .

		Amid snows unassailed even by eagles ' talons .

		Vocal sculpture over against marmoreal seas .

		But Landor could descend at will into a boudoir and be witty .

		You remember no doubt how delightfully the Duchess de Fontaigne talks to Bos - suet and will agree with me that
Balzac	LOCATION	has little to show as true , or Ingres anything more beautiful .

		But do you remember her who gazes across melan - choly Flemish lands dreaming her soul away in dreams of one in
Paris	LOCATION	dreams that she herself is only faintly aware of a delicate breathing only audible to the attentive ear ?

		But I urge no fault .

		I was meditating on the beautiful things that few ever see or hear .

		Time can do nothing .

		It is not likely that
Pater	PERSON	's and Landor 's readers will in - crease ; but there will always be a few .

		You know the prophecy arriving early and staying late .

		All the same the thought is a sad one that the next gen - eration may be more concerned with my writing than with
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's or Pater 's , and merely because they are inferior .

		Ah , there is the sting .

		GOSSE .

		Does your distress extend to my writings ?

		MOORE .

		No ,
Gosse	PERSON	, I had n't thought of yours , but I 'm sure you would shed the last drop of your blood to make Landor and Pater known to the next generation .

		1918 THE DIAL GOSSE .

		I wonder if you would shed the first drop of yours .

		But we 're wasting time .

		MOORE .

		Wasting time !

		Are you then so eager to return to
Scott	PERSON	, who never seems to have suffered from writer 's cramp ?

		It was my father 's wont to tell that
Scott	PERSON	wrote for three or four hours every morning , and spent the afternoons on horseback a mode of life that seemed to me disgraceful , the romantic page requiring in my ten year old imagina - tion all the poet 's life , as the cocoon requires all the silkworm 's .

		It was some years after that my dis - like of forays and joustings suited to the family reading was stirred up again by an engraving in which a benevolent gray-haired old gentleman sat under a purple curtain , pen in hand , not writing , nor thinking for when a man thinks his counte - nance empties , losing all expression .

		Scott was not thinking , there was little time for thinking ; he was writing off his debts at the time , and had given an hour to a portrait painter .

		His right hand held the gray goose quill while his left hand caressed the in - trusive head of a deerhound .

		I saw another por - trait later , after my father 's death , and my misgiv - ings were increased by the empty yellow face , as insipid as a turnip , that
Raeburn	PERSON	discerned as the real author of Ivanhoe .

		GOSSE .

		It might be as well to leave out deduc - tions drawn from personal appearances .

		You 've been painted a great many times , and I 'm not certain that some of your portraits might not lead to some unfavorable interpretations of the value of your writings .

		But we 'll say no more on this point , but will return to the prose narratives .

		Of course
Ivan	PERSON	- hoe was put into your hands and you were bidden to read it .

		MOORE .

		Ivanhoe ,
Burke	PERSON	's Speeches ,
Macaulay	PERSON	are enduring memories of an unhappy childhood .

		But I liked The Bride of Lammermoor .

		The ro - mantic prediction : When the last heir to Ravenshood to Ravenshood shall ride To woo a dead maiden to be his bride , He shall stable his steed in the
Kelpet	PERSON	's flow And his name shall be lost for evermo ' , finds an echo in most hearts -LRB- in every heart -RRB- , for the note is a true note , seldom struck and often sought ; and
Carlyle	PERSON	could not have been indifferent to its appeal though he makes little of it , telling in his vindictive essay how the romantic page being finished ,
Scott	PERSON	donned a green jerkin and mounted a palfrey and prepared to go away hunting ; but one morning a pig could not be persuaded to leave the hounds , and Sir
Walter	PERSON	had to intervene , cracking his whip to the amusement of his retainers .

		Car - lyle 's account of the episode amounts almost to as - sassination ; it exceeds his fell and ferine accouu
Coleridge	PERSON	's mutterings as the poet shuffled across tii terrace muttering , `` Subjective , objective . ''

		But you must not go ,
Gosse	PERSON	, till you 've heard Mr.
Waverley	PERSON	in a love scene .

		I opened the book
this morning	TIME	.

		GOSSE .

		And it opened at the page you are going to read to me .

		How very remarkable .

		MOORE .

		`` Forgive me , Mr.
Waverley	PERSON	.

		I should incur my own heavy censure did I delay expressing my sincere con - viction that I can never regard you otherwise than as a valued friend .

		I should do you the highest injustice did I conceal my sentiments for a moment I see I distress you , and I grieve for it , but better now than later ; and O !

		better a thousand times , Mr.
Waverley	PERSON	, that you should feel a present momentary disappointment than the long and heartsickening griefs which attend a rash and ill assorted marriage ! ''

		`` Good God !

		But why should you anticipate such con - sequences from a union where birth is equal , where fortune is favourable , where , if I may venture to say so , the tastes are similar , where you allege no preference , where you even express a favourable opinion of him whom you reject ? ''

		`` Mr.
Waverley	PERSON	, I have that favourable opinion , and so strongly , that though I would rather have been silent upon the grounds of my resolutions , you shall command them , if you exact such a mark of my esteem and con - fidence . ''

		I have often heard you lament the ineptitude of the female novel , but can you say , hand on your heart , that it is possible to discover in the serial story published in The Servant Girls ' Magazine a page more inept than that I have just read more removed from human thought and feeling , more trite , calling up no image unless that of two sleek , rotund , inoffensive little animals that but I see I distress you .

		GOSSE .

		It is not so much our opinions that divide us as our tempers yours allows you to speak with studied disrespect of one who once occupied the highest position in literature to which a man can attain .

		You know that
Balzac	LOCATION	was a great admirer of
Scott	PERSON	, and the fact makes the change that has come over public taste regarding the
Waverley Novels	LOCATION	incomprehensible , to me at least .

		I have listened to your reading of a declaration of love that doubtless moved our grandfathers and grandmothers to tears , and heard your comment that it reminded you of nothing unless perhaps the almost mute and wholly unnecessary guinea pig .

		And what aggra - vates my position is that I can not say truthfully that I feel what you have read is not ridiculous .

		MOORE .

		There are many more .

		GOSSE .

		If you will allow me to continue a little while longer I will draw your attention to a matter about which you may find it convenient to speak in your essay ; that though we admire
Shelley	PERSON	's poetry we are unable to admire the poetry
Shelley	PERSON	admired .

		358 THE DIAL
November	DATE	i He admired
Byron	PERSON	and I 'm afraid that nobody will be able to explain to us how it was that
Shelley	PERSON	's exquisite ear took pleasure in the versification of the Bride of
Abydos	LOCATION	,
Lara	PERSON	, The Corsair , and
Childe Harold	PERSON	.

		This admiration and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's are incom - prehensible unless we allow that
Byron	PERSON	possessed qualities in
1820	DATE	that he does not possess in
1918	DATE	.

		I admit that it is not easy to believe that texts must be regarded as les petits vins du pays wines that lose their flavor after a certain number of years but if we do not raise or lower poetry to the level of the wine list , how are we to explain the loss and gain ?

		Whereas
Byron	PERSON	has lost
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has gained ; like the fine wines of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	he seems to have gathered flavor and aroma , and is today a greater poet than he was in the Elizabethan days .

		MOORE .

		Excellently well said ,
Gosse	PERSON	; we know that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was rough on the palate in
1603	DATE	, and that for more than fifty years
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	retained their supremacy .

		GOSSE .

		After the Restoration they began to lose their fragrance and have continued to lose it ; and if some writers come down to us deteriorated , why should we find it hard to believe that others have gained ?

		And since change for better or worse is observable in all , is it certain that any writer is des - tined to be read as long as there are readers in Eng - land ?

		The romantic movement swept Pope away , and no reputation was more securely established than his .

		Who shall say that another change will not sweep
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	out of favor ?

		MOORE .

		So you think ,
Gosse	PERSON	, there is no standard of taste , and that the mere caprice of a generation is accountable whether it admires
Scott	PERSON	or Balzac ?

		GOSSE .

		Do you think there is one ?

		MOORE .

		I think I find one in antiquity .


Vergil	ORGANIZATION	,
Horace	PERSON	, and Catullus would stare at us very blankly if we were to rouse them from their sleep to ask their opinion of
Quentin Durward	PERSON	, and it requires no great effort of the imagination to discover the very words with which
Apuleius	ORGANIZATION	would answer us .

		He would say , `` In my day there was a great deal of Christianity creeping about and we did not think much of it , but we did not think it would lead you into an admiration of such dullness as Scott . ''

		But
Apuleius	PERSON	and Longus ,
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	,
Catullus	LOCATION	,
Horace	PERSON	, Homer ,
Sophocles	LOCATION	, and Aristophanes would take off their hats to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every one of them would understand Hamlet and
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	and
Lear	PERSON	.

		The Tempest would enchant them ; and they would ap - preciate all our great prose writers : Landor , De Quincey ,
Pater	PERSON	.

		Why , therefore , should they fail to understand our narrative prose if there be any worth in it ?

		GOSSE .

		But do you think that an appeal to antiq - uity is altogether fair to
Scott	PERSON	or to any modern writer modern life being so different from ancient life ?

		Do you think that
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	would have under - stood Miss
Austen	PERSON	?

		MOORE .

		You have put an interesting question for which I am obliged to you , and my answer will fall out naturally in the course of the conversation .

		Pride and Prejudice was published many years after it was written .

		How many ?

		GOSSE .

		Fourteen years ; and you can reckon on her to support your contention that the literature that interests the next generation is not written for money .

		MOORE .

		Scott 's centenary must have fallen flat , for I remember nothing of it ; but I have a very dis - tinct memory of the articles that celebrated Miss
Austen	PERSON	's .

		Praise there was in plenty , and if the writers of the articles could not discover the quali - ties that stirred their enthusiasm , it was because they were not themselves writers of prose narrative .

		It may be said that nobody understands anything so intimately as the craft he practices .

		The praise was all right and very pleasing to me , who was neverthe - less puzzled and unable to explain how the gentle - men could have written so much and said so little , the subject being
Miss Austen	PERSON	, about whom so many interesting things might be said .

		I should not have wished them to omit the obvious fact that
Miss Austen	PERSON	was a delightful writer , who described the society of which she was part and parcel ; it must be said of course , but it was not easy to see why this very trite appreciation should be expanded into many columns when so much remained unwritten about this delightful writer who ... and so on .

		After having mentioned for the tenth time that she de - scribed the society of which she was part and parcel , I should have liked the critics to point out that
Miss Austen	PERSON	was the inventor of a new medium of literary expression which is the truth and no more than the truth ; the truth is always strange and it will no doubt come as a surprise to the critics , but confute it who may : Miss
Austen	PERSON	was the inventor of the formula whereby domestic life may be described ; and every one of us without exception , Balzac and Turgenev as much as Mrs.
Henry Wood	PERSON	and
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		A perfect blossom .

		Her craft ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		A great deal has been written about her craft , which we must allow to be good , wonderfully good when we remember that it was she who dis - covered the method and got more out of it than
Giotto	PERSON	did out of his .

		It is not too much to say that she was her own potter , decorator , vintager ; and that her jars were mostly well shapen , the paint - ing witful , and the wine excellent , without doubt
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 359 the purest our island produces a delicious wine , wholesome , palatable , one that can be drunk with pleasure by all , especially by men and women of letters , by whom it is especially recommended .

		Though divided on all other points , it seems we are united on this , and were not my rooms too small to contain the entire sodality it would have pleased me to invite all here and put a certain matter to the vote the only certain way of settling anything but as that is impossible I have taken upon myself the responsibility of speaking in the name of the sodality : we are agreed that if the great dead were to reawaken , the
Austen	PERSON	wine might be offered to
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	,
Catullus	LOCATION	,
Horace	PERSON	,
Longus	LOCATION	,
Apuleius	PERSON	, and Petronius Arbiter without fear that they would run to the window making wry faces .

		It is many years since I have read Pride and Prejudice , but the two principal characters , Mr.
Collins	PERSON	and
Elizabeth	PERSON	, are still clear to me .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Bennett	PERSON	still keep a place in my recollection , and unless my memory retains the good and forgets the false , this book tends towards the vase rather than the washtub , which is rare in English novels ; but it will be safer for me to speak to you of
Sense and Sensibility	ORGANIZATION	, which I read lately , for in that work it often seemed to me that
Miss Austen	PERSON	is at her best and at her worst .

		Her subject is what is known as `` County '' and her narrative opens , as it should open , in a large commodious house situated in the middle of a park as far as possible from the highroad .

		And the moment chosen is propitious .

		Mrs.
Dashwood	PERSON	's hus - band has just died ; Mrs.
Dashwood	PERSON	and her daugh - ters are going to leave their ancestral hall for a cottage in
Devonshire	LOCATION	; and the son and heir is minded to give them a considerable sum of money , for they have not been left well off ; three or four thousand pounds are mentioned , but the heir 's wife thinks three or four thousand pounds too large a sum ; a long discussion ensues and by successive stages the proposed sum is reduced until at last a few insignificant presents are considered sufficient .

		The heroine of
Sense and Sensibility	ORGANIZATION	is
Marianne	LOCATION	, and
Miss Austen	PERSON	's intention is to present a highly strung romantic girl who believes the time for love is twenty or before , for at two and twenty young women have passed the bloom of youth ; and
Mari	PERSON	- anne is of course certain that whosoever loves once can never love again .

		Now it seems to me that in setting forth the mental attitude of her young people
Miss Austen	PERSON	falls into something like the senten - tiousness of Mr.
Waverley	PERSON	unwittingly , for she was not sufficiently practiced in her craft to see that the mere writing of a long passage for
Eleanor	PERSON	to speak to her sister fails to put the reader in possession of the fact that
Eleanor	PERSON	represents sense .

		It is all too sudden .

		The passage I 'm going to read is hurled , as it were , at the reader without preliminary intima - tions to make the best he can of it , with the result that he makes nothing of it and falls to thinking whatever does all this nonsense mean ?

		A state of soul can not be conveyed in a speech , and in a speech delivered by somebody whose acquaintance we have only just made ; and I confess that I thought we were going to have
Waverley	LOCATION	over again when I read : `` Of his sense and goodness , '' continued
Eleanor	PERSON	, `` no one can , I think , be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation .

		The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent .

		You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth .

		But of his minuter propensities , as you call them , you have , from peculiar circumstances , been kept more ignorant than myself .

		He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principles by my mother .

		I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments , and heard his opinions on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed , his enjoyment of books extensively great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure .

		His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person .

		At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his per - son can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance is seen .

		At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or , at least , almost so .

		What say you ,
Marianne	PERSON	? ''

		`` I shall very soon think him handsome ,
Eleanor	PERSON	, if I do n't now .

		When you tell me to love him as a brother I shall no more see perfection in his face than I do now in his heart ''
Eleanor	PERSON	then tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister .

		`` I do n't attempt to deny , '' said she , `` that I think very highly of him , that I greatly esteem , that I like him . ''

		Marianne here burst forth with indignation : `` Esteem him , like him , cold-hearted
Eleanor	PERSON	, oh worse than cold - hearted , ashamed of being otherwise .

		Use those words again and I 'll leave the room this moment . ''

		It can not be denied that this runs Mr.
Waverley	PERSON	very close ; the difference is that
Miss Austen	PERSON	had something in her mind which she wanted to get out as quickly as she could .

		She is in the position of a man who speaks too quickly for his audience to follow his thoughts .

		Scott was merely producing copy for the printer .

		The opening of Sense and Sensibility is not only hurried , it is confused by the inclusion of a scene that nobody would wish away ; the talk between the heir and his wife is not , strictly speaking , in the subject , ancfwe find ourselves forced into the admission that it would be better if the pages had been reserved for a more shapely exposi - tion of the characters of
Marianne	ORGANIZATION	and
Eleanor	PERSON	.

		The omission of the scene between the heir and his wife would have been a great loss , but we should have understood
Marianne	PERSON	when she bids good-by to
Northlands	LOCATION	and have sympathized with her .

		3 6 THE DIAL
November	DATE	i `` Dear , dear
Northlands	LOCATION	-LSB- she asks -RSB- when shall I cease to regret you !

		When learn to feel at home elsewhere !

		Oh !

		happy house , could you know what I suffer now in viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more !

		And you , ye well-known trees !

		you will continue the same .

		No leaf will decay because we are removed , or any branch become motionless though we can observe you no longer !

		No , you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occa - sion , and insensible of any change to those who walk under your shade !

		But who will remain to enjoy you ? ''

		This sententiousness -LRB- or is it sensibility ? -RRB-

		is con - tinued for about forty pages and is not dropped until the sisters go with their mother to the
Devon	PERSON	- shire Cottage , and our attention has relaxed consid - erably ; but
Miss Austen	LOCATION	regains it when a young man appears whom
Marianne	ORGANIZATION	recognizes as the one she has been craving for ever since her girlhood , and within a very few weeks she is convinced that he is the only one worth living for .

		At last the theme becomes clear and we perceive that the author 's in - tention is that
Marianne	PERSON	shall be cheated of her desire , and marry in the end a man whose years once seemed to put him among those that can no longer hope to inspire passion .

		Passion alone is valid , so Marianne thinks , and we comprehend the scheme , which is that the young man must break with her ; it is essential to the story that he should , and how to bring the rupture is a problem , I said , one that will put the skill of the narrator to the finest test .

		The story will begin to creak in its joints if the greatest care be not taken .

		In about three weeks the young man expresses a desire to leave the neighborhood , and the reason he gives for his return to
London	LOCATION	is not satisfactory ; indeed his manner alarms
Marianne	PERSON	, and her disquiet is increased by many little incidents .

		So far so good , but the ques - tion has to be answered : Is the author to take the reader into her confidence and tell that the young man has flirted with
Marianne	PERSON	merely to pass the time away , his thoughts being fixed on a rich mar - riage ; or is the author going to keep the secret from the reader , thereby appealing to the sense of curiosity which is in everyone ?

		Strange as it may seem ,
Miss Austen	PERSON	chose to appeal to the curiosity of the reader , and we are well advanced in the novel before we hear that the young gentleman has succeeded in ally - ing himself to money .

		The motive of curiosity seems to me to lie a little outside of her art , and it would have been better for her to have taken the reader into her confidence and told that the young man was seeking a rich marriage and had no intention of applying his life to the worship of a poor girl ; and later on Miss
Austen	PERSON	's inexperience in her craft leads her into a blunder that can not be condoned .

		She brings back the young man , after his marriage , to tell
Eleanor	PERSON	that he is very sorry and my heart failed me when I saw the scene rising up in the narrative , and I prayed that it might not come to pass .

		But she was the first , a
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	among women , and when she wrote there was no prose narrative for her to learn from .

		It is so easy for us to avoid these mistakes .

		A writer of inferior talent -LRB- shall we say Maupassant ? -RRB-

		would have known that the scene could not be written , for there are scenes in life that can not be written even if they can be proved to have happened .

		The writer must choose what can be written ; and a worse exhibition of skill than this scene is not discoverable in literature .

		The young man apologized , blubbered , and went away , and with his disappearance from the book my faultfind - ing ends .

		Remember that the theme of the book is a dis - appointment in love ; and never was one better writ - ten , more poignant , more dramatic .

		We all know how terrible these disappointments are , and how they crush and break up life , for the moment reduc - ing it to dust ; the sufferer neither sees nor hears , but walks like a somnambulist through an empty world .

		So it is with
Marianne	PERSON	, who can not give up hope ; and the Dashwoods go up to
London	LOCATION	in search of the young man ; and every attempt is made to recapture him , and every effort wrings her heart .

		She hears of him but never sees him till at last she perceives him in a back room and at once , her whole counte - nance blazing forth with a sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly had not her sister caught hold of her and in the page and a half that follows ,
Miss Austen	LOCATION	gives us all the agony of pas - sion the human heart can feel .

		She was the first ; none has written the scene that we all desire to write as truthfully as she has , and when
Balzac	LOCATION	and
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	rewrote this scene , they wrote more elab - orately , but never with greater result .

		In Miss
Austen	PERSON	the means are as simple as the result is amaz - ing , A young girl of twenty , jilted , comes up to
London	LOCATION	with her mother and sister , and she sees her lover at an assembly ; he comes forward and addresses a few words more to her sister than to her - self within hearing of a dozen people , and it is here that we find the burning human heart in English prose narrative for the first and , alas , for the last time .

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	's imagination has not spent itself in this supreme scene .

		She can develop her motive , and the narrative is continued amid gossiping women coming and going into the house taken for the sea - son ; the drawing-room is never empty ; in and out the visitors come and go asking questions about
Marianne	PERSON	's marriage .

		Each of these questions is like a burning knife thrust into the girl , and she has to keep a steady face upon it all .

		She has to bear
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 361 with it all , listening to the chatter till she wishes herself dead , at all events in some silent world , and what is so admirable is that while the reader 's heart is wrung with pity for the girl , the reader is amused by as good chatter as has ever been written and a great deal of good chatter has been written by the great writers , for the power of writing chatter is the signed manual of the great writer .

		Perhaps the French word `` bonnement '' will explain my meaning better ; `` chatter , '' being an abstract word , does not express as much as `` bonnement . ''

		The word `` bonne - ment '' is associated with the showman , and the word recalls to our mind the rapid , almost incoherent , talk of the man who stands at the end of the booth cry - ing , `` Walk up , walk up , and see my show ! ''

		Rabelais was a great master of patter , and next to him is Shakespeare .

		Balzac too could write good patter ; but Mrs.
Jenning	PERSON	's patter in Sense and Sensibility is as good as any .

		She sometimes , it is true , includes an important statement in the patter , one that is necessary for the comprehension of the narrative ; and this to me is a mistake , for the pleas - ure we find in patter is merely the pleasure of words rapidly run together .

		You have not read
Sense and Sensibility	ORGANIZATION	for a long while ,
Gosse	PERSON	, and will let me read some of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's patter .

		`` Well , my dear , 't is a true saying about an ill wind , for it will be all the better for
Colonel Brandon	ORGANIZATION	.

		He will have her at last ; ay , that he will .

		Mind me , now , if they ai n't married by Midsummer .

		It will be all to one , a better match for your sister .

		Two thousand a year without debt or drawback except the little love - child , indeed ; ay , I had forgot her ; but she may be ` prenticed out at small cost , and then what does it signify ?

		Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old-fashioned place , full of comforts and con - veniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner !

		Lord !

		how Char - lotte and I did stuff the only time we were there !

		Then there is a dovecote , some delightful stewponds , and a very pretty canal ; and everything , in short , that one could wish for : and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike road , so 't is never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old ' yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along .

		Oh !

		't is a nice pjace !

		A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage ' - house within a stone 's throw .

GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	.

		The
Moral State	ORGANIZATION	HE UNIQUE apology which Mr.
Alfred E. Zim	PERSON	- mern gives for his volume ,
Nationality	ORGANIZATION	and Govern - ment -LRB- McBride ;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- that it is `` not a book in the true sense of the word , but a collection of articles and lectures written at different times during the past few years '' is fortunately not justified .

		For although it is true that the book is not a unified whole and that it does not present a single and well - rounded thesis , it has an inner consistency of attitude and a high provocative quality , both in form and substance , which give it great value as an aid to interpretation .

		It is no small tribute to Mr.
Zim	PERSON	- mern 's clarity of intellect and persuasiveness of style that a book admittedly a collection of random papers should maintain so definite a method of approach to the multitude of those complex problems which to - day lay claim to our bewildered attention .

		Further - more , a few general contentions do appear in the variety of arguments and discussions .

		These general contentions are of supreme importance , since they are an attempt to formulate the main ethical issues in - volved in the present conflict by arms .

		Mr.
Zim	PERSON	- mern presents them with the fine detachment which can come only from a deep feeling of the poignancy of the personal tragedies of the war , together with the fine serenity of style which can come only from so rich a background of historical precedent and example as it was our right to expect of the author of
The Greek Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		Commonwealth , indeed , is the keynote of Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	's thought .

		Consequently he takes issue with the whole theory of nationality in so far as that theory means that the limits of any national culture are the limits of the sovereignty and authority of the state in which the particular nationality is in - cluded .

		He quotes Lord
Acton	PERSON	's analysis in
1862	DATE	: The greatest adversary of the rights of
Nationality	ORGANIZATION	is the modern theory of nationality .

		By making the
State	ORGANIZATION	and the nation commensurate with each other in theory it reduces practically to a subject condition all other na - tionalities that may be within the boundary .

		It can not admit them to an equality with the ruling nation which constitutes the
State	ORGANIZATION	, because the
State	ORGANIZATION	would then cease to be national , which would be a contradiction of the principles of its existence .

		According , therefore , to the degree of humanity and civilization in that dominant body which claims all the rights of the community , the inferior races are exterminated or reduced to servitude , or outlawed , or put in a position of dependence .

		In other words , since the boundaries of a state are not the boundaries of a language or a people , almost 362 THE DIAL
November	DATE	any number of national cultures can be included within that state .

		This theory equally justifies the political philosophy of an
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	and a British Empire .

		Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	is unflinching in drawing this conclusion .

		He believes neither in the theory of `` self-determination , '' nor in the formula , behind which is so much revolutionary passion , of `` no annexations . '

		I Both are muddle-headed and unrealistic .

		But if , then , there is no difference in philosophical questions of polity between the British Empire and , let us say -LRB- for the question of nation - ality is here best illustrated -RRB- the Austro-Hungarian Empire , why the present quarrel between them ?

		The difference arises , if I do not mistake Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	's view , not from any abstract question of political organization , but from the differences in the exercise of the proper functions of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here we strike the fundamental contention .

		To Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	,
the State	ORGANIZATION	is not merely a type of organization , an instrument of convenience ; it is an ethical entity .

		It can act , as an individual acts , either well or ill .

		Somewhere Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	speaks of `` the unique corporate individuality of social groups . ''

		It is the duty of
the State	ORGANIZATION	to act in the interests of the common weal , to become , in a word , a commonwealth .

		The sin of
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, as of
Germany	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	, lies not in her inclusion of several nationalities within her boundaries but in her attitude toward them .

		Except for the Germans and Magyars the dominant races they have been treated as subjects instead of as citizens with equal rights .

		Annexation for
Germany	LOCATION	means extension of power ; for
England	LOCATION	, extension of trusteeship .

		Of course in contrasting the British idea of empire with the Prussian idea , Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	is quite aware that he somewhat overpaints the lily of English benef - icence .

		Yet historically , at all events , he is on the whole correct in his description of the facts .

		A deeper question arises from his assumption that this general idea of the moral State what , as Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	is quite aware , foreign critics call English cant and hypocrisy has been part of the conscious purpose and tradition of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		If convic - tion and intensity could make it such , then this book of Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	's would answer our question for us .

		But is the
State	ORGANIZATION	an entity which can be properly endowed with moral attributes at all ?

		The instinc - tive anger of the world is concentrated today and justly not upon that multiform Leviathan which is given the general descriptive term of
Germany	LOCATION	, but upon specific individuals .

		It is probably a healthy instinct which makes the common run of us get indignant not at an idea but at the particular people who embody it .

		In spite of the caricaturists and colored maps , it is difficult to focus anger upon abstractions ; to curse at shadows .

		Because
the State	ORGANIZATION	can be used as an instrument of aggression , it does not necessarily follow that it ought to be used as an instrument of salvation .

		It is , after all , an instrument for good or ill it is not of itself either good or ill .

		It has n't a soul which can be lost or saved .

		It is in essence a scheme of organization whereby power can be allocated and brought effect - ively to play .

		To endow it with the human virtues of wickedness and goodness is merely to become anthropomorphic at precisely the point where myth - ology is most dangerous .

		We are still hypnotized by words : praise or blame have no meaning when attached to other than human men and women .

		It is considered infantile to anathematize the lightning which strikes our house ; equally , to rail at that
State	ORGANIZATION	which crushes our hopes , or to eulogize that which furnishes us with justice and freedom , is of no par - ticular danger so long as we recognize that we are dealing only in symbols .

		The trick of personaliza - tion is as old as the race , and language itself serves still to clothe the dark forces , which we can not face unaided , with the familiar flesh that is our ultimate reality .

		When , however , we make of our symbols `` corporate individualities '' to which our affections and loyalties can be attached as to our dog , our friend , our parent , then we are likely to experience the final disillusion .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	, as I see it , is like a machine which makes the color and texture of our clothing ; if we do not like our clothing , or if our neighbors object to it , then we can alter the ma - chine , or smash it , or build a new one .

		It is our servant ; not our master .

		For between the Prussian worship of
the State	ORGANIZATION	as such and Mr.
` Zimmern	PERSON	's adoration of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	designed for ser - vice instead of power it is difficult to discern any real cleavage of principle .

		Both visions are apoca - lyptic , and both reflect the qualities of the men who experienced them : in one case selfishness and jeal - ousy and cruelty ; in the other , luminous intelligence and genuine kindliness .

		Our choice must be deter - mined , as must all choices of ethical preference , by judgment from an argument ad hominem .

		At bottom one might describe this attempt of Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	's as a search for some ultimate object of loyalty .

		The Puritan tradition refuses to be frustrated .

		Our new duty is to the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		None of us today needs to be told how miserably the
Church	ORGANIZATION	has failed us ; the younger generation has been , as far as religion is concerned , pretty thor - oughly uprooted .

		To die for the glory of the Lord seems today not merely inglorious but absurd .

		We have become tolerant in all things except irrelevan - cies .

		We search for a new faith .

		Some believe they
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 363 have found it in nationality .

		Here one can thor - oughly subscribe to Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	's penetrating and wise analysis of a modern fallacy .

		He points out the morbidity of the heightened national feeling which is the inevitable by-product of political oppression ; he shows in deft phrase how a man 's original self - respect of race can not safely be denied .

		With equivalent power and sureness he shows the danger which comes from the atrophy of the feeling of nationality in a materialistic country like our own .

		-LRB- A criticism , by the way , which he has somewhat modified since our entrance into the war . -RRB-

		Now the
State	ORGANIZATION	, which is in one sense narrower , is in another broader than the nationality , for it includes it .

		To this
State	ORGANIZATION	, this
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	would have us attach our deeper affections and loyalties .

		It is the carrier of a precious tradition , an entity with a soul and purpose , a stimulation of our highest activities .

		In a word , it is Mr.
Zim	PERSON	- mern 's personal compensation for those consolations which conventional religion has denied him .

		It lacks the self-centeredness which is characteristic of na - tionalistic feeling ; it conceives its task more broadly ; it has more human tang and savor than the churchly faiths of a barren and godless age .

		Yet it is a symbol which in all probability the new world upon which we are entering will re - pudiate .

		There will be confusion and bitterness following this war , and in all likelihood a sharp reaction away from all kinds of bloodless abstrac - tions , the
State	ORGANIZATION	among them .

		It is odd that Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	, who has written in this book with such insight about labor and the unmitigated evils of a soulless industrialism , should not himself have guessed the answer to his search .

		Unless we raise up more nationalistic passions than the fury of this war might normally be expected to allay , the new world will regard the
State	ORGANIZATION	or the
World State a League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	as an instrument of convenient organization .

		There will be few cryptic worships .

		Men will attach their loyalties to those whom they love , and will find their happiness in their work .

		In the long run it can not be found elsewhere .

		For whatever we permanently cherish must have in it the rhythm and color of daily life and daily desire .

		HAROLD STEARNS .

		From an Older Time J.HOSE OF us who began our reading careers after
1900	DATE	are inclined , perhaps unjustly , to neglect the school of excellent writers who delighted the youth of our fathers and mothers .

		The eighties and nine - ties saw a very deliberate and serious attempt to found a `` national '' American literature , and that attempt deserves far more respect and investigation from those of us who pretend to be still wanting that very thing than we usually give it .

		The ap - proach to this enterprise was sectional but not sep - aratist , sectional in the sense that if each great region
New England	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, the
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountains ,
Louisiana	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, the Western plains were fittingly embodied in fiction , their dis - tinctive types of personality and ways of speech artis - tically presented , the federated picture would pro- duce us a veritable American contemporary litera - ture , comparable in depth of life and beauty of pattern to the French and Russian material that we were beginning to admire .

		With this motive more or less at the bottom of their hearts , writers like
Miss Jewett	PERSON	,
Miss Wilkins	PERSON	,
G. W. Cable	PERSON	,
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	,
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	, and
James Lane Allen	PERSON	worked conscientiously to catch and fix the distinctiveness of the life that each one knew .

		And over this school presided with unques - tioned authority Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, that incredible gen - ius who had come from humble
Ohio	LOCATION	to capture the Brahmin citadel itself , and when the kings had been gathered to their fathers to reign in royal
Cambridge	LOCATION	himself .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	himself was never consciously sectional ; he conveyed the simple homeliness of that naive middle-class age which got itself recognized everywhere as broadly and pervasively `` American . ''

		But it was in his mellow art and ' under his pontifical blessing that the school felt itself sustained and encouraged .

		Of all these writers , Mr.
Cable	PERSON	is the only one who continues to produce novels of the same quality and with the same motive .

		Those of his school who are not dead , have earned an honorable retirement in other fields .

		Lovers of
Louisiana	LOCATION	-LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- comes to us from this fine veteran of seventy - five , with his unmistakable characteristics , after a lit - erary career of much more than forty years .

		And , as if to show his perennial vigor , he has not gone lazily back to his Creole life of the past , but writes his romance about a very modern
New Orleans	LOCATION	of the last three or four years .

		This gives him the oppor - tunity to show the Creole life in all its unfading charm , in the beautiful flower of a
Rosalie Durel	PERSON	, in the courtliness and finesse of her banker father , 3 6 4 THE .

		DIAL
November 2	DATE	and even in the wickedness of her wonderfully named cousin Zephire .

		And it enables him to con - front and then to mingle with this inexhaustible Creole theme the other molding element of modern
New Orleans	LOCATION	, the rather stiffly admirable
Philip Castleton	PERSON	, with his sociological modernity and his critical love for the South .

		It is rather an aston - ishing thing for so veteran a novelist to do to keep so much of the old flavor of romance and yet pour so much intellectuality into his work .

		The interest of the feat almost disarms our criticism of the artis - tic creation .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	has always blended his romance and sociology .

		From many of his contemporaries we could excusably have acquired our current legend that his generation was serenely oblivious of `` social problems . ''

		But we could never have got it from him .

		From the very first he .

		seems to have seen the South as an impartially criticizable society as well as the beloved Dixie of romance .

		And it was the South 's very energetic dislike to be looked at in any such light that sent him long ago to make his home in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		If it was his upbringing in ante-bellum
New Orleans	LOCATION	that gave him his ten - der love of her picturesque life , it must have been his Northern , and perhaps his partly German heri - tage , that gave him a fatally critical sense of the poisons that continued to beset the South 's conva - lescence of reconstruction .

		To my Northern mind he seems the fairest of critics , with a justice that is sincerely tempered by love .

		His defense of the freedman , those pamphlets he wrote in the eighties * about the `` silent South '' and the post-slavery prob - lems , are restrained in tone and earnest with a high-minded persuasiveness .

		Only a South that would stand for nothing but a servile adulation of its ways could resist such a prophet .

		He spoke as a lover of Dixie , but it was just that plea Dixie would not listen to that only through political fairness to the Negro would the South be released from the clutch of its `` Negro problem . ''

		In this latest novel
Philip Castleton	PERSON	is Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's attitude personified .

		Those Southerners who do not complain about Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's strictures on the South put their complaints against him on the ground that he is too much the sociologist at all times and too little the artist .

		I do not know whether he wrote
John March	PERSON	, Southerner -LRB- 1894 -RRB- to prove his impartiality .

		But it happens that this story , with its pugnacious and chivalrous young hero of reconstruction and its rascally Negro politicians , is one of his best novels .

		Mr. Cable was artist enough to draw vivid portraits which were the re - verse of special pleading for the sociological ideal - isms he had been expressing .

		Into that book he got pretty nearly the entire life of a turbulent and proud Southern community in its welter of personal and political feuds and aspirations to develop its sudden - ly discovered resources .

		No mere apologia could have been so convincing .

		But in Lovers of
Louisiana	LOCATION	the reader who missed the artist in Mr. Cable would have a better case .

		Philip rarely becomes more than an abstraction .

		If he is not exactly priggish , he is little more than a voice calling upon his great city to lead the South to modernity .

		He comes back from
Princeton	LOCATION	to take his place in the public life of the city .

		He gives a course at
Tulane	ORGANIZATION	in political history .

		He delivers before a Negro society an address which is taken by his proud Creole rival for the hand of Rosalie as an apology for being a white man .

		He heads the Grand Jury , and menaces the mysteries of Creole clairvoyants and quadroon girls .

		In his high - minded courtship of Rosalie he invades the precincts of the finest Creole families closed till then to ideas , and not only saves her father from bankruptcy but wins him to a larger tolerance .

		Philip is always less a lover , less even a reformer , than he is a walk - ing idea of what Mr.
Cable	PERSON	would like the effective modern Louisianan young man to be .

		Even when he secures his
Rosalie Durel	PERSON	her whom he has once identified with his city , and his city with her our romantic interest is less stirred by their union than by that of the two touching old figures behind them , the grandmere and the Judge , who find their belated happiness after forty years .

		The romance that is embodied in
Rosalie	PERSON	and her family scarcely compensates for the abstractions of
Philip	LOCATION	and the
Castletons	PERSON	.

		Of course she is utterly charming , and charming in a more vigorous and in - telligent way than Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's other
Creole	ORGANIZATION	hero - ines , such as the Nancanous .

		Her creator spares us much of the enormity of dialect , and is thus able to save both her and her really admirably drawn father from that belittling and patronage which seems the inevitable effect of dialect on the modern taste .

		In this book Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's phonetic atrocities are so much milder than usual and his conversations so much briefer as to bring his story completely with - in the range of what , I take it , is our demand today .

		Nothing cuts off his school from us quite so much as that lavish cultivation of dialect .

		Our eye simply balks at untangling the paragraphs of a character like
Narcisse	PERSON	in Dr.
Sevier	PERSON	, so that that youth , who is so obviously intended to be a most amusing and winning figure , falls as flat as a Petrouchka who has lost his sawdust .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	seems well aware of this change of taste .

		Lovers of
Louisiana	LOCATION	is brief and pointed in its style .

		It has few of those leisurely wastes of conversation
1918	DATE	3 6 5 which that school copied Mr.
Howells	PERSON	in pouring out upon us .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	himself was saved by the fact that even in his most prairie-like stretches there is always a faint amusingness , in its transcript , of the literal banality of life .

		The other writers are seldom so fortunate .

		When they use dialect they produce books which will , I think , become progress - ively unreadable .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's romance is still old-fashioned , how - ever modern his literary manner may have become .

		His generation also followed Mr.
Howells	PERSON	in what
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	calls a `` kittenishness '' in all references to love .

		Lovers of
Louisiana	LOCATION	sounds stilted ; deprived of the flow of conversation , the romance is a little bare and angular .

		For a short book , it has a bewildering ingenuity of plot .

		So short a story will scarcely carry so much interweav - ing of themes without fatiguing the reader , and fatiguing him justifiably .

		At times the meaning al - most sinks out of sight under the weight of the financial intrigue , and of the influence of the young people 's romance upon the shy reunion of their elders .

		Here are not only a Creole grandmother and an `` English '' grandfather who should have married years before , but were kept apart by social prejudice .

		There is also a broken love-match between
Rosalie	PERSON	's father and
Philip	PERSON	's mother , which was prevented by the same beloved Aunt
Castleton	PERSON	who now works against
Philip	ORGANIZATION	's suit .

		Add to this a financial com - plication in which the Castletons rather quixotically attempt to make up to the Durels the losses suffered by the embezzlements of the wicked cousin Zephire , rival suitor for
Rosalie	PERSON	's hand , and get the aid of an ex-slave of the Durels as well as a Scotch banker who intrigues ceaselessly to bring
Rosalie	PERSON	and
Philip	LOCATION	together .

		Weave into this the realization that this indebtedness stands between
Rosalie	PERSON	and
Philip	LOCATION	, and you produce a network that at times baffles your in - telligence .

		To the author these intricacies of prop - erty and family pride have a significance that a younger novelist would be inclined to yawn over .

		For the mere situation of these two families -LRB- not hostile , still unmingling , though each represents its kind of aristocratic best in the fascinating life of
New Orleans	LOCATION	-RRB- would have been motif enough .

		He would not have felt so much the need of elabo - ration .

		There would have been more to understand of the people themselves and less of the too neat intermingling of their objective fortunes .

		Lovers of
Louisiana	LOCATION	therefore helps us to under - stand , I think , the limitations of that `` national '' school of fiction .

		For our interest today is vaguely in `` life '' itself rather than in the distinctive trap - pings of life , picturesque as they may be .

		We like to understand characters from their cradles to their graves .

		We pry around the intimacies of their souls in a way that seems almost ribald in the light of these scrupulous older novelties .

		It is not even `` American '' life we are after .

		We are on a restless search for `` human life , '' almost as the thing in itself .

		We feel a craving to look beyond and through the particular type or the odd individual to some calm , immemorial current of personal truth .

		Any deliberately sectional portrayal comes to seem dan - gerously near an exploitation .

		The novelist is ex - ploiting his material , digging out his marketable ore instead of making his human landscape reveal some significant veracity .

		This is the difference between books like
John March	PERSON	, Southerner and The Grand - issimes .

		In the latter one feels the exploiting touch .

		But fundamentally , to Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's honor , it must be said that he does riot deserve that stigma .

		He has felt deeply enough about his land to be its sound and bravely passionate counselor .

		And he has been artist enough not to let either this idealism nor his own very strict personal moralism impede his por - trayal of all the sweetness and gayety of that life which his youth loved .

		RANDOLPH
BOURNE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Connoisseurship or Criticism 1 ROBABLY no one has hitherto imagined placing to - gether the names of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Bernard Berenson	PERSON	, and I confess the justification for doing so here is a slight one .

		It would appear , nevertheless , if I let the present lines run along to an essay on The Importance of Prefaces .

		No one is unfamiliar with the importance of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's prefaces , and no one should read Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's Essays in the Study of Sienese Painting -LRB- F. F. Sher - man ;
$ 3.65	MONEY	-RRB- without first studying the pages which precede the essays themselves .

		The author 's ability is shown there , in his description of his problems , and the reader 's response to his methods , quite as much as in the actual solving of the problems . '

		The book is made up of problems questions of attribution , of date , of differentiation amongst paint - ers of the Sienese School , who have only received the study they deserve in comparatively recent years .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	confesses that the absence of an essay on the relations between Sienese art and the arts of the
Far East	LOCATION	, which he was prevented from com - pleting in time for this volume , `` leaves it a more 366 THE DIAL
November 2	DATE	purely professional and technical one than he could have wished . ''

		The average reader , even if a lover of the entrancing art of
Siena	LOCATION	, will readily join with Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	in his regret , and perhaps even accept the terms of it as a permission to leave the volume and others like it to that very special public which is prepared by native talent and acquired experience to follow the intricacies of the debate in which the author engages with Dr. Siren over the authorship of the Marriage Salver in the
Boston Museum	LOCATION	, or the relative claims of
Matteo di Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	and
Guidoccio Cozzarelli	PERSON	to the production of various pictures which are discussed .

		As `` professional and technical '' as such matters are , we need not however dismiss them and the book as something beyond the powers of the ordinary student of art .

		He must , it is true , have equipment to follow the argument : he must have the enormous equipment of the critics themselves if he is not to be taken by surprise through the citation of some work he has never heard of and which is capable of chang - ing the whole line of argument .

		And who but a man of the rarest opportunity and complete leisure can track the all-but-forgotten
Little Masters	ORGANIZATION	through obscure hill towns , provincial cities of
France	LOCATION	, and private collections from
Baltimore	LOCATION	to
Vienna	LOCATION	?

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	does well , in his preface again , to `` beg the student , even when not perfectly convinced by his arguments , to believe in his con - clusions . ''

		It is the wiser course , for the time being anyhow , and will enable the reader to enjoy with the critic the zest of his researches and the ingenious fitting together of fragments which reconstitute some lost personality of the quattrocento .

		Does the game at times seem scarce worth the candle ?

		If it does , then play it the harder , for your admission or even your doubt shows that you need to look more closely at these Sienese ; they are so beautiful that to one who has spent much time in their company no amount of effort seems too great for the attainment of a better acquaintance with them .

		I do not urge the value of any and all truth simply for the dignity that inheres in it .

		But in such a case as the one I instanced Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's probing into the relative positions of Matteo and Guidoccio we have not so much the reconstruction of a minor painter , as the freeing from inferior work long attributed to him of one of the real masters of Sienese art .

		As long as we judge Matteo di Gio - vanni by the less skilful and less intense pictures of his follower , we have a distorted idea of him .

		To be sure , most students are by this time aware of the looseness with which attributions were given before the days of scientific criticism , and when they have once seen Matteo as the exquisite and great man he shows himself to be in the
Siena	LOCATION	gallery , they will not easily take him down from his pinnacle , even in the face of unworthy pictures to which his name has been attached .

		And yet even such students will welcome more light on the subject .

		Among connoisseurs a defense of Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's essays can only provoke the smile of indulgence that is the part of superfluous efforts .

		But there are few critics today who see other possibilities in their pro- fession than the popular-rubbish article so nearly universal in the newspapers and minor magazines on one hand , and the archeological title-searching of experts on the other .

		And so , as most of us have had enough for a lifetime of unintelligent attacks on the modernists , and even more banal puffery of aca - demic and commercial successes , we have become pretty well resigned to the quietude of the profes - sional and technical reviews , and accept the settling of questions of detail , which occupy the present vol - ume , as the main business of the critic .

		The enor - mous success of Mr.
Clive Bell	PERSON	's Art is largely due to his exhilarating reminder that connoisseurship is only an incidental part of the critic 's office .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	is very good-humored about the weariness with which the reader may listen to his arguments , but he is sure enough of a public which wants more of them to continue the kind of writing which has engaged him for the past ten years or so .

		He will have that public as long as museums and collectors keep adding more works by the minor artists of the past the great works being always less on the mar - ket , and so less discussed .

		And the vanishing point of the lines of third , fourth , or fifth-rate works whose authorship awaits discovery is at a horizon that we shall never reach .

		It is easy to go too far with such an argument .

		The picture acquired by the
Fogg Museum	ORGANIZATION	, for whose painter Mr.
Bereneon	PERSON	finds the name
Ugolino Lorenzetti	PERSON	, is not a fifth-rate work but a beautiful and important one ; to remind us by reproduction of the great
Duccio Nativity	ORGANIZATION	in
Berlin	LOCATION	is a service we must esteem .

		But there are far bigger ones that the critic may render .

		Let us hope that in the essay on the relations of Sienese art and the arts of the Far East , which Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	is meditating , he pro- poses to get us out of the desert of the specialists and into the fertile country of the major problems of art .

		He has at times given proof of his interest in modern art , and if it is too much to ask that he pursue that subject , at least there are broad phases of the significance and relationships of the old schools which have never been well discussed .

		He will find a ready audience if he will approach such themes .

		THE DIAL
CLARENCE BRITTEN GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS SCOFIELD THAYER HELEN MAROT	PERSON	OHALL THE SAME NEWS DISPATCHES COME , IN A few months or even weeks , from
Berlin	LOCATION	which re - cently came from
Sofia	LOCATION	news dispatches portraying Bolshevist uprisings against the government ?

		On
July 14	DATE	such a question would have seemed absurd .

		Today it is significant of the tremendous and far - reaching social and political changes which have taken place in such short time that the question is not only not considered absurd , it is actually being asked .

		Lord
Milner	PERSON	has already asked it .

		Evi - dently the leaders of the German Majority Social - ists are anxiously asking it .

		As early as last
September	DATE	Vorwarts of
Berlin	LOCATION	was depicting the horrible results of a `` break through '' on the western front , and it is somewhat curious that even then it was the internal consequences of a military debacle which chiefly concerned the editor .

		Instead of war outside our frontiers there is war at home , trenches in the streets , machine-guns in the houses , corpses of men , women , and children on the pavement .

		The food supply now entirely fails .

		There is no more coal , and in consequence no light , no trains , industry comes to a standstill , hundreds of thousands die , a spirit of madness takes possession of the survivors , revolts break out , and an attempt is made to crush them with bloody force .

		An overdrawn and extreme picture , you say .

		Pre - cisely , but overdrawn and extreme for a purpose .

		And that purpose is hardly naive ; it is not merely to strengthen the morale of the `` field grays '' by showing what disastrous consequences would ensue from a weakening of the defensive spirit at the front .

		That may have been a subsidiary purpose , but it is now safe to assert that it was not the main purpose .

		For a considerable period it has been clear that the German Majority Socialists have been maneuvering for high stakes for control of the German govern - ment itself .

		Diplomatic information is united on the assertion that the German middle classes what might be described as the moderate industrial and commercial and financial classes are determined to gain a speedy peace no matter what price is paid for it .

		They are quite willing to employ any ally for that purpose , even the German Socialists , who no longer are averse to describing themselves as the one force in
Germany	LOCATION	capable of preserving `` law and order '' on the conclusion of peace .

		The world has already seen in
Russia	LOCATION	a striking example of how an expropriated moneyed and landed class will not scruple to ask for foreign aid in order to regain what it considers its own .

		Shall we witness a similai phenomenon in
Germany	LOCATION	the sudden growth of 5 class more afraid of its own disillusioned proletaria than of a victorious foreign army ?

		Between defea in an imperialistic war and a domestic revolution who can doubt what reaction will choose ?

		Presi dent
Wilson	PERSON	has himself stated that the war ha ; raised up forces too strong for any statesman to con trol , and in very truth we are today at one of thos < dramatic periods in history when no one can confi dently say what dark and swift passions have noi been aroused .

		Naivete is one of the most engaging qualities of all conventional foreign-office officials But shrewder minds are already alarmed at the pros pects of a
Bolshevist Germany	LOCATION	.

		We have cited Lore
Milner	PERSON	as one example .

		The recent news dispatches from neutral capitals highly praising the `` political good sense and ability '' of the German Majority Socialists is but another straw indicative of the waj the wind is blowing .

		Perhaps in a few months we shall observe a campaign of adulation of
Philip Scheidemann	PERSON	as the man of the hour in
Germany	LOCATION	, comparable to the campaign of adulation of
Keren	PERSON	- sky .

		If we do and certainly events are moving rapidly in that direction in all probability a dis - illusion exactly like the disillusion which followed the revelation of Kerensky 's weakness will follow the revelation of
Scheidemann	ORGANIZATION	's weakness .

		Once the tiger of exploited labor has tasted the blood of vic - tory , its appetite grows by what it feeds upon .

		Am - bassador
Gerard	PERSON	tells us that if a revolution ever does come in
Germany	LOCATION	, it will make the Russian revolution look like a
Sunday	DATE	school picnic .

		In any event , the future for
Germany	LOCATION	is ominous .

		For if one thing is certain about this war , it is that its conclusion will not bring it to an end .

		Just in pro- portion as the charge that
Germany	LOCATION	was a feudalism has been true , by just so much can we measure the coming bitterness of the struggle between its classes .

		There is , of course , the chance of a reaction towards a `` Defense of the Fatherland '' movement like that of
1813	DATE	, but that chance is slim .

		Defeat on the battlefield is not the only penalty autocratic nations will pay for the criminal adventure of this war .

		The dry rot of domestic class warfare seems also to be an inevitable part of their punishment .

		But shall the democratic nations escape ?

		In proportion as they scorn to adopt the autocratic spirit and methods of their enemies .

		3 68 THE DIAL
November 2	DATE	jtLviDENTLY SOMETHING IS THE MATTER WITH THE modern scheme of industrial enterprise .

		There are feverish attempts in all the nations where the institu - tion of modern industry exists to try out some new method or to hold on to old schemes .

		We shall pres - ently have the chance to regard the several nations as industrial experimental stations , for no two seem bent on the same policy of organization .

		If the Majority Socialists of
Germany	LOCATION	is to be the majority working-class party when the war is over , it seems clear that the German idea of bureaucracy and state management of industry will take a new lease on life .

		In striking contrast to the German state of mind toward industrial organization , it is interesting to find that the workers of
Australia	LOCATION	, who have been responsible for the development of state capi - talism and bureaucratic management in that coun - try , have swung completely away from their de - pendence on politics and legislative reforms to syndicalism ; to the One
Big Union	ORGANIZATION	of our own
I. W. W. Naturally	PERSON	the trade union organization and activity in
Australia	LOCATION	is receiving opposition .

		Mr.
E. E. Keep	PERSON	, president of the
Employers ' Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration of
Melbourne	LOCATION	,
Victoria	LOCATION	, is agitating for the suppression of the movement , which he says is spend - ing or proposing to spend in the next year 83,000 in propaganda .

		Should labor again get into political power and endeavor to put these ideas into practice , it will be a disaster as tragic to industry in
Australia	LOCATION	as the Bolshevikist ascend - ency in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		While Mr.
Keep	PERSON	is opposing trade union organi - zation in
Australia	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ernest J. P. Benn	PERSON	, Chair - man of the
Industrial Reconstruction Council	ORGANIZATION	, is carrying on agitation for the complete organization of workers as well as all other factors participating in British industry , and the establishment of a na - tional
Parliament of Trades	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again we find that the industrial organization of the Soviets of
Russia	LOCATION	does not follow either the theory of the trade union , the industrial union , the political socialist , or , needless to say , the
British Parliament of Trades	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has sprung out of the necessity of meeting a situation .

		The organization for this reason closely follows the actual functioning of the producers .

		It is unhampered by theories , ulterior purposes , or interests .

		No wonder that the Germans , including the German
Scheide	PERSON	- mann Socialists , are horrified at an unabashed in - dustrialism crossing the border without the clothing of theory or other discretions .

		1 HE DEATH OF A. C. L-ECOCQ , THE COMPOSER OF light opera and more particularly of Girofle-Girofla of happy memory , does more than stir recollections of the melodious conventional three-act operetta , sentimental and gay , which did so much to make the
last twenty years of the nineteenth century	DATE	a ro - mantic and engaging era .

		It recalls again the meagerness of our own work in the field of light music .

		The ordinary `` musical comedy , '' with its vaudeville extravaganza , its glucose tunes , and its thin wit , has been saved from destruction only by the imperishable freshness and pulchritude of our chorus girls : without them , we should have been forced by sheer ennui to demand a more intelligent form of entertainment .

		For the field of light music can be almost indefinitely expanded , and there are many theatrical genres for which light music alone is appropriate .

		There is the operetta of the
Lecocq	PERSON	type , the witty burlesque of the
Gilbert	PERSON	and
Sullivan	PERSON	type , the farce with music , the revue .

		The last has been highly developed on the Continent ; in
America	LOCATION	the yearly Follies and Passing Show are our closest approach to that combination of satire , horseplay , and ` syncopated jingles which make the first-class revue almost a specific art form .

		The farce with music , too , has been well developed with us , for American playwrights are apt at farce and pro- ducers find it easier to procure isolated songs and dances than an entire homogeneous score like that , say , of The Chocolate Soldier .

		But our lack of even tolerable operettas and witty burlesques is appalling .

		When we do have a composer of ability and keen sense of orchestration , like
Victor Herbert	PERSON	, where shall we find the author - to write the book for his score ?

		Nowhere do our pioneer qualities reveal themselves more strikingly than in our attempts at operetta .

		For good operetta is like old wine it is dry and sparkling and is poured from somewhat musty bottles .

		The composer and the librettist must be sophisticated and urbane .

		There must be a sus - picion of mockery in the sentiment and a touch of burlesque itself in the music .

		Operetta is the musi - cal counterfoil to that artificial comedy which Charles Lamb described with humorous discern - ment .

		WILLIAM JAMES HAS GIVEN CLASSIC EXPRESSION to that feeling of despair and ennui which affects the normal man when he visits a model community .

		It is like one 's feeling of hopelessness before the per - fect child .

		Perhaps for the most of us there had been small hope of ever seeing an entire community afflicted with such dull , idyllic sinlessness .

		But to - day there is a living example of just such a com - munity for all to see ; and many are .

		That ex - ample is
Washington	LOCATION	, where never before in human history has the task of being wicked been made so difficult .

		Long , long ago the city was made dry , and the merry tinkle of the ice in the whiskey glass has yielded these many months to the soft crash of straw on the soda fountain .

		Recently because of the influenza epidemic , all theaters and movie houses have been closed ; there is literally no place to go but home if you have a home , for
Washington	LOCATION	is the original habitat of the rent profiteer and one is
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 3 6 9 always on the move .

		Restaurants close at nine - thirty in the
evening	TIME	, and there would be no special point in staying in them anyway .

		Public meetings are prohibited .

		`` Stagger '' hours have been insti - tuted whereby one department goes to its work a half hour earlier than another , thus relieving the congestion of the street cars and there is not even the cheerful community sociableness of the crowded trolley .

		Stores open at ten o'clock , and buying has been reduced to the thoroughly uninteresting and thoroughly praiseworthy task of purchasing neces - sities .

		Everybody is really busy , and loafing has become a lost art .

		One never sees a friendly mur - der , as in
Chicago	LOCATION	; or a cheerful drunken brawl , as in
New York	LOCATION	; not even a lynching .

		The city goes on the even tenor of its purposeful way , reserving all its belligerency for the well-known
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cynics aver that if liquor were reintro - duced , the city would forget all about the war and bitter defeat would await our armies .

		This is prob - ably a libel , for
Washington	LOCATION	has carefully preserved one vice .

		But nobody wants to who ever heard of angels smoking in Paradise ?

		PRESERVATION OF THE STUDY OF LATIN HAS RE - cently been advocated with great force by
M. A. Meillet	PERSON	, a professor at the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	.

		This distinguished philologist sees in the linguistic diver - sity of modern
Europe	LOCATION	one of the strongest forces making for
Continental	ORGANIZATION	disunity .

		The war will in all likelihood intensify rather than lessen the move - ment for the adoption of separate languages by small nationalities a movement which has been going on for over a half-century with accelerating speed and intensity .

		If the unity of European civilization is to be maintained unbroken , some common bond must be discovered or revived .

		It is disconcertingly true that however sympathetic we may be to this linguis - tic decentralizing movement on political grounds , culturally speaking the ideas expressed in these new literatures are for the most part the common stock of modern thought .

		M. Meillet is probably correct in thinking that for cultural purposes the old and widespread languages are sufficient .

		Consequently the adoption of a new language by a small people is as likely to erect barriers between that people and the outside world as to enrich its own peculiar heri - tage .

		To counteract this centrifugal tendency
M. Meillet	PERSON	suggests that the study of Latin should be maintained .

		A knowledge of Latin shows the rela - tionship of the Romance languages to each other and of the
Romance	ORGANIZATION	languages as a whole to English and German .

		But primarily a knowledge of Latin enables one to discern those ideas which are the com - mon heritage of European civilizations as a whole .

		Just why M. Meillet should have chosen Latin for this purpose of linguistic unification may seem some - what arbitrary to those who are ever keeping their axes sharp against the classicists .

		Yet somehow the ancient humanism , divorced from the immediacies of scientific discovery and experiment , seems today in the crowded hatred of strife a more healing and gracious doctrine than it did in
the first days of July 1914	DATE	, when the concepts of creative practicality were regarded as the surest instruments for the establish - ment of the social millennium .

		IHE WAR SERVICE OF
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY Association	ORGANIZATION	has been allotted
$ 3,500,000	MONEY	of the
$ 170,500,000	MONEY	asked for during the welfare drive which begins
November 11	DATE	.

		The amount would seem small if it were intended to be more than a cash supplement to the stream of donated books that have been pouring into the
Association	ORGANIZATION	's reser - voirs since its first call .

		For
the Service	ORGANIZATION	is now fully occupied with what must be its most valuable function the supplying of reading matter to hos - pitals and
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	houses .

		Of these , one hundred and forty-nine have already been equipped with libraries .

		The allotment from the Welfare Chest will be used to extend this equipment and to buy such books as are not otherwise provided , since the
Service	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- unlike the caretakers of a certain sort of donated library -RRB- believes in making the supply meet the demand , not the demand the supply .

		The cash supplement , therefore , is essential .

		Meanwhile the stream of book donations must not be permitted to subside .

		Books , no less than men , suffer an ac - celerated wear and tear at the front ; and the Asso - ciation 's ideal for every man in service a book in service demands an uninterrupted flow of rein - forcements .

		Nearly every booklover has on his shelves worthy volumes that have outlived their usefulness for him but would sell for only a ridicu - lous fraction of their value to the right readers .

		For all such books the
Service	ORGANIZATION	has the right readers .

		Probably the booklover will never again have so good an opportunity to put his shelved books back to work for him .

		There is demand for nearly every kind of reading entertainment and distraction to lighten the first hours in hospital , serious literature to indulge tastes acquired in civil life , educational and technical works to fill this enforced leisure with preparation for a return to civil life .

		Whoever has experienced a reading famine in hospital will send his books to
France	LOCATION	to help relieve the monotony of convalescence among our soldiers .

		If he has not books , he would do well to act upon the
Associa	LOCATION	- tion 's suggestion that he give their price to the War Chest .

		37 THE DIAL
November 2	DATE	Communications INCOMMUNICABLE LITERATURE SIR :
Francis Bacon	PERSON	was given to tripartite analy - ses .

		If his subjects did not fall naturally into three sections he so treated them that they seemed to .

		`` Studies serve for delight , for ornament , and for ability , '' he said judicially , looking about him at the .

		revival of learning .

		Having undertaken an examina - tion of this statement lately , I am forced to the con - clusion that we in modern
America	LOCATION	who study liter - ature especially English literature do so for none of these reasons .

		Not for delight ; the students find it drudgery .

		Not for ornament ; it is a disgrace to seem , outside the classroom -LRB- and in it , too , for that matter -RRB- to know much of the great masters of prose or poetry , or to manifest a power of expression .

		Not for ability ; wherein shall it result to the mate - rial profit of any of us , save the pale priests who pass along the lamp , to know there were two Wartons ?

		There is a friend of mine who would say that We have gone beyond the Baconian exposition , that we study literature for its effect of broadening and deepening the character .

		Let his students beware of him .

		Let them become more human , let their sympathies have wider scope , at their own peril .

		It will ruin them for business .

		They will be failures in this progressive civilization if they forget him not quickly , and all the dangerous nonsense he has taught them .

		Indeed , he does alarm them ; the classics alarm them ; we all do ; and they take over - elaborate precautions lest they be softened and made gentle by the speculations of the great minds of the world .

		Instinctively self-protective , they steel them - selves against all prophets of the humanities .

		Usu - ally it is a needless defense .

		They are already isolated and immune .

		Only those who have ears can hear and they have been hearing all along .

		It is self-evident to the man who has corrected themes for many classes that the creative faculty in any one student remains practically static , and that there are no visible results from methods the most varied , the most drastic , the most conscientious .

		No student has ever learned under my instruction to spell , or punctuate , or build a sentence .

		Nobody can teach these things .

		The original cryptogram of letters is transferred to us in childhood , and after - wards we puzzle over it alone .

		He who can spell at the beginning remains able to spell at the end ; he who could punctuate at first can punctuate still ; he who early in life can narrate , describe , and analyze retains his power .

		Our students in compo - sition grow , flourish , and die aloof from our aid , integral , sufficient to themselves , relying upon chance and whatever innate ability they possess .

		In the realm of literature the conditions are similar .

		The same lad who in high school precociously under - stood the sonnet on Westminster Bridge will in the university find subtle meanings and interplay of thought in the series to the
River Duddon	LOCATION	.

		We do not broaden and deepen them .

		If they are broadened and deepened they do it themselves , by the force of hidden aspirations , by natural mental growth .

		Those who are stupid , except in extraordi - nary instances , will remain stupid ; the man who was brilliant once is now unchanged .

		Knowledge can be imparted in limited quantities , a dead and useless , uninspired knowledge of the anatomy of certain poetry and prose .

		But whatever apprecia - tion of the masters your student may show in your presence he has capacity for in your absence .

		You may amuse him and yourself by what you say ; the time in class may pass pleasantly enough ; but you can not add a cubit to his understanding .


George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	is always himself ; so is
William Cow	LOCATION	- per ; so are
Janet	PERSON	, and Fred , and
Algernon	PERSON	.

		The boy who loves literature will read it in the library ; the others suffer many purposeless and grilling hours .

		As well attempt to explain orthodox Christianity to a Buddhist , as the flower of literature to the uninter - ested .

		He can not understand , and he does not wish to .

		We are tilting against a mill a huge , bellyless , soulless organization , compact of dullness , custom , and immutable law .

		We may tear a flange , but there is no possibility of convincing .

		It is evident that I am pessimistic
this morning	TIME	.

		I have overstated my case .

		Is there no hope for us ?

		I once asked a friend if he had read The Theory of the Leisure Class .

		`` Why , no , '' he retorted ; `` why should I ?

		All of my friends have read it .

		It per - meates the atmosphere in which I live . ''

		Perhaps professors are , in a vague way , makers of atmos - phere as has been so often less flatteringly hinted by sundry college journals .

		We read ; we under - stand ; we fulminate .

		Who knows by what devious and shadowy trails civilization and culture are ad - vanced ?

		There is little enough progression on the high road .

		Our recognized output is sugared stupidity ; but the plant may be worth maintaining for its by-products .

		THE SOCIALIST PLATFORM SIR : This year as never before the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	lays claim to the radical vote .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	this claim has long been a commonplace ; the young radical is of course a Socialist , whether of the right or left .

		In
Great Britian	LOCATION	the rule still holds good under new terminology Fabians ,
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, and so on .

		In
America	LOCATION	indeed the reign of Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	has cleft a wide gulf between the radical and any practicable labor party , but as far as Socialism is concerned the inertness of so many radicals proves again that the American is a non-political animal .

		`` American Socialism is so doctrinaire , '' he com - plains .

		Strange indeed as coming from the well - informed radical !

		`` Doctrinaire , '' indeed , to the man whose Socialism is learned from the abstrac - tions of the corner soap-boxer ; `` doctrinaire , '' per -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 37 1 haps , to the college student whose `` Socialism 1 '' ends with
Marx	PERSON	and
Engels	PERSON	but hardly to the mature radical who has followed the party platforms and tactics since
1900	DATE	.

		It is in view of these platforms and accomplish - ments that we believe our party to furnish the only possible political affiliation for the radical who looks beyond win-the-war shibboleths to the coming re - construction .

		The old arguments against Socialism have been shattered by the administration .

		`` Busi - ness incentive '' has been thrown to the winds ; `` in - dividual liberty '' has has been shelved for the period of the war .

		That old anti-Socialist romance , The Scarlet Empire , bids fair to be outdone in a regime where the motorist is no longer master of his own gasoline , the housewife of her own sugar-bowl , or the letter writer of his own correspondence .

		Aside from the plunge into socialization and state control which has proved possible the wildest dreams of Utopian Socialism , a convincing argument has been given to our `` immediate demands '' for work - ing-class reform .

		`` It can not be done '' was the old reply to our every proposition , and the tax rate and debt limit were held up as impassable barriers .

		We have now learned however that nothing is financially impossible , that private property exists in strict sub - ordination to public need , and that what the majority wills can be done irrespective of precedent .

		Yet there is danger in this plunge toward social control .

		The Republicans see it , and helplessly block the wheels ; the Democrats prefer not to see it , trusting all to the steering of an able executive ; the
Marxians	PERSON	alone can meet the menace advisedly as the long-expected
State Socialism	ORGANIZATION	.

		The socialization which has come upon us is clearly the form that has existed in
Germany	LOCATION	since
Bismarck	LOCATION	, characterized by centralization , military purpose , and disregard of individual rights .

		The advantage is efficiency ; the danger lies before us in what we know of
Germany	LOCATION	today .

		We can not avoid this development ; our `` doctrinaire '' Marxists have long foretold it ; and efficiency has come to stay .

		There is but one escape to turn
State Socialism	ORGANIZATION	into Social Democracy .

		This transformation can be made by concrete measures of two classes .

		The first of these tends toward industrial democracy .

		To quote from the new Socialist Congressional Platform : Self-government in industry is the first essential of a truly democratic nation , and the only guarantee of real freedom for the workers .

		The demand is made , therefore , for the right of government employees to organize and strike , and the principle of industrial unionism is endorsed .

		A second group of demands looks toward a more complete political democracy : amendment of the Constitution by majority vote , the abolition of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, the application of the initiative and ref - erendum to federal legislation , and most daring of all the responsibility of the President , his cabinet , ind the courts to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the people .

		We Socialists do not desire that
Germany	LOCATION	should receive all the benefits of the war , and in demanding a responsible government for our enemies we put in a plea for
America	LOCATION	as well .

		The program of the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	has justly provoked the admiration of the liberal world .

		We point with pride to an
American Congressional Platform	ORGANIZATION	, later than the British and profiting by it , yet to the student of American Socialism a di - rect development of the `` immediate demands '' of past platforms .

		Striking demands of the interna - tional portion of the program are the representation of labor and suppressed races and nationalities at the peace conference , and the organization of a world federation with legislative as well as judicial powers to obviate disputes and to settle such disputes as arise .

		In addition to the call for government ownership of public utilities and basic industries , always present in the Socialist Platform , a far-seeing succession of demands is made for measures of present reform : a national policy on unemployment , including a permanent system of employment agencies ; the development of voca - tional education ; the organization of a construction serv - ice to carry on public works and to provide apprenticeship for returning soldiers and other workers seeking per - manent employment on the land or in the exploitation of natural resources ... the encouragement of agri - cultural cooperation ; the enactment of laws prohibiting child labor ; social insurance ; war profits taxation of
100 %	PERCENT	; income and inheritance taxes progressing to
100 %	PERCENT	; taxation of unused land at full rental value .

		It proposes the acquisition by the government of all banks essential to business and industry and complete democratic control of credit and finance .

		A section new to the American platform is that which deals with civil liberties .

		Demand is made for the literal interpretation of the civil liberties provisions of the Constitution , for the suppression of mob violence by the federal government , for the re - peal of the post office censorship of the press , for the restriction of the application of the Espionage Act , for the repeal of legislation restricting freedom of speech .

		The German radical has long consented to restriction of civil liberty ; the British radical has refused to accept such a restriction .

		The American radical must choose between German submission and Anglo-Saxon protest , and the one political vehicle for this protest in
1918	DATE	is the Socialist Party ... If , then , the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	in
1918	DATE	is doctrinaire , the aims of the Allies are doctrinaire .

		Democracy and self-determination are these mere echoes of the eighteenth century revolution , when the overthrow of kings was the gateway to liberty ; or are they to be interpreted in specific terms , translated into the twentieth century and the new world ?

		The old parties have conjured by these words the Socialists give them concreteness and the push of revolution .

		If there exists a political party in the
United States	LOCATION	more worthy of the support of the radical , we challenge him to bring it forward .

November	DATE	2 Notes on New Books THE FLAME THAT Is
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		By
Henri Malherbe	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		After
Barbusse	PERSON	, there is a certain temerity in translating for English readers any other French book which deals directly with impressions of the war .

		For Le Feu gave you the impression of look - ing straight through the language into the war expe - rience itself .

		The literary medium became a clear glass , and the narrator 's art made you almost forget that you had not experienced yourself all that he had to tell you .

		In contrast to such a book , the literary medium of
M. Malherbe	PERSON	's impressions is distress - ingly apparent .

		On no page does he let you forget that he is writing about the war in an effort to con - vey to you his sense of its vastness , austerity , and horror .

		There is everywhere a self-consciousness , a sense of the craftsman 's straining .

		The little book is unpretentious enough .

		It purports to be nothing more than a series of notes written hurriedly as the author caught significant things .

		But his little vi - sions of Death and Love have too much the air of being composed .

		He is sincere enough , but he does not flow .

		In a few paragraphs however he does express poignantly what war means to the `` intellec - tual '' in its midst .

		It is hard to forget sentences like the following : To be a soldier is to be a naked blade .

		It means to strip oneself of illusions , to stifle one 's memories .

		It means to keep oneself single and strong for a sacred duty , for a sacrifice bitterly accepted .

		It is to make oneself dry , forceful , fit , a fierce and solitary soul from which the charms and amenities , the arts and all the peaceful graces of human society have ebbed away .

		THE FOURTEENTH OF
JULY	DATE	, AND DANTON .

		By
Romain Holland	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		Written some twenty years ago , these plays by
M. Rolland	PERSON	have very literally an historic rather than a dramatic interest .

		They were the fruit of the effort of the author and a group of his associates to found a people 's theater , in accordance with a decree of the
Committee of Public Safety of 1794	ORGANIZATION	: 1 .

		That the Theatre-Frangais shall henceforward be solely dedicated to productions given by and for the people at stated intervals each month .

		2 .

		That the building shall bear the following inscription on its facade : People 's Theatre ; and that the various troupes of actors already established in the
Paris	LOCATION	theatres shall be requisitioned in turn to act in these popular pro- ductions , which are to take place three times in every decade .


M. Rolland	PERSON	conceived the idea that the Revolution itself furnished excellent material for such produc - tions , and designed a `` sort of epic comprising ten plays , '' dealing with the progress of the Revolution up to the Girondin prescripts , when `` it devours it - self . ''

		Two of this series are here printed .

		It is fairly obvious that they read better than they would act .

		In his attempt to get away from the conven - tions of the theater ,
M. Rolland	PERSON	forgot the dramatic significance out of which they grew .

		The result is that instead of the vices of a solidified , mechanical production , the author has gone to the other ex - treme and given us plays in which the chief protag - onist is the people and we have a massive struc - ture , but gelatinous .


Rolland	PERSON	's instinct for defining character goes far toward saving these otherwise rather clumsy dramas .

		Hulin ,
Danton	PERSON	,
Desmoulins	PERSON	are drawn with power and precision .

		The historic interest of these plays goes back to the French , and lights up the Russian , Revolution .

		But they are material for the student rather than the mere spec - tator of drama .

		Not the least interesting portion of the volume is the introduction by the translator ,
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	.

		Two TOWNS ONE CITY .

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The title refers to
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	: the author , who died before his book was published , was a news - paper man who loved both .

		From an essentially < journalistic point of view he chronicled the events and portrayed the tendencies that seemed to indicate even before the war that Londoners and Parisians had much in common , and that they had a spiritual kinship .

		He succeeded admirably in transferring the emotions of the day to these papers , and in trans - lating racial reactions in terms of these emotions .

		His sketches of the two cities in the second year of the war are concerned with the attitude of the people , the observations of journalists and politicians , and the changed conditions arising from the tighten - ing of military and civil regulations .

		They are dramatic and humorous in turn , always human , and always interpretative of the best traditions of both peoples .

		Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	was an excellent propa - gandist ; indeed , if one may speak in terms of pota - tions , the book is one long draught of entente cordiale .

		THE THREE-CORNERED HAT .

		By
Pedro A. de Alencon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Our Anglo-Saxon fiction is not given to dealing very extensively with the cruder forms of amorous purpose .

		The novel since
Tom Jones	PERSON	has had to make up in elaborate characterization and invention of types for what the decencies of the age have demanded it sacrifice in the way of the endlessly amusing old motifs of intrigue and pursuit .

		Our reading public may be pardoned for forgetting that man may want woman enough to pursue her in a thoroughly wicked , determined , and delightful way that would be pragmatically impossible for Mr.
Stu	PERSON	- art
P. Sherman	PERSON	's ordinary honest citizen going about his business in the market-place .

		This little Span - ish tale would be piquant enough anywhere , but against the background of our respectable tradition
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 373 it is irresistible .

		The plot of the naughty old Corre - gidor against the miller 's wife , and the delicious un - ravelings of the farce in a scene that would have done honor to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, make up a story that is classic in its sparkle and wit .

		The author tells us that he first got it from an ignorant goatherd , who enter - tained a party with it .

		It is an ancient tale , and he heard many versions of it from the picaros of the farms and hamlets of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		`` The basis of the mat - ter is always the same , '' he says , `` tragi-comic , wag - gish , and terribly epigrammatic , like all those dra - matic lessons with a moral of which our people are so enamored . ''

		He has rescued it from the embellish - ments of vulgarity into which it often fell , and has made it truly `` delicious , discreet and beautiful , '' as he first heard it from the lips of his goatherd .

		Let no one think that `` delicious '' means `` immoral . ''

		No people enamored of a moral ever got a more thor - oughly satisfactory ending to a tale .

		The two vir - tuous wives are completely vindicated ; the wicked
Corregidor	LOCATION	is brought to utter confusion and ridicu - lous humiliation ; and the miller , after his trials , shows virtue again justified of her children .

		The Anglo-Saxon reader can enjoy it all with the clearest of consciences .

		And the introduction , by
Jacob S. Fassett	PERSON	, Jr. , the translator , acquaints him with a Spanish writer who must have been one of the most fascinating of men and authors .

		LIFE AND WORKS OF
OZIAS HUMPHRY	PERSON	,
R.A.	LOCATION	By
George C. Williamson	PERSON	.

		Limited edition .

		John Lane ;
$ 25	MONEY	.

		If you own a picture by
Ozias Humphry	PERSON	-LRB-
1743	DATE	-
1810	DATE	-RRB- or if you want to buy one or sell one , this is a book for you to have .

		The relationship of the size and expense of such a volume with the im - portance of its subject is only to be explained along such lines as I have just suggested .

		Without the collector of English pictures and , especially , without the dealer in them , a tome of the dimensions of this one would be out of the question , not alone today with labor and materials costing what they do , but at any time .


Ozias Humphry	PERSON	painted miniatures that rank well with those of the English school of the eight - eenth century ; occasionally in a drawing in san - guine he reaches a point where fine and delicate craftsmanship is supported by a genuine love of char - acter ; but as a rule he and his patrons were satisfied by a pretty conventional performance .

		To look at his best work is to sympathize with the pride which Englishmen have in their country , in the beauty of their women , and in the sturdiness of their men .

		But
Humphry	PERSON	bears witness also , through the quality of his painting and through his portrayal of his sitters , to the less admirable sides of English character its conventionalism , its slightness of real aptitude for expression in the graphic arts .

		Even at his time , when the country was at its best in painting , one feels how ill the British school fares in a comparison with those of the Continent .

		Humphry , while a minor member of his school , is sufficiently typical to warrant such a reflection .

		His life in
England	LOCATION	and in
India	LOCATION	; his connections with celebrated personages ; and the numerous letters , which form an unusually complete record of his career and surroundings , fur - nish ample material to his biographer , who has spared no pains in bringing out the interesting sides of it .

		EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHICAL RESEARCH .

		By
John Edgar Coover	PERSON	.


Stanford University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		The issues of `` psychical research '' have been treated in such a dilettante fashion that the mere size of Mr.
Coover	PERSON	's work with its more than 600 quarto pages crowded with curves , tables , and cal - culations will correct the baneful impression that the layman may safely enter where the expert treads most cautiously .

		The central issue is `` telepathy '' ; for with that hypothesis relegated to the limbo of myth , all the elaborate beliefs including it and tran - scending it crumble in a superstitious heap .

		An ample endowment has enabled Mr.
Coover	PERSON	to de - vote three years at
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	to a truly scientific research patient , minute , discerning , criti - cal yet sympathetic .

		The net issue is negative .

		There is no `` telepathy . ''

		The actual success found in the attempt to transfer the simplest ideas tallies with the estimates ascribable to chance .

		Nor does the utterly futile hypothesis that some gifted spirits have a power denied to better balanced mortals fare any better .

		So far as they submit themselves to the same conditions -LRB- which many refuse -RRB- they prove as negative as less presumptuous mortals .

		The ap - parent evidence for the belief is complex .

		Subcon - scious hints , faint suggestions , fallacies of memory , intentional , hysterical , and unintentional deception , and particularly the similar functioning of similar minds account for the excess of success above failure , when chance should make them alike .

		For this rea - son Mr.
Coover	PERSON	has made a special study of these habits , and an illuminating one .

		Teachers do not grade students , judges do not sentence culprits , as - tronomers do not estimate transits of stars , people do not report their ages according to the neutral fact , but color them by number-habits .

		In brief , we have all become expert in reading between the lines of faces and intentions , of words and gestures , of miens and expressions .

		Through this tendency , aided by coincidence , and strengthened by the mis - leading interest in successes and the ignoring of dull failures , as well as by the persistent primitive habit to interpret all things from stars to omens as per - sonally significant , the popular mind has built up a system of interpretation which it insists is real ; by such insistence and the support it finds in trained minds subject to the same inclinations , it has com - 374
November	DATE	2 pelled psychologists to consider the problem in the terms of popular interest .

		The verdict is now avail - able ; it always has been for those with a logical perspective of the meaning of proof .

		But it is now available in monumental form .

		If you really wish to establish `` telepathy , '' Mr.
Coover	PERSON	will show you what it means , in the way of patient research , to take even the first steps in such a demonstration .

		To oppose to such evidence a few casual and striking and obscure incidents that appeal to personal interest has always been an unwarranted procedure ; it is doubly so now .

		To suppose that the popular mind will now refrain from rash credulity , or that those who speculate to their own advantage upon this pleasant trait will find their dccupation gone , is an optimistic psychological conclusion .

		Mr.
Coover	PERSON	's volume is rather a heavy weapon to brandish , but its existence is a protection of sanity .

		RIGHT AND WRONG AFTER THE WAR .

		By Rev.
Bernard Iddings Bell	PERSON	.

		Houghton Mif - flin ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Statesmanlike priests have always realized that the Church can not lead merely by moving heavenward and calling upon all men to follow after it .

		Spirit - ual leadership consists rather in leaping to the head of an idealistic procession that is already on its way somewhere , and convincing its members that what they really mean and what they are really after is identical with your own message .

		In these days of the waning Church , when religion in the hands of
Billy Sunday	PERSON	has become a spiritual burlesque show , and in the hands of the average minister a mere bundle of pedestrian moralism and cheap consola - tions , it requires a good deal of a sprint for the re - ligious mind to get to the head of any vitally moving line .

		The stalwart Mr.
Bell	PERSON	however has succeeded in doing that very thing .

		He pushes theology , even the `` new '' theology , out of the way , and - says bluntly that the
Church	ORGANIZATION	must preach Jesus `` in the terms of the new day -LRB- the collectivist regime , he means -RRB- or else perish as a moral influence from the earth . ''

		He outdistances even the Christian Socialists , the Peabodys and the Rauschenbusches , and begins flatly with `` problems connected with the hunger and the sex urge . ''

		What would his spiritual forefathers say to this recognition of the needs of the natural man , to this tacit claim that it is the task of the Church so to influence society that these needs shall be satisfied ?

		This diverting theologian follows up his attacks on property , on poverty , even on alms - giving of any sort , with a demand that the Church support feminism , sex instruction , and even , quali - fiedly , contraception !

		The Church , he says , must envisage the community primarily as a nurturing - place for children .

		It must aid and not compete with other social movements .

		In other words , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, to save its soul , must pretty well lose it to those groups that have a broader vision than itself .

		Mr.
Bell	PERSON	's tone is as bold as if he were speaking for a majority of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		He sounds like a modern St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	.

		In his delving into life and attempting to apply religion to the actual facts , there is much the same attitude .

		He suggests the medieval theologian , too , in his summing up of each brief discussion with a stark Thesis , in italics , that no one can fail to understand .

		His Right after the War is to be a straight proletarian socialism .

		His wrong will be almost everything that the rich and respectable classes who support the Church now consider economically necessary and intellectually established by the tested experience of centuries .

Svante Arrhenius	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The destinies of the stars may be considered by many to be a subject far beyond the finite grasp of the mind ; yet since it is the problem of cosmic evolu - tion , it must of necessity attract our attention .

		Not many decades ago
John Fiske	PERSON	familiar - ized the public mind with the philosophical interpretation of the problem .

		Many essays have been written on the subject , but none with the profoundness of thought and literary ability of
Svante Arrhenius	PERSON	,
Sweden	LOCATION	's ' greatest physical scien - tist and philosopher , and Nobel prize winner in chemistry in the year
1903	DATE	.

		His latest book -LRB- pub - lished in
1915	DATE	, but only recently translated , because of the condition in
Europe	LOCATION	-RRB- is a welcome contribu - tion to the list treating the philosophical aspect of astronomy .

		The book is written in a style easily comprehended by the average intelligent layman .

		The opening chapter deals ' with the awakening of primitive man 's mind to a sense of its relationship to the universe -LRB- Origin of Star Worship -RRB- .

		The practical value of this awakening was soon demonstrated in the work - ing-out of means of measuring time , seasons , and space .

		This first chapter gives the historical back - ground without which no treatise , however well written , can be properly balanced .

		In the second chapter Dr.
Arrhenius	PERSON	has taken up one of the largest problems in astronomy today ; namely , the origin and nature of the Milky Way -LRB- `` Wintry Way '' in
Sweden	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		From the time of the early Greeks to the present it has taxed the powers of astronomers .

		This chapter , since it discusses prac - tically all the vital problems of modern astronomy , is the most interesting to the astronomer .

		There are included cosmological problems from the time of Anaxagoras to that of
Kant	PERSON	, and from the time of Herschel to the present ;
Kapteyen	ORGANIZATION	's star drifts ;
Pickering	ORGANIZATION	's statistics of zones ;
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's and
Moore	PERSON	's contributions to the study of planetary ne - bulae ; and the work of the
Mount Wilson Solar Observatory	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chapter III treats of the climatic im - portance of water vapor and its employment as a geological force in the evolution of the earth 's sur - 375 -LSB- Based on Official Documents -RSB-

November 1	DATE	face .

		Chapter IV applies the facts of geology thus gained to the stellar system .

		Its theme , in other words , is the atmosphere and physics of the stellar bodies .

		The conditions of the various planets and satellites are also discussed , as well as the after effect of separation from the original nebulous con - dition .

		The author is a master in this field because of his knowledge of physical chemistry .

		The planet Mars has always held both the scien - tific and the popular interest .

		No planet nor celestial object arouses more human interest .

		This is due of course to the supposed existence there of conditions suitable for the maintenance of life .

		Arrhenius dis - cusses the arguments for and against that supposi - tion in the light of all the latest available scientific knowledge upon the subject .

		His conclusions are based upon the facts , and principles established by the observations of both camps and investigated with thoroughness by himself , and his final word is that we must revise in their entirety our ideas about Mars .

		The belief that there exist color of vegeta - tion , seas , canals , and organic life , `` must nowadays take its place in the shadowy realm of dreams . ''

		The last chapter of the book is devoted to a study of the physical conditions of the two inner planets , Mer - cury and
Venus	PERSON	-LRB- between the sun and the earth -RRB- , and the
Moon	LOCATION	.

		Naturally the final stage of the cosmic process is included also .

		So brief a survey can not convey the vastness or the completeness of the evolutionary principles involved .

		No book however has brought this topic of cosmic order , from `` birth to death , '' so com - pletely within the grasp of the intelligent layman .

		One who seeks to know the results of the labors of astronomers , historically and philosophically , can find no better treatise .

		A REPORTER AT
ARMAGEDDON	LOCATION	.

		By Will Ir - win .

		Appleton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In the midst of the mad medley of books which insist upon explaining just how the war must be won , and where it must be won , and how victory must be lassoed and tethered and broken to the har - ness of a new era , it is rather a welcome respite to turn to a volume which looks at the war solely through a quick pair of eyes particularly when the eyes are divided by a nose for news .

		The nose for news is sometimes put out of joint , at the front to judge by the product of some of the correspondents but
Will Irwin	PERSON	appears to have kept a saneness of vision .

		This reporter at Armageddon drops across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to
Spain	LOCATION	, then into
France	LOCATION	, thence to
Swit	PERSON	- zerland and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	contrives to crowd his narrative with much interesting detail , without ap - pearing to strive for needless emotional effects .

		He understands the value of a plain , unrhetorical recital of events and incidents which are quite sufficiently charged with feeling in themselves .

		The things of which he tells have no need to be in the
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	phrase `` splashed all over with trowelsful of slabby and mortarish '' fine writing .

		The book is , naturally , of no value as a contribu - tion to the literature of war .

		Journalism can hardly aspire to that elevation .

		But it is highly readable and alive with impressions , and now and then touched with apt phrasing , as when he speaks of the tendency of all the capitals of western
Europe	LOCATION	with the exception of
Madrid	LOCATION	to be a bit standard - ized .

		`` No sooner does a fashion start in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' he writes , `` than it is copied somberly in
London	LOCATION	, stren - uously in
Berlin	LOCATION	where the specialty is being gay with your teeth clenched merrily in
Vienna	LOCATION	, and decorously in
Stockholm	LOCATION	. ''

		THE AMATEUR VAGABOND .

		By
John	PERSON	and
Robert Matter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		On the face of this record , it is quite possible to circumvent the globe and remain immune to prac - tically everything but conversation .

		Nearly all the impressions received by the protagonist are received through aural channels and transmitted to the printed page under a guard of quotation marks .

		The young college man wants to `` get away from it all , '' to `` stand square '' on his own feet , and `` come to grips with the world . ''

		Even worse than that , he wants to `` see all kinds and conditions of people and to live and work and talk to them on their own plane and to try to understand them . ''

		You have already guessed that he wants to `` find himself . ''

		So he crosses to
England	LOCATION	on a cattle boat , and there flips a coin to determine whether he will go to
China	LOCATION	or to
Australia	LOCATION	.


Australia	LOCATION	wins .

		As for
London	LOCATION	, `` the days and nights were like sections of a moving picture ; he felt himself an observer , look - ing upon life as upon a film , experiencing nothing which touched him closely , thinking all the while that what he saw was not in reality happening be - fore his eyes . ''

		As for journey to
Australia	LOCATION	: The ship passed
Gibraltar	LOCATION	, touched at
Algiers	LOCATION	, and headed across the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	for
Genoa	LOCATION	.

		There a hundred Italian , Austrian , and Spanish emigrants came aboard .

		Jack endeavored to count the number of children that accompanied them , but the youngsters moved about so spryly he was forced to abandon his tally before he reached the total of seventy-five .

		Here is the sort of traveler , you will observe , who stands more in need of an adding machine than of eyes .

		From
Australia	LOCATION	we trail the vagabond to Van - couver and thence home in a reminiscent mood .

		-LRB- See Epilogue , page 339 . -RRB-

		`` I have been wondering what the trip taught me , '' he says , voicing a wonder which the reader heartily shares .

		I have n't everything clearly thought out yet , but I shall have some day .

		I know this much right now .

		I am a different boy from the one who left this room last Jan - uary .

		I have obtained what I went after .

		I have become acquainted with myself and I know that I have changed .

		Yes , for the better .

		With some books ^ quotation is the kindest criticism .

		378 THE-DIAL
November 2	DATE	OLD TRUTHS AND NEW FACTS .

		By Dr.
Charles E. Jefferson	PERSON	.

		Revell ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		An outstanding religious leader has constructed another book , Old Truths and New Facts , to deal with Prayer , the Bible , the Church , Missions , and Jesus Christ from the slant of war language .

		Our theological Homer nods and writes without his usual thought or power .

		His points of view are good those of the liberal religious thinker who - takes a sensible social attitude to Christianity , and to the necessity of reinterpreting that great faith to meet our modern needs .

		But the book lacks incisive thought and prophetic passion , either one of which should be present in a volume turned loose on an economizing war public .

		OUR ADMIRABLE BETTY .

		By
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		The historical romance is by no means dead .

		Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	still finds the eighteenth century a very prof - itable field .

		Only he takes it less seriously than did his forerunners of a dozen years ago , and makes the romance the thing , and not the history .

		When one has a command of the pseudo-archaic English of that olden time , and can sprinkle one 's pages with `` B'gad ! ''

		and '' ` Od 's body '' and `` Demme , '' and can create impossibly ravishing gentlemen in ruffles and silk-skirted coats of velvet , in worked satin and brocade , with the glossy curls of huge periwigs , there is no reason why one should not write an amusing story merely by exposing a divine young creature to the gallant pursuit of a company of these ravishing gentlemen .

		It is all the more interesting if one lets one 's beautiful
Betty	PERSON	lose her heart to a shabby wounded Major of forty-one who has retired to a bachelor life in his manor house , there to write his History of Fortification in ten volumes .

		Ripe cher - ries and a boundary wall furnish the piquant be - ginning of the adventure , and the rival lovers give the Major some stirring times .

		Romance unabashed and extravagant stalks through Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	's pages .

		And although the book is so very much of the made - to-order kind , it has the verve and charm of the best samples of that commodity .

		Once you give yourself over to romance you could do far worse than sur - render to Our Admirable Betty .

		AN AMERICAN FAMILY .

		By
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	.

		Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1	MONEY	.50 .

		Mr.
Webster	PERSON	is no dabbler in the art of fiction , and here he has acquitted himself with undeniable skill .

		Dealing with the substance of mid-Western industrial life the clash of antagonistic classes and of antagonistic ideals he has given us a thoroughly waked-up novel , a novel which is Wellsian in the zest with which it tackles sociological problems .

		And like several of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	' heroes , his central character attains the wrong marriage first , and sub - sequently makes the splinters fly in the process of extrication .

		These intellectual protagonists some - how are seldom gifted with the knack of falling into ultimate love at first sight ; they have to be schooled in love .

		The `` family '' of Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's novel is a
Chicago	LOCATION	product of wealth a three-generation as - sortment with a tradition , and with its narrownesses neither too emphasized nor too darkly painted .

		One son of the third generation fails to fit into the family scheme and epitomizes his revolt by falling in love with an anarchist 's daughter a fiery , pas - sionate agitator who spreads disorganization into the family factory and dismay to the family hearth .

		Their marriage is a failure from the start and drifts from indifference to tragedy .

		The author has let himself in for some violent effects toward the climax of his story , but the sincerity of their telling clears them of sensationalism .

		Meanwhile he shows a fine sense of character , and the conflicts of his narrative are illuminated with incisive sympathy .

		There is nothing casual about his handling of industry , despite a somewhat journalistic incorporation of materials which are so recent as almost to be newsy .

		LOVE ETERNAL .

		By
H. Rider Haggard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1A50	MONEY	.

		When a man has written forty-four novels , his vein may be pardoned for running a little thin .

		But one would scarcely expect from H. Rider Haggard so very bad a story as Love Eternal .

		His object is evidently to bring comfort and consolation of a spiritual nature to his unimaginative readers af ^ flicted by the war .

		But in this enterprise he is forced to introduce an absurd `` spiritualism '' and a most unconvincing sacrifice of love .

		Godfrey , the young hero , falls into the hands of a medium in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, where he has been sent to school by his hard-hearted clergyman father .

		The good pastor with whom he is studying releases him dramatically from her wiles and exorcises the devils that lurk around her .

		Made independent by the bequest of another spiritualist lady who has taken a fancy to him ,
Godfrey	PERSON	returns home to
England	LOCATION	, only to be torn from his love
Isobel	PERSON	by the connivance of his father and hers , the selfish baronet .

		So they vow never to see each other till both the fathers are dead .

		Godfrey goes to war , is wounded , and gets his
Iso	ORGANIZATION	- bel at last !

		She had known from the first that `` theirs was the Love Eternal . ''

		But he is sent away to
Africa	LOCATION	, takes fever , is visited by his now dead
Isobel	PERSON	, and soon joins her `` in the Land of that Love Eternal which the soul of Isobel foreknew . ''

		The medium pursues him with prophecies through life , and a ghastly white spirit girl named
Eleanor	PERSON	an - noys him too .

		They furnish not only the desirable thrills , but apparently also the desirable evidence of the existence of another life .

		Those who enjoy the style of the author of The Rosary will find Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	's latest work congenial .

		Freedom is now being born as truly as there is eternal justice .

		England deserves not to be cursed , but to be blessed , for

		The Allied democratic nations are not our enemies .

		By
Ralph Ber	PERSON	- gengren .

		Atlantic Monthly Press ; 75 cts .

		Like the stories of
W. W. Jacobs	PERSON	or the verse of
James Stephens	PERSON	, this slender volume will vouchsafe its richest yield if it be read aloud .

		For the best reaction it ought to be perused indoors , the ideal audience being that to which one is married .

		How - ever , those who have not arrived at or who have exceeded that state will find ample to enjoy in the little sheaf of household divertissements .

		There are more than half a dozen of them all in the same mood and manner and they fall comfortably within the time limits of one sitting .

		Several of them are reprinted from the Contributors ' Club of the At - lantic Monthly .

		The Comforts of Home is by a man , but he has not restricted himself to the masculine domain .

		For after an amusing dip into the exigencies of moving and getting settled , he passes on to consider the fur - nace `` the monster on the floor of the cellar , im - passive as
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, and apparently holding up the house with as many arms as an octopus '' and Tie does not disdain to react to attics , and kitchens , and bathrooms , and guest chambers , and open fires .

		All these sketches are marked with happy turns of phrasing , with a style that is informal and personal , and with undeviating lightness .

		At no time pre - tentious , they frequently display a welcome and in - cisive wit .

		Only in dealing with plumbers does the author reveal a flagging inspiration .

		But plumbers are hardly the stuff to evoke any muse .

1917	DATE	-RRB- .

		In a recent issue of THE DIAL Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	defined the functions of romanticism and of realism as , on the one hand , `` to delight with beauty '' and , on the other , `` to amaze with understanding . ''

		The latter felicity is less to be expected of those whose primary concern is with the blind forces of emotion rather than with the lucidities of the intellect .

		And yet the poet who cares only for beauty betrays it by a lim - ited vision , while the realist who ignores it is no more amazing than are certain successes of instinct - ive behavior .

		Nietzsche 's most terrible analyses are scarcely softened * by his power over the German language .

		Yeats ' fluent music is most commanding when he catches truth in his net of images .

		Indeed the poet 's faculty for revealing the universe would seem to be in inverse ratio to his desire to embrace it .

		The light of ages is likely to vanish under bushels of metaphysics .

		These convictions are strengthened by the sigh - ings and shriekings of such a Neo-Nietzschean as
Benjamin De Casseres	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not that he yearns for love - liness .

		He seems to take a morbid joy in the leering of lean and filthy specters .

		Far from seeing the world in a grain of sand , he readily reduces it to a pebble in his shoe .

		He appears to be on more inti - mate terms with pain than with poetry , and his attempt to relieve his agonies by screaming in upper - case letters is more to be pitied than encouraged .

		Not his despair in the face of a universe which he views as a slaughter-house hidden in a rose-bower but the stupidity of his revolt against stupidity is condemned .

		His book is `` not poetry in the proper sense of the word ... it is a bit of spiritual autobiography . ''

		It is really an epitome of the help - less wrath of the adolescent for the first time aware of the malignancy of life .

		Mr.
De Casseres	PERSON	is the little-boy-who-can ` t-get-over-it .

		One wonders if he could find release in the free man 's worship so splendidly declared by
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, or whether the only salvation that remains for him is the anni - hilation he wretchedly contemplates .

		CHARLOTTE
BREWSTER JORDAN	PERSON	Dr.
S. Parkes Cadman	PERSON	, addressing the
Bedford Branch	ORGANIZATION	of the

Vicente Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	strikes a deeper note than
Wells	PERSON	or any other English-speaking romanticist in ` The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ' ... its story is deeply moving , ... an epic eluci - dating instead of clouding the painful perplexities men endure ... Justice is done to the immortal spirit of
France	LOCATION	in the day of her trial and her glory ... Here you meet the animalistic existence of the rich ranchman of the Argentine Republic ; the per - fumed fop of the Boulevards who forsakes the lures of vice and follows the cross of sacrifice ; the afflicted parent who groans beneath its load and dies ten thousand deaths in the death of a beloved son ; the vain , frivolous woman who saves herself by yielding to the spiritual impulses war creates ; the German philosopher with be-spectacled face and long hair who is at once a pedant and a brute ; the Russian exile whose vision surveys the awful prospects with a prophetic insight , an inerrant penetration .

J. H. JOWETT	PERSON	,

D.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , thus expresses his opinion concerning MAN 'S SUPREME INHERITANCE By
F. MATTHIAS ALEXANDER	PERSON	With a Foreword by Professor
JOHN DEWEY	PERSON	Dr.
J. H. JOWETT	PERSON	writes !

		`` MR. ALEXANDER HAS GIVEN US A WORK OF RARE AND ORIGINAL VALUE .

		His philosophy unveils a deliverance from the untutored and unintelligent sub - consciousness in which we are all more or less enslaved , and he opens out the prospect of an enlightened subconsciousness through the ministry of conscious guidance and control .

		Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	's philosophy seems to me to be entirely sound . '

		It does not hang in the air ; it moves on the earth .

		He shows how it can be directed to the re-educating of those whose subconscious life is a blind creation .

		But far better stilf , he applies it to the education of the young before these perversities have arisen .

		The large acceptance of his principles would revolutionize the early training in our schools .

		Here , at any rate , is a very arresting expo - sition of a theory and method which would redeem the individual from the mastery of non - intelligent forces in his life , and bring mind and body into the co-ordinated health of vital fellowship .

		IT IS A VERY ILLUMINATING BOOK AND ABOUNDS IN VIS - ION AND PRACTICAL SUGGESTION . ''

		Professor
RICHARD MORSE HODGE	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, writes in the
New York	LOCATION	Times : `` No book could have a greater subject nor a better title .

		Here is a book of basic signifi - cance to physiology , psychology , education , and every sphere of contemporary life ... Everyone is interested in his own development and in that of the race .

		To this problem the author has made a distinct contribution , based upon first-hand information ... Par - ents will be especially interested in the chapters on Race Culture and the Training of Chil - dren ... The athlete may learn not a little from this book of how to handle himself in his sport .

		The golfer will appreciate its pages and what they record regarding the position of mechanical advantage and the light they shed by indirect illumination upon the vexed question of why he goes off his game and why he does not improve his play .

		The plowman should be no less interested in the position of mechanical advantage than the golfer .

		As a brain worker , however , a man stands to gain most of all . ''

		Professor
FRANK GRANGER	PERSON	, D.Litt. ,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Professor of Classics and Philoso - phy -LRB- Eng . -RRB-

		I `` MR. ALEXANDER HAS MADE AN ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE VERY GREATEST VALUE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE ... I am obliged for the op - portunity of making acquaintance with the work of so original a thinker ... One of the most urgent needs of the present time is the profounder analysis of the causes which determine the habitual movements of human beings .

		In the absence of adequate knowledge in this field , the ground is left open to empirical and one-sided attempts to remedy the obvious disturb - ances of the normal course of human development .

		Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	indeed is concerned with the borderland which both separates and unites mental and physiological processes .

		Leav - ing for the moment physiological processes out of account , I have been much impressed by what seems to me a most valuable contribution to psychology ; a contribution the more needed because , if
M. Alexander	PERSON	is working on right lines , we must call a halt to all those who , under various banners and pretexts , have been eliminating recently from edu - cation the elements of conscious control .

		Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	has accumulated a large store of experience and he seems to me singularly successful in giving a clear expression to the important results that have disclosed themselves to him .

		1 i THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Will
Russia	LOCATION	Defeat Us ?

		IVUSSIA is NOW challenging and will shortly test our democratic good faith .

		And if we fail to meet that test , we shall pay a severe penalty ; our coming decision as to our treatment of her after the peace with
Germany	LOCATION	will determine whether we are to reap the fruits of victory in a lasting peace or whether in obstinate and passionate stupidity we are recklessly to throw them away .

		Nor is this state - ment extreme , for even conservative opinion has come to agree that although the war has been won in the West , it may yet be lost in the
East	LOCATION	.

		No one questions the momentousness of the issue : the dispute is solely over the wisest method of meeting it .

		Neither does one question that somehow or other we shall meet it : the only doubt is whether or not we shall meet it consciously and with firm democratic purpose .

		Surely it is not irrelevant to plead that we examine now , and revise if necessary , our present policy so that we jnay not discover our - selves in a situation where , through gradual and but half understood commitments , we find it im - possible either to retreat or to go forward .

		So long as
Germany	LOCATION	was a mtenace , any plea for revision or clear statement of our Russian policy might perhaps justifiably be waived .

		But now that
Germany	LOCATION	has been defeated , and along with her the satellite powers which she dragged to ruin , the time has come to ask straightforwardly : What do we mean to do about
Russia	LOCATION	?

		When Prussian mili - tarism has been reduced to impotence , two enemies even greater remain to be conquered the old enemy of hunger and its camp follower , anarchy .


Russia	LOCATION	, according to the conventional view , contains both these enemies in abundant measure .

		How are we to win victory over them ?

		The reactionaries and enemies of democracy already have their answer ready continue the present half-hearted military intervention and make it more severe ; overthrow the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	and restore `` orderly '' governments ; when this has been accomplished , send food and economic assistance to rehabilitate the country .

		Meanwhile , of course , root out every trace of Ger - man influence in that unhappy country .

		Then the skies will be bright , and trade and commerce -LRB- with us , naturally -RRB- will flourish .


Russia	LOCATION	will have peace and democracy and bread and an economic system like our own , which we can understand and appre - ciate and do business with .

		Now there are two answers to this sanguine commercial proposal .

		The first answer is that whatever may have been the real reason for our military intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	, the ostensible reason the reason avowed by our own government and to which we are bound as a matter of honor , until it shall be formally changed was a reason quite different .

		The
United States	LOCATION	has distinctly stated as its belief that military intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	was more calculated to bring disorder and chaos to that unhappy country than to mitigate what disorder might already exist there .

		From that position , so far as any statement from our government goes , we have not yet receded .

		We consented reluctantly to a limited degree of military intervention for a single purpose to protect the Czecho-Slovak troops .

		That purpose has already been accomplished .

		The Soviet Government has formally promised that what few Czecho-Slovak troops remain in
Great Russia	LOCATION	, not already under Japanese or Allied protection , will be allowed free and uninterrupted passage back to their own country , which is now a political as it has always been a geographical reality .

		It may be objected that the promises of the Soviet Government are worthless .

		Possibly , but their foreign minister has already asked the Allies for terms of an armis - tice , and one of those terms , with the adequate guar - antees , could easily be the protection and safe trans - portation of the remaining Czecho-Slovak troops to the Galician frontier .

		If the Allies care to deal with the Soviet Government at all , the protection of the Czecho-Slovak troops will be a comparatively simple matter .

		What we solemnly said we entered
Russia	LOCATION	for , it is now easy to attain .

		It is however the second answer to the proposal of the reactionaries which comes to grips with the situation .

		As far as the policy outlined above has been followed , it has failed to work .

		Only those so wilfully blind that they will not see have been slow to observe that Bolshevism can not be destroyed by any such weak instrument as an army .

		Ger - many could not do it .

		The further she flung her THE DIAL armies into revolutionary
Russia	LOCATION	, the stronger be - came the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	.

		The further the Allies pene - trate into
Russia	LOCATION	, the more firmly do the peasants rally to the Bolshevik banner .

		For Bolshevism is not merely the reign of terror of revolution , as our press would seemingly like to have us believe .

		Its roots lie deeper .

		Whatever its formal tenets of faith , it is primarily the philosophy of the under dog .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	and the Near East and the
Balkans	LOCATION	and the territory of what used to be
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	the under dog is the peasant .

		His philosophy may be expressed in one word land .

		He wants land as the hungry man wants food .

		It is an irony of the present situation that a creed which is theoret - ically a Marxian and industrial socialism has proved in actual practice to be the public expression of a deep agrarian revolt , to be the offshoot of basic agrarian injustice .

		If ever ` the class warfare on which it rests should invade a highly organized and industrialized country say
Germany	LOCATION	then it would be in very truth the `` proletarian '' revolution which it is now somewhat too glibly called .

		And as basic injustice is done not merely to peasants and farmers , the likelihood of its invading other coun - tries is not entirely remote .

		Already it has spread to
Bulgaria	LOCATION	-LRB- in spite of peace -RRB- ; it has shown its teeth in the new Jugo-Slavia and German
Austria	LOCATION	; there are stirrings even in
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		When the intoxication of the wine of successful nationalism in Czecho-Slovakia shall have given way to the more enduring necessities for bread and clothes , it may even appear there .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	itself Liebknecht is the greatest of popular heroes , and the Majority Socialists tremble before the approaching specter .

		Already , in fact , the revolution in
Germany	LOCATION	has .

		taken a sharp turn to the left .

		Bolshevism thrives on the disillusions awakened by military defeat .

		In a word , we are confronted with a situation where the militarist solution offers no solution at all .

		We can not crush Bolshevism by force of arms .

		We can only hold it in leash until it has an oppor - tunity to break out again with redoubled force .

		If we are honest in our wish to exorcise it , we must recognize the basic needs from which it springs .

		The first need is for fair play .

		No league of nations can endure which is not founded on that : a Holy Alliance may endure temporarily , but no league of free natiohs .

		It is precisely a
Holy Alli	ORGANIZATION	- ance which the reactionaries of this country and of the Entente countries are already advocating .

		Con - sider : we are to police in addition to our normal tasks of caring for
Africa	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines , and the less stable Central American republics we are to police and feed
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	, the
Balkans	LOCATION	, all the lands included in the old
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and now
Russia	LOCATION	as well .

		In other words , if we follow the logic of our interven - tion in
Russia	LOCATION	to its conclusion and if the enemy countries develop signs of Bolshevist socialism , we shall shortly have on our hands the task of feeding and policing and `` giving '' political and economic in - stitutions to practically all of
Europe	LOCATION	, all of
Africa	LOCATION	, and all of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		And when we say `` we '' we can mean only the
United States	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		We are to form ourselves into a Holy Alliance against all forms of radical socialism and embarrassing economic and industrial philosophies .

		The world is to be made over in our image , irre - spective of whether it wants `` ft or not .

		Of course this is absurd and ridiculous .

		Of course it can not be done .

		Yet it is precisely the program to which we are committing ourselves unless we sharply mod - ify our policy , as dt is most characteristically exhibit - ing itself in the case of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		This will not be a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	; it will `` be a mockery .

		It will not and can not endure .

		Even if we press into service the German reactionaries as some papers shame - lessly suggested when they advocated that Ger - man troops should not withdraw from the
Ukraine	LOCATION	,
Lithuania	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Finland	LOCATION	, and the other Baltic provinces until `` stable '' governments had been carefully left behind it is doubtful whether the tenure of such a Holy Alliance could be more than three or four years .

		The peoples of this country and
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	did not , after all , sacrifice their blood for the privilege of creating this kind of a new balance of power .

		It is not the type of
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	which President
Wilson	PERSON	ever contemplated ; it is not what the great bulk of peoples in their hearts really want .

		We entered the war to crush the menace of German imperialism .

		It is crushed .

		We have won the war .

		How long will French or British or Italian - or our own troops now in
France	LOCATION	be content to police three continents in the interests of a specific kind of economic system ?

		How long will we here at home , or the families of the war-weary soldiers in the countries now asso - ciated with us , wait for the return of our men ?

		If we have to wait until the world is made over , I am afraid it will be a long time .

		It will be odd if someone does n't become impatient .

		The statesmen who are now concluding peace ought never to for - get that the main object of the war has been achieved , and that it is neither the wish nor the intention of the great mass of democratic peoples to be organized into an international police force to determine the way of life and the conditions of .

		economic and in - dustrial development for the many nations of the world .

		1918 399 For the truth is that the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	must rest upon that kind of fair play which allows a cer - tain margin of freedom for every nation
Russia	LOCATION	included .

		Nations have different economic habits ; different degrees of industrial development ; differ - ent aspirations towards the ideal social life .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is after all a league of nations , as a society is a community of different individuals : as long as the common law is obeyed , as long as the international interest for world peace is properly safeguarded by respect for the international author - ity , it is certainly the right of different nations , as it is certainly to the interest of the world , that they should not only have their own cultural au - tonomy but that they should try as many social and economic experiments as are consistent with the wider necessity for general world peace .

		We can not allow debts to be wantonly repudiated , but who doubts that if
Russia	LOCATION	were left to free development she would some day restore all she canceled in her hour of agony and humiliation ?

		Democratic , even radical , nations are in the long run better interna - tional risks than autocratic ones .

		We can not allow nations to act as agents provocateurs and stir up in - ternal trouble in their neighbors ' territories , but who doubts again that
Russia	LOCATION	would gladly recall all her revolutionary agitators in return for the privilege of being let alone to work out her own experiment ?

		We have not been fair to
Russia	LOCATION	, and it is now high time to begin , if we wish the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	to be a lasting reality .

		Because
Russia	LOCATION	presents typ - ically , if in aggravated form , the kind of problem a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will constantly confront .

		Here is the test of our good faith and belief in the ability and right of peoples to determine their own destiny .

		We can afford to be , if not generous , at least sym - pathetic and understanding .

		It is not the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	that anyone cares for or would even plead for , any more than one would plead for any special ` political party .

		It is the
Soviet Republic	LOCATION	that presents us with our problem .

		First , let us get the truth about it .

		We have had our press censored and our news cut off for so long that not even those best ac - quainted with Russian conditions today venture to express any opinion .

		We are deprived of all the essential facts necessary to make a fair judgment ; we are allowed only dubious documents .

		But cer - tain things we do know .

		We know that the Soviets have done many far-reaching and constructive things .

		We also know that they have asked to cooperate with us in the rehabilitation of the economic and industrial life of their country .

		They have offered to do so in a spirit of fair play .

		Their official news - papers and manifestoes speak of the offers they have made , one of the latter concluding `` let them -LSB- the Allies -RSB- help us to reorganize our railways and eco - nomic life . ''

		Can we not afford to make the at - tempt ?

		Must we dictate , not only to those who have been our enemies , but even to those who , in spite of misrepresentation and slander , are eager to become our friends ?

		The challenge is real , and we should do well to ponder the answer .

		We can , of course , haughtily say no .

		But it will not be in this spirit that a real
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	can be created , or if created , can endure .

		HAROLD STEARNS .

		Tribal Esthetics IN THE LIFE of the American Indian all expression symbolizes itself in the form of the dance .

		It is the solemn high mass of the Indian soul , to which he brings his highest gifts for adoration .

		I have re - cently seen on two occasions the dance of the corn the blessing of the young corn to ' a bountiful frui - tion which though extremely simple in form is a very handsome demonstration of Indian grace and beauty .

		We owe the presence of these forms in our midst , centuries old , to the divine idea of the neces - sity of survival .

		It is inherent in all mankind to want to write its autograph upon the face of the earth before returning to it again , and those who hold in any degree to their forefathers ' fine traditions of the spirit of preservation feel more impressively the need of recording them .

		And as pou look at the older men of the tribe , and see the gifts of the centuries on their calm cheeks and brows , and the aristocratic distinction which is so much a part of all their actions and appearances , you feel something of regret that there is an obvious laxity of interest in old customs and forms .

		You do not feel the tribal sense in the dances , for it is in other efficiencies that the tribe is interested , other traits that beguile it , other notions of wealth and order and gayety .

		And you know , as you look upon these dances , that you may be one among the rare few to have witnessed these fine ceremonials ; that soon regrettably soon they will have come to an end ; and that if these charming shows shall by sheer insistence survive , there must be other spaces devised in which to perpetuate them , another and more spiritual regime prevailing .

		The dance is not merely a survival : it is a rare 4OO THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	expression eternalizing itself ; it is the draftsmanship of the Indian soul insisting on perpetuation .

		And what seems to the casual and unperceptive eye to be a wholly barbaric outpouring of excessive energy is entirely another thing .

		It is an organized rhythmic conception and esthetic composition , spirit and body harmonized to symbolize certain laws , faiths , even creeds , since all this tends toward the quality of worship in their so ardent desires .

		Thus the dance is not to these people a form of gay exer - cise ; it is wholly a bodily conception of a beautifully lofty spiritual idea .

		It is the harmonization of every muscle of the body toward a rhythmical expression of the various ideas that inspire them war , peace , fruition , among the themes .

		Even as a spectator you are made to feel that every movement and every vocal variation in song is of impressive significance , that they are profoundly religious first of all and last of all and admit of no levity of intention or of laxity of devotion .

		Hence it is , if you are a kind watcher and you are expected to be a kind watcher in the sense of being an earnest and interested watcher that you find yourself witnessing rare and beautiful episodes in the history of a great people , the significance of which you can not hope to draw to yourself .

		Seldom has one a clear knowledge of their language or even of their symbolism , for they speak their own tongue among themselves and with extreme ratity admit the alien to the world of their ideas and meanings .

		This is their spiritual aristocracy ; they do not think us fit for their society excepting in a very casual sense , and they are cautious of how far you shall be let in to their spiritual halls .

		During the two days in which I write they are dancing the dance of the young corn , which is danced several times a
summer	DATE	.

		It is the
July	DATE	episode yesterday for the Santiagos and
today	DATE	for the San - tanas .

		As in the
June	DATE	episode , the dance was espe - cially for the Juans of the tribe , the dance being given before the door of each family of that name .

		In the coming ^ week there will be the dance of the
San Domingo Indians	LOCATION	; at the end of
September	DATE	, the dance of
Geronimo	LOCATION	; at a later date , the famous snake dance of the Hopis .

		The Pueblos patriotically offered their services for the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	and gave one of their rarest dances on the
evening	TIME	of
July 4	DATE	at the hour of sunset , certainly one of the most beautiful spectacles , brief though it was , which I have ever witnessed .

		It is called the dance of mercy .

		It is the dance in its original form , as it has been given during the run of the centuries .

		It has been seen in this vicinity but two or three times in twenty-five years .

		Apparently it is a dance which the Indians do not wish the world to see too often ; it was danced this time as a special concession of the chiefs of the tribe .

		Its protagonists are two men of excellent physique , and of very gifted powers of expression the body of each of them painted in halves , one half a warm tawny reddish earth tone with black stripes painted tigerlike at intervals down the entire right half ; and the other half a light greenish hue ; eyes heavily striped with blue and yellow rays , with small dots of red now and then close to them each holding a strange kind of shield shape , of rich colors , some - what decorated , with many trappings suspended from the headdress .

		Each man is led with a long bahd of multicolored hues by two little girls , the most beautiful of that age in the tribe certainly , richly costumed also , and beautifully painted .

		The two children symbolize the fact that since the warring tribes are now at peace they may be led docilely by little children .

		It is impossible to transmit the splendor and dra - matic intensity of this spectacle , lasting not over fifteen minutes .

		It is quite beyond the fluency of words to register the precise beauty exhibited there - in .

		It will suffice to say that when it was finished you had the sense of having been let in upon a bit of sacred history , something which only a very small number in the world outside themselves had been permitted to witness for the Indian is essen - tially a secretive person .

		He is the discoverer of the secret and the keeper of the secret He must be sure of his friend before confiding anything .

		And you also had the feeling that you were witness to one of the most beautiful bits of organized expression it is possible to see , for these two men were unques - tionably artists of the first degree , and were highly reverenced by the older men of the tribe for their skill in interpretation .

		There was reverence on the faces of the younger Indians present , and there was serenity on the wrinkled cheeks of the older and quietly passing chieftains of the tribe .

		And as you watched the old captain declaiming to them in their own language as they danced rhythmical lines of deep beauty of sound you could only say to your - self that you understood nothing from first to last , but that what your eye beheld was beautiful beyond the reach of words in any language .

		And through it all you felt that here was the history of your native land enacted for your pleasure , written in the very language of the sun and the moon and the sky , the birds and the flowers , rain and running rivers , and that it was in this tongue that they might surely speak with each other to a perfect understanding .

		There was the glimpse of this little spectp.cle of a great civilization , probably one of the finest in history , and soon , or comparatively soon ,
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 401 to pass out of existence , out of the ken of the visible world forever into a religious silence , the dignity of which would be little appreciated in the new years to come .

		And most of all you could feel the great beauty of their own esthetic creation , a form evolved by themselves out of their own peculiar needs , having nothing whatever to do with a world so alien to them in all ways .

		And when they Come to the house - tops to watch their good father , the sun , pass down over a trembling horizon on his regally effulgent way , wrapping their cloaks around them , wrapping themselves obviously away from the contamination of a world so foreign to them you feel with them also that their father is a godlike parent , bringing them nothing but good , if they but conduct them - selves well in his radiance .

		There is solemnity in the going and the coming of the red men ; there is an age to their movements , and there is the smile of thousands of years in the smile they confer upon you , a smile natural because it is like the free sky under which they live .

		There is a frankness of speech in the glance that runs over you as they look up and down your person , and a quick perception of character tabulated in their minds when the instant is gone .

		And you rest your jaded senses in a wealth of eternal meanings that attach to every action of theirs .

		You feel that at last here is a people in accord with the universe , wanting little or nothing from a world of invented subter - fuge , being the equal of the very dawn and of the going down of the sun , vastly superior to all the hosts of vulgarities with which we , who belong to the newer civilization , befool ourselves .

		In their dance is the tribal esthetic expression of all these dignified significances ; their dance is the gesture of the body which gives the meaning of the centuries , and their songs are the self-created melodies which they have sung to their deities for these thousands of years .

		They have completed their own civiliza - tion with a beautifully conceived esthetic , and out of this esthetic they have built a conduct that fits the day and the hour and the moment , beyond even the reaches of infinity .

		It is a pity that we who have replaced them shall not know them ; it is a pity that we who have too much of civilization can not begin our scheme over again upon some such simple lines as they have evolved so beautifully .

		It is a bit pathetic that a form so useful to them shall be forever nothing but a so-called dance of barbarism to us ; that we shall see nothing in their rhythms except an idling of time and a too excessively energetic extravagance .

		It would be an idle heresy for us to think really of the corn as a being who can be assisted to fruition by the offering of a dance , and yet it is ineffably beautiful and certain in its esthetic effect .

		It is a life of an - ciently splendid ritual , and we of this time have lost the gift of ritual .

		We are without the power to cele - brate the simple experience .

		We have no ceremony for our vision .


MARSDEN HARTLEY	PERSON	.

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	and the New Diplomacy T HE ETHICS of honor and dignity , the idealization of their assertion and defense , are deeply ingrained in the minds of all the ruling classes whether their rule is the direct rule of governors or the more efficacious indirect rule of opinion and sentiment .

		This morale of pride and fear is most deeply em - bedded in all that concerns the relationships of states to one another .

		In contrast , the ethics of industry and of reciprocal contractual service are lacking in prestige .

		They seem too prosaic , utilitarian , and ma - terialistic to possess moral status .

		They lack glam - our and romance ; they are not glorified by the halo that reflects historic sacrifice and heroism in their behalf .

		We can not easily conceive them as the sub - ject matter of poetry and legend .

		And so far are men from actuation in their conduct by calculation of self-interest that nothing which does not become the stuff of poetry and passion can command full allegiance .

		Those who are skeptical about the possibility of a reversal of moral prestige with respect to these two principles would do well to recall that Ger - many has sincerely regarded itself as the idealist among modern nations , and has contemptuously con - sidered the
United States	LOCATION	as the materialistic and commercial people .

		This fact may develop hospital - ity to the recognition that what is morally at stake is a conflict of ideas and idealizations inherited from feudalism with those which express the transition to a democratic ordering of life .

		This being the case , it requires only a courageous expression of the newer morale of industry and commerce to insure that in tirrie poetry , glamour , and romance will become attached to it also .

		For these things , import - ant as they are , are not self-generated nor substan - tial .

		They are adjectival .

		They will in the proc - esses of time cluster about any order that commands men 's practical allegiance and in consequence their admiration .

		The decline of democracy in comparative prestige 402 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	during the last generation , the relative eclipse into which it has passed , will be reversed by the outcome of the present war .

		A war the final outcome of which is demonstrably to be determined by the efforts of a nation that entered the war to make the world safe for democracy will effect a transformation of sentimental valuations .

		The permanence of this re - versal will depend upon whether the democratic movement gives its own case away by continuing an unconscious adoption of the older morale of honor and defense of status , or has the intellectual courage to assert the moral meaning of industry , exchange , and reciprocal service .

		These considerations may seem remote from the question of the practicability of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	in order to end international anarchy .

		But so to think involves a tremendous underestimation of the practical part played in human life by the imagi - nation and the emotions gathered about it .

		The past system is not supported by any rational appeal to usefulness ; its upholders always decry such an appeal as contrary to its proper elevated and noble nature .

		Mere external habit would not sustain it in the face of constant exhibition of its deficiencies , were not the idealizations of emotion enlisted in its behalf .

		Country , fatherland , nation , honor , rights , defense , protection , glory , sacrifice : these are words which express the forces which above all else main - tain the established order or disorder .

		Against this , the contrary sentimental idealizations which
spring	DATE	from a certain attempt to give Christianity a mild , pacifistic interpretation are pathetically helpless .

		But the old order of ideas is implicated in much more definite and positivistic ways in the mainte - nance of the present system .

		Let anyone seriously ask himself what he understands by diplomacy and why it is that such disparagement hangs about it , and he will see what is meant .

		Everywhere outside of the
United States	LOCATION	, diplomatists have been drawn from the aristocratic class that is to say , from pre - cisely that class which has preserved most nearly unimpaired the old ethics of honor , dignity , nobility , and purely personal relationships the class which has preserved in the most intact way the old noble contempt for the impersonal service rendered by ex - change of goods industrially and mechanically pro- duced .

		It is not diplomacy as an abstraction which tragically failed the world at a crucial moment .

		It was concrete human beings , diplomatists , who showed their ignorance of modern forces and their incapacity to manage them .

		This class of persons manifested all the marks of the old moral order .

		Secret diplomacy is not a `` mere technical device ; it is something more than a mere rule of traditional usage .

		It carries with it all the signs of a class so personally and professionally set apart that it moves in a high , inaccessible realm whose doings are no concern of the vulgar mass .

		It breathes contempt for publicity because it springs from contempt for the public .

		It would maintain the privacy which characterizes the intercourse of gentlemen with one another in matters which are their primary concern .

		For the most part the great powers have directly continued with respect to international relations the traditions which developed when the relations of states were matters of the personal relations of sov - ereigns who owned the states , and when ambassadors were the personal representatives of their personal superiors .

		It was no iconoclast but an authority like Sir
Thomas Barclay	PERSON	who said of the states - men of
Europe	LOCATION	who have controlled foreign policies for the last generation : `` Present generations who have suffered through the incompetency and failure of their governing classes are not likely to allow themselves to be deluded again as to the realities of war compared with those of peace . ''

		But there is no way of surely remedying this evil state of affairs save by transferring the management of international rela - tions from men who are completely , subconsciously even more than consciously , committed to an old be - lief whose minds and hearts are wholly possessed by it over to men whose habitudes of thought have been formed by dealing with the facts of mod - ern industry and the give and take , for common interests , of modern commerce .

		A
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	which should be conceived primarily in political terms of the old sort would inevitably leave the older type of diplomatists in control .

		They are on that ground already ; more - over the activities it requires have no drawing power for men who think spontaneously in terms of the realities of modern life .

		For some time to come , as in the past , big financiers and men of business will largely regulate international relationships for the greater part of the time .

		But there is a constant division of responsibility between them and those who control the .

		political foreign-offices .

		The lat - ter , in acting as agents for the former in times of peace , produce situations which carry things beyond the wishes and out of the power of the economic rulers .

		Something would be gained in clarity and responsibility by any arrangement which made ex - plicit , constant , and formal the power actually wielded by business , and which effectively brought the training and technical ability of its representa - tives directly to bear upon the problems of inter - national intercourse .

		But such a movement could not end at this point .

		When international com -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 403 missions and boards have representatives of big business upon them , because their technical training is required to handle specific questions , they will also have to seat economists and representatives of labor .

		The scope and significance of the questions which would be turned over to them for adjustment would constantly grow .

		Just as the war has led many an able and trained business man to put his special abilities at the disposal of the public interest , so a new type of international diplomacy would stimulate the tendency to use the intellectual power generated in modern industry and commerce for something besides personal advantage .

		No one can afford to ignore or despise this particular sort of ability and training .

		The decision of the character of the imme - diate future in both domestic and international mat - ters depends first of all upon whether they are chiefly used in secret and irresponsible ways for personal power and advantage , or whether they are gradually sublimated by being put to public use in behalf of a public interest .

		404 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	The Real Stop ford
Brooke IT	PERSON	is A MATTER of opinion as to which relatives make the best biographers .

		Wives are necessarily untrust - worthy , for they may seek no dispensation from their vows to love , cherish , and obey .

		Sons are likewise under bonds to society , which reckons filial piety among the virtues and graces and daughters still more so .

		On the other hand the literary `` friend of the family '' is almost always patronizing ; he takes himself as seriously as the undertaker , and he usually has something of the latter 's jealousy of his subject .

		On the whole it would seem that sons-in-law make the best biographers .

		They are intimate , and share the family secrets , and yet they are detached and can take the point of view of a man of the world .

		Their relation has taught them tact , and they have learned to accommodate truth to manners .

		The exception of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	is only apparent , for it is clear that
John	PERSON	- son gave
Boswell	PERSON	the sound training of a son-in-law , and no less clear that if
Johnson	PERSON	had had a daughter
Boswell	PERSON	would have married her .

		The great example of
Lockhart	LOCATION	receives confirmation in the Life and Letters of
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	, by
Lawrence Pearsall Jacks	PERSON	-LRB- 2 vols. ,
Scribner	LOCATION	;
$ 4.75	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Principal Jacks has told the story of
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's life with intimate feeling and outward dignity .

		He has in fact rescued his hero from the reputation of being a derived and second-rate journeyman of letters the Brooke of lectures , handbooks , and primers and let him speak out as a free man .

		He has unfolded a story of development and emancipation of which the public at least was ignorant .

		And he has justified the writ - ing of his book : he has convinced us that
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	was worthy of his biography .


Stopford Brooke	PERSON	was born in
1832	DATE	in
Ireland	LOCATION	, where his father held a petty living .

		He received his degree at
Dublin University	ORGANIZATION	, and took orders in the English Church , and a
London	LOCATION	curacy at the age of twenty-three .

		The young Irish .

		clergyman handsome , enthusiastic , with good pulpit and parlor manners , facile eloquence , and a strain of poetry carried all before him .

		After a few years of mingled work among the poor in the east of
London	LOCATION	and play among the rich in the west , he became chaplain to the Crown Princess of
Prussia	LOCATION	and the
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		After his return to
London	LOCATION	he was frequently called on to preach before the Queen at
Windsor	LOCATION	, and became one of her chaplains .

		He was a protege of Dean
Stanley	PERSON	and often preached at
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	to crowded houses .

		Indeed the crowd became something of an obsession with
Brooke	PERSON	; he rarely mentions his preaching , in the numerous letters which Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	has preserved , without adding the pregnant phrase `` crowded to the doors . ''

		During the years after his return to
London	LOCATION	,
Brooke	PERSON	was engaged in the form of relig - ious speculation based on the proprietary chapel , of which the clergyman takes a lease and in which he sublets sittings .

		Brooke 's chapels first Saint James in York Street , then
Bedford Chapel	ORGANIZATION	,
Bloomsbury	PERSON	were prosperous enterprises , owing to the incum - bent 's genius for men-pleasing .

		He pleased royalty and fashion ; he pleased the broad-Church party of Dean
Stanley	PERSON	and
Jowett	PERSON	; he pleased skeptical lib - erals like
James Martineau	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		The career of the young clergyman was a subject for
Thackeray	PERSON	; and one of his admirers , whom Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	quotes , lets slip the name which is at the back of our minds as we read ,
Charles Honeyman	PERSON	and adds that
Brooke	PERSON	's chapel like
Honeyman	PERSON	's was above a wine cellar .

		The chief interest of the first volume of letters is the naive revelation of
Brooke	PERSON	's absorption of the culture of his mid-Victorian surroundings .

		He lived by imitation ; his intellectual habitation was a hall of echoes .

		As a boy in
Ireland	LOCATION	he and his brother used to take refuge in the garret of his grandfather 's house and read
Emerson	PERSON	's essays ``
night after night	TIME	till we had finished them in the midst of infinite discussions carried on till two or three in the morn - ing . ''

		With the same brother he made the stern intellectual resolve to study In Memoriam `` to its innermost depths and talk of nothing else till they have mastered everything it contains . ''

		Naturally
Kingsley	PERSON	, whose career was so like his own , became his model .

		His first published critique was a eulogy of
Kingsley	PERSON	's novels in
Kingsley	LOCATION	's style .

		It is the voice of the muscular Christian and that of the Christian laureate that we hear in this Victorian praise of war : So long as selfishness prevails in human nature , so long will aggressive wars arise ; and so long as a true and vivid spirit of hatred to the evil strength of Wrong ex - ists and a righteous sense of the mightiness of Right , so long will there always be found nations who will take arms to a man and with one heart protest against the unholy thing .

		And in doing this they are morally bene - fitted .

		The boundaries of justice and injustice are more clearly defined .

		The nation is given something else but itself and its prosperity to think of ... If a war be just , and for noble objects , it will practically do good to the nation who wages it .

		It is the voice of
Browning	PERSON	that we hear in this : In my sixty-seven years I have only had a whiff of the joy to be got out of natural beauty .

		But when I have seen this earth well I 'll have a look at other planets and at new beauty .

		1918 405 And he writes to a correspondent : You only of all the people who have spoken to me of my
Browning	PERSON	have recognized how much of myself is in the book .

		When he lectures on Mental Culture in
1857	DATE	`` The first law of Mental Culture then is Order .

		The second ... is Attention ... The third ... is Faith .

		The fourth law is > Love '' we smile at the imitation of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, with his seven lamps of this and that ; and when he sets down the portentous list of books he must read , we think of
George Eliot	PERSON	's diary and weep .

		He went in for Victorian art criticism and became an admirer of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	and
Tintoretto	ORGANIZATION	.

		He shared the belief in history current in his day .


John Richard Green	PERSON	, who married
Brooke	PERSON	's cousin ,
Alice Stopford	PERSON	, was his intimate friend , and sought his criticism on The History of the English People .

		Brooke 's participa - tion in the Anglo-Saxon enthusiasm found expres - sion in his History of Early English Literature . '

		He felt also the scientific interest that followed the Origin of Species , attended Huxley 's lectures on Physiology in
1861	DATE	, and in the spirit of Victorian compromise found that : nothing helps me more in writing sermons than some study of
Natural Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		It adds tone to the necessarily speculative character of theological writing .

		He , like
Kingsley	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	and the others , pottered about with a hammer after fossils .

		But more important than this , he shared in the glorious legacy of nature feeling which
Wordsworth	PERSON	had left to his fellow men , shared it and increased it .

		The best of
Brooke	PERSON	's letters , and they are very numer - ous , are those in which he gives himself freedom to love and enjoy nature as
Wordsworth	PERSON	did .

		And to him , as to
Wordsworth	PERSON	, nature became the great in - strument in his salvation and emancipation .

		For
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	freed himself and saved his soul .

		Somehow he broke the bonds which bound him to the commonplaces of his time , and threw aside * the second-hand clothes , intellectual and spirit - ual , which he had picked up so cheaply in the Vic - torian marketplace .

		His conversion was not dra - matic as St.
Francis	PERSON	' was , nor is it told dramatically as
Newman	PERSON	's is .

		It is part of
Brooke	PERSON	's real distinc - tion that he wrote no Apologia , no spiritual autobi - ography .

		And his biographer in the volumes before us treats the spiritual drama of
Brooke	PERSON	's life with noble reticence .

		The one salient outward event ,
Brooke	PERSON	's secession from the English Church in
1880	DATE	, is hardly emphasized .

		A letter from the Bishop of
London	LOCATION	saying what a bishop would say , that if
Brooke	PERSON	could n't believe the resurrection of Jesus he could n't believe anything that is all .

		If
Brooke	PERSON	passed through the Gethsemanes and Golgothas in which his contemporaries changed their faiths , he left no record of it , or Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	has obliterated it .

		In truth , it may be thought that the change was so gradual that
Brooke	PERSON	himself was conscious of it as only a natural evolution , a winging out into a larger life .

		In any case the real significance was not in his change of religious faith , but in the change in social outlook which accompanied it .

		`` He had come to regard the Church in
1880	DATE	rightly or wrong - ly as on the side of the rich , '' says Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	, `` and he himself stood definitely on the side of the poor . ''

		Above all in importance was the freedom from the world , the flesh , and the devil of men-pleasing that the change brought him .

		No more Queen 's chap - laincies and sermons in Westminster !

		Brooke kept his chapel and most of his audience for a few years ; thereafter he preached itinerantly , mostly in Uni - tarian churches .

		And though
Brooke	PERSON	continued to lecture on English poets and to publish handbooks about his contemporaries , he did not take these labors as seriously as before .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	remarks in connection with his book on
Browning	PERSON	, `` His power of dismissing things is beyond praise , '' and in a larger sense it was this power that
Brooke	PERSON	chiefly exercised in the latter years of his life .

		Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	says of these years : They were not spent in conscious effort to improve the occasion , nor to improve the world , nor to improve him - self ... They were spent in the realm of absolute values , in which
Brooke	PERSON	as a child of Nature and a lover of beauty had long been at home .

		It is to Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	' book that we owe our knowl - edge of this personality which had silently developed behind the screen of the popular preacher and critic this new man that
Brooke	PERSON	put on , who speaks in utterances more vigorous and original than anything we associate with
Brooke	PERSON	of the Primer or the in - numerable volumes of sermons .

		There is something of
Swift	ORGANIZATION	's honesty in this rejection of a favorite hypocrisy : As to dying in harness ... I 'm sick of being too much in harness , and I have no ambition to die working .

		Green said `` I die learning . ''

		I say , I shall die unlearn - ing , and ` pon my word it 's the wiser of the two sayings .

		There is something of
Swift	ORGANIZATION	's saeva indignatio in this outburst at the wronging of
Ireland	LOCATION	in
1881	DATE	: And I have lived to see Gladstone do this !

		And English and Scotch Liberals cheering and hooting with Conserva - tives and Tories .

		All the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	hand and glove to take away from
Ireland	LOCATION	the rights of a free people , because they have risen against injustice .

		There is a courage beyond Swift 's in his comment on the attitude of the
Church toward Education	ORGANIZATION	in
1908	DATE	: O how badly , how meanly , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	has systematically behaved throughout , without one break of decent conduct , in this matter always trying to evade its just responsi - 406 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	bilities , always whining for money , always hating to spend a farthing it desires to get out of the people !

		I thank God I got rid of the stain of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The old idols come crashing down and he notes their fall with a trenchancy of phrase that is refresh - ing .

		He admits that
Kingsley	PERSON	's books `` scream . ''

		If he tells you it is five o'clock , it seems as if it were the last hour of the world ...
J. R. Green	PERSON	met him at
Macmillan 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` After dinner , '' says G , `` he marched up and down the room like a restless animal , shouting out about the living God . ''

		Instead of the complacent Victorianisms about war , we have this in
1914	DATE	: We are right in this war , but what is one to say of a humanity which after thousands of years can only settle the doctrine that Might is not Right at the expense of a million lives ?

		But it is Nature which is the chief subject of
Brooke	PERSON	's later letters and diaries .

		He had taken Nature as he had the other spiritual gifts of his day .

		Nature stood always for reality to him , and even in his busiest years of successful preaching and book - making he found his retreat from his world of specious philosophy , second-rate literature , and social sham into her fastnesses .

		As years went on he lived more and more by himself and in communion with her .

		For certain of her aspects he had a genu - ine passion .

		Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	notes his feeling for running water , and it is characteristic that in his yearly visits to Homburg for the sake of the cure , he took refuge from the world , which in that place was more than ever impossible to him , and lived in imagi - native companionship with the spirits of the wells the Elizabeth-Brunnen , the Stahl-Brunnen , and the
Louisa	LOCATION	j Brunnen .

		Of the last we have much in the diaries by way of conversations , stories , re - flections .

		In contrast to that fantastic mythopea place this natural magic from
Wordsworth	PERSON	's country : Past pretty groves ... full of flowers I came at last to the spur and crossed over the rocks to the pony track that goes up
Langdale Strath	LOCATION	.

		It was a desolate valley .

		For miles I did not see a single figure , not even a single animal .

		The sound of streams was everywhere , and no other sound except at times a curious crying far up the mountain , like that of a woman weeping bitterly .

		I sat down under a great dropped crag , which had been splintered by the lightning and the frost , and it seemed to me as if the whole world were mist and dream , and nothing more .

		The solid mountains , rocks , and hills were as insubstantial as a ghost , and I alone was real .

		This then is the
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	whom Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	' volumes make known to us .

		But for them we should never have known the real man merely the Victorian portrait of a gentleman , correct , conven - tional , commonplace .

		Dr.
Jacks	PERSON	has revealed a man far greater than his work , and like
Lockhart	PERSON	he has added a personality to ` the age .

		ROBERT
MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	.

		The Psychology of War X \ NCIENTLY , when psychology was mental phi - losophy and the stream of consciousness was an im - mortal soul , whose faculties were unchangeable and whose works were foreordained , such a title as
J. T. MacCurdy	PERSON	's The Psychology of War -LRB- Luce ; 75 cts . -RRB-

		would have been no arrogance .

		Today , `` the '' imparts to psychology a resiliency and hard - ness from which the mind rebounds ; `` the '' invests the observations which it thrusts forward with a pontifical garniture ; `` the '' leads the reader to expect something of the sharpness and flatness of dogma .

		Nor is he disappointed .

		Dr.
MacCurdy	PERSON	surveys and interprets and reconciles the two latest , and in some ways the soundest , of the many psychologizings evoked by the war : those of Freud and his school , and of T 1 rotter , who has not yet a school .

		And he adds the observations of
William James	PERSON	on the `` moral equivalents '' of war .

		The observations and influences of these writers receive at his hands how - ever a treatment resting on the assumption jhat the mind of man is a machine wound up , and set running in a vacuum , as if its character , movement , and mutations were explicable like those of a watch , by the interrelation of its parts .

		Such treatment may serve well the soul which priests save , but it can hardly evoke the truth about a living mind , every one of whose aspects and conditions is the effect of causes of which the enduring mechanisms of the body are only a small part , and the changing setting of things and people , and places a very large part .

		For one 's mind is what one minds ; and the minding of war differs from other sorts of minding by its content , not its act .

		A psychology of war can be only a general psychology having special bearings on the business of war-making .

		That business uses the same instincts , impulses , feelings , wishes , and ideas , inher - ited or acquired , which any other business uses .

		Each changes the vague unrest of mere feeling which is the original content of consciousness , into the order and articulation of action and thought appropriate to itself by touching it off and estab - lishing for it objectives and direction .

		People with musical or mechanical or literary or mathematical minds are not born with them .

		They acquire them by becoming habituated , through accident or inten - tion , to minding those things more than any others .

		1918 THE DIAL 407 A habit of mind is like any other habit , to be got and broken , a trick of attention and appetite .

		Pro- fessions and crafts and all the vocations of men are habits of minding some things rather than others .

		Their psychology is no story of a release of inward and autonomous springs .

		Their psychol - ogy is a story of the interplay and correlation of bod - ily and environmental events , in which the latter are the definitive elements , the quality-giving forces .

		The more complex and highly organized a society is the truer this becomes , the same man being various - ly engineer or physician or clergyman or soldier , according to what he gets the habit of persistently minding .

		Only the madman is an exception , and he is an exception because he has lost his mind .

		And he has lost his mind precisely because he has ceased to mind the world about him , because in him the inner mechanism , once touched off , does unwind itself narrowly , strictly , according to the interrela - tion of its parts .

		The madman has withdrawn from the world and does in fact live in the vacuum of his own imaginings .

		Dr.
MacCurdy	PERSON	has , I suspect , fallen into the initial fallacy of transferring the as - sumptions of his own art he is a psychiatrist by pro- fession to a field in which a number of quite other factors are in play .

		War is an outcome of the deepest-lying of human forces , and therefore something which can not be altered by legislation or agreement any more than a man can be kept sane either by force or by promise .

		Instinct is stronger than reason .

		And in war times two types of instinct , usually ir - reconcilably at combat in the inner life of man , are reconciled and work in harmony .

		These are the individualistic lusts and wishes of the primary brute whose behavior and repression are the theme of the Freudians , and the `` herd instinct '' which is the preoccupation of
Trotter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Man by his gregarious nature is doomed to split up into groups , and these groups behave biologically as if they were separate species struggling for existence .

		Thanks to his herd instinct , which makes man accept the opinions of those immediately around him herd , or `` mob '' sug - gestion only that seems to be right which is done by his group , and an abnormal suspicion of the acts of other groups develops .

		Thus a state of antagonism develops which is much augmented by the aggressive tendency latent in human gregariousness .

		The antagonism is cumulative , so that sooner or later a state of extreme tension is reached .

		At this point , when action of some sort seems imperative , the primitive , unconscious instincts of man assert themselves -LRB- as they constantly tend to do -RRB- and the herd , rinding in this a ready weapon , relaxes its ban , making of blood lust a virtue .

		Suddenly the indi - vidualistic and social tendencies find themselves working hand in hand essentially a sublimation and war with its tremendous energy is unleashed .

		The behaviour of both the mass and the individual then demonstrates that the herd is playing the role of species struggling for existence .

		It can not be objected that war is merely the business of soldiers .

		Every citizen , male or female , has a share in the spirit of war .

		All suffer a diminution of egoism , with an added consciousness of the state , and all feel the satisfaction of blood lust , whether it be gained by jabbing a bayonet or devouring descriptions of carnage in the enemy 's trenches .

		It must not be thought that the repression of these primitive tendencies is easily lifted .

		There is a feeling of horror quite different from fear when a nation is on the brink of war , although with it , some thoughtful introspectionists admit , can be detected a `` something '' which seems to hope that war will come .

		This `` something , '' like the fascination of a horrible spec - tacle , is , of course , the unconscious wish .

		When it has come as close to consciousness as this , its shadow , as it were , being seen , war is truly imminent , for now the herd antagonism is mightily augmented by the primitive pas - sion for violence .

		The repressing force which colours war with horror , makes it difficult to kill the first man , and keeps the citizen at home from relishing the tales of carnage until he is `` used to it '' this force can probably be related to the loyalty we have to the larger herd , all mankind .

		At such a time as this , with almost the whole world weltering in blood , it seems hard to believe in the strength of this wider allegiance .

		Yet it asserts itself with greater strength at the close of every great war , as the revulsion from bloodshed lasting through generations bears witness .

		Now this summary is an admirable description of one aspect of the moods of nations once war has started / It is altogether irrelevant to the causes which themselves start war and hence to the ending of war .

		Those are remote from the biological con - .

		ceptions of the struggle of groups for survival and the psychological conceptions of the repression and release of impulses .

		Warlike relations are no more frequent than peaceful relations between primitive tribes , and the newcomer or stranger is as likely to be worshipped as a god as to be killed as a foreigner .

		The hypothesis of a primitive blood-lust must be harmonized with the well-known physiological re - vulsion against the sight of blood so common among peoples of all breeds ; and the heightening of group - consciousness and group-loyalty and the liberation of repressed impulses are phenomena incident to all contests games of football or baseball , boxing matches , debates , political campaigns , and commer - cial and sectarian rivalries .

		They become equally marked in the face of physical disaster , where there are no rivalries whatsoever as during the San Fran - cisco earthquake , the
Halifax	LOCATION	explosion and the erup - tions of Vesuvius and
Aetna	ORGANIZATION	, the floods at
Youngs	PERSON	- town and the tidal waves at
Galveston	LOCATION	.

		National rivalries and national conflicts evoke the same phe - nomena , of course : they are only instances additional to those enumerated , and as rivalries and conflicts in no way different from them .

		Hence Dr.
Mac	PERSON	-
Curdy	ORGANIZATION	's conversion of the problem `` Do we want to abolish war ? ''

		into the problem `` Do we want nations ? ''

		is futile .

		In view of the facts , `` Do we want nations ? ''

		should be restated `` Do we want groupings of any kind ? ''

		So put , the question answers itself .

		So put , it exhibits the confusion on which the book rests the confusion of the typical 408
November 16	DATE	with the particular .

		Dr.
MacCurdy	PERSON	has outlined a very interesting psychology of conflict and disaster in general ; he has not proposed an operable differen - tial psychology of that particular kind of conflict we call war .

		He has not done this , I think , because there is none to propose , because war is distinguished from mere conflict by the dimension of creative and organizing action it adds thereto ; and it is this action , not the conflict nor the `` herd-suggestion , '' which is the liberating and vitalizing element of the war mood .

		THis has been particularly true since the industrial revolution , when the creative background of destruction began to overshadow destruction it - self .

		Individuality consequently has been expanded and enhanced , self-consciousness has been intensified , and the stature of men has grown .

		This is a very different thing from the blind and passing moods of `` herd-suggestion . ''

		These , in a complicated civil - ization , can not be sustained , and individuality is of course lost in them .

		But in objective actions , from knitting socks to threading rifles , there is a basis both for the expansion of personality and the eleva - tion of mood .

		If the creative effort stimulated by war and it far exceeds the destructive effort can be preserved without the incentive of destruction , the positive values attributed to war can be pre - served without war .

		That this is not at all impos - sible the whole history of democracy attests , for on the whole democracy has meant at once a liberation of the creative powers of the common man and a decrease in war .

		The
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	have been side by side for a hundred years without battle , and in the
United States	LOCATION	all the warring peoples in
Europe	LOCATION	have lived side by side in generous and , for the most part , creative rivalries .

		Dr.
MacCurdy	PERSON	's analysis demonstrates , I think , beyond reasonable doubt that there is nothing in human nature as such which renders inevitable the combination of conflict and construction which is war .

		That consequently legislation and agreement can prevent it , just as they can prevent other con - tingent eventualities .

		Conflict is perhaps inevitable to human nature , and construction is inevitable .

		The combination of both as war , is not .

		Certainly no one who knows anything about the causes of wars , and particularly about the causes of the pres - ent one , would venture the assertion that they were inevitable to human nature and could not have been prevented .

		War is organized killing of one 's own species .

		It has no prototype in biology , and no ana - logue in animal life .

		n The common rivalries of peoples have nothing to do with it ; the greed and jealousies of rulers , everything .

		To accomplish their ends they are compelled to dragoon and whip their subjects into military service .

		Democracies do not easily make war .

		Thus the mind of
Europe	LOCATION	showed in
1914	DATE	none of the characteristics Dr.
MacCurdy	PERSON	describes as preliminary to war .

		The war was to
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	the eventuation of the inconceivable .

		Lichnowsky and
Muhlon	PERSON	and other Germans of conscience attest beyond question that the assault upon mankind was a conspiracy of the ruling class , which the people of
Germany	LOCATION	, schooled for it as they had been , still met with some - thing of shock .

		And if this be so with the present war , which has acquired some of the traits of a war of peoples , of a real revolution , how much the more must it have been so in less democratic times !

		And if this be so , the masses of men are in no need of `` moral equivalents for war . ''

		Organized society can not help providing plenty of opportunities and occasions for the generous rivalries of peaceful conflict which sufficiently satisfy the instinct war is supposed to satiate .

		The rank and file , left to them - selves , would never wage war .

		Their lives are al - ready sufficiently a battle , and they already live dangerously enough in the mines , in the lumber - camps , on the roads , in the fields , on the sea , wher - ever the basic dirty work of civilization is being done .

		They always live at fighting weight , make their sacrifices , and pay their toll of life .

		It is the small leisured class , that lives soft , has never been hungry , and is bored , that requires a moral equiva - lent for war .

		This is the class that first takes up the war-cry , and that first and last finds in the war the escapes from self it craves .

		The reason is that war puts its members to work without marking upon them the stigma its standards attach to manual labor ; their other `` moral equivalents '' erotic ad - venture , gambling , traveling , hunting big game , all the things which are play for the rich and crime ?

		for the poor leave them an unused margin of energy , and they continue to be bored .

		But set them to work no work , no food and their warlike in - stincts will find satisfaction complete .

		In sum : the war-mind is the mind that minds the organized killing of its own species .

		This type of minding is , however , very different from the conflict - minds which are the normal social expression of the combative instincts of men .

		It is limited to a small class who have the power to compel other men to carry out their purposes .

		Since it is not the inevi - table expression of human nature like , for example , matings or food-gettings either the destruction of this class or the destruction of their power will be sufficient to prevent war .

		The combative and gregarious appetites of the masses of men are suffi - ciently satisfied in the normal groupings and con - flicts of the daily life .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 409 The Modern Point of View and the New Order m .

		THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS .

		HE MODERN point of view , with its constituent principles of equal opportunity , self-help , and free bargaining , was given its definitive formulation in the eighteenth century , as a balanced system of Natural Rights ; and it has stood over intact since that time , and has served as the unquestioned and immutable ground of public morals and public policy , on which the advocates of enlightened and liberal views have always been content to rest their case .

		The truths which it holds to be self-evident and indefeasible are conceived to be intrinsically bound up .

		in an over - ruling order of nature , in which thoughtful men habitually believed at that time and in which less thoughtful men have continued to believe since then .

		This eighteenth century order of nature , in the magic name of which
Adam Smith	PERSON	was in the habit of speaking , was conceived on lines of personal initiative and activity .

		It is an order of things in which men were conceived to be effectually equal in all those re - spects that are of any decided consequence in intelli - gence , working capacity , initiative , opportunity , and personal worth ; in which the creative factor engaged in industry was the workman , with his personal skill , dexterity , and judgment ; in which , it was be - lieved , the employer -LRB- `` master '' -RRB- served his own ends and sought his own gain by consistently serv - ing the needs of creative labor , and thereby serving the common good ; in which the traders -LRB- `` middle - men '' -RRB- made an honest living by supplying goods to consumers at a price determined by labor cost , and so serving the common good .

		This characterization of the `` obvious and simple system '' that lies at the root of the liberal ideals may seem too much of a dream to any person who shuns `` the scientific use of the imagination '' ; its impon - derables may .

		seem to lack that axiomatic self-suffi - ciency which one would like to find in the spiritual foundations of any system of law and custom .

		In - deed the best of its imponderables are in a fair way now to drop back into the discard of uncertified make-believe .

		Buttin point of historical fact it ap - pears to have stood the test of time and use , so far as appears on the face of law and custom .

		However , the subsequent course of events has shown no indisposition to depart from this `` natural state of man , '' on the effectual reality of which the modern point of view rests its inviolate princi - ples of law and morals and economic expediency .

		A new order of things has been taking effect in the state of the industrial arts and in the material sci - ences that lie nearest to that tangible body of experi - ence out of which the state of the industrial arts is framed .

		And the new order of industrial ways and means has been progressively going out of touch with the essential requirements of this established scheme of individual self-help and personal initiative .

		Under the new order the first requisite of ordinary industrial production is no longer the workman and his manual skill , but rather the mechanical equip - ment and the processes in which the mechanical equipment is engaged .

		And this new industrial equipment and process embodies not the manual skill , dexterity , and judgment of an individual work - man , but rather the accumulated technological wis - dom of the community .

		Under the new order of things the mechanical equipment the `` industrial plant '' takes the initiative , sets the pace , and turns the workman to account in the carrying-on of those standardized processes of production that embody this mechanistic state of the industrial arts , very much as the individual workman in his time held the initiative in industry , set the pace , and made use of his tools according to his own discretion in the exercise of his personal skill , dexterity , and judg - ment , under that no , w obsolescent industrial order which underlies the modern point of view , and which still colors the aspirations of Liberal statesmen and economists .

		The skilled workman still is always indispensable to the due working of this mechanistic industrial process , of course , very much as the craftsman 's tools , in his time , were indispensable to the work he had in hand .

		But the unit of industrial organiza - tion and procedure , what may be called the `` going concern '' in production , is now the outfit of industrial equipment , a works , engaged in a given mechanical process designed to turn out a given output of stand - ardized product ; it is the plant , or shop .

		And under this new order of industrial methods and values it has already come to be a commonplace of popular `` knowledge and belief '' that the mechani - cal equipment is the creative factor in industry , and the `` production '' of the output is credited to the plant 's working capacity and set down to its account as a going concern ; whereas the other f ac - 4IO THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	tors engaged , as , for instance , workmen and mater - ials , are counted in as auxiliary factors which are indispensable but subsidiary .

		Under the new order the going concern in pro- duction is the plant or shop , the works , not the indi - vidual workman .

		The time , place , rate , and material conditions of the work in hand are deter - mined immediately by the mechanically standardized process in which the given plant is engaged ; and beyond that all these matters are dependent on the exigencies and maneuvers of business , largely by way of moderating the rate of production and keep - ing the output reasonably short of the productive capacity .

		The workman has become subsidiary to the mechanical equipment , and productive industry has become subsidiary to business , in all those coun - tries which have come in for the latter-day state of the industrial arts , and which so have fallen under the domination of the price system .

		Such is the state of things throughout in those greater industries that are characteristic of the new order ; and these greater industries now set the pace and make the standards of management and valua - tion for the rest .

		At the same time these greater industries of the machine era extend their domina - tion beyond their own immediate work , and enforce a standardization of much the same mechanical char - acter in the community at large , in the ways and means of living as well as in the ways and means of work .

		The effects of their mechanically stand - ardized production , in the way of goods and services as well as in the similarly standardized traffic through which these goods and services are dis - tributed to the consumers , reach out into the every - day life of all classes ; but most immediately and imperatively they reach the working class of the industrial centers .

		So they largely set the pace for the ordinary occupations of the common man even apart from any employment in the greater mechanical industries .

		It is especially the latter-day system of transport and communication as it works out under the new order highly mechanical and exactingly scheduled for time , rate , and place that so controls and standardizes the ordinary life of the common man on mechanical lines .

		The training enforced by this mechanical stand - ardization therefore is of much the same order throughout the community as it is within the me - chanical industries proper , and it drives to the same outcome submergence of the personal equation .

		So that the workday information and the reasoning by use of which all men carry on their daily life under the new order is of the same general character as that information and reasoning which guides the mechanical engineers ; and this unremitting habitua - tion to its scope and method , its principles of knowl - edge and belief , leads headlong to a mechanistic conception of things , ways , means , ends , and values , whether it is called by that name or not .

		The resulting frame of mind is often spoken of loosely as Materialism .

		This impersonal character of the workday habituation is particularly to be counted on wherever the latter-day scheme of mechanical stand - ardization takes effect with all that wide sweep and massive drift with which it now dominates the larger centers of population .

		Since the modern era began , the state of the indus - trial arts has been undergoing a change of type , such as the followers of
Mendel	PERSON	would call a `` mu - tation . ''

		And in the course of this mutation the workman and his part in the conduct of industry have suffered a great dislocation .

		But it is also to be admitted that the typical owner-employer of the earlier modern time , such as he stood in the mind 's eye of the eighteenth century doctrinaires this traditional owner-employer has also come through the period of the mutation in a scarcely better state of preservation .

		At the period of this stabilization of principles in the eighteenth century he could still truthfully be spoken of as a `` master , '' a foreman of the shop , and he was invested with a large reminiscence of the master-craftsman , as known in the time of the craft-guilds .

		He stood forth in the eighteenth century argument on the natural order of things as the wise and workmanlike designer and guide of his workmen 's handiwork , and he was then still presumed to be living in workday contact and communion with them , and to deal with them on an equitable footing of personal interest .

		Such a characterization of the capitalist-employer who was doing business at the time of the Industrial Revolution may seem overdrawn , and there is no need of insisting on its precisf accuracy as a descrip - tion of eighteenth century facts .

		But it should not be extremely difficult to show that substantially such a figure of an employer-owner was had in mind by those who then argued the questions of wages and employment and laid down the lines on which the employment of labor would be expected to ar - range itself under the untroubled system of natural liberty .

		But what is more to the point is that which is beyond question .

		In practical fact , almost as fully as in the speculations of the doctrinaires , the employer of labor in the productive industries of that time was , in his own person , commonly also the personal owner of the establishment in which his hired workmen were employed ; and also again in passable accord with the facts he was presumed personally to come to terms with his workmen about
1918	DATE	THE DIAL wages and conditions of work .

		Employment was considered to be a relation of man to man .

		That much is explicit in the writings which bear the date - mark of this modern Liberal point of view ; and the same assumption has continued to stand over as a self-sufficient premise among the defenders of the free competitive system in industry for three or four generations after that period .

		But the course of events has gone its own way , and about that time somewhere along in the
middle half of the eighteenth century	DATE	that type of em - ployer began to be displaced in those industries which have since then set the pace and made the outcome for wages and conditions of work .

		So soon as the machine industry began to make headway , the in - dustrial plant increased in size , and the number of workmen employed in each establishment grew con - tinually larger , until in the course of time the large ' scale of organization in industry has put any relation of man to man out of the question between employ - ers and workmen in the leading industries .

		Indeed it is not unusual to find that in an industrial plant of a large or middling size , a factory , mill , works , mine , shipyard , or railway of the ordinary sort , very few of the workmen would be able , under oath , to identify their owners .

		At the same time , and owing to the same requirements of large-scale and mechanical organization , the ownership of the works has also progressively been changing character , so that today , in the large and leading industries , the place of the personal employer-owner is taken by a composite business concern which represents a com - bination of owners , no one of whom is individually .

		responsible for the concern 's transactions .

		The personal employer-owner has virtually dis - appeared from the great industries .

		His place is now filled by a list of corporation securities and a staff of corporation officials and employees who exer - cise a limited discretion .

		The personal note is no longer to be had in the wage relation , except in those backward , obscure , and subsidiary industries in which the mechanical reorganization of the new order has not taken effect .

		So , even that contractual arrangement which defines the workman 's relation to the establishment in which he is employed , and to the anonymous corporate ownership ' by which he is employed , now takes the shape of a statistical reckoning , in which virtually no trace of the relation of man to man is to be found .

		Yet the principles of the modern point of view governing this contractual relation , in current law and custom , are drawn on the old assumption that wages and conditions of work are arranged for by free bargaining between man and man on a footing of personal understand - ing and equal opportunity .

		That the facts of the new order have in this way departed from the ground on which the constituent principles of the modern point of view are based , and on which therefore the votaries of the estab - lished system take their stand this state of things can not be charged to anyone 's personal account and made a subject of recrimination .

		In fact it is not a case for personal discretion and responsibility in detail , but rather for concerted action looking to some practicable working arrangement .

		The personal equation is no longer a material fac - tor in the situation .

		Ownership , too , has been caught in the net of the new order and has been depersonal - ized to a degree beyond what would have been conceivable a hundred years ago , especially so far as it has to do with the use of material resources and man power in the greater industries .

		Owner - ship has been `` denatured . ''

		It used to be true that personally responsible discretion ^ in all details was the chief and abiding power conferred by ownership ; but wherever it has to do with the machine industry and large-scale organization , ownership now has virtually lost this essential part of its ordinary func - tions .

		It has taken the shape of an absentee owner - ship of anonymous corporate capital , and in the ordi - nary management of this corporate capital the greater proportion of the owners have no voice .

		In practical fact
today	DATE	, corporate capital is the capitalized earning-capacity of the corporation con - sidered as a going business concern ; and the owner - ship of this capital therefore foots up to a claim on the earnings of the corporation .

		Corporate capital of this kind is impersonal in more than one sense : it may be transferred piecemeal from one owner to another without visibly affecting the management or the rating of the concern whose securities change hands in this way ; and the personal identity of the owner of any given block of this capital need not be known even to the concern , to its administrative officers , or to those persons whose daily work and needs are bound up with the daily transactions of the concern .

		For most purposes and as regards the greater proportion of the investors who in this way own the corporation 's capital , these owners are , in effect , anonymous creditors , whose sole effectual relation to the enterprise is that of a fixed `` over - head charge '' on its operations .

		Such is the case , even in point of form , as regards the investors in cor - porate bonds and preferred stock .

		The ordinary investor is , in effect , an anonymous pensioner on the enterprise ; his relation to industry is in the nature of a liability , and his share in the conduct of this indus - try is much like the share which the Old Man of the Sea once had in the promenades of
Sinbad	LOCATION	.

		No doubt , any reasonably skilful economist any 41 2 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	certified accountant of economic theory could suc - cessfully question the goodness of this characteriza - tion of corporate capital .

		It is , in fact , not such a description as is commonly met with in those theories of ownership and investment that trace back to the formal definitions of Ricardo and
Adam Smith	PERSON	.

		Nor is this description here set down as a formal defini - tion of corporate capital and its uses , nor is it de - signed to fit into that traditional scheme of concep - tions that still holds the attention of the certified economists .

		Its aim is the less ambitious one of describing , in a loose and informal way , what is the nature and uses of this corporate capital and its ownership , in the apprehension of the common man out of doors .

		He is not familiar with the recon - dite wisdom of the past , or with subtle definitions ; but he knows something of the subtleties of the mar - ket , the crop season , the blast-furnace and refinery , the internal-combustion engine , and such like hard and fast matters with which he is required to get along from day to day .

		The purpose is only to bring out , without undue precision , what these interesting phenomena of capital , investment , fixed charges , and the like may be expected to foot up to in the un - schooled reflections of the common man , who always comes in as `` the party of the second part '' in all these maneuvers of corporation finance .

		He com - monly has no more than a slender and sliding grasp of those honorable principles of certified make - believe that distinguish the modern point of view in all that relates to property and its uses ; but he has had the benefit of some exacting experience in the ways of the new order and its standards of reckoning .

		By consequence of much untempered experience the common man is beginning to see these things in the glaring though fitful light of that mechanistic conception that rates men and things on grounds of tangible performance , without much afterthought .

		As seen in this light , and without much afterthought , very much of the established sys - tem of obligations , earnings , perquisites , and emolu - ments appears to rest on a network of make-believe .

		Now , it may be deplorable , perhaps inexcusable , that the new order in industry should engender habits of thought of this unprofitable kind ; but then , after all , regrets and excuses do not make the out - come , and with sufficient reason interest today cen - ters on the outcome .

		To come to an understanding of the source and origin of this margin of disposable revenue that now goes to the earnings of corporate capital , it is neces - sary to come to an understanding of the industrial system out of which the disposable margin of revenue arises .

		Productive industry yields a margin of net product over cost , counting cost in terms of man power and material resources ; and under the estab - lished rule of self-help and free bargaining this margin of net product has come to rest on produc - tive industry as an overhead charge payable to anony - mous outsiders who own the corporation securities .

		There need be no question of the equity of this ar - rangement , as between the men at work in the indus - tries and the beneficiaries to whom the overhead charge is payable .

		At least there is no intention here to question the equity of it , or to defend the arrange - ment against any question that may be brought .

		It is also to be remarked that the whole arrange - ment has this appearance of gratuitous handicap and hardship only when it is looked at from the crude ground-level of tangible performance .

		When seen in the dry light of the old and honest principles of self-help and equal opportunity , as understood by the substantial and well-meaning citizens , it all casts no shadow of iniquity or inexpediency .

		So , without prejudice to any ulterior question which may be harbored by one and another , the question which is here had in mind is quite simply as to the production of this disposable margin of net product over human cost .

		The relevant facts are neither particularly obscure nor particularly elu - sive ; only , they have had little attention in the argument of economists and politicians .

		The parti - tion of incomes is apparently more easily understood by them , and a more engrossing subject of argumen - tation than the production of goods .

		This would be particularly true for these economists and politicians who are well imbued with the legalistic spirit of the modern point of view .

		It is known to all , even to the most safely guarded persons who do riot come in contact with industry or production , that industry will always turn out something in the way of a net margin of product over human cost over human effort and necessary consumption .

		It holds true as far back as the rec - ords have anything to say .

		It is evidently a ques - tion of the productivity of the industrial arts .

		Men at work turn out a net product because they know how and are interested in doing it , and their output is limited by the industrial methods which they have the use of .

		But the industrial system of the new order will work at the high rate of efficiency of which it is capable only under suitable conditions .

		It is a comprehensive system of interdependent working parts , organized on a large scale and with an exact - ing articulation of parts works , mills , railways , shipping , groups and lines of industrial establish - ments , all working together on a somewhat deli - cately balanced plan of mutual give and take .

		No
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 4 * 3 one member or section of this system is a self-suffi - cient industrial enterprise , even if it is true that no one member is strictly dependent on any other one .

		Indeed no one member or section , group , or line of industrial establishments , in this industrial universe of the new order , is a productive factor at all , except as it fits into and duly gives and takes its share in the work of the system as a whole .

		Such exceptions to this rule of interlocking processes as may appear on first examination are likely to prove exceptions in appearance only .

		They are backward trades and occupations which have not had the benefit of the Industrial Revolution and do not belong under the new , mechanistic order of industry ; or they are trades , occupations and works devoted to the con - sumption of goods or to the maintenance of the rules governing the distribution and consumption of wealth , as , for instance , menial service , police service and the apparatus of the law , the learned professions and the fine arts .

		It is also of the essence of this industrial system and its ' technology that it necessarily involves the industrial community as a whole , its working popu - lation and its material resources ; and the measure of its successful operation is determined by the effectual teamwork of its constituent parts .

		Evidently the total output of product turned out under this industrial system , the `` annual production , '' or the `` annual dividend , '' is the output of the total com - munity working together as a balanced organization of industrial forces engaged in a moving equilibrium of production .

		No part or fraction of the com - munity is a productive factor in its own right and taken by itself , since no work can be done by any segment of the community in isolation from the rest ; no one plant or works would be a producer in the absence of all the rest .

		The total product - is the product of the total community 's work .

		The question of productivity and net productivity may , therefore , be stated in general terms to the following effect : The possible or potential produc - tive capacity of any given community , having the disposal of a given complement of man power and material resources , is a matter of the state of the industrial arts , the technological knowledge which the community has the us ?

		of ; this sets the limit , determines the `` maximum '' production of which the community is capable .

		The actual production in such a community will then be determined by the extent to which the available technological effi - ciency is turned to account ; which is regulated in part by the intelligence , or education of the work - ing population , and in greater part by market condi - tions , which decide how large a product it will be profitable to turn out .

		The net product is the amount by which this actual production exceeds its own cost , as counted in terms of subsistence , and including the cost of the necessary mechanical equip - ment ; this net product will then approximately coin - cide with the annual keep , the cost of maintenance and replacement , of the investors or owners of capitalized property who are not engaged in produc - tive industry , and who are on this account some - times spoken of as the `` kept classes . ''

		Indeed , it would seem that the number and average cost , per capita of the kept classes , communibus annis , affords something of a rough measure of the net product habitually derived from the community 's annual production .

		The state of the industrial arts therefore is the indispensable conditioning circumstance which deter - mines the productive capacity of any given commun - ity ; and this is true in a peculiar degree under this new order of industry , in which the industrial arts have reached an unexampled development .

		The same decisive fact may also be described as `` the com - munity 's joint stock of technological knowledge . ''

		This common stock of technological knowledge de - cides what will be the ordinary ways and means of industry , and so it decides what will be the character and volume of the output of product which a given man power is capable of turning out .

		The working community is a productive factor only by virtue of , and only up to the limit set by , the state of the industrial arts which it has the use of .

		These of course are obvious facts , which it should scarcely be necessary to recite , except that they are habitually overlooked , perhaps because they are obvious .

		This body of technological knowledge , the state of the industrial arts , of course has always continued to be held as a joint stock .

		Indeed , this is the sub - stance of the community 's civilization on the ma - terial side , and therefore it constitutes the substantial core of that civilization .

		Like any other phase or element of the cultural heritage , it is a joint posses - sion of the community , so far as concerns its custody , exercise , increase , and transmission. ; but it has turned out , under the peculiar circumstances that condition the use of this technology among these civilized peoples , that its ownership or usufruct has come to be effectually vested in a relatively small number of persons .

		The machine technology requires for its working a large and specialized mechanical apparatus , an ever increasingly large and increasingly elaborate material equipment .

		So also it requires a large and diversified supply of material resources , both in raw materials and in the way of motive power .

		It is only on condition that these requirements are met in some passable fashion that this industrial system 414 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	will work at all , and it is only as these requirements are freely met that the machine industry will work at a high efficiency .

		At the same time the settled principles of law and usage and public policy handed down from the eighteenth century have in effect decided , and continue to decide , that all material wealth is , rightly , to be held in private ownership , and is to be made use of only subject to the unham - pered discretion of the legally rightful owner .

		Meantime the highly productive state of the indus - trial arts embodied in the technological knowledge of the new order can be turned to account only by use of this material equipment and these natural resources which continue to be held in private owner - ship .

		From which it follows that these material means of industry , and the state of the industrial arts which these material means are to serve , can be turned to productive use only so far and on such conditions as the rightful owners of the material equipment and resources may choose to impose ; which enables the owners of this indispensable ma - terial wealth , in effect , to take over the use of these industrial arts for their own sole profit .

		So that the usufruct of the community 's technological knowl - edge has come to vest in the owners of such material wealth as is held in sufficiently large blocks for the purpose .

		Therefore , by award of the settled principles of equity and self-help embodied in the modern point of view , the owners of the community 's material resources that is to say the investors in industrial business have in effect become `` seised and possessed of '' the community 's joint stock of technological knowledge and efficiency .

		Not that this accumulated knowledge of industrial forces and processes has passed into the intellectual keeping of the investors and been assimilated into their mentality , even to the extent of a reasonably scanty modicum .

		It remains true of course that the investors , owners , kept classes , or whatever designation is preferred , are quite exceptionally ignorant of all that mechanics of industry whose usufruct is vested in them ; they are in effect fully occupied with other things , and their knowledge of industry does not , and need not , extend to any rudiments of technology or industrial process .

		It is not as intelligent persons , but only as owners of material ways and means , as vested interests , that they come into the case .

		The excep - tions to this rule are only sufficiently numerous to call attention to themselves as exceptions .

		As an intellectual achievement and as a working force the state of the industrial arts continues , of course , to be held jointly in and by the community at large ; but equitable title to its usufruct has in effect passed to the owners of the indispensable material means of industry .

		The outcome is , in effect , that these owners have equitably become the sole legitimate beneficiaries of the community 's disposable margin of product above cost .

		These are also simple facts and patent , and they should seem sufficiently obvious without argument .

		They have also been explained at some length else - where .

		But this recital of what should already be commonplace information seems necessary here for the sake of a more perspicuous continuity in the present argument .

		To many persons , perhaps to the greater proportion of those impecunious persons who are sometimes spoken of collectively as `` the common man , '' the state of things which has just been out - lined may seem unfortunate .

		And further reflection on the character and prospective consequences of this arrangement is likely to add something more to the common man 's apprehension of hardship and inse - curity to come .

		Therefore it may be well to recall that this state of things has been brought to pass not by the failure of those principles of equity and self-help that lie at the root of it all , but rather by the eminently unyielding stability and self-suffi - ciency of these principles .

		It is not due to any inher - ent weakness or shiftiness in these principles of law and custom , which have faithfully remained the same as ever , and which all men adfnit were good and sound at the period of their installation .

		But it is beginning to appear now , after the event , that the inclusion of unrestricted ownership among those rights and perquisites which were allowed to stand over when the transition was made to the modern point of view is likely to prove inexpedient in the further course of growth and change .

		Unrestricted ownership of property , with inheri - tance , free contract , and self-help , is believed to have been highly expedient as well as eminently equi - table under the circumstances which conditioned civi - lized life at the period when the civilized world made up its mind to that effect .

		And the discrepancy which has come in evidence in this later time is traceable to the fact that other things have not remained the same .

		The odious outcome has been made by disturbing causes , not by these enlightened principles of honest living .

		Security and unlimited discretion in the rights of ownership were once rightly made much of as a simple and obvious safe - guard of self-direction and self-help for the common man ; whereas , in the event , under a new order of circumstances , it promises to be nothing better than a means of assured defeat and vexation for the common man .

		1918 THE DIAL 415
Vicente Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	A FULL VIEW of
Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	, the Spanish novel - ist whose war story The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse -LRB- Button ;
$ 1.90	MONEY	-RRB- and historical novel Sonnica -LRB-
Duffield	LOCATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- have recently been trans - lated into English , looks more like a composite photo - graph than a clear portrait .

		The versatile author , now approaching his fifty-second birthday , has lived a life of multifarious activity .

		He knew , as early as his eighteenth year , the ignominy of political im - prisonment an ignominy that he doubtless looked upon as glory ; he knew , as early as his thirty-first year , the recompense of fame , when he wrote his remarkable tale The Cabin , which later crossed the borders of
Spain	LOCATION	and appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes under the suggestive title Terres Maudites and this year became accessible in Eng - lish -LRB-
Knopf	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		He has pleaded his radical causes in person as well as in print , has been exiled , pardoned , acclaimed leader of the Republican party of his nation , and has represented it in the
Cortes	LOCATION	; he has translated portly tomes upon portly subjects , directed his own publishing house -LRB- through which he has been of vast assistance in disseminating new ideas -RRB- , and has achieved an international reputation based upon a steady succession of novels .

		Including his latest work , the voluminous Mare Nostrum , which has not yet been put into English , the novels alone run to about seventeen , with two more
Venus Dolorosa	PERSON	and
Los Enemigos	LOCATION	de la Mujer -LRB- The Ene - mies of Woman -RRB- in preparation .

		For a literary career which began only about
1894	DATE	and which has included travels and endless translations , not to speak of an ever growing history of the present war , his labors have been prolific , yet characteristically Spanish in their versatility .

		Both the life and the writings of this ' energetic personality have been devoted to the same high pur - pose the abolition of all enemies to progress and freedom .

		In his attitude toward
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, toward the bullfight or the evils of drink , toward the self-blighting ignorance of the very people for whom he has fought , he has been frank and fearless .

		Naturally such propagandist dynamism shows in his works , which possess the defects of their quality .

		But they have the virtues too .

		-
Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	is , above all things , a writer of intense , radiant power .

		He is quick to respond to the picturesque , whether animate in the folk of his beloved Valencia or inani - mate in that nature which he has endowed with meaningful life .

		At his best he triumphs in scenes demanding epic description , until we are over - whelmed with the sense of actuality and feel a strange thrill of actual participation .

		So absorbed does the writer become in this part of his tale that we are drawn into it with him , and almost uncon - sciously .

		For instance , both The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and
Sonnica	ORGANIZATION	deal primarily with war , the first with the eventful days of the Marne , the second with the siege of ancient Saguntum by
Hanni	PERSON	- bal ; yet in each the author is , so to speak , contem - porary with his subject .

		In each he describes war as the horrible thing it is ; not for him the prettified pictures of gold braid and gold medals .

		At
Sagun	PERSON	- tum you starve with the besieged , you behold them reduced to the verge of cannibalism , you walk with the heroic defenders of the city into the communal funeral pyre rather than surrender to the indomi - table Celtiberian .

		At Saguntum too , in the volup - tuous days before the coming of war , you revel in the orgies of Sonnica the courtesan , and it is a tribute not only to the author 's powers of recon - structing a past civilization , but also to his virtuosity , that the scenes in
Sonnica	LOCATION	's abode of pleasure are drawn with an equal measure of realism and actu - ality .


Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	has a fondness for wealth of detail , but rarely does he overdo it , as in some passages of
Mare Nostrum	ORGANIZATION	.

		Turn from
Sonnica	LOCATION	to The Four Horsemen and you are face to face with contemporary warfare in all its horrors of body and soul .

		Here , as in the earlier novel of war , the description rises to interpretation .

		The mud and blood of the trenches becomes almost visible ; the characters themselves , rather than acting against a background of war , become merely a detail of the vast mechanism .

		In this respect the Spaniard stands easily in the forefront of those who have written of the present conflict .

		He is the
Vereschagin	PERSON	of the modern war novel .

		Mare Nostrum does for warfare upon the sea what The Four Horsemen does for it on land .

		Its author was from the very first imbued with a strong pro-Ally sentiment .

		Long a lover of
France	LOCATION	and republicanism , and long devoted to Zola , from whom he probably drew his descriptive skill , he naturally let this triple love appear in his later works .

		Mare Nostrum is at once an indictment of the German U - boat methods and a trumpet call to
Spain	LOCATION	.

		In its interpretative description of the
Mediterranean Sc	LOCATION	- ' as a background for the action , he has written pages worthy of a Hugo ; this part of the novel is epic in its effect .

		The weakness of
Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	lies in characteri - zation .

		This is not so evident in his earlier as it 416 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	has become in his later novels .

		Take , for instance , so absorbing a tale as The Cabin , which suffers from a rather stiff translation into English but which is none the less superior both to The Four Horsemen and to Mare Nostrum as a work of art .

		Although it has been objected that the persons of The Cabin are types , yet there is such a throbbing intensity in their presentation that we forget , as we read , to inquire into the matter .

		Again , take what French and Italian critics look upon as the
Spaniard	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece ,
Canas	PERSON	y Barro -LRB- Reeds and Mud -RRB- , which is as yet unknown in our tongue .

		This , like the preceding tale , belongs to the regional novel , a genre that has received much attention in
Spain	LOCATION	, because of the well-defined characteristics of the vari - ous parts of the country and the peculiarities of per - son and place to which they give origin .

		Here , as in The Cabin , it may be objected that the persons are .

		types rather than characters , yet the case for effective characterization is by no means weak .

		A re-reading of such novels as these makes one ask whether the real field for their author is not in the regional - novel rather than in the more profitable , but less artistic , tales of war as exemplified in The Four Horsemen and
Mare Nostrum	ORGANIZATION	.

		Agreeing at the outset that The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and its successor were written in a worthy and triumphant cause , let us also agree not to be therefore blind to their artistic defects .

		The Four Horsemen ` suffers from two serious drawbacks in this respect .

		Not only is the characterization weak , but the interest of the novel shifts at a crucial point from one protagonist to another .

		At first we are led to believe that the tale will concern chiefly
Julio Desnoyers	PERSON	and his married sweetheart .

		Neither of these is distinguished for any depth of mind , yet the war suddenly makes self-sacrificing models of them .

		Such a transformation may be true ; in fact , under the enormous stress of contemporary warfare it must have been so in countless instances .

		Yet in a novel it is not enough to state the conversion ; it should have been prepared , however slightly .

		Once
Julio	PERSON	goes to war the author centers his attention and ours upon
Julio	PERSON	's aged father , who having in
1870	DATE	run away from military service in
France	LOCATION	, has re - turned from
South America	LOCATION	a wealthy man , only to find himself face to face with another and a greater war .

		His son 's death in a sense redeems his own previous desertion .

		Throughout , of course , the pur - pose is plain ; take away the marvelous pages of description however , and the story is not only trite but ill managed .

		Similar artistic evils beset Mare Nostrum .

		Ulises , a Spanish shipowner , is intrigued by
Freya	PERSON	, a fasci - nating beauty , into supplying German submarines with fuel .

		His country is neutral and he sees no wrong in it .

		He is destined however to have his eyes opened to the scope of his acts .

		As in the case of the preceding novel , the revela - tion comes to him through his son , who is blown up on board ship by one of the very submarines that he has provisioned .

		Freya , the German spy , is drawn in the most melodramatic fashion .

		She is a movie `` vampire '' of the first class , almost a carica - ture .

		Yet it is plainly to be seen that the author meant her seriously .

		As so frequently in this writer , the best characterization appears in the secondary - personages .

		The later novels reveal another tendency , in which , alas , the
Spaniard	ORGANIZATION	is not alone .

		He spins his yarns out to inordinate length .

		Mare Nostrum in particular is filled with a wealth of oceanographical detail , combined with snatches of history , that clearly do not belong in the book , however informative they may be .

		This is all the more to be deplored on account of the superlative beauty of some of the passages devoted to the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		There is no doubt , in one reader 's mind at least , that these later tales were written in altogether too great haste .

		One of the disadvantages of writing war books while the war is in progress is that the possibility of their being rendered anachronistic by the advance of the conflict inspires in the author a greater impa - tience than usual to get his book out as soon as pos - sible .

		Yet for all his faults ,
Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	exercises over the reader a fascination that could not be effective but for the presence of high talent .

		Other novel - ists are more expert in characterization , yet they attract us far less .

		Other writers manage a plot with greater consistency , yet we follow them with diminished ardor .

		There is in all this man does a vehemence that carries us along even over page after page of detail for detail 's sake .

		And although in choice of subject he seems to yield quite readily to the crowd , there is no such concession in the matter of style .

		He has a habit of extended indirect dis - course , for instance , as if to avoid direct quotation .

		He possesses a love of historical lore and of minutiae in description .

		He likes to write long chapters , that could easily be split into shorter and more imme - diately effective ones .

		The secret of his power may lie in the projection of his dynamic personality upon all he does .

		This lover of the glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	and the glory that is
France	LOCATION	, this hater of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	-LRB- as dis - played in
Sonnica	LOCATION	-RRB- and of contemporary
Germany	LOCATION	, is a good fighter , a passionate lover , a colorful cham - pion , an embodiment of the new
Spain	LOCATION	, or at least ,
1918	DATE	417 of one of the phases of the new
Spain	LOCATION	.

		And if the reader wishes to know the best that
Ibanez	PERSON	has done in the modern novel , let him turn , after perusing the great descriptive passages of these latest works , to such a tale as The Cabin or to
Canas y Barro	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here are no pages of padding , no inartistic projecting of purpose through plan , no shifting of interest , no excessive agglomeration of detail , no jerking of man - ikins .

		Here is thesis subordinated to or , better still , fused with art ; here is atmosphere , insight , power , proportion .

		Here is the real

GOLDBERG	PERSON	.

		The Function of Rhythm I N THE PREFACE to his new book of poems , On Heaven -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	remarks : The greater part of the book is , I notice on putting it together , in either vers libre or rhymed vers libre .

		I am not going to apologize for this or to defend vers libre as such .

		It is because I simply ca n't help it .

		Vers libre is the only medium in which I can convey any more inti - mate moods .

		Vers libre is a very jolly medium in which to write and to read , if it be read conversationally and quietly .

		And anyhow , symmetrical or rhymed verse is for me a cramped and difficult medium or an easy and uninteresting one .

		One recollects , further , that Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	has in the past been also insistent , in theory and in practice , on the point that poetry should be at least as well written as prose that , in other words , it must be good prose before it can be good poetry .

		Taken together , these ideas singularly echo a preface written one hundred and twenty odd years ago Words - worth 's preface to the
Lyrical Ballads	LOCATION	.

		In the appendix to that volume
Wordsworth	PERSON	, it will be recalled , remarked that in works of imagination the ideas , in proportion as they are valuable , whether in prose or verse , `` require and exact one and the same language . ''

		And throughout he insisted on doing away with all merely decorative language and on using the speech of daily life .

		On the matter of meter or rhythm , however , the two poets are not so entirely in agreement as they might appear to be .

		They are in agreement , it might be said , just in so far as they both seem inclined to regard the question of rhythm as only of minor or incidental importance .

		`` Metre , '' said Words - worth , `` is only adventitious to composition . ''

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	, as is seen above , candidly admits that he avoids the strictest symmetrical forms because to use them well is too difficult .

		Do both poets perhaps underestimate the value of rhythm ?

		In the light of the widespread vogue of free verse at present , it is a question interesting to speculate upon .

		And Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	's poems , which are excellent , afford us a pleasant opportunity .


Wordsworth	PERSON	's theory as to the function of rhythm was peculiar .

		He believed that as poetry consists usually in a finer distillation of the emotions than is found in prose , some check must be used lest the excitation arising therefrom , whether pleasurable or painful , exceed desired bounds .

		Rhythm is to act as a narcotic .

		`` The co-expression of something regu - lar , something to which the mind has been accus - tomed ... in a less excited state can not but have great efficacy in tempering ... the pas - sion by an admixture of ordinary feeling ... '' Only by way of incidental emendation did Words - worth suggest that in some cases meter might `` con - tribute to impart passion to the words . ''

		This is per - haps to put the cart before the horse .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	, on the other hand , while equally regarding or appear - ing to regard meter as a subsidiary element , raises a different and subtler objection to it .

		In common with a good many champions of free verse he , feels that free verse is better than symmetrical verse for the conveyance of more intimate moods .

		This is a plausible and intriguing theory .

		At first glimpse it seems only natural that in a freer and more discur - sive medium the poet should find himself better able to fix upon the more impalpable nuances of feeling .

		But a steadier inspection leaves one not quite so sure .

		If one can convey subtler moods in free verse than in symmetrical verse , might one not logically argue that prose could be subtler still than either ?

		And we should have reached the conclusion that poetry should employ , to reach its maximum effi - ciency , not only the language but also the rhythms of prose in other words , that it should be prose .

		The logic is perhaps not impeccable ; but it is sufficiently strong to suggest the presence of some error .

		If prose could convey subtler emotional moods and impressions than poetry , why write poetry ?

		We suspect however that the reverse is true , and that it is poetry which possesses the greater and subtler power of evocation .

		But the language is , largely speaking , the same in both .

		And conse - quently we must assume that this superior quality of evocativeness or magic which we associate with poetry has something to do with the fact that , more artfully than in prose , the language is arranged .

		And this arrangement is , obviously , in great part a matter of rhythm .

		8 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	This brings us back , accordingly , to the after - thought in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's appendix to the Lyrical Ballads the idea that meter may impart `` passion '' to words .

		The truth of this seems irrefragable .

		When a poet , therefore , discards rhythm he is dis - carding perhaps the most powerful single artifice of poetry which is at his disposal the particular artifice , moreover , which more than any other enables the poet to obtain a psychic control over his reader , to exert a sort of hypnosis over him .

		Rhythm is persuasive ; it is the very stuff of life .

		It is not sur - prising therefore that things can be said in rhythm which otherwise can not be said at all ; paraphrase a fine passage of poetry into prose and in the dishevel - ment the ghost will have escaped .

		A good many champions of free verse would perhaps dispute this .

		They would fall back on the theory that , at any rate , certain moods more colloquial and less intense than those of the highest type of poetry , and less colloquial and more intense than those of the highest type of prose , could find their aptest expression in this form which lies halfway between .

		But even here their position will not be altogether secure , at least in theory .

		Is any contemporary poetry more colloquial or intimate than that of
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	, who is predomi - nantly a metrical poet ?

		It is doubtful .

		Metrical verse , in other words , can accomplish anything that free verse can , and can do it more powerfully .

		What we inevitably come to is simply the fact that for some poets free verse is an easier medium than metrical verse , and consequently allows them greater efficiency .

		It is desirable therefore that such poets should employ free verse .

		They only transgress ' when they argue from this that free verse is the finer form .

		Tins it is not .

		The reasons for this would take us beyond the mere question of rhythm .

		When
Wordsworth	PERSON	re - marked that one could re-read with greater pleasure a painful or tragic passage of poetry than a similar passage of prose , although he mistakenly ascribed this as altogether due to the presence of meter , he never - theless touched closely upon the real principle at issue .

		For compared with the pleasure derived from the reading of prose , the pleasure of reading poetry is two-natured : in addition to the pleasure afforded by the ideas presented , or the material -LRB- a pleasure which prose equally affords -RRB- , there is also the more purely esthetic delight of the art itself , a delight which might be described as the sense of perfection in complexity , or the sense of arrangement .

		This arrangement is not solely a question of rhythm .

		It is also concerned with the selection of elements in the language more vividly sensuous and with the more adroit combination of ideas with a view to set - ting them - off to sharper advantage .

		Given two poems in which the theme is equally delightful and effective on the first reading , that poem of the two which develops the theme with the richer and more perfect complexity of technique will longer afford pleasure in re-reading .

		It is , in other words , of more permanent value .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	confesses in advance that he prefers a less to a more complex form of art .

		As a matter of fact Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	is too modest .

		When he speaks of free verse he does not mean , to the extent in which it is usually meant , verse without rhythm .

		At his freest he is not far from a genuinely rhythmic method ; and in many respects his sense of rhythm is both acute and individual .

		Three poems in his book would alone make it worth printing :
Antwerp	LOCATION	, which is one of the three or four brilliant poems inspired by the war ;
Footsloggers	ORGANIZATION	, which though not so good , is none the less very readable ; and On Heaven , the poem which gives the volume its name .

		It is true that in all three of these poems Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	very often employs a rhythm which is almost as dispersed as that of prose ; but the point to be emphatically remarked is that he does so only by way of variation on the given norm t -RRB- f move - ment , which is essentially and predominantly rhyth - mic .

		Variation of this sort is no more or less than good artistry ; and Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	is a very competent artist , in whose hands even the most captious reader feels instinctively and at once secure .

		Does he at times overdo the dispersal of rhythm ?

		Perhaps .

		There are moments , in
Antwerp	LOCATION	and .

		in On Heaven , when the relief of the reader on coming to a force - fully rhythmic passage is so marked as to make him suspect that the rhythm of the passage just left was not forceful enough .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	is of a discursive temperament , viewed from whatever angle , and this leads him inevitably to over-inclusiveness and mo - ments of let-down .

		One feels that a certain amount of cutting would improve both
Antwerp	LOCATION	and On Heaven .

		Yet one would hesitate to set about it oneself .

		Both poems are delightful .

		Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	writes with gusto and imagination , and what is perhaps rarer among contemporary poets with tenderness .

		On Heaven may not be the very highest type of poetry it is clearly of the more colloquial sort , delightfully expatiative , skilful in its use of the more subdued tones of prose but it takes hold of one , and that is enough .

		One accepts it for what it is , not demand - ing of it what the author never intended to give it that higher degree of perfection in intricacy , that more intense and all-fusing synthesis , which would have bestowed on it the sort of beauty that more per - manently endures .

		1918 THE DIAL 419 The Light Essay r ERHAPS IT is hardly fair to relegate the light essay to the less creative forms of literature , to see it as journalism dressed up , as it were , for a literary party .

		Yet when you have begun to identify `` crea - tive '' writing with novels , verse , and drama you find yourself belittling the essay as scarcely more than a subterfuge , an illegitimate method of securing the literary sensation without doing the genuine literary work .

		You suspect that the light essayist is a per - son who was born without the narrative style and the poetic gift , who has not had enough adventures or does not understand life well enough to write stories , and lacks the divine fire for verse .

		In spite of the
august	DATE	examples of the essay which our pro- fessors slowly brought us to admire , most of us would rather be a Maxim Gorky than a Lamb , or have written The Brook
Kerith	PERSON	than the Sketchbook of
Washington Irving	LOCATION	.

		American writers especially seem to be compensating for their lack of novelistic talent by a striking artistic capacity for the light essay .

		They do not , like the protean Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton , simply toss it in as one of the many things they can do .

		They found whole literary careers on it .

		But you always feel something lacking , even in the piquant petulance of Miss Repplier , the sly charm of Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	, the urbanity of Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	, and even in the inexhaustibly witty fooling of
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	.

		Just the last vivifying touch is absent .

		You feel that it is proper that most of these writers are middle-aged , and most of their readers too .

		.

		The youthful light essayist is usually a painful phenomenon .

		He is apt to be ostentatiously bright .

		The middle-aged mind is legitimately mellow , and its self-consciousness is rather pleasant .

		We know that it has ruminated over and is aware of a lot of things that happened before we were born .

		But vivid green shoots ca n't be mellow .

		The young essayist is afraid you will think he is unsophisticated , while the middle-aged does n't much care if you do .

		And youth 's idea of being whimsical is usually to nose about among the irrelevant , and be very bold with the trivial .

		The youthful essayist usually develops into the professional anecdotalist , with an active mind that is harnessed up to no real thinking but can only stream off from itself a futile current of amusing incident .

		When Mr.
Robert Cortes Holliday	PERSON	, therefore , in his Walking-Stick Papers -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , de - scribes himself as a `` pale , spectacled , middle-aged young man '' you are prepossessed in his favor .

		A middle-aged young man ought to write pretty good light essays .

		He ought to be mellow without giving you the impression that life has no more adventures , and he ought to be as diverting as his youth and naivete will let him .

		The first requirement of the light essay is that it should amuse you .

		To be amused is to experience one of the really great pieces of good fortune in life .

		The trouble with most pretended amusement is the suddenness of your deflation .

		Mere wit and anecdote go out like a candle in the wind .

		But the good essay does not stale .

		You leave it refreshed and in a nice glow of pleasedness , and its flavor follows you .

		So that it is this quality of amusingness that finally saves the light essay from the non-creative reproach .

		But all the more ghastly are the efforts that fail .

		The light essay is a truly perilous thing .

		Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	does not fail .

		Almost every page is amusing , and amusing in so simple a way that it rather astonishes you .

		He does not overload like
Strunsky	PERSON	, and yet he is not thin .

		When you find yourself turning back to get the exact words in which he describes the departure of the Whartons and
Henry James	PERSON	from the Scribner shop , or the call of
Chesterton	LOCATION	, or the expensive girls at the art exhibition , you decide that it was no mistake to capture these papers from the journals for which they were written , and put them between the covers of a book .

		To be sure , Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	gives your mind no run for your money .

		He seems to have no particular convictions , and he has not a touch of scholarliness .

		His motto is : `` It is a very pleasant thing to go about in the world and see all the people . ''

		Scrubwomen and `` bartenders in very low places , '' as well as policemen , are among those people whose conversation he vajues .

		He shares with you the
romance %	PERCENT	of the fish-reporter 's life .

		He delights in the thunder of the trucks on Hudson Street .

		He loiters on upper Broadway , hunts lodgings , and takes you behind the scenes of the book reviewer 's sorry life .

		And with all his informality of language and mood he always manages to escape both cheapness and self-consciousness .

		I do n't know how much of Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	's appeal comes from the fact that he is so charmingly one of the submerged , observing the world from behind the counter of a bookshop or a reporter 's desk , or from the anonymous sidewalk .

		Here is no respect - ability to maintain .

		He is neither a gentleman nor a preacher nor a maiden lady nor even a playgoer , as most American essayists are .

		He is not dignity unbending and rather obviously in the act of play .

		This irresponsible obscurity has so many advantages that you wish he had endowed his papers occasion - 420 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	ally with more mind .

		Not the least amusing touch is his dedication to `` three fine men ''
Brownell	PERSON	,
Belloc	ORGANIZATION	, and
Cortissoz	PERSON	, three tough knights of reac - tion if there ever were any .

		Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	is the cat looking at these kings .

		He admires them be - cause `` they represent to my mind the best things going ; the pure milk of the word . ''

		Well , it is fortunate for him that the mysterious processes of animal chemistry transform the purest milk into strange new forms of tissue and blood .

		In these papers there is not the faintest trace of the style , attitudes , or opinions of these `` fine men . ''

		Is this the adorable naivete of a young man who admires without in the least comprehending , or who is so genuinely humble that he does not even imitate ?

		So perhaps it is lucky he has left out the mind , and given us his diverting pictures of celebrities in the solemn business of buying books , and of succumbing to his Literary Levities in
London	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	is not one of those writers who believe that to do a light essay all one needs is a light subject .

		Mr.
Carl Van Vechten	PERSON	is .

		So in The Merry-Go-Round -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- he writes on Music and Cooking , De Senectute - Cantorum , and then stuffs his pages with the most deplorably indi - gestible facts and anecdotes imaginable .

		For he is of that school of which
James Huneker	PERSON	is the grand - father and
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	the honored immediate sire .

		They are a curious crowd .

		They combine the utmost ferocity of conviction against the aca - demic and the puritanical with a pedantic fondness for the ragbag of facts .

		They are , or have been , most of them , musical and theatrical critics or invet - erate reviewers .

		And it is , of course , good for crit - ics to be erudite .

		As reviewers their minds require and receive continual fertilization of after-the-play suppers and convivial glasses .

		Their paradise is
Munich	LOCATION	, that dowdy city of heavenly beer , bad art , , good music , and a German king 's idea of Greek architecture .

		In their friendly intercourse there must be much barter of facts and anecdotes .

		And one can not write description , or praise and blame , interminably .

		So into their writing , little by little , the facts do creep , the mere historical rubbish of the profession , and you get light essays like those of Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	, delineating every instance where musicians and food have come into contact , or reciting lists of the musical comedies he saw in his younger days .

		Or you get pages strewn with felicities like this : ``
Sophie Arnould	PERSON	, one of the most celebrated actresses of the
Eighteenth century	DATE	, died in poverty at the age of 63 , and there is no record of her burial place . ''

		There are , of course , minds like that .

		But to read their work is as uncomfortable as taking out the stuffing of a sofa-pillow to rest your head against .

		And yet Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	's intentions are evidently all for the light essay for the bright unconventional sauntering about the musical , dramatic , and literary fair .

		But like the others of his school , his gustatory capacities are too enormous .

		He can swallow any amount of bad plays , and any number of pseudo-deca - dents like
Edgar Saltus	PERSON	and
Erik Satie	PERSON	.

		When he chooses out
Feydeau	ORGANIZATION	and
Mirbeau	LOCATION	and Avery Hop - wood and
Philip Moeller	PERSON	to praise in the theater , you feel that hatred of puritanism has thrown his taste , as it has that of Mencken 's , askew .

		His essay In
Defense of Bad Taste	ORGANIZATION	argues in favor of sincerity , and that is good .

		But the trouble with his school , with the
Menckens	PERSON	and the
Nathans	PERSON	, is not that their taste is bad but that it is all disinte - grated .

		They mire themselves in facts because their learning is not assimilated to their tastes .

		Neither are their tastes harmonious with each other .

		These critics appreciate the second-rate , not because they do not know any better , but because the whole slant of their judgment has tended to take up the defense of whatever the puritan mind most violently objects to .

		They have , one feels , let their taste be deter - mined rather by negativing the puritan than by positively asserting a strong modern harmony of appreciation .

		Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	however deserves some mitiga - tion of these strictures .

		He is always as sprightly as his intellectual dough will allow him to be .

		Where he can resist the clutch of facts , as in the little piece called Au Bal Musette , he is graphic and amusing .

		Here he has the light essay trembling on the very verge of the short story , and you find him writing with a power that you wish he would of tener avail himself of .

		He leaves the impression elsewhere of a talent that has been somewhat coarsened either by too much use or by a following of minor prophets .

		What saves him in the end is the freshness and warmth of his appreciations .

		The Impressions of the Theater , the notes on
Mimi Aguglia	PERSON	,
Isadora Duncan	PERSON	, and the Spanish dancers of The Land of Joy are fine pieces of discerning admiration .

		In a merry-go-round of criticism it is , after all , this fine cordiality of liking that the reader himself warms to .

		Just as Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	wins us by his sense of the pleasantness of the world , so Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	wins us by his feeling , all theories put aside , for the downright delight of dramatic genius .

		And at their best both of these young American writers do lift the light essay out of that disparaged level of non - creation , and make it not only truly amusing but imaginatively artistic as well .

		1918 THE DIAL 421
London	LOCATION	,
October 14	DATE	I READ RECENTLY in a volume by a distinguished and vivacious American critic , whom I like so much that I may even end by respecting him , a paper on The Great American Novel ; and my blood is fired to rivalry .

		No lesser subject than
The Great English Novel	ORGANIZATION	shall content me .

		I think however that what Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	meant by the phrase was a novel -LRB- still in the womb of time -RRB- which should express the whole of the American Re - public even as Balzac expressed -LRB- or failed to express it depends on the point of view -RRB- the whole of the
France	LOCATION	of his time .

		I ask nothing so portentous : I shall be quite happy with a good novel , even if it only expresses an eccentric family in an obscure corner of a provincial town .

		To my mind the English novel is passing through a stage of ferment which can hardly fail to produce something really good .

		To be sure , we have our fine , established , elder writers already .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	no longer abides our question ; Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	is a great man ; and if the position of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is not unquestionable , at all events I do not think it is open to profitable questioning at the moment .

		But if we move ten or twenty years further down we see a welter of reputations half made and barely begun which will really repay examination .

		My opinion is that there is now a greater number of English writers trying their utmost , to the exclusion of all other considerations , to compose gdod novels than has ever existed before .

		Let me name as many as I can remember :
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	,
Ford Madox Hueffer	ORGANIZATION	,
Frank Swinnerton	PERSON	,
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	,
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	,
F. Brett Young	PERSON	,
Viola Meynell	PERSON	,
J. M. Murry	PERSON	,
Katharine Mansfield	PERSON	,
E. M. Delafield	PERSON	,
Ethel Mayne	PERSON	,
Rebecca West	PERSON	, and
Norman Douglas	PERSON	.

		I do not pretend that this list is exhaustive ; but , to use a disrespectful phrase , what a menagerie it is !

		Neither do I pre - tend that all of these writers are equally good ; but I do assert that all are writers of keen sensibilities , good intellects , and technical accomplishments , and that all are trying to produce artistically justifiable books rather than books which will sell .

		Apart from the general ferment which is passing throughout our literature , I think two main factors are at work here .

		In the first place , the vision of the technically perfect and harmonious novel is still near to us and still unrealized .

		It stimulated the nineties ; but the nineties somehow never did pro- duce anything as good as
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	.


Henry James	PERSON	and Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	were divine exceptions ; and any - way we felt rather humbly thankful for them than proud of them as Englishmen .

		In the second place , psychology , which was the child of the novelists , has like so many modern children taken to bringing its parents up to date .

		Modern advances in the science of the mind have given a real stimulus to the writing of fiction ; and though this stimulus has resulted so far mainly in much disorder and extravagance , it has produced good results already and will produce better .

		A good many persons in
England	LOCATION	sneer at the antics of the psychoanalysts ; and I admit that there seems to be something about the Freudian doctrine which turns its followers occasionally into buffoons .

		It may , too , promise to explain much more than it is capable of explaining ; but to reject it on those grounds is merely to own oneself incapable of distinguishing between good results and bad .

		Advances in psychology are possible , not illusory , things .

		Stendhal really does tell us more about the workings of the mind than the
Gesta Roman	ORGANIZATION	- orum ; and the methods of psychoanalysis promise to tell us more still .

		For my part , I rejoice to hear my friends babbling about the Censor and Introverts and Extroverts and the Undifferentiated Function .

		It delights me to see Mr.
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	clinging grimly through three hundred odd pages to the tail of the Unconscious .

		Sometimes I am extremely bored and sometimes I think they are grossly in error ; but I bear with them gladly , knowing that they are taking psychoanalysis out of the hands of the doctors and bringing it from the asylum into the street .

		God forbid that I should seem to belittle the importance of psychoanalysis in the asylum .

		If my aunt takes it into her head that she is a rabbit and can only live in a hutch , I am grateful to the alienist who discovers that this illusion is due to the long suppression of her religious sense , and can re - move it .

		But I shall also be grateful to the creative artist who , in the more important business of explain - ing normal humanity , can tell me why I turned viciously on my best friend and wounded him almost beyond forgiveness , or why tonight , without dis - coverable cause , when the news from the front is good and my bank balance beyond reproach , I am sad and feel that I live in a gray and hateful world .

		This last passage is perhaps a trifle egotistic psychoanalysis takes one that way .

		Let me return as much as I can to the objective .

		The modern novel is moved by these forces which make for strength and excellence .

		It is also affected a good deal , I believe , in the minutiae of its composition by the copiousness and excellence of modern verse .

		It derives from the lyrists more color , cleaner and 422
November 16	DATE	closer diction , greater condensation , and more vivid - ness of feeling than it had before .

		But it has one serious defect , which , unless it is overcome , will go far to nullify all its advantages .

		It is too sketchy .

		The average length of the novel has steadily declined for many years ; and in spite of certain examples to the contrary , it continues to decline .

		It is quite extraordinary how this fact has escaped recognition as something hostile to proper development .

		We are all novelists and critics alike biased not by our own feelings , but simply by a ridiculous fear of ridicule in favor of brevity .

		The novelists have been terrorized into an absurd anxiety to avoid boring us , and when one of them does run over five hundred pages we all mechanical - ly shrug our shoulders and behave as though he had set us a perfectly impossible task .

		But these pro- tests are all really purely mechanical .

		No one dis - likes length in a good novel , and well the best sellers know it .

		Sir
Hall Caine	PERSON	,
Miss Marie Corelli	PERSON	, ``
Richard Dehan	PERSON	, '' and the rest throw enormous wads of language at their public ; and the public accepts it all and craves for more .

		Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	however and Miss ' West creep modestly about , at - tenuated shadows of their proper selves , quite unable to understand that anyone can endure more than eighty or a hundred thousand words from them at a time .

		And the result of this is quite obvious .

		The novel is the fullest and most discursive form oj literary art that exists .

		It is its business to giv < us high moments certainly , but also to rationaliz -LRB- and substantiate those moments by setting therr against a detailed background .

		The lyric and th < drama convince us by lightning flashes of imagina tion ; the novel must persuade .

		And when th -LRB- novelist does not allow himself enough room , h < does not persuade .

		He offers us sketches insteac of finished pictures .

		He does not sufficiently satisfy our powers of attention and apprehension ; and at th < end he leaves us with a sense of something lacking I said that there were examples to the contrary and I find them in Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	am Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		Here you have a fertile and vigorou faculty of invention which illuminates every sid < of the chosen theme and uses up every scrap of th < chosen material .

		I do not think they are perfec novelists .

		Neither of them has the poetry of Mr
Brett Young	PERSON	or the intellectual strictness of Mr
Swinnerton	PERSON	; but in their exuberance and breadtl of enterprise they make most of their contemporarie look like pale creeping ghosts .

		And unless thei : contemporaries realize this and make up their mind to let themselves go , the great age of the Englisl novel , which I do feel to be a possibility , will per haps be postponed for a generation or more .

		EDWARD SHANKS .

		I will no longer seek I am tired and blind .

		My hands are shadows that the shadows bind .

		And yet each year the blind leaves push and peer From iron boughs .

		I can not say the trees Have sought , or ceased , or known uncertainties .

		I sent myself too far , perhaps ... I found There is no way to follow to its star The light that breaks in crystal on the ground .

		There are no distances : I can not see Beyond the line of poplars at my door .

		All is a mist a gray vacuity ... And now the tremulous poplars bud once more !

		It is like music , like a pastoral horn Sounding across old chasms .

		There is born A delicate color somewhere in my brain An ecstasy made clear and visible .

		The poplars draw their rigid parallel Against the gray ; but I have traveled far To trace all starlight to a single star .

		Beauty is but a sickness of the mind And yet , and yet I can not say the trees Have sought , or ceased , or known uncertainties ; Or answer what the roots of poplars find .

		THE DIAL
CLARENCE BRITTEN GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS SCOFIELD THAYER HELEN MAROT	PERSON	ALTHOUGH ALL THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION returns have not been tabulated at the time of our going to press , it is already indicated with a fair de - gree of certainty that the Republicans have won for the next
Congress	ORGANIZATION	a slim majority in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and a somewhat larger comparative majority in the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even the more astute political prophets are surprised at the result .

		Many predicted that as does seem to be the case in
David I. Walsh	PERSON	's election in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	the President 's appeal , uncon - ventional as it may have been , would win the general support of the voters .

		But whatever the final figures may be , the striking increase in Republican votes is indisputable and the party is justified in claiming , on the whole , a victory .

		THE DIAL is not a political party organ in any sense , but it will not attempt to conceal its disappointment at the fact that the coun - try did not choose to back President
Wilson	PERSON	defi - nitely and decisively in his policies both of war and of peace .

		However , one point is certainly overlooked by those liberals who are now wringing their hands in despair and claiming that reactionism has com - pletely triumphed and that sanction has been given for a punitive as distinguished from a reconciliatory peace .

		The international issue entered very little into the present campaign .

		Certainly the issue of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	did not even impinge on the consciousness of the majority of voters .

		How could it ?

		The
Administration	ORGANIZATION	itself never raised the issue of the kind of peace it advocated a
Wilson	PERSON	peace , as against a Lodge and
Roosevelt	PERSON	peace until a few days before election , when it was too late for any - thing except futile partisan strife .

		But the Admin - istration went further .

		Not only did it not raise the issue , it did everything it could to prevent any discussion about terms of peace on a liberal basis .

		The very people who would have been glad to sup - port and give publicity to President
Wilson	PERSON	's liberal ideas were prevented from writing and speaking .

		The violent and vindictive and militaristic spokes - men , on the other hand , were given carte blanche , and for over a year ever since the passage of the Espionage Act , in a word we have been given an exhibition of how public opinion can be molded and guided towards a reactionary end .

		We never did have a liberal press in this country even worthy to lick the boots of the English liberal press or , for that matter , the French or Italian liberal press , and what little we did have was , on the passage of the Espionage Act , promptly quashed where not intim - idated from speaking .

		The Administration prac - tically told us that free speech and free opinion would have to be waived during the period of the war , in the interest of national unity .

		Of course ' the opposition gladly acquiesced , for it was perfectly willing to have anything liberal buried as quickly as possible .

		It was quite prepared to , and as later events proved , did identify free speech and free opinion with sedition and treason .

		The practical re - sult , of course , was that the only speech and opinion which could be uttered or written freely was re - actionary speech and opinion .

		After a year or more of this perfectly unnecessary and shameful reign of terror over anybody who dared to think differently from the easily swayed majority , the President issued an appeal to the voters to support him in a policy , especially in a peace policy , which was the diamet - rical opposite of everything that the public had been reading in the newspapers and magazines , or hearing in the streets and homes , or seeing in our national institutions of light and leading , the moving-picture houses .

		It had in sober truth reached a point in this country where to support the President literally was considered almost identical to pro-Germanism .

		Small wonder if the voters repudiated at the polls a policy which all the practical acts of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	had taught them to despise .

		But the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	can not now complain of what has happened to it .

		You can not eat your cake and have it too .

		You can not educate public opinion one way and then expect it to support you on the basis of a merely personal and what most people believed mistakenly , of course a merely partisan appeal .

		We frankly prefer a
Wilson	PERSON	to a Roosevelt peace .

		So , we think , do the majority of the American people , or at least so they would , if they had been allowed to discuss the issues of the war freely .

		Even today we believe that a majority of the American people prefer a real
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	to a war ending in the old kind of balance of power .

		But if the voice of the polls seems to dispute this optimism -LRB- as certainly the Re - publican leaders will now try to make it appear -RRB- , where can the responsibility lie but at the door of the - Administration itself ?

		Certainly if ever it was proved that the right of free speech and free assemblage was imperative in war time , this election has proved it .

		424 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	1WO ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLIE THE AMERICAN AT - titude towards peace assumptions which may yet wreck the prospects of a better world order .

		They are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The primary thing necessary for the mainte - nance of peace is the organization of force to sup - press the wilful wrongdoer .

		War is caused by evil nations ' using their armies for a cause which they know to be wrong .

		They must be suppressed and made to abide by what is right , which is quite easy to determine .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Since this is a righteous nation , it is in favor of peace .

		It goes without saying .

		There is noth - ing that this country can do to promote peace except to be so strong that evil nations will fear to attack it , and that it can be ready to use force on the side of righteousness .

		Because some such attitude as this is so general , lead - ers of the type of Messrs.
Taft	PERSON	and
Roosevelt	PERSON	may very successfully and with the best intentions in the world wreck the President 's efforts towards the beginnings of a new world order .

		The main problem of peace is not how to - organize repression but how to change the conditions which lead to war , even as between nations which are not inherently evil .

		The problem of war did not begin when the world took up arms against the Germans .

		Most of the Allies have fought one another bitterly , and may fight bitterly again -LRB- perhaps in alliance with Ger - many -RRB- , and the peace problem is to prevent happen - ing in the future what has so often happened in the past .

		Most nations when they fight do not be - lieve themselves in the wrong .

		Generally they believe themselves passionately in the right .

		War is not generally a conflict of clear wrong against clear right ; it is more often what the Greek declared it to be , a conflict of two rights .

		If the old .

		condi - tions are perpetuated , war will be inevitable , because the old conditions bore , and will bear again , most unfairly in favor of some nations and against others .

		Arbitration or an international court is in these circumstances generally useless , because all that a court can do is to judge on the basis of the old law and practice , and that has proved utterly inadequate .

		Our first task is to determine how the old rules shall be changed , to what extent we will agree to that change and make sacrifices on its behalf .

		Before our policeman can be effective there must be a law to which he compels obedience .

		The enforcement of peace means , in the last analysis , the enforcement of a certain law .

		What is that law ?

		Our first task is legislative , not penal .

		To illustrate concretely .

		It is agreed that
France	LOCATION	is to have
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	;
England	LOCATION	, the German colonies ;
Poland	LOCATION	, the Polish provinces .

		If the new `` owners '' care to exclude
Germany	LOCATION	from getting any raw materials whatever from
Lorraine	LOCATION	,
Morocco	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	generally ,
Poland	LOCATION	, that is their affair .

		It is the `` law . ''

		Result : on one side of the border , a people living in a rich country whose population of forty million is no larger than it was a hundred years ago , with an im - mense overseas empire and vast reserves of raw material which they do not need ; across the border , living on a poor soil , a rapidly expanding population of seventy , eighty , in a few years a hundred million , deprived of raw material vitally necessary to their livelihood .

		Has
France	LOCATION	the `` right '' to say that for the purposes of peaceful industry no German shall mine ore in
Morocco	LOCATION	, or buy palm oil in the
Congo	LOCATION	?

		What conferred the `` right '' ?

		Again , certain of the new states we are recognizing need outlets to the sea .

		Czecho-Slovakia will be absolutely land - locked .

		Jugo-Slavia may find it needs ports which .


Italy	LOCATION	, for military and naval reasons , may claim , or that its trade demands access to undoubtedly Ital - ian ports , which access on equal terms
Italy	LOCATION	refuses .

		Result : a conflict in which Jugo-Slavs passionately believe the right is on their side .

		But the law is on
Italy	LOCATION	's .

		The conflict becomes embittered with tariffs and discriminations until finally a German-Jugo - Slav understanding develops into an alliance .


Ukrainia	LOCATION	quarrels with
Poland	LOCATION	-LRB- she is now doing so -RRB- , and a German-Ukrainian alliance develops .

		Jugo-Slavia starts a war against
Italy	LOCATION	on the cry of `` right of access to the sea '' ;
Ukrainia	LOCATION	against Po - land on the cry of `` right of access to raw materials . ''

		Both tomorrow will be German cries .

		The present law is certain .

		But on which side is the right ?

		What is the
League to Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	going to do about it ?

		America not concerned ?

		Then why is Colonel Roosevelt today so busy redrawing the map of
Europe	LOCATION	in every speech he makes and settling the destinies of precisely the countries mentioned ?

		And if Americans are ready to enforce certain laws on
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	, are they ready to accept them themselves in the Isthmus , in the
Phil	LOCATION	- ippines , in our commercial relations with
Mexico	LOCATION	and Central and
South America	LOCATION	?

		Until we have answered such questions in our own minds , and are ready to pay the price that the answer demands , we have not made our contribution to the permanent peace of the world .

		IlISTORY TEACHES FEW LESSONS .

		THE EXAMPLE of the French Revolution is utterly lost on the mod - ern Bourbons who believe that the excuse of this war can be used now , as then , for an attempt to crush social revolution everywhere .

		Many naive observers look piously shocked when it is suggested that a war begun for democracy is ending in a con - scious attempt to destroy all forms of radicalism .

		Yet the following quotation is not from some
Bour	PERSON	- bon royalist journal , but from The
New York	LOCATION	Evening Sun : If such a tendency -LSB- revolution -RSB- spreads through the de - feated and disaster-crazed German army , the most terrible consequences to civilization are to be feared in the next year or two .

		It may come to the point where the Ally Powers and the
United States	LOCATION	may be compelled to lend
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 425 aid to the German Government in restraining the whirl - wind of popular wrath and preventing too great excesses .

		Obviously it is not to the interest of the world at large that the reconstruction of the
German State	ORGANIZATION	and the sub - stitution of democratic rule for autocracy should be per - mitted to degenerate into a reign of terror or a regime of ruin .

		Whether the capacity to hold down the revolu - tionary wave to sane limitations will remain in the broken and discredited political leaders who are responsible for the war and the debacle may be doubted .

		They may have to implore outside aid to prevent the supplementing of outside chastisement by domestic frenzy , resulting to - gether in irreparable calamity .

		There may remain no choice to the Allies save to pacify the country and turn it over to a sobered and stable popular government in - spired by the judgment of the citizens , not by the passions of a mob .

		Only one observation needs to be made on this shameful proposal .

		We entered this war to crush German autocracy ; we did not enter it to shoot workingmen revolting against their government in the streets of
Munich	LOCATION	or
Berlin	LOCATION	; we did not enter it to help form an international strike-breaking union .

		As far as revolution in
Germany	LOCATION	goes , we entered the war primarily with the hope of stimulat - ing just such a revolution .

		After stimulating it , are we now to be told that our real task is to suppress it ?

		This would indeed be the final irony .

		AMONG BOOKLOVERS THE OUTBREAK OF WAR raised a gust of prediction that this vast material , this sharp stimulant would round off all the literary careers which in those days seemed to be at loose ends , and that it would moreover disclose a large company of Miltons otherwise mute and inglorious .

		We expected to come into a war literature limited in its variety only by the extreme number of ways in which the human spirit can react to an engrossing reality .

		Now , in the midst of a book season from which the war has crowded nearly everything but itself , we find our prediction ludicrously wide of the mark .

		With only one or two exceptions , the war has clinched no reputation the world was beginning to herald in
1914	DATE	, though it has upset many which then seemed safely established ; and , with only a few more exceptions , it has discovered no fresh talents of dis - tinction .

		Instead of the rich variety we anticipated , we have a few clumsy molds into which war-time letters have poured themselves for four years : the propaganda of justification , of morale -LRB- with its attendant superstitions of consolation -RRB- , and now of reconstruction has absorbed and more often than not discredited our contributions to history , to phi - losophy and religion , to the social sciences , and even to many of the so-called pure sciences , while it has destroyed the integrity of fiction and tainted much of what has been written about the fine arts ; undi - gested or perfunctory war journalism has taken possession of travel and reminiscence , until the reader flounders in a morass of diaries , letters , and memoirs `` war books '' indistinguishable except by their jackets ; verse has pretty much divided between a strained experimentalism and the monotonous me - chanical vigor of the
Kipling-Service	ORGANIZATION	school ; drama has substituted spies for crooks and has forgotten mere human nature ; biography , one of the glories of English literature , has dwindled away ; belles lettres have all but disappeared .

		To every count in so sweeping a statement there are of course brilliant exceptions .

		Under Fire established the reputation of
Henri Barbusse	PERSON	and drew along with it the revi - sion and translation of his earlier L'Enfer .

		The war discovered to us Andreas Latzko and
Robert Graves	ORGANIZATION	, a soldier-poet whose Fairies and
Fusiliers	ORGANIZATION	is equally indifferent to radical experiment and to mechanical prosody .

		Philosophy , if not so preten - tious as sometimes , still keeps its self-respect in Ber - trand
Russell	PERSON	's Mysticism and Logic and in
Gil	PERSON	- bert
Murray	PERSON	's
Religio Grammatici	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the field of political theory there are , among other exceptions , the uncompromising conviction of
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	's Freedom and the unflinching realism of
Walter Weyl	PERSON	's The End of the War .

		Sometimes a novel - ist as
Frank Swinnerton	ORGANIZATION	remains artist enough to disdain either prostituting his characters to the spiritual claims , of war or employing the sword to cut his Gordian knots .

		Biography , too , has lately given us
Lytton Strachey	LOCATION	's Eminent Victorians .

		But such exceptions only illuminate the prevailing waste of mediocrity , revealing all too clearly the monoto - nous configuration of a desert of books whose authors have reacted to the infinitely complex reality of this war in some half-dozen stereotyped ways .

		Here is another task of after-the-war reconstruction the rehabilitation of literature and its restoration to dig - nity after the atrocities of martial invasion .

		OELDOM DOES A PUBLIC LIBRARY BOOK EVER SLIP through the routine of cataloguing , labeling , and issuing with its edges still uncut with its pages un - defiled by the prosaic paper knife of an unfeeling assistant .

		On the rare occasions when this does hap - pen it brings a thrill of pleasure to the real book - lover who chances to discover it .

		Of course the logical thing to do would be to offer up the volume on the altar of efficiency by directing someone 's at - tention to the oversight .

		But the real booklover does n't do that sort of thing .

		He feels something of the pride of ownership something of the trustee - ship of a literary heritage as he carries the book home , there to turn leisurely through its pages with his own ivory or silver handled knife , stealing peeps at tempting paragraphs , happy in the knowledge that these pages have never been perused before .

		Such a book is like a bloom unsevered from the stem : it is bright and clean and undrooping .

		Unprofaned by pencil , unsmudged by thumb , it yields its message joyfully .

		What a pity that the library ca n't leave the boon of cutting the leaves to the first reader always .

		But there is the danger that the first reader may be the unloving reader , the impatient reader who jabs with hairpin or slashes with pen - knife .

		After all , ` twere better to make an initial sacrifice than risk an initial sacrilege .

		426 THE DIAL
November 16	DATE	Communications iDLE-MlNDEDNESS AND RECONSTRUCTION SIR : I have .

		read with much interest Mr.
Freder	PERSON	- ick 's article -LSB- in THE DIAL for
October 19	DATE	-RSB- and can agree in a large measure with it .

		I think his vision is broad and his recognition of the problems to be solved quite in accordance with the exigencies of the situation .

		The one and only difficulty I see in carry - ing out his proposition is the selection of the men to act on the committees .

		If they are selected from men who believe that the business methods of the past are correct , the new business system as organized will be only slightly modified from the old business system .

		In other words , we shall still have a busi - ness for profits rather than a business for production .

		Unless these committees can be dominated by people who believe that the good of the community is super - ior to the good of any class , and are willing to organize a new business system on those lines , the details of how the committees are constituted or what they do will not matter very much .

		If on the other hand these committees recognize that human rights come before property rights , that production comes , before profits , that the good of the community is superior to the good of any individual or class , then the details will rapidly arrange themselves .

		From these few statements the conclusion follows irresistibly that the study of idle-mindedness and its elimination are more important than the study of efficiency and its increase .

		If we could bring all the members of the community up to a degree of efficiency approximating that which is being attained by some , the change in our industrial conditions would be so great in a few years as to be almost unbelievable .

		You naturally ask how I know this .

		My reply is that for the past three years we have been studying idle-mindedness rather than efficiency , and while we have so far developed only what might be called crude methods for so doing , our results have been a most remarkable .

		Moreover we have had the cooperation of the , intelligent workers and managers everywhere , and the opposition only of those managers and workmen who were aware of their inability to hold their posi - tions and earn the salaries which they were being paid .

		The study of idle-mindedness , with the develop - ment of methods for its elimination , is the great change which the war has produced in our work .

		To be sure , many people have been willing to accept this principle as an emergency war measure .

		To us it has no such significance , but is the base on which our new industrialism must be reared after the war .

		If we were obliged to do this to win the war , we shall be obliged to continue doing it to keep the war won ; and that nation which does it most intelli - gently , other things equal , will become the economic leader of the world .

		We can best understand the significance of this fact when we realize that the collapse of the Central Empires was more an economic collapse than a mili - tary collapse .

		In fact , army officers returning from
France	LOCATION	tell us the German army is not yet beaten , and that it would take from one to two years more for us to beat them , provided they did not run short of supplies of some sort .

		There is no question that the military strength of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	, and Aus - tria was sapped by the failure of their economic - strength .

		It is of vast importance that we should learn this lesson while it stands before us , and that we should build our economic system of the future in such a manner as to develop the maximum of economic strength , which can only be developed by cooperation ^ Cooperation can not be established with - out mutual confidence , and a feeling on the part of our cooperators that each is getting the just reward of his labor .

		This involves not only the elimination of special privileges as such , but the elimination of secret business agreements .

		If we can insert into our new business and eco - nomic policy that secret business agreements of any kind are detrimental to the community , and are therefore to be eliminated , we shall have the base of a cooperative economic system .

		I trust you will be willing to accept this as less a criticism than a supplement to Mr.
Frederick	PERSON	's article -
H. L. GANTT	PERSON	.


New York City	LOCATION	.

		SIR : It is nothing less than amazing to see a great portion of our American press suggesting that the inevitable peace negotiations should be left wholly in the hands of our own and the Allied generals .

		There can of course be no doubt that the purely military armistice must be dictated by the command - ers in the field .

		But the plain implication of much of the recent cry in the American press `` Leave it to Foch '' has been that the terms of peace them - selves should be left to the military commanders .

		An incredible number of our editorial writers have been picturing the frock-coated diplomatists as people willing , even anxious , to deprive the armies of the full fruits of their victories .

		Not only present mili - tary guarantees but future policy might much more safely be left in military hands .

		This is indeed ironi - cal from the very writers who a few short months ago were bitterly assailing
Germany	LOCATION	for allowing
General Hoffman	ORGANIZATION	at Brest-Litovsk to overrule the civilian
Von Kuhlmann	PERSON	.

		For if one thing is certain , it is that the ultimate peace treaty must be signed by our duly constituted civil authorities .

		When the sword has won its way , the pen shall complete the work ; when the soldier has triumphed , the statesman shall with wisdom and -LRB- as we hope -RRB- with modera - tion speak not only for an army , but for a people , for a world of people .

		It is the aim of the German General Staff , or has been in the past , to beat every
1918	DATE	427 pen into a sword ; it shall now be our endeavor to carry to a relentless conclusion the idea that every sword is to be beaten into a pen .

		With victory in sight , if not already here , shall we turn aside from this democratic course to say to the Ludendorffs and the
Hindenburgs	PERSON	, `` After all , you were right '' ?

		For they never were .

		They can indeed smile in tri - umph if in the hour of our repudiation of them , we celebrate our victory by imitating their spirit and tem P er -

		SYNGE , CONRAD , AND
MR. STEELE	PERSON	SIR : I note your review of Land 's End by
Wilbur D. Steele	PERSON	, in which it is stated that I rather prefer Mr.
Steele	PERSON	as an artist to
Synge	PERSON	and
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a matter of record , I wish to point out that I have never said , hinted , or thought anything so uncritical .

		The assumption of the reviewer is gratuitous , and such a statement , if I had made it , would have appealed , I am sure , to Mr.
Steele	PERSON	's sense of humor as well as to that of the public .

		Nevertheless , I still maintain that Mr.
Steele	PERSON	is an admirable artist , to whom your reviewer might have devoted with justice the space which he occupied in considering my infinitely less important prefatory note .


EDWARD J. O'BRIEN	PERSON	.

		Bass River ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- REVIEWER 'S NOTE : The reviewer did not say that Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	preferred Mr.
Steele	PERSON	to
Synge	PERSON	and Conrad as an artist , but for his `` sensitive fidelity to the more abiding romance of ordinary life . ''

		The preface is partly devoted to a contrast between this quality of Mr.
Steele	PERSON	's art and the more remote backgrounds of Synge a `` nd Conrad .

		This contrast would be entirely pointless were Mr.
Steele	PERSON	not given an artistic significance of their own rank .

		The reviewer did Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	the compliment of think - ing that there was at least this logic in his admira - tion .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	wrote -LRB- italics mine -RRB- : Mr.
Steele	PERSON	is a romantic realist , who refuses to escape from life , but contents himself with making a truce with it ... In this respect he is to be contrasted with
Synge	PERSON	, though there is much resemblance in other ways between the two writers .

		To Synge the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	were a refuge from civilization , and his art was almost a protective coloration against life .

		and : Conrad sets man against an eternal background remote , from common experience ... Mr.
Steele	PERSON	's preoccupa - tion is with a more generally shared background , in which wonder is born of ordinary things , whose strange - ness has been forgotten through constant surface famil - iarity .

		How can the reviewer do justice to Mr.
Steele	PERSON	when the latter is preceded by the blaze and glory of Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's prefatory note ?

		It may be `` infinitely less important , '' but its impressiveness inevitably pales whatever its light falls upon . -RSB-

		Foreign Comment LITERATURE AFTER THE WAR What will be the effect of the war on literature ?

		The correspondent of
The New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	and
The Chicago Daily News	ORGANIZATION	sends a dispatch from
Stockholm	LOCATION	wherein he quotes from the Swedish magazine Literature .

		The editors asked various writers to express their opinions .

		H. G. Wells answered : I believe that the war will have its chief significance for literature through interest shifting frorrr the poetry of personal experience to the poetry that is contained in humanity 's common destiny .

		In the time to come we shall probably be less inclined to busy ourselves with indi - viduality and in a higher degree think of how individuals are affected by the mighty currents of thought and feeling that will flow through the races .

		Dr.
George Brandes	PERSON	was especially bitter : Most of the literature that has come to my notice during the war has been propaganda literature , which goes out to place the enemy in the most shameful light and itself in the most flattering aspects .

		The significance of these works , if they have any , is practical , not artistic or liter - ary .

		In my own view , the war has dragged back hu - manity a century or more .

		It has exterminated young vigor by the 100,000 , the young men from whom a renewal of spiritual life perhaps might otherwise have been ex - pected .

		It has dried up
Europe	LOCATION	's economic resources and plunged nations into bottomless debt .

		By its systematic slander , by a partly bought , partly fanatic press , it has stultified
Europe	LOCATION	.

		By its hate , produced by outrages and slander , it has poisoned the soul life of the masses .

		By its fearful hypocrisy in the name of self-righteousness it has lessened the general stock of love of truth that has been laboriously acquired by the human race .

		By daily mass murder and mad waste of money on unprofitable and unproductive enterprises it has impoverished , stupe - fied , poisoned .

		I , for my part , expect extremely little of the literature that will arise from a soil which is nourished by youths ' blood , politicians ' lies , and newspaper filth .


Carl Laurin	PERSON	's ' opinion follows : I have not succeeded in detecting any change in belles - lettres attributable to the war , but I suppose that art and literature will develop much as before .

		Some people think that the cubists will soften the angles of their worst quadrilaterals under pressure of the calamities of the times ; others that one will not sup so much with ladies as one did in the
spring of 1914	DATE	.

		I find it very hard to see any direct influence on literature even in the French Revolution .

		The same interest in the drama with a theme from ancient
Rome	LOCATION	that one had in
Louis	LOCATION	XVI times in the Little Trianon prevailed certainly throughout the Revolution and during
Napoleon	PERSON	's time , but , most typical for the bloodthirsty phase of the Revolution , was the interest in the sentimental and the jejune .

		Incidentally , a note by Mr.
Clement Shorter	PERSON	in his literary column in a recent
London	LOCATION	Sphere fur - nishes a kind of pungent comment , especially in view of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	' fear that the war has per - manently estranged peoples .

		He says : It may be worth while noting here that although the war has lasted over four years ,
Hamlet	LOCATION	is still being performed at the
Deutsches Theater	ORGANIZATION	in
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Charleys Tante	LOCATION	, under which we recognise our old friend ,
Charlie	PERSON	's Aunt , at the
Thalia	LOCATION	, and
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	at the Apollo .

November 16	DATE	Notes on New Books FIFTH AVENUE .

		By
Arthur Bartlett Maurice	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		To Fifth Avenue , unfurling northward decade by decade like a stair carpet in which the pattern repeats itself , Mr.
Maurice	PERSON	has delegated himself the role , of chronicler , and the result of his labors is a well-written , well-proportioned sketch , enliv - ened with reminiscence and varied with judicious quotation .

		He has gone back to the beginning of the
last century	DATE	, unraveled the early pattern of the famous thoroughfare , and then followed a historic sequence down to the
Avenue	LOCATION	's crimson-bannered present .

		He has filled in the framework with some of the coloring of the early days , touches of dress and discussion and deportment , and ballasted the narrative with plenty of names and dates .

		But with - out discounting the value of what Mr.
Maurice	PERSON	has done , one can not help wishing that his interpretation of Fifth Avenue as it exists today were more ade - quate and less formal .

		In other words , the author has written a handbook which falls far short of being a heart-book .

		The Fifth Avenue of
Philip Hone	PERSON	the `` Knickerbocker Pepys '' and of
Ward McAllis	PERSON	- ter the coiner of the `` Four Hundred '' have an undeniable appeal , but they do not compensate for Mr.
Maurice	PERSON	's failure to interpret the Fifth Ave - nue of today .

		And this present Avenue the one which
Granville Barker	PERSON	touched somewhat drably in Souls on Fifth really intrigues the pen with its myriad varying moods and incongruous fascinations .

		We wish Fifth Avenue as Mr.
Maurice	PERSON	has put it between covers contained more of the 1 exhilaration of sunlit distances from the roof of a bus , more of the restless stir of eddying humanity at the crossings , more of the poetry of a hansom wheeling over the glistening asphalt , more of the snug slam of limou - sine doors , of the tuneless twanging of street pianos , of the ceaseless stir of traffic .

		Even the joys of `` window shopping '' ought not to go by default .

		But all this perhaps fell without the scope of Mr.
Mau	PERSON	- rice 's intention .

		To chronicle is one thing ; to inter - pret is another .

		This volume is attractively printed , and contains a number of charming drawings by
Allan Gilbert Cram	PERSON	.

		JOSSELYN 'S WIFE .

		By
Kathleen Norris	PERSON	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	.

		If Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	had been willing to be less melo - dramatic , or more so , she would probably have writ - ten a better novel .

		She starts with an interesting Golden Bowl situation - an old father and his young wife , the charming son and his demure
Ellen	PERSON	.

		The inevitable gravitation occurs ; but instead of develop - ing the complexities of the situation , the author hurries it into a climax in a shocking murder , seem - ingly parricide .

		In the search for the murderer and the trial of the son , Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	has the materials for an excellent detective story .

		The identity of the murderer is so original that it is a pity to have it squandered as an incident in a story that is not primarily a murder mystery .

		The novel is so short as to leave the impression of a waste of admirable material .

		Had the author foregone the murder , she would have had a well-written story of
Long Island	LOCATION	country-house and Fifty-ninth Street studio life , with four interestingly contrasted characters .

		Had she concentrated on the murder , she would have had a mystery of the most baffling and exciting character , one which could have been strung out through a whole book .

		As it is , the story fails to satisfy .

		Virtue is fittingly rewarded in the faithful little wife who stands by her husband to the bitter end of his ordeal .

		But the author has suggested motives so much more thrilling that the reader ` feels slightly balked of what , he can argue to himself , was justly due him .

		THE MIRTHFUL LYRE .

		By
Arthur Guiter	PERSON	- man .

		Harper ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		`` Life is a tragedy to him who feels : a comedy to him who thinks . ''

		Age has not staled the flavor ^ of this epigrammatic truth .

		It is the more convinc - ing when one examines so-called `` humorous verse . ''

		For unless the author happens to be a thinker as well as a rhymer , the jingles he produces prove him the merest sentimentalist .

		It is the more regrettable , when one considers the amount of verse to which
Arthur Guiterman	PERSON	attaches his name , that he is not a more mirthful liar .

		The jacket of his latest volume praises the author 's `` taste and skill as a poet . ''

		An exquisitely adequate phrase .

		So .

		might one recommend the taste and skill of a dressmaker , or that of the carpenter whcf fits up the neat dog - kennel next to the garage the only difference being that one would not be offended by sentimentality in the carpenter or the dressmaker .

		Here and there however Mr.
Guiterman	PERSON	does strike a really funny note .

		His Aversions are to be sympathized with ; his sonnet sequence in the manner of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, on Afternoon Tea has an elusive if agreeable character , reminiscent of the fragrance of a distant cup , never quite attained to .

		His child poems are the happiest , from the little girl who wants Somebody made of meat , And who can laugh and cry and eat And make believe , and make a noise , to his rhyme In
Defense of Children	ORGANIZATION	, in which the author declares that he has known no child in all his life `` that ate its ice-cream with a knife ! ''

		There is nothing novel in Mr.
Guiterman	PERSON	's work ; but one forgives him this when he handles a trite subject with the picturesque vividness bestowed on Our Weddings : Long since , when Ursa Major was a cub , When mammoth-steak supplied our frugal larder , I wooed your maiden fancy with a club -LRB- Thank Heaven that I did not hit your harder ! -RRB-

		1918 THE DIAL 429 THE SMALL PLACE .

		By
Elsa Rehmann	PERSON	.

		Put - nam ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		If Miss
Rehmann	PERSON	shall have helped to arouse at least a desire toward making the garden a premedi - tated design rather than a haphazard accident , she will have served a worthy purpose .

		The day of the amateur flower garden is , or ought to be , remote .

		No longer are a box of red geraniums , a spade , - and a misdirected quest for `` a bit of nature '' enough to create , in one 's back or front yard , a picturesque contribution to the physical appearance of the com - munity .

		Just as the contractor and the owner must , in questions of design , willingly give way to the su - perior training of the architect , so the gardener housewife , no matter how much she may `` just love flowers , '' must leave their correct and successful dis - tribution to the landscape architect .

		He deals , of course , with more than the floral department .

		The general scheme the laying out of paths and en ' trances , the surrounding fences , the foliage , its mass - ing and growth ' all come under his jurisdiction .

		The fact that
Miss Rehmann	PERSON	has limited her problems to the small country house makes her exposition particu - larly helpful to the average suburban dweller .

		Her choice of examples all of them the work of experi - enced landscape architects gives the collection au - thority ; and her wisdom in illustrating practically every point she makes with excellent photographs enables the layman to visualize her suggestions with the least amount of effort .

		She offers a concise handbook , not too botanical , not too architectural , to all those who are able to perceive that it takes not only pride and love of the decorative but also the technical assistance of a trained expert to make of even a small domain a thing of beauty .

		SHELLEY 'S ELOPEMENT .

		By
Alexander Har	PERSON	- vey .

		Knopf ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		One takes up this book in the spirit in which one might `` listen in '' during a telephone conversation , hoping possibly to hear something intimate ; one lays it down as one might hang up the receiver , find - ing that the eavesdropping has been merely tire - some .

		This attempt to cast the elopement of the poet or rather the wrangles leading up to it into fictional guise becomes simply an unending succes - sion of pictures of Shelley munching bread and raisins , of the Godwins hurling dishcloths and impre - cations at one another 's heads , and of dull talk gen - erally .

		It is like nothing so much as a prolonged game of `` button , button , who 's got the button ? ''

		with
Shelley	PERSON	substituted for the button , and the query cast in the future tense .

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	labors under the impression that this `` most romantic epi - sode in literary history '' was carried on in the mood of defunct Bowery melodrama .

		His puppets `` fairly hiss , '' they `` shriek , '' and they dialogize through their teeth thus : `` Woman , how dare you ? ''

		and `` Mon - ster !

		Give me back my child . ''


William Godwin	PERSON	ca n't refer to his financial embarrassment without clearing his throat .

		Fanny
Godwin	PERSON	's complexion was `` like that of boiled rice . ''


Mary Godwin	PERSON	is made to say that `` Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	is too much of a poet not to make love to every woman he meets . ''

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	tracks Mary to the grave of her mother .

		The girl 's pedestrianism must have been exceptional , for we read that she `` walked daintily , '' that she `` lifted her dark skirt and trod mincingly , '' that she `` climbed delicately a fence , '' and that she `` vaulted - upon a marble slab . ''

		This last is a not inapt descrip - tion of what Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	has done .

		He has , it ap - pears , `` vaulted upon a marble slab . ''

		THE NEW DEATH .

		By
Winifred Kirkland	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		It is difficult to estimate precisely the intellectual casualties which are the inevitable accompaniments of war .

		But it is clear that the frustration consists in something more than the number of poets , paint - ers , and musicians killed .

		There is surely sufficient tragedy in the wiping out of a whole generation of young modernity in
France	LOCATION	, in the desolation of the English universities , and to a lesser degree of our own .

		But the casualties most ominous for our intel - lectual future are those suffered by the living rather than the dead .

		There is something perilous as well as pathetic in the spectacle of those setting them - selves up as our prophets who are so blinded by hate or tears that they can not even see .

		Nor is it less distressing to see so many sincere souls devoting themselves to luxuriant and futile sentimentalism who might , under a less acute emotional strain , have spent their energies and ardors in the promotion of genuine and germane ideals , The New Death is a singularly apposite illustra - tion of that spiritual confusion which , growing directly out of the war , arrogates to itself a novel authoritative insight .

		Advertised as `` a profoundly consoling book , '' it offers all the consolation that is possible from fervid fiction .

		To be candid and coherent requires a high degree of courage where part of the logic of the situation is bitterness and disillusion ; this book offers the cheaper remedy of an exalted romanticism .

		It has all the seductiveness of mysticism and all its characteristic weaknesses .

		It is hushed , intense , ecstatic .

		It breathes a solemn ardor .

		It is aglow with revelation : It is a new illumination , a new death , when dying can be the greatest inspiration of everyday energy , the strong - est impulse to daily joy ... For a little while death has come into its own , as the great enhancer , the great en - richer of life .

		`` Sunk in science , '' the author tells us , we had come to identify death with dissolution , and saw in war a hateful thing because it cut short with a terrible finality vision and growth and achievement .

		But the war has taught us otherwise at least it has taught our author otherwise .

		Our war aims , it appears , have never been justly appraised or ade - quately expressed .

		Death , we learn from this intense and tearful book , is the be-all and the end -
43 THE DIAL November 16	DATE	all , the supreme object for which we were fighting .

		It does not seem to occur to the author that war may be as unfortunate as it is necessary .

		Because it is required to make the world a better place to live in that millions of men should die , it would not seem to follow that dying itself thereby becomes a delectable and ultimate object .

		But it does for
Miss Kirkland	LOCATION	.

		In nearly - two hundred pages of solemn and portentous gossip she fairly revels in the beauties and blessedness of dying .

		She discovers exquisite flavors and possibilities , and -LRB- as quoted above -RRB- finds in death the essential joie de vivre .

		The old view of dying that made us seem to ourselves puny and ephemeral beings , tossed by chance into a brief consciousness , restricted all our free growth here and hereafter .

		It was essentially a maladjustment of living to dying that retarded all genuine progress ... The ' supreme problem of the war is death ... Science has had its turn ... Spiritual facts must be spiritually investigated .

		And crowning logic of all : No science can convince us that we have no soul when we feel it suffer so .

		One might dismiss the whole book as grave and garrulous rhetoric , if it - were not so striking an instance of our war pathology .

		Ever since
1914	DATE	we have been deluged with these sentimental laud - ings of horror and destruction .

		It does not make our war aims one whit less shining and sincere to recognize that their attainment involved untold calamity .

		We were fighting that life might be freer , fuller , and more companionable .

		It is unedifying to becloud and glorify the brute facts of death and disease and destruction , those very facts which we were fighting to make impossible for other gen - erations .

		Probably no one more than the soldier would resent this palliation of the evils of war .

		Unquestionably our attitude toward death , as well as life , has become more considered and consequen - tial .

		Miss
Kirkland	PERSON	's book is one among many testimonies to our preoccupation with the old vital questions that have been revitalized by war .

		It is a testimony likewise to the mental confusion and dis - order which the distress has brought upon us .

		Of its type of romanticist consolation
Miss Kirkland	LOCATION	's book is probably the best possible .

		It is - a pity that she does not devote so exquisite a style to genuine idealizations , passionate but intelligent contributions to the perfection of the world we are hoping for after the war .

		By
Annie Payson Call	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Among the books , written for popular consump - tion , which deal with nervous disorders these two are illustrative of the use and abuse of the author 's privi - lege .

		Dr.
Emerson	PERSON	's simple presentation of the plati - tudes of psychiatry , though it is addressed to all those who have ever been nervous , will be of interest only to the more limited group who have yet to learn the significance of such terms as the subconscious , introversion , and sublimation .

		Dr.
Emerson	PERSON	him - self is very chary of technical phraseology .

		If he takes anything for granted , it is too gross an ignor - ance .

		He aims to show the functionally nervous how they may effect a cure by conscious mental readjust - ment .

		The book is readable and well organized .

		Equally popular in intention , and far more loose in arrangement , is Miss Call 's Nerves and the War .

		Her religious bias is all but fatal to the scientific interest of her remarkably cheerful volume .

		She handles with equal simplicity such various and com - plicated matters as shell shock , chastity , and the will to use the bayonet .

		Her infallible remedy for the nervous troubles engendered by the nature of modern warfare is `` obedience to law , '' the economy of con - centration and that of relaxation , with special em - phasis upon the latter .

		Whereas Dr.
Emerson	PERSON	defines insanity as `` false social self-consciousness '' and concludes that love , the unifying power of religion or of philosophy , is essential to a sound soul ,
Miss Call	ORGANIZATION	defines the purposes of God in the war and calls upon the soldier obediently to fulfill them .

		Such superficial writing is the more to be con - demned in .

		a world wherein the consolations of re - ligion must yield to those of psychotherapy if we are to have a citizenry genuinely responsive to the social good and resistant to social and individual ills .

Lajpat Rai	PERSON	's book is an extremely useful work , albeit rather dangerous .

		Useful , because it attempts to analyze certain unsolved economic and social prob - lems which have confronted the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	in
India	LOCATION	and which demand careful study ; danger - ous , because superficial readers may conclude that because of mistakes in the past ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	has forfeited all claim to maintain her control of
India	LOCATION	in the future .

		The indictment is clearly drawn up .

		Lajpat Rai contends that the whole economic struc - ture of
India	LOCATION	has been remodeled for the advantage of British trade and manufactures regardless of the effect upon the natives .

		The cotton industry , which first saw the light in
India	LOCATION	, has been deliberately throttled for the benefit of Manchester manufactur - ers , and Indian fiscal policy has been so shaped as to build up the textile industries of
Lancashire	ORGANIZATION	and `` crush the beautiful fabrics of
India	LOCATION	. ''

		The shipbuilding industry has declined ; as far as mining operations are undertaken they redound to the advan - tage only of British capitalists ; agriculture , the greatest of all Indian industries , has been crushed under a weight of impossibly high taxation .

		As for famine , the curse of the land , it is ascribed to the extreme poverty of the inhabitants , which in turn results from the stupidity and greed of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	.

Hyndman	PERSON	and
Digby	PERSON	on the one side and
Strachey	LOCATION	on the other .

		The arguments of those who favor his own thesis naturally appear in the stronger light ; the statistics which he adduces are in general too slight to weigh very heavily .

		With such incomplete evidence before us , few will be willing to accept his charges at their face value .

		At the same time the testimony cited , so far as it goes , is sufficient to cause us to hesitate before sweep - ing the author 's contentions lightly aside .

		And we are the readier to give him a fair hearing inasmuch as he seems to be more interested in the welfare of Indian peoples than in the propagation of revolution ; he does not prejudice his argument by ranting nation - alist invective and he is ready to confess that British rule has its brighter side .

		But this bright side he passes over with a single page of grudging approbation .

		He forgets complete - ly that if
India	LOCATION	had not fallen under British control her fate would inevitably have been conquest by some other European power .

		Whether her lot under French rule would have been happier or more pros - perous is questionable ; in all likelihood she would have been drained completely dry in the vain effort to prolong the life of the ancien regime .

		Had she fallen to the ill-regulated despotism of the Russian Czars in the nineteenth century , or had she come under the perfectly efficient and mechanical autoc - racy of
Germany	LOCATION	in the twentieth ,
India	LOCATION	might con - ceivably sigh for the slipshod but comparatively liberal methods of the British .

		From such a fate
Great Britain	LOCATION	has saved her , and also from the fate of civil war , which would have attended any regime of non-interference by European powers .

		Lajpat Rai , in considering how
England	LOCATION	has repaid her debt to
India	LOCATION	, forgets that she has given to the Indian nationalities what lay in the capacity of no other nation to give , nor in that of the states of
India	LOCATION	herself peace , combined with an increasing liberty to conduct their own affairs .

		Wherein
England	LOCATION	has failed , her failure probably has been the converse of that which we should expect from
Germany	LOCATION	; she has not developed the resources of
India	LOCATION	to their full power .

		That the remedy is to be found in the type of home rule suggested by the author is doubtful ; certainly he adduces no satisfac - tory evidence to prove that prosperity would result from this particular kind of autonomy .

		It seems more likely to result from the broader imperial out - look which almost necessarily will characterize Brit - ish policy after the war .

		UNDER SAIL .

		By
Felix Riesenberg	PERSON	.

		Macmil - lan ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The anatomy of a sailing vessel is brimful of po - tential dramatic values .

		No one can hold the slight - est doubt of that at least not since the dawn of
Conrad	LOCATION	, in whose sea romances the component parts of a ship become component parts of the plot .

		Whether you fully grasp the terminology does not so much matter ; you can not fail to be moved by his handling of it .

		This is not preliminary to contrast - ing Conrad and
Felix Riesenberg	PERSON	, which would be a gratuitous absurdity a hitting below the water line .

		But there is one thing which the latter might and should have learned from
Conrad	LOCATION	, and that is the discreet utilization of the vernacular of sea - craft .

		If Under Sail is to be taken merely as a seaman 's book for seamen , well and good ; but if it aspires to beguile the general reader as a narrative of adventure , as a graphic depiction of life before the mast in the waning days of the sailing ship , then one can not help regretting that it is so overladen with the routine of seamanship that richer elements of the story suffer a rather disastrous partial eclipse : It is as if
Barney Oldfield	PERSON	were to essay a book about automobile racing , and then cram it with tire trouble and clutch and carburetor adjustments .

		The reader of Under Sail is not stirred by page after page of such accurate but baffling chronicle as : The cables were unshackled , and the ends stoppered abaft the wildcats .

		Canvas coats were put on them , just over the chain pipes to the locker .

		`` Jackasses '' were then bowsed into the hawse holes for fair , taking the `` tails '' to the windlass .

		With the ground tackle secured , the `` cat '' and `` fish '' were unrove , and this gear stowed away in the fore peak .

		When a man falls overboard , it should be possible to convey that every effort was made to rescue him without setting down that `` the main spencer was hauled out and reefed spanker set while we braced sharp forward . ''

		So much `` tops ` l , main t ` gan ` sl , jib , and stays ` ls '' is no better than so much Greek to the landsman .

		In fact Greek would be preferable to these elisions , for if you do n't know Greek , you know you do n't ; but here you have a lurking suspi - cion that you might be able to recognize the words if only their teeth had n't been knocked out .

		The au - thor takes you to sea and leaves you there , becalmed in the doldrums of a too technical terminology .

		Aside from this defect , Under Sail is the straight - away account of a voyage from
New York	LOCATION	round Cape Horn to
Honolulu	LOCATION	and return , depicting in un - forced narrative the incidents of departure , of storms at sea , of fisticuffs and clashes with superiors , and of the general rough routine and discomforts of a long period away from port .

		Mr.
Riesenberg	PERSON	was an ordinary seaman on this voyage , and he has set down a conscientious personal record of it , leaving out nothing not even the unsavory practices of the Chinese cook .

		Such ceremonials as the choosing of the watches , holyston - ing the deck , and initiating sailors who are crossing the equator for the first time are rendered in a matter-of-fact manner which gives them a certain authentic humor .

		SERBIAN FAIRY TALES .

		Translated by
Elodie L. Mijatovitch	PERSON	.

		McBride ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		To catch a whiff of the true flavor of these tales you must divest yourself of all adult conceptions .

		You must read them in the spirit of a child ; for if you insist on reading them as an adult , you will be irritated by the too flagrant violations of what goes by the name of common sense .

		The theme which runs throughout these tales is the strengthen - ing of the righteous weak against the evil strong , the overcoming of supernatural enemies by a magic key to greater power .

		The stories seem to have been conceived by a people who grew up with their back to a mighty , danger and with their face to a fire which promised safety and light .

		But these tales are not distinctly Serbian .

		There is nothing Slavic about them .

		And that , indeed , is as it should be , for fairies and magic are the properties of the chil - dren of the whole world .

		MAGGIE OF VIRGINSBURG .

		By
Helen R. Mar	PERSON	- tin .

		Century ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	.

		A partial suspension of what may be termed the heart 's reasoning faculty is one of the inalienable attributes of most fiction readers .

		With few excep - tions , they no more think of consulting their hearts in the presence of a novel than they would think of consulting their watches in the presence of a hostess .

		This explains why fiction writers are enabled to dwell upon distractions at the expense of obligations ; why they can carry their burden part way uphill , then drop it when it gets heavy , and bound lightly over the summit without it and yet few will suspect that the job has been shirked .

		It also explains why not alone the factory run of fiction but much of a higher quality can be so essentially machine-made as Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	's
Maggie of Virginsburg	ORGANIZATION	.

		The roots of Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	's story are in that soil which has yielded so bountifully to her pen .

		And so long as her narrative stays in the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch country , which has given her her best ma - terial , it shares the ready skill of her other fiction .

		But when she cuts loose from this environment she becomes involved in effects which are woefully defi - cient in reality .

		For one thing , Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	would have us believe that her waif-hero and her waif - heroine , intimate companions from childhood until college separates them , carefully conceal from each other knowledge of the existence of a spark of passion between them , and that the boy does not utter a syllable until a legacy of
$ 20,000	MONEY	a year unseals his lips .

		The letter heralding this unsealing reaches the girl two days after her marriage to a wealthy man , whom she does not love -LRB- of course -RRB- , and to whom she had been engaged only one week , and who is assassinated five years later , thus clearing the way for that union which you knew all along was des - tined to terminate the book .

		This intervening mar - riage , if it means anything at all , means something in relation to the girl 's love for her girlhood com - panion .

		But Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	practically ignores it , dodges it by means of one of those facile five-years - later elisions .

		This is the author 's most flagrant flouting of her obligation , not to her public for as we have said , it does n't mind but to her art .

		In the course of the narrative , there is some sketchy delving amid sociological and educational tendencies , but no one with the exception of those who recline in hammocks is in danger of being bowled over by this excursion .

		There is a lull in the publishers ' fighting fusil - lade .

		Instead of books volleying hot from the trench or winging from the sky , we are being inun - dated by an output of somewhat calmer mien , fore - shadowing the work of repair and rehabilitation .

		This non-combatant section of our contemporary war literature is far from reflecting inaction how - ever .

		Even the by-products of .

		fighting are strenu - ous , and one does not lead a quiet life even when one has been forcibly removed from the front to a German detention camp .

		Three recent volumes indicate the scope of non-combatant authorship .

		Mrs.
Lucas	PERSON	' book undoubtedly is of widest appeal , embodying as it does a rather personal series of let - ters which tell what is being accomplished toward bringjng happiness into tiny lives which war has brushed aside into misery and suffering .

		This story of the maimed , motherless waifs of
France	LOCATION	is one that a woman can tell best , and Mrs.
Lucas	PERSON	has given full rein to her sympathies .

		At the same time , she reveals what is being done in the way of intelligent relief work .

		THE ART OF
AUBREY BEARDSLEY	PERSON	.

		By
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		The Modern Library ,
Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	; 70 cts .

		THE ART OF
RODIN	LOCATION	.

		By
Louis Weinberg	PERSON	.

		The Modern Library ,
Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	; 70 cts .


Arthur Symons	PERSON	' essay on the art of
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	is worth reprinting , if only for the sake of that passage which concludes : His world is a world of phantoms , in which the desire of the perfecting of mortal sensations , a desire of in - finity , has overpassed mortal limits , and poised them , so faint , so quivering , so passionate for flight , in a hopeless and strenuous immobility ... They have put off the common burdens of humanity , and put on that loneliness which is the rest of the saints and the unrest of those who have sinned with the intellect .

		This fine appreciation of his friend is the more sig - nificant because it serves to show how far from
Beardsley	PERSON	's imperious art are the toadstool produc - tions of his ubiquitous imitators .

		Because Beards - ley 's drawings have the qualities which
Symons	PERSON	points out - because they have design and intensity , spirituality and craftsmanship and .

		satire they are worth a fond analysis .

		Because they have scale , the small reproductions which comprise the major por - tion of this book have a definite value .

		But however good the intention of such volumes as these , they are too apt to fall into the banal , to become cheap Chautauquas where the earnest un - informed grow heady on red ink .

		The volume on
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	is a case in point .

		Mr.
Weinberg	PERSON	's pro- logue has all the worst qualities of
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	's sculpture heavily pedagogical , sacrificing form to meaning so ruthlessly that the meaning withers by the di - vorce , solemnly sentimental .

		Moreover the repro - ductions are in many instances so poor blurred , foreshortened , and utterly devoid of what the Jap - anese call `` notan '' -LRB- roughly , arrangement of val - ues -RRB- as to detract from the book rather than add to it .

		It is doubtful whether anyone unfamiliar with
Rodin	PERSON	's work -LRB- and the volume is evidently in - tended for him -RRB- would be encouraged by this pre - sentation of it , although those who care for it might enjoy the better reproductions in spite of their in - herent lack .

		After all , black and white drawings lend themselves more freely to this kind of treatment than marble masses , `` the hole and the lump . ''

		But it is something of an achievement to have gotten out even the latter book at this time .

		One hopes that the publishers will care rather to increase the num - ber of scholarly appreciations , of cheap and suggest - ive reproductions , such as the
Beardsley	PERSON	book , than to pander to the taste of culture-hunting igno - ramuses , as in the
Rodin	LOCATION	volume .

		\ THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Why the
Wilson Peace Policy May Fail	ORGANIZATION	.

		HE PRESIDENT 'S various pronouncements have made clear enough the type of international reorgan - ization for which he stands as the outcome of the war : a liberal
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, broadly demo - cratic in type , based upon the self-determination and democratic representation of peoples , and equality of economic rights and opportunity as between great states and small .

		Such an international order ex - cludes , on the one side , a mere Alliance of a few great states enforcing a policy upon which they shall have decided in diplomatic secrecy ; and on the other a
Bolshevist International	ORGANIZATION	asserting the Dictatorship of the Proletariat .

		It is here suggested that the liberal policy will fail , caught between the two fires of reaction and
Bolshe	PERSON	- vism .

		Incidentally , it will collapse largely by rea - son of the failure of public opinion in
America	LOCATION	to realize the issues involved , and to support the Presi - dent a failure in part due to the ban placed by the repressive measures of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	itself upon any real discussion , during the war , of the wider issues involved .

		Mere acquiescence in the
phrase %	PERCENT	` League of Nations '' of course means nothing .

		An alliance of a few great states , the machinery of which is a conclave of ambassadors sitting in secret , with a vague court of arbitration in the background , can be called a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Holy Alliance was such a League , and so called .

		Indeed a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	for the
Maintenance of Perpetual Peace	ORGANIZATION	was one of the great topics of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	a hundred years ago .

		The discussions went on pretty much in the same terms that they go on today .

		And the League which was finally formed had the support of a powerful monarch who was a sincere and deeply religious , lover of peace , but who hap - pened honestly to believe -LRB- in a sense very rightly -RRB- that political democracy was incompatible with the maintenance of international peace .

		The obstacles to the realization of his dreams were quite as much revolting American colonies , popular revolutions , and the assertions of nationality and human right , as the ambitions of dynasts .

		Any democratic and liberal
League of Peace	ORGANIZATION	, to achieve the ends outlined by Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, must involve at least a form of association which includes small states as well as great , considerable limita - tions to national independence and sovereignty as we now know them , equality of economic opportunity in the backward and undeveloped territories of the world , and , by way of machinery , an international parliament representing peoples all great parties as much as governments , managing the affairs of the nations in the open and making changes , as and when the need arises , in the international conditions which , unchanged , lead to war .

		Just as perpetual legisla - tive change is the price of orderly progress within the nation , so must it be in the international field .

		What are the conditions sine qua non for the success of such a plan ?

		They pretty obviously include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- A general faith in it .

		If the four great powers
America	LOCATION	,
Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	now arranging the peace do not believe that such a League can sufficiently insure their military security and economic future , they will resort to one or both of two courses : they will come to `` private arrange - ments '' among themselves ; or they will demand `` ma - terial '' guarantees in the shape of strong naval and military forces , strategic frontiers , territory with , raw materials , preferential tariff arrangements de - signed to make their nations or empires self-sufficing .

		Either course would be fatal to the liberal form of League .

		For special or secret arrangements even to be suspected will prompt counter arrangements of like character .

		And territorial and military com - petition means -LRB- a -RRB- rivalry among the ` Allies them - selves ; -LRB- b -RRB- violations of the principle of nationality or the rights of lesser states ; -LRB- c -RRB- illiberal forms of government due to the needs of constant military preparedness .

		Thus , aggrieved or victimized nations would be opposed to the new settlement and the
League	ORGANIZATION	which attempted to make it permanent .

		The military type of state and its discipline would accen - tuate the popular ferment everywhere .

		Any League which contained forces so disruptive would be bound sooner or later to break up .

		We see here how the element of `` faith '' works .

		Lack of faith in it wpuld justify itself , for the disruptive forces would be directly born of that lack .

		In the same way , real belief in it would equally justify itself , for states - 460 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	men would not then make those claims for `` ma - terial '' guarantees which cause the disruptive rivalry .

		It is an illustration of the working of political prag - matism .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- An honest offer of the Allies to protect the due rights of a democratized
Germany	LOCATION	, and to ac - cord her equality of economic treatment in the mat - ter of access to raw materials , the & ea , and so on .

		If Germans find that the new League will not so pro- tect their rights , they will take their own measures of protection .

		And those measures , in the case of a solid block of a hundred million folk , now after the disintegration of both
Russia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	the strongest single state in continental
Europe	LOCATION	, will constitute the menace of the future
Europe	LOCATION	.

		A Socialist
Russia	LOCATION	may in the future turn with more sympathy to a Socialist
Germany	LOCATION	than to a bourgeois
America	LOCATION	, and a close Russo-German understanding , due to a common need for protection , be one of the developments of tomorrow .

		The much feared inclu - sion of
Germany	LOCATION	in the
League	ORGANIZATION	has nothing really to do with `` trusting '' her , but consists in making her an offer of protection after she shall have ful - filled the conditions of the peace .

		That offer should be made not because we can trust
Germany	LOCATION	but be - cause without it we certainly can not .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- In the new partition of
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, and
Africa	LOCATION	, surrender by the protecting powers of all special privilege and preferential treatment for them - selves in favor of the principle of equality of treat - ment for the whole world .

		Otherwise there can be nothing resembling equality of opportunity for weak and powerful .

		The economic stimulus to , perhaps real need of , conquest will remain .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- No partition of
Russia	LOCATION	under the guise of continued military occupation for the purpose of resisting German `` peaceful penetration '' or as the result of our decision that since she `` is not ready for Socialism '' we shall forbid her to try the experiment .

		A new
Drago Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, denying the right of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean governments to enforce the payment of bonds by military occupation , must be applied to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	opposing Socialism , or other forms of economic democracy , in the greater part of the Slav world , would be a twentieth century dupli - cation of the nineteenth century Holy Alliance , which set itself against the rising current of its time by forbidding experiments in political democracy -LRB- notably in
South America	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The twentieth cen - tury alliance of our
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	would be as blind as was that of the nineteenth century to new forces stirring in the world .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Decisive support in American public opinion for the policy of the President .

		If the influence of great political parties in
Europe	LOCATION	, firmly rooted tradi - tions , strong prejudices , just and righteous anger which more frequently than anything else perhaps makes men unjust are to defer to the President 's program , those forces must not be able to use the President 's political opponents for the purpose of paralyzing his action in foreign affairs .

		I suggest that none of these conditions of success is present in sufficient degree , and that the forces opposed to the American policy are now beyond
America	LOCATION	's control .

		Take the first point : the existence of a general belief in the feasibility of the system of international relationship proposed by Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	.

		All admit that it will be extremely difficult to achieve .

		If it is ever to be realized by the conscious efforts of men , in the face of the powerful feelings and forces working for the maintenance of the old order , it can only be by the aid of those who have the faith that moves mountains for mountains will have to be moved .

		That means that the idealism and passion of the reformer , the revolutionary , must play its part .

		He alone has enough faith in the new to discard the old .

		The radicals and reformers of
Europe	LOCATION	have during the ~ war been the keenest supporters of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's policy .

		But he will be deprived of that support at trfe peace settlement for two reasons : First , the special circumstances of war -LRB- including the need for administrative ability -RRB- have given gov - ernmental power into the hands of conservatives the type of the successful business man who have used their positions to consolidate their present posi - tion of influence ; and they have taken that power from radicals .

		And second , the fear felt by European radicals that at a pinch Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	would yield to the reactionaries a fear induced by his acts , as dis - tinct from his words , in such things as open diplo - macy , Russian intervention , passports for Labor delegates , and one or two other matters .

		This has led very many to look to Bolshevism , rajther than to liberalism , as the one road to real reorganization .

		Note what has happened in
England	LOCATION	as an illus - tration of what has happened in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	as well , in differing degrees .

		^ The people before the war had elected a government which was Liberal and Radical .

		This government , without process of election , is during the war replaced by one drawn mainly , from the right wing of the
Conservative Party	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is true that there may be an election again before the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , with the press for four years under close governmental con - trol , all Radical organizations under suspicion , some of them broken up , it will not be humanly possible in a bare month for Radicalism , just forming into new groups and parties , to stem the momentum of the more solidly organized and drilled conservative
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 461 forces .

		America will not deal at the peace table with the
New Europe	LOCATION	, which does believe in the President 's policy , but with the
Old Europe	LOCATION	, repre - sented in the person of elderly , extremely conserva - tive men , honestly skeptical about the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	men who have risen to power and pros - perity under the old order , and who instinctively and on general principles resent any fundamental change in it .

		Many of them are men who have succeeded in politics by shrewd appeal to the nationalist pas - sions and traditions , which blaze most fiercely in war time .

		It is not from these that will come any real offer of protection to a democratized
Germany	LOCATION	which is the second prerequisite condition enumer - ated above .

		We shall be dealing with the very human and excusable passions of retaliation of coun - tries that have suffered incredibly at the hands of the enemy a passion which , already naturally fierce , in the circumstance has been deliberately exploited for political purposes .

		The peace terms , depriving
Germany	LOCATION	of the raw materials of
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Silesia	LOCATION	so necessary to her industrial life , will be such as to bear so hardly upon the next generation that re - sistance is sure to develop and to make
Germany	LOCATION	the center of alliance with Slavic states whose differ - ences preclude solid union among themselves .

		-LRB- They have already violent differences and the
Union of the Free Nations of Central Europe	ORGANIZATION	has already broken down . -RRB-

		Such territorial readjustments as the retrocession of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	might not militate against future peace if the Free Trade elements in the European governments had been strengthened by the war .

		But the nationalist passions of war Have strengthened the protectionist and imperialist parties , and will make impossible the third condition enumerated above : equality of opportunity for the whole world in the backward territories , including those to be acquired by the Allies in
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, and
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	, the arch-Radical , has already capitulated to the imperialists and has already pro- nounced for a preferential empire .

		If carried out , this will put the lesser states and all the outside world at an economic disadvantage in something like a fourth of the world 's area .

		It is in flagrant contradiction to the President 's own interpretation of his own condition about equality of economic opportunity .

		Add to this the disagreement with ref - erence to Freedom of the Seas , and the readily ex - cited prejudices which the very words will arouse in Conservative circles in
England	LOCATION	, and one '' may judge what chances of acceptance there are for the President 's conditions .

		The question will not of course be presented in clear-cut terms of opposing doctrine .


France	LOCATION	will take the ground that it4s an affront to limit her new sovereignty over
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	by embarrassing conditions concerning German access to ore fields .

		And she will take a similar position with reference to
Morocco	LOCATION	and any territory in
Asia	LOCATION	Minor that may fall to her share .

		England on similar grounds will want a free hand in the German colonies , in
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	, in
Egypt	LOCATION	; so that if Lord North - cliffe , Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	, and Mr.
William Hughes	PERSON	carry the day in the future fiscal policy of the British Empire , British trade shall secure satisfactory and thumping preferences therein , with no embarrassing peace conditions to prevent it .


Italy	LOCATION	has a whole host of knotty points which the party of `` sacred egoism '' - will certainly demand shall be settled in its way .

		One of the greatest problems of all greatest in its effect upon the future history of human society will be the general attitude to the Russian Revolu - tion .

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	determined to thwart the doctrines of the French Revolution .

		The new
Congress of Versailles	ORGANIZATION	will certainly attempt to thwart the doctrines of the Russian .

		It is undeni - able that the Revolution has robbed millions of hon - est Frenchmen of their savings , and that the eco - nomic penetration of
Russia	LOCATION	by Germans may place that country dangerously under German influence .

		Certain Russian groups monarchist , Cadet which recently were looking for German aid are now be - lieved to favor our intervention .

		It will therefore be far better for the future of safe and sane democ - racy and of Russian bonds that the early steps of Russians in self-government and self-determina - tion should be guided by their elder brothers , the practical means to that end being the partition of the country between the great Allied powers for temporary but necessarily prolonged military occupation .


Japan	LOCATION	, who has been to the forefront in the policy of intervention , will of course loyally share the self-sacrifice by shouldering her part of the White Man 's Burden in its latest form , and fitting the Slav race for democracy upon Western models .

		As to the last point : the use of political opposition to the President by the extremer parties in
Europe	LOCATION	to defeat his policy .

		Take an instance .

		If
France	LOCATION	forbids German access to
Lorraine	PERSON	ore , there can be no workable
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	; and there will be war in the future .

		Suppose the President attempts to secure
France	LOCATION	's adhesion to his policy of equality of access to raw materials by making the granting of financial aid to
France	LOCATION	subject to her subscription to that policy .

		Does anyone suppose that American opinion would understand his move and support him sufficiently to resist the kind of appeal which we can imagine
Colonel Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	making ?

		The Amer - 462
November 30	DATE	iV ; m public would know hut one tiling , : ; is between licioir l' ` i : iniT and evil
Germany	LOCATION	, the I ` icsident was `` siding with
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		We arc dealing , bete pet - haps with a special quality of the \ mnu.m popular mind .

		Considerations which demand discipline of righteous indignation seem harder for Americans than for other folk .

		If lynching is possible in this country , it is because of this simplification ol psy - chology ; to object to lynching is almost a defense ot rape .

		Lynching exists not because the American is cruel but because his indignation at crime runs a \ \ av with him .

		The argument from atrocity has been so developed that we shall find a generation hence , when all really responsible for the atrocities are dead , a hundred million folk asked , in the name of eternal principles of righteousness , to pay in harsh conditions of life for offenses which they did not commit .

		We touch heie perhaps the deepest moral forces working against the I ` tesident 's policy .

		Kvcr since the country entered the war there has been steadily developing a temper and attitude wholly inimical to its declared internationalist purposes .

		The oppo - sition has just recently become more clearly defined by the action of the
Republican Party	ORGANIZATION	, and its exist - ence and danger admitted by the fact of Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son 's own appeal for a I
Vmocratic Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hut the opposition to Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's internationalism goes far beyond party lines .

		It is the result of nation-wide moral forces acting in just the way that similar forces acted in
England	LOCATION	to paralyze the Lib - etals in that country , to destroy governments made
HP	ORGANIZATION	of men of the type of
Grey	PERSON	, and to give the coun - try over to the influence of men of the type of Lord Northcliffc and Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	.

		From the first day of the war there opened a violent campaign against Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's policy none tin less violent or effective because those who came under its influence were not aware that they were repudiating Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's principles , or because their repudiation was the result , not of any consciously analyzed argument , but of a general state of mind and temper .

		And , absurd and paradoxical as the statement may sound , the repressive measures of the Administiation Espionage and Sedition Acts di - rect l \ aided this campaign , to such an extent indeed that tlic \ made it a penal offense to defend the policy which the President was enunciating .

		Take one example among many possible ones .

		The President again and again has insisted upon distinguishing between the German people and the German -LRB- lovernment not from any feeble senti - mentality , but because if the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is ever to be a fact it must , during the Peace Confer - ence itself , offer entrance into it to a democratized
Germany	LOCATION	.

		That oiler will never be made unless public opinion is able to see in some measure why , though these atrocities may be true , the
Geiman	PERSON	people may still he human beings capable of cooperat - ing with a democratic world .

		The failure to recog - nize that truth may yet wreck the whole attempt at a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hut it is literally true to say - that while the press and pulpit day in and day out resounded with dreadful elaborations of atrocities , carrying the inevitable conclusion that the German people are as had as the German -LRB- lovernment , how many American papers would during the last year have da icd to print an argument upholding the dis - tinction upon which the President has insisted ?

		They could not do so without defending in some measuie the < lei man people , and the Fspionage Act reads that `` whoever l > v word or act shall sup - port or favor '' the em m \ .

		li.ill be liable to imprison - ment for twenty years .

		Sentence against Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son 's thesis has already gone by default .

		No one dated defend it .

		There was just one chance of assuring in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can opinion a balance of moral foices which would make it possible to obtain wide support for a policy which looked to removing the deeper causes ol those German evils which menace the world .

		And that was to insure the very freest exptession possible -LRB- never very free in war time however legislative penalty is removed -RRB- of the liberal and I ` lnistian attitude toward these things , so that within the mass there should exist in the religious organi/ations , and among radicals and internationalists om idet - ablc centers of influence standing for `` the second thought '' as opposed to the first .

		Hut the preserv : turn of that modicum of ballast has been exceedingl hard and dangerous , all but impossible , as ever liberal journalist knows .

		We get this monstroi paradox : a government exetcising a power of contt over news , information , the mind of the nation , ui paiallelcd in history , and the net result of the e \ c cise of that power is to create a state of feeling whic rendeis impossible the very policy for which tl government stands .

		It is true of course that the blunders of an admii I 1 1 ation arc only contributory .

		The ultimate cai lie deeper and are concerned with the fact that HI erals , democrats , internationalists too often ha \ not individually the courage of their opinions , anc d.ne not in war time testify to the faith that is in them .

		Things which are said commonly enough in private no one dare pronounce in public .

		But the net result of these reticences and repressions is the situation which confronts the President today .

		To summarize : The American policy of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will demand for its success profound
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 463 faith in its practicality and need .

		Its execution will in the early stages likely to determine its later life he in the hands mainly of the most conservative elements in
Europe	LOCATION	, who quite frankly have hut the faintest faith in it .

		Its success also demands an offer of protection to a democratized QetttUMf .

		It will be intrusted to conservative and often avowedly anti-democratic statesmen , who have replaced demo - cratic statesmen by appealing to the very natural hate of the whole f/erman race .

		It * success de - mands equality of economic opportunity in the unde - veloped areas and a greater measure of international economic freedom than the world has yet known .

		mnenrs before which the policy will come for judgment are drawn largely from parties pledged nornic preferences , which are in flat contradic - tion to this principle , and who are advocates of self - sufficinr . '

		protectionist empires that would be fatal to any developed economic internationalism .

		If the
League	ORGANIZATION	is not to be a f foly Alliance opposing experi - ment in industrial , as the former Holy Alliance op - experiments in polificil , democracy ,
Russia	LOCATION	must be j' iyen a free hand to be a * Socialistic as she pleases , even to the e/t .

		- n t , , i repudiating her public de | , r .

		All the governments with whi < h
America	LOCATION	will deal are in favor of intervention for the sup - pression of extreme Socialism , and one at least is at present determined that the payment of Russian coupons shall be secured at whatever cost of i i Russian affairs .

		And all these parties now know that they can look for support in their - n to Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's p ' - !

		i ' y to Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's own political rivals in
America	LOCATION	.

		Only a political miracle can give success to Am < - r ican policy in those conditions .

		Perhaps it may hap - pen political miracles have happened under Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	.

		It is not the object of the present writer to sug - gest what should be the American relation to the litions .

		He merely calls attention to th ' - m .

		A EUROPEAN LIBKRAL .

		The
Fourteen Points	ORGANIZATION	and the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	O ' .

		Mi HAS ONLY to study the fourteen condition * of peace set forth by President
Wilson	PERSON	in his speech of
January 8	DATE	to be convinced of two things : in the first place , they primarily concern the condition * of a permanent peace rather than merely the conditions of peace with
Germany	LOCATION	at the present time ; and secondly , they can not be effectually realized in detail without the continuing support of an international .

		nation which shall be administrative in char - acter , and not merely judicial .

		The first considera - oncerns us here only a * it i * bound up with the second .

		The future historian will point out the extraordinary detachment of President
Wilson	PERSON	from exclusive preoccupation with immediate war issues .

		He will note that , while ^ the articles from VII to XIII are concerned with territorial issues which grow immediately out of the alignments of the war , even these are framed within a statement of world issues which might -LRB- substituting the name of some other country for that of
Russia	LOCATION	in article VI -RRB- have been laid down at any time of peace in a discussion of fundamental guarantee * of world peace .

		He will then observe that the * e specific war aim * appear as illustrations of the general principle * by mean * of matter * which have been made urgent in the course of the war .

		Looking in detail at the content * of the fourteen article * in their bearing on the question of die dom - it character of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, they will mant cri be found to run the gamut from those which lutely require an international agency with legisla - tive and administrative powers to those which can be finally settled by the peace treaty itself .

		Inter - mediate are those which can formally be determined by the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, but which require a per - manent international body to insure that the formal settlement becomes an enduring actuality .

		A of the fourteen condition * from this point of view will , I think , justify the following conclusion : there are but two matters which the peace treaty itself can finally adjust .

		These are the righting of the wrong done
France	LOCATION	in respect to
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	, and the readjustment of the frontiers of
Italy	LOCATION	, Next come the problems of restoration aft ' all the territories invaded by the Central Power * , These would not of course demand a permanent international commission .

		But the work to be un - dertaken will certainly cover a period of years , and it will involve many points that can not be com - pletely covered in advance by any written agree ' ment .

		If the work of restoration is to be done intelligently and in a way which will not leave behind it disputes and sore points , it will re/juire mixed commission * involving the cooperati ' statesmen , economists , physicians , engineers and technicians of all sorts .

		Since not all question * which irill arise can be treated a * mere matter * of practical detail , de deliberation * of these com - 464 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	missions will have to be supervised by some kind of international council .

		Trenching more directly upon the issue of a permanent international government is the matter of international covenants and guarantees .

		These are specifically mentioned in the case of the
Balkan States	LOCATION	, the Dardanelles , and the new independent
Polish State	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are certainly directly implied in the reduction of armaments , and in cooperation to secure for
Russia	LOCATION	an `` unhampered and unembar - rassed opportunity , '' to say nothing of `` assistance of every kind that she may need and may herself desire . ''

		For convenience and brevity of discussion , these concerns may be summed up in the problems of nationality and of restoration of order compatible with freedom in eastern and southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Nothing has brought international relations to greater disrepute from the standpoint of law than the tendency to write certain guarantees into treaties of peace and then fail to furnish any methods for making these `` guarantees '' effectual .

		In part this is due to the Pickwickian piety which , when `` seri - ous '' matters are out of the way , may overcome in a moment of sentimental relief even a congress of professional diplomats .

		But in greater measure it is due to the fact that as affairs now stand that is , without a permanent international executive body the attempt to enforce such guarantees might in - directly threaten the peace of the world .

		An earnest effort from any quarter would be regarded as having back of it some interested nationalistic motive , and would array against it all of the nations on the other side of the
Balance of Powers	ORGANIZATION	, even if their own national interests were in no way involved .

		It is much safer to treat the guarantee written into the treaty of peace as a scrap of paper than to run the risk of dropping a spark into a heap of inflammable international material .

		Take the case of Roumania and the problem of a guarantee of civil rights to the Jews .

		On the face of it , it is a simple matter .

		But then we dis - cover that it is a question of internal political constitution .

		The great landowners control the politics of
Roumania	LOCATION	through controlling the fran - chise .

		The cities and industrial centers are discrim - inated against .

		The Jews are mainly in the latter places .

		To give them the necessary rights would involve giving political rights to others who are now disenfranchised so as to secure the supremacy of the landed aristocracy .

		It is hard to see how an adequate guarantee for the Jews is to be secured short of a shift of the center of internal gravity in the whole country .

		When one considers the medley of nationalities in
eastern Europe	LOCATION	and the inheritance of exacerbations along with religious differences and economic rivalries , it is harder yet to avoid the con - clusion that it will remain the tinder-box of
Europe	LOCATION	unless a comprehensive and impartial international government undertakes for a considerable time the supervision of the development of institutions which shall insure an adequate adjustment of rights in this enormously delicate situation .

		The strong prejudice against external intervention in domestic affairs is justified as long as the theory of isolated and independent sovereign states prevails in practice .

		But the
United States	LOCATION	, at least , has been largely in the war precisely because it is realized that the dividing line between domestic institutions and foreign policies has become wholly artificial .

		It was precisely the autocratic domestic institutions of Ger - many which drew us into what , in its origin , was a purely European war .

		So far as concerns the
United States	LOCATION	, the war was either an evil job which had to be undertaken from stern necessity , or it was a war for such intervention in the `` internal '' affairs of
Germany	LOCATION	as will guarantee us against the recur - rence of any such catastrophe .

		The logic of this situation demands such friendly oversight of the affairs of other states from which world-wide con - flagrations might
spring	DATE	as will forestall wars in the future .

		And since the
United States	LOCATION	has no intention of becoming a crusading
Don Quixote	PERSON	of nations , this demand means precisely a permanent international government whose powers shall be even more executive and administrative than - judicial .

		It remains to speak of those two articles among the fourteen which imply , in the most open fashion , a League for economic purposes that is concerned with permanent regulation of those economic affairs which cause wars .

		These are the third and fifth articles , dealing ^ respectively with the removal of trade barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions , and with the impartial adjust - ment of all colonial problems .

		It is possible for opponents of the President to interpret the third article as an academic proclamation of the abstract principle of free trade , and to interpret the fifth as applying merely to the German colonies which have been seized during the war .

		But no such limitations will accord with the principles of the declaration of
February 11	DATE	regarding the adjust - ments most likely to bring a peace that will be per - manent and that shall not `` perpetuate old elements of discord and antagonism that would in time be likely to break the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	and consequently of the world . ''

		In the concluding portion of this discussion these points will be taken up .

		JOHN DEWEY .

		THE DIAL British Labor and Reconstruction B > Y AN OBSERVER not vitally concerned in the future of his country and of the world , considerable amuse - ment might be extracted from what is misleadingly called in
Great Britain	LOCATION	`` Reconstruction . ''

		I say
Great Britain	LOCATION	rather than the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	be - cause I believe that in
Ireland	LOCATION	the word is unknown .

		In
Great Britain	LOCATION	, at any rate , all kinds of well and ill meaning persons have for years been making all kinds of lavish promises about the new heaven and the new earth that are to be created after the
war %	PERCENT	They have promised us a
Change of Heart	ORGANIZATION	on the part of workmen and employer alike , a New Spirit in industry and in industrial relations , a Brotherhood of the Trenches which will readily transform itself into a Brotherhood of the Work - shops .

		Of course it may be that all these great good things are really upon us , only waiting for their appearance until the clouds of war are dissipated .

		But it must be said that there is so far singularly little evidence of their approach .

		To all appear - ance nearly all sections of the community are either tacitly assuming or openly preparing for the restora - tion of the pre-war industrial and economic system without substantial change .

		There will be differ - ences of course : the strength of economic and indus - trial organization among both workers and em - ployers will have very greatly increased ; there will be a strenuous effort on the part of employers , at least , to maintain after the war the new methods of production and the war-time freedom from
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	regulations , and , on the part of Trade Unions , to maintain war-time rates of wages ; and whatever happens , the position of women both in industry and in society will have been materially changed for the better .

		These however are inessen - tials , if the economic system is regarded as a whole , important as they are in themselves .

		So far as the fundamental principles on which our economic sys - tem is based are concerned , it is safe to say that nowhere outside the ranks of Labor is there evidence of any widespread desire for a change .

		`` Outside the ranks of Labor , '' did I say ?

		Even in the ranks of Labor there are still very many who have neither the imagination nor the courage to envisage the coming of new conditions widely differ - ent from those of yesterday .

		One evidence of this fact must suffice .

		A then Liberal newspaper , The Daily Chronicle , sent a special correspondent to the
Trades Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Derby	ORGANIZATION	in
September	DATE	.

		The following is the impression which he carried away from the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	: Whether the
Trade Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	or the
Primrose League	ORGANIZATION	is the more conservative body may well be the topic of debate in high Tory quarters , but a mere Liberal would not find much to choose between them .

		The Con - gress is terribly afraid of doing anything that might cause scandal , or that some antiquary might find to be not in accordance with a worm-eaten precedent .

		If there is to be any progress in consequence of this war , it will not come from the
Trade Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which is timid and time-serving , and much more audacious men than your half-baked
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	delegates will be needed to give the world a shove forward ... It makes one marvel exceedingly that the reactionary newspapers should represent this uninspired and dead-alive
Trade Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	as an engine of revolution .

		The dele - gates may , perhaps , regard themselves as very terrible fellows as pioneers , but a Liberal like myself would be quite willing to see them all hanged , drawn , and quartered if their enterprise is adequately represented in their feeble resolutions and debates .

		What it all comes to is that we are to go on as we are going , and all that is ascertained is what most of us had taken for granted that working men , like the rest of us , prefer to leave the responsibility for doing any - thing definite to somebody else .

		What amount of truth there is in this indictment we shall be better able to see at a later stage in this article .

		Here it is enough to note that there is undoubtedly in the British Labor movement a large conservative element , among both officials and rank and file , and that this element is plentifully repre - sented in such a body as the
Trades Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		To a considerable extent this conservatism arises not from an active desire to preserve the existing order but from defects of thought and imagination .

		Indeed the fundamental reason for the absence in
England	LOCATION	of any real and comprehensive policy of Reconstruction lies mainly in defects of thought and imagination .

		Upon certain specific and sec - tional after-war problems the `` capture of German trade , '' the improvement of capitalist organization , the maintenance of increased production a section of the community has concentrated a good deal of thought ; but the fundamental questions , the general principles on which Reconstruction policy as a whole should be based , have either been forgotten or have been left largely to men whose good will is innocent of any power of practical application .

		This applies not only to the Labor movement ; it applies to every class and section of the community .

		In fact we are setting about to '' muddle through '' Reconstruction as we `` muddled through '' the earlier stages of the war , and the likelihood is that , after as during the war , we shall learn our lessons only out of bitter experience and chaos .

		For the lack of clearly formulated general principles is resulting in a paralysis of our efforts , even in relation to the most immediate problems .

		We are finding that , 466 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	until we have decided upon what principles we mean to proceed , we can not proceed at all .

		The fact that we are governed and governed inevitably by a Government whose main preoccu - pation is the war necessarily aggravates these defects in our national preparedness .

		The War Cabinet has no time to formulate general principles of after - war policy , and having been constituted for quite a different end , would be most unlikely to agree on such principles if it had the time .

		Nor has the formation of a sort of emergency Cabinet for Home Affairs greatly improved the position ; for this Cab - inet is subject to the veto of the real Cabinet , and in the absence of agreed principles it is usually felt that the safest course is to do nothing drastic .

		The result is a half-paralysis of the
State	ORGANIZATION	machinery for Reconstruction , and this paralysis readily and in - evitably communicates itself to outside bodies .

		Even so , we might be saved if any influential section among us had clear principles and an em - bracing policy .

		Much could be done without the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, or to force the
Government	ORGANIZATION	's hand , in such a case .

		But the plain fact is that no section is in this position and that most certainly the Labor movement is not .

		Here a question will no doubt arise .

		Has not
the Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	proclaimed a most comprehensive policy in its Memorandum on Labor and the New Social Order ?

		On this , two things require to be said first that Labor and the New Social Order is not comprehensive in the right sense , because it leaves out of account the most vital aspirations in the world of Labor , and secondly that it is not , in any real sense , the policy of the
Labor	ORGANIZATION	movement .

		The most vital forces that are stirring in British Labor today are not so much political as economic .

		The most important problems for
British Labor	ORGANIZATION	after the / war are also economic in character , and center round the control of the new industrial forces which have been mobilized during the war .

		Not merely the pledges to restore
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	rights , which have been made again and again by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, but the very facts of industry call for a new orientation and a new organization of the Labor movement .

		To the human implications of these facts the Memorandum on Labor and the New Social Order ` is largely blind .

		It is not a statement of a new program io fit the new conditions , material and spiritual ; it is a clear and well-expressed re - phrasing of an old policy the policy of the
Fabian Society	ORGANIZATION	and of Mr.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	.

		Eminently prac - tical in its proposals , it is nevertheless vitiated by the fact that it turns for help always to the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and ignores or underestimates the vital forces of economic organization which exist and act , in the main , independently of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the second place , Labor and the New Social Order is not , in any real sense , the policy of British Labor .

		It is a program which has received , indeed , the official endorsement of the
Labor Party Con	ORGANIZATION	- ference ; but it is essentially something accepted by
Labor	ORGANIZATION	and not something devised and believed in by
Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is in effect a series of resolutions drafted and proposed by Mr.
Webb	PERSON	, and accepted in default of an alternative program .

		But such an , acceptance does not go deep ; and it is safe to say that , even to the majority of Labor candidates , Mr.
Webb	PERSON	's Memorandum means and counts for very little .

		This is not to say that there is any alternative policy which can claim to be the policy of British Labor .

		There is not ; and the fact that there is not accounts for Mr.
Webb	PERSON	's easy triumph .

		My whole point is that Labor , as an organized body whose strength has greatly increased during the war , is largely prevented from using the strength by the fact that it can not translate its aspirations into a practical policy .

		New ideas are everywhere at work ; but no idea has yet won sufficient mastery to enable it to be expressed in terms of a united policy for
the Labor Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		If I am right in saying that neither British Labor nor the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	has a policy , what of the British employers and capitalists ?

		They too are disunited ; but all the indications show that they are at least considerably nearer the foundation of a policy than either Labor or the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Reports of the
Departmental Committees	ORGANIZATION	appointed to advise upon future commercial and industrial policy in the various industries , and the Reports of Lord
Balfour	PERSON	of
Burleigh 's Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Com - mercial and Industrial Policy , in general show , by the relative unanimity of their conclusions , that there are at least the makings of a common policy among employers .

		`` Trustification , '' or at least con - solidation , of industry is everywhere in evidence .

		There is a strong movement , fostered by most Gov - ernment departments , toward the greater centraliza - tion of industrial control and the formation of strong and representative employers ' organizations claiming to speak `` in the name of the trade . ''

		Government encouragement to this movement arises largely from considerations of war-time convenience .

		It is easier and more efficient for the Food Minister or the Ministry of Munitions or the
Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	to deal with a representative employers ' association or combine than with a number of isolated firms .

		But these developments will not cease with the war , and the great improvement in the organization of capital
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 467 on its trading and commercial side will undoubtedly be maintained .

		Nor are these developments confined to the busi - ness side of capitalist organization .

		There has also been a great strengthening of employers ' associations formed to deal with Labor questions , while the great new central organization open to all sectional asso - ciations the
Federation of British Industries	ORGANIZATION	has a clearly formulated , if largely ^ secret , policy on both labor and commercial questions .

		On its commercial side , the new policy of capital - ism has been well described as `` Administrative Pro- tectionism , '' employing as its methods not merely the tariff , but still more the subsidy and other forms of protection for `` key '' or nascent industries .

		On the
Labor	ORGANIZATION	side , the policy is directed to the casting down of all `` restrictions on output '' imposed by Labor but not necessarily of parallel restrictions imposed by employers themselves the maintenance of war - time methods of standardization , and the continued employment on a large scale of semi-skilled and unskilled labor .

		On the important question of
State	ORGANIZATION	control it is not so clear what the policy of the employers will be .

		There is no doubt that , if we reckon by numbers , the great mass of employers will urgently demand the removal of war-time State control , with its accom - paniment of rationing and in some cases `` costing , '' at the earliest possible moment .

		But it is not certain that this will be in all cases the policy of the largest and most influential manufacturing firms , who are beyond doubt better served under
State	ORGANIZATION	control than their smaller and less influential competitors .

		It is probable that certain large interests will demand , in connection with the removal of restrictive
State	ORGANIZATION	control , the continuance of
State	ORGANIZATION	assistance to in - dustry and the placing in the hands of representative trade associations , which they will dominate , of con - siderable public power in such matters as rationing and industrial organization .

		If the concentration of capitalist organization is the most marked feature of war-time development on the side of the employer , it is also a. marked feature on the side of Labor .

		In the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	movement there is certainly a large preponderance of opinion in favor of closer coordination of effort and greater union of forces .

		This movement toward concentration has , however , serious obstacles to face ; The law puts in the way of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	amalga - mations obstacles which are difficult to surmount .

		Financial difficulties arising out of differences in benefits , contributions , and reserve funds , and other vested interests stand in the way .

		But the most im - portant hindrance to real unity lies in the lack of a common policy .

		The skilled craftsman fears oust - ing from his trade by his less skilled rival ; men fear the competition of women ; crafts and sections are jealous of their independence .

		These differences would vanish before a really compelling unity of idea and purpose ; but , as we have seen , this is just what is lacking .

		Consequently , while some progress has been made among the iron and steel workers , the woodworkers , the post office employees , and in cer - tain other groups , the movement toward concentra - tibn on the side of
Labor	ORGANIZATION	has lagged in its actual achievement far behind the parallel movement among employers .

		Thus at every point we are brought up sharply against the fact that
British Labor	ORGANIZATION	has no clear common policy .

		The results of this situation are , to say the least of it , unfortunate .

		Capital knows what it wants , and presses the
Government	ORGANIZATION	for decisions in its favor .

		The Government sometimes grants its de - mands , and still more often half commits itself to a verbal promise .

		On the `` side of commercial policy , Capital has received many half-promises ; but few of these have '' yet reached the stage of fulfilment .

		Labor , on the other hand , has made few demands in the sphere of after-war policy , unless the
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	's program is to be regarded as a demand .

		It has , on the other hand , so far offered an obstacle to the adoption by the Government of the employers ' labor policy .

		Even in such matters as industrial demobilization we are still by no means prepared for peace ; and in relation to wider questions of in - dustrial reconstruction almost nothing has been done .

		The
Whitley Report	ORGANIZATION	, thus far the
Government	ORGANIZATION	's sole contribution to this problem , has so far hardly affected the vital industries , and does not seem likely to affect them , at least for some time to come .

		If , then , the
Government	ORGANIZATION	hoped that the Whitley Re - port would absolve it of responsibility for industrial resettlement , and place responsibility upon the Joint Industrial Councils of employers and
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	- ists which it was proposed to create , that hope has been disappointed .

		The problem of industrial rela - tions after the war still remains unsolved , and in many industries employers and Trade Unions are still facing each other warily the employers with a policy which Labor will not in any case accept , and
Labor	ORGANIZATION	armed principally with a negation , or at least with demands which have not yet been clearly formu - lated and expressed .

		To leave my conclusion there would however produce far too forlorn an impression of the indus - trial situation .

		It looks as if any post-war settlement of industrial problems will have to be improvised in a hurry when the circumstances force a settlement .

		But it is possible that in this improvisation the new 468 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	forces at work in the world of
Labor	ORGANIZATION	will find a means of expression .

		I have not discussed these new forces in the present article because I have been here concerned rather to clear the ground for a subsequent exposition of their character .

		The old forces which have ruled , and still nom - inally rule , the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	movement are `` played out '' !

		The new forces which are at work have not yet succeeded in so organizing themselves as to take their place .

		Until they do so
British Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	- ism will inevitably present many anarchic features , but the hope lies in the emergence from this partial anarchy of a new order .

		The making of this new order depends upon a new vision and a common idea of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	purpose and of the principles which should animate
Labor	ORGANIZATION	's policy in Reconstruction .

		And , finally , the getting of this new vision depends upon the ability of the new forces in the world of Labor to sink inessential differences and to turn from criticism and destruction to responsibility and con - struction -

		The Betrayal of
Henry Adams	PERSON	I T WAS a primitive little world into which
Henry Adams	PERSON	was born ,
February 16 , 1838	DATE	.

		Nor was he born at the center of it rather at the circumfer - ence of civilization , in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The entire purpose of his life as expressed in the remark - able volume before us -LRB- The Education of
Henry Adams	PERSON	,
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	-RRB- was to get to the center of that world , to understand the forces which controlled it , to become intellectually cosmopolitan .

		And yet though he went to and fro in the world , and lived in its great capitals , and consorted with its leaders , and above all tried to synthesize its deepest knowledge , he remained always a New Englander .

		There is something pathetic in the wistful attitude of
Henry Adams	PERSON	, standing always a little aloof from the world , puzzled and disconcerted .

		There is something tragic in his halting progress as he limps along , consciously behind and striving to catch up .

		No man was ever more keenly aware of failure than
Henry Adams	PERSON	, and no man ever confessed it more conscientiously .

		No one has ever tried more scrup - ulously to fathom the secret of the curse of sterility .

		The first , and perhaps the strongest , impression which the reader receives from the book is that of the intense isolation of the writer .

		Not
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	on his island seems more utterly alone .

		And as the methods by which
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	mastered his situation and built a life for himself are typical of the whole effort of humankind to build the ma - terial habitation of civilization out of the raw material of nature , so the method of
Henry Adams	PERSON	in the far more difficult task of building an intel - lectual habitation out of the vast accumulation of knowledge is likewise typical .

		As Crusoe 's story is an allegory , so to
Henry Adams	PERSON	his whole experience of life became symbolic .

		A New Englander of the nineteenth century , , he found the only name for his conception of that experience in the great super - stition of his age Education .


Henry Adams	PERSON	began his education with a very concrete apprehension of the corner of the earth into which he was born .

		He describes the
New England	LOCATION	of the early nineteenth century explicitly and concretely : The atmosphere of education in which he lived wai colonial , revolutionary , almost Cromwellian , as though he were steeped , from his greatest grandmother 's birth , in the odor of political crime .

		Resistance to something was the law of
New England	LOCATION	nature : the boy looked out on the world with this instinct of resistance ; for number - less generations his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be reformed , filled with evil forces to be abolished , and they saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition ; their duty was unchanged .

		That duty implied not only resistance to evil , but hatred of it .

		Boys naturally look on all force as an enemy and generally find it so , but the New Eng - lander , whether boy or man , in his long struggle with a stingy or hostile universe , had learned also to love the pleasure of hating ; his joys were few ... Politics as a practice , whatever its professions , had always been the systematic organization of hatreds , and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	politics had been as harsh as the climate .

		The chief charm of
New England	LOCATION	was harshness of con - trasts and extremes of sensibility a cold that froze the blood , and a heat that boiled it so that the pleasure of hating one 's self if no better victim offered was not its rarest amusement ; but the charm was a true and natural child of the soil , riot a cultivated weed of the ancients .

		The violence of the Contrast was real and made the strongest motive of education .

		The double exterior nature gave life its relative values , winter and
summer	DATE	, cold and heat , town and country ; force and freedom marked two modes of life and thought , balanced like lobes of the brain .

		Town was winter and confinement , school , rule , disci - pline ; straight gloomy streets , piled with six feet of snovr in the middle ; frosts that made the snow sing under wheels or runners ; thaws when the streets became dan - gerous to cross ; society of uncles , aunts , and cousins who expected children to behave themselves , and who were not always gratified ; above all else , winter represented the desire to escape and go free .

		Town was restraint , law , unity .

		Country , only seven miles away , was liberty , diversity , outlawry , the endless delight of mere sense impressions given by nature for nothing , and breathed by boys without knowing it .

		And further ,
Adams	PERSON	had a clear perception of the fact that this provincial world was further nar - rowed for him by the fact that he was of a race THE DIAL 469 peculiar and apart by virtue of the excess of those qualities which gave
New England	LOCATION	its distinction .

		He realized that the characteristic mark of all the Adamses had been their inherited quarrel with the conventional organization of the bourgeois society about them represented by State Street a quarrel which had gone on for a hundred and fifty years and `` had again and again broken out into riot , blood - shed , personal feuds , foreign and civil wars , whole - sale banishments and confiscation , until the history of
Florence	LOCATION	was hardly more turbulent than that of
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		This opposition was vividly brought be - fore the boy 's mind by the long battle of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for the abolition of slav - ery , and by the part of his father ,
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, in the founding of the
Free Soil Party	ORGANIZATION	.

		He comprehended the difference between the Adamses and the
Websters	ORGANIZATION	, the
Everetts	LOCATION	, the Winthrops a difference which he phrased as that between
Quincy	PERSON	and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		`` Quincy had always been right for
Quincy	PERSON	represented a moral principle the principle of resistance to
Boston	LOCATION	... If State Street was wrong , Quincy must be right !

		Turn the dilemma as he pleased , he still came back on the
eighteenth century	DATE	and the law of Resistance ; of Truth ; of Duty ; and of Freedom .

		He was a ten-year-old priest and politician . ''

		With this inheritance behold
Henry Adams	PERSON	start - ing out on his quest .

		Like the ancient worthies , Josophat ,
Rasselas	PERSON	,
Candide	LOCATION	, he set out from his walled garden to view the world with the object of understanding it .

		And like Candide he represents himself in the present volume as keeping an open and trusting mind , as relying on the world to reveal itself .

		One thing he asked and one only education , guidance , preparation to live in the world that was coming to be .

		And his experience , as he half humor - ously records it , may be summed up in a single word betrayal .

		The first of the educational possibilities which
Adams	PERSON	recognized was that of his family easily the first in reputation in
America	LOCATION	.

		As a child he half thought he owned the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, and took for granted that he would some day live in it .

		`` A Pres - ident was a matter of course in every respectable family . ''

		One thing indeed his birth did for him in giving him the social .

		freedom of the world , but of definite guidance from his immediate family he got little .

		`` The family was more an atmosphere than a positive influence ... His father 's business in life was to get past the dangers of the slave power , '' and he adds somewhat bitterly : `` The task done , he might be content to let his sons pay for the pilotage ; and it mattered little to his success whether they paid for it with their lives wasted on battle - fields , or in misdirected energies and lost oppor - tunities . ''

		His second educational possibility was in the unique culture of the community .

		Though his father suffered a certain ostracism in pro-slavery
Boston	LOCATION	, along with
Dana	PERSON	and
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, yet
Edward Everett	PERSON	was his uncle , and
Peter Chardon Brooks	PERSON	, the richest man in
New England	LOCATION	, his grand - father .

		Through another uncle ,
Nathaniel Froth	PERSON	- ingham , minister of the
First Church	ORGANIZATION	, he was con - nected with the eminent group of Unitarian clergy - men who represented the religious interest of the time .

		He was , of course , sent to
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, where his name was a passport to everything the institution had to offer .

		He was led towards Con - cord for a time by the influence of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	.

		`` Concord seemed to him at one time more real than Quincy . ''

		Yet these local advantages proved to
Adams	PERSON	worse than useless a series of deceptions .

		He records his disillusionment with the sterile philosophy of the Unitarians : That the most powerful emotion of man next to the sexual should disappear , might be a personal defect of his own ; but that the most intelligent society , led by the most intelligent clergy , in the most moral conditions he ever knew , should have solved all the problems of the universe so thoroughly as to have quite ceased making itself anxious about past or future ... seemed to him the most curious social phenomenon he had to account for in a long life .

		Harvard did little more for him .

		The tools he needed to shape his own education for the twentieth century , as he came to see later , were a knowledge of French , German , Spanish , and mathematics and it was a matter of recurring regret that they were not put or forced into his hand .

		All his life he lamented , like many another New Englander , the absence of the pentecostal gift of tongues .

		Even
Lowell	PERSON	failed him in the end .

		`` From him the boy got no revolutionary thought whatever but he got good-humored encouragement to do what amused him , which consisted in passing two years in
Europe	LOCATION	, after finishing the four years of
Cambridge	LOCATION	. ''

		This was
Adams	PERSON	' next adventure .

		The faith in
Germany	LOCATION	, cultivated by
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	, was strong in the fifties , and to
Germany	LOCATION	Adams went , with the indulgence of his , parents , `` to begin at a German university the study of Civil Law al - though neither he nor they knew what Civil Law was or any reason for his studying it . ''

		This second experiment in formal education succeeded no better than the first .

		His first lecture on the subject of his choice was his last .

		`` H had thought
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	a torpid school , but it was instfnct with life compared with all that he could see of the
University	ORGANIZATION	470 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	of
Berlin	LOCATION	. ''

		He modestly stepped down to the Gym - nasium , thinking at least to learn the language .

		More disillusionment .

		`` The
German University	ORGANIZATION	had seemed a failure , but the German High School was something very near an indictable nuisance . ''

		He listened to music and one day surprised himself by being able to follow the movement of a symphony .

		`` He could not have been more astonished had he suddenly read a new language ... A prison-wall that barred his senses on one great side of life , sud - denly fell of its own accord , without so much as his knowing when it happened . ''

		For the rest he was glad to escape from
Berlin	LOCATION	to
Rome	LOCATION	, of which he has only ` this to say : `` Perhaps Henry learned something in
Rome	LOCATION	, though he never knew it and never sought it . ''


Henry Adams	PERSON	' next teacher was action , and his schoolroom the American legation at
London	LOCATION	, where
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	was minister during the Civil War .

		As his father 's private secretary he shared to the full the anxious business of those fateful days .

		The
Adams	PERSON	family landed at Liver - pool , to be met by news that
England	LOCATION	had recog - nized the belligerency of the Confederacy .

		They went up to
London	LOCATION	`` a family of early Christian martyrs about to be flung into an arena of lions . ''

		Then followed the negotiations with the hostile English Cabinet over the Trent affair , over the sail-ing of the Confederate privateers , over Glad - stone 's public announcement that
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	and the Southern leaders had made a nation , and finally over the delivery of the rams , built in a Scotch shipyard , to the
Confederate navy	ORGANIZATION	which final dis - pute was terminated by
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	' let - ter to Lord
John Russell	PERSON	: `` It would be superfluous in me to point out to your lordship that this is war . ''

		This is by far the most generally interesting part of the autobiography ;
Henry Adams	PERSON	was a close witness of history in the making , but he main - tains through his record of these momentous events his own singular point of view .

		What was the outcome of this experience in terms of his own education ?

		Disappointing as usual .

		For one thing `` he thought ... that he was going to a friendly Government true to the anti-slavery principles which had been their steadiest profession ... He was , like all Bostonians , instinctively English . ''

		But the
London	LOCATION	of the Civil War , where `` the belief in poor Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's brutality and
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's feroc - ity became a dogma of popular faith '' shook this principle of racial nationality .

		`` The beginning of a new education tore up by the roots nearly all that was left of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		He pictures himself following anxiously `` one of the most perfect educational courses in politics and diplomacy that a young man ever had a chance to pursue , '' under the most costly tutors in the world Lord
Palmerston	LOCATION	,
Lord Russell	PERSON	, Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	.

		Especially in regard to
Gladstone	PERSON	`` one asked one 's self painfully what sort of lesson a young man should have drawn for purposes of his education from this world famous teaching of a very great master . ''

		And forty years later , in reading
Russell	PERSON	's and
Gladstone	PERSON	's letters , he came to the conclusion that `` they made a picture different from anything he had conceived , and rendered worthless his whole painful diplomatic experience . ''

		After the war ,
Henry Adams	PERSON	' method of educa - tion changed .

		Instead of taking hand actively in the process as experimenter , he became a spectator .

		In
London	LOCATION	he viewed the opening scientific renais - sance which had begun with the
Origin of Species	ORGANIZATION	, and fancied that he might get the best part of Dar - winism from geology , `` a science which suited idle minds as well as though it were history . ''

		Return - ing to
America	LOCATION	, he devoted himself to observations of political life in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		This was that lowest period of American political morality , when the miasma left by the war infected every circle , even the highest .


Henry Adams	PERSON	wrote up the Gold Conspiracy of
1869	DATE	, and he and his older brother
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	described the cognate scan - dal of the
Erie Railroad in Chapters of Erie	ORGANIZATION	.

		Adams had no doubt that the filthy trail of
Jay Gould	PERSON	and
Jim Fisk	PERSON	led to the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	if not to the
White House	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		At all events , such men as he found in
Washington	LOCATION	were altogether inferior as teachers to those at whose feet he had sat in
London	LOCATION	.

		`` When he raised his eyes to the loftiest and most triumphant results of politics to Mr.
Boutwell	PERSON	, Mr.
Conkling	PERSON	, or even to Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	he could not honestly say that such an education , even when it carried one up to these unattainable heights , was worth anything . ''

		The theory of bio - logical progress , of which he had gained a glimpse in
London	LOCATION	, seemed an utter illusion .

		`` That two thou - sand years after Alexander the Great and
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, a man like Grant should be called and should actually and truly be the highest product of the most advanced evolution , made evolution ludicrous . ''

		Of all the regions traversed by
Henry Adams	PERSON	, this of
Washington	LOCATION	in
1869	DATE	is the dreariest , and his pen fairly drops bitterness .

		He is a
New England Dante	LOCATION	, sorely in need of an Inferno .

		From this disillusionizing spectacle of the world he was rescued by President
Eliot	PERSON	, who made him Assistant Professor of Histotfy in
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, he meanwhile to continue his journalistic labors as
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 47 editor of the
North American Review	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although
Adams	PERSON	thought that of all his many educations that of school teacher was the thinnest , it is clear that at this time he began those systematic studies which gave the material on which his mind worked for the rest of his life .

		After six years he resigned , to return to
Washington	LOCATION	and his close companionship with more active friends :
Clarence King	PERSON	, the founder of the
Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	,
John LaFarge	PERSON	, and
John Hay	PERSON	.

		He wrote his History of the
Administration of Jefferson	ORGANIZATION	and
Madison	PERSON	.

		He continued to observe passing events and became almost interested in the Free Silver movement of the early nineties .

		But he resigned himself .

		In
1893	DATE	the issue came on the single gold standard , and the majority at last declared itself , once for all , in favor of the capitalistic system with all its necessary machinery .

		Of all forms of society or government , this was the one he liked least , but his likes and dislikes were as anti- quated as the rebel doctrine of state rights ... Nothing in politics ever surprised
Henry Adams	PERSON	more than the ease with which he and his silver friends slipped across the chasm , and alighted on the single gold standard and the capitalistic system with its methods ; the protective tariff ; the corporations and trusts ; the trades-unions and socialistic paternalism which necessarily made their com - plement ; the whole mechanical consolidation of force , which ruthlessly stamped out the life of the class into which
Adams	PERSON	was born , but created monopolies capable of controlling the new energies that
America	LOCATION	adored .

		But if
Adams	ORGANIZATION	thus resigned himself to accept the play of forces that he could not control , his effort to understand those forces became ever more passion - ate .

		He had already seen that history as written in the nineteenth century was either antiquarianism or anecdotage .

		Under the examples of
Froude	PERSON	and
Kinglake	PERSON	he had been ready to accept the notion `` that History , like everything else , might be a field of scraps , like the refuse about a
Staffordshire	LOCATION	iron furnace . ''

		But the new concepts of science tending toward a unified view of the world process brought to his mind the question why human history should not be a part of that unity , and a branch of natural science representing the application of laws govern - ing force and mass .

		There is something strangely pathetic in the effort of
Adams	PERSON	' mind to accustom itself to new modes of thought , to move in formulae to which it was unaccustomed .

		Always tragically obsessed by the thought that he was behind the pro- cession ,
Adams	PERSON	tried desperately to catch up .

		One of the great forces in the world had been sex , and ' of this he knew himself ignorant , the victim of his education .

		The woman had once been supreme ; in
France	LOCATION	she still seemed potent ... Why was she unknown in
America	LOCATION	?

		Anyone brought up among the Puritans knew that sex was sin .

		In any previous age sex was strength ... At the
Louvre	LOCATION	and at
Chartres	LOCATION	, as he knew by the record of work actually done and still before his eyes , was the highest energy ever known to man , the creation of four - fifths of his noblest art , exercising vastly more attraction over the human mind than all the steam engines and dynamos ever dreamed of ; and yet this energy was un - known to the American mind .

		An
American Virgin	ORGANIZATION	would never dare command ; an
American Venus	ORGANIZATION	would never dare exist ... Symbol or energy , the Virgin had acted as the greatest force the western world had ever felt , and had drawn man 's activities to herself more strongly than any other power , natural or supernatural , had ever done ; the historian 's business was to follow the track of the energy ; to find where it came from and where it went to ; its complex source and shifting chan - nels ; its values , equivalents , conversions .

		Adams knew nothing about any of them , but as a mathematical prob - lem of influence on human progress ... all reacted on his mind , and he rather inclined to think the Virgin easiest to handle .

		Accordingly , in his effort at a scientific reading of human forces , he set himself to the study of the age in which those forces seemed most in harmony , when man held the highest idea of himself as a unit in a unified universe .

		This was the century
1150	DATE	-
1250	DATE	, and the essay took form in Mont-Saint-Michel and
Chartres	LOCATION	, a Study of
Thirteenth-Century Unity	ORGANIZATION	.

		From that point he purposed to fix a position for himself '' which he could label
The Education of Henry Adams	ORGANIZATION	: A Study of Twentieth-Century Mul - tiplicity .

		With the help of these two points of rela - tion , he hoped to project his lines forward and back - ward indefinitely .

		In the unfolding of this dynamic theory of history he developed a law of acceleration of human energy for which he found a formula roughly accurate since
1840	DATE	in the ratio of increase in the volume of coal power a doubling every ten years ; before that , a twenty-five or fifty year period of reduplication might serve as a measure back to 1400 ; and before that a longer period , until the movement became infinitely slight .

		Such accelera - tion might be tested and the ratio more exactly de - termined by a study of the works of mankind , but that was a task for the mathematician and for the sociological statistician .

		For
Adams	PERSON	it was impos - sible .

		To educate one 's self to begin with had been the effort of one 's life for sixty years ; and the difficulties of educa - tion had gone on doubling with the coal output , until the prospect of waiting another ten years , in order to face a seventh doubling of complexities , allured one 's imagination but slightly ... All that a historian won was a vehement wish to escape .

		He saw his education complete , and was sorry he ever began it .

		In these closing chapters of the book there is much of interest to the student of modern life .


Adams	PERSON	' theory did not preoccupy him to the extent of taking his eyes off the history that was making about him ; on the contrary , it seems to have sharpened his per - ceptions .

		As the close friend of
John Hay	PERSON	he was a sympathetic observer and collaborator in that 4.72 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	statesman 's comprehensive world diplomacy .

		He was intensely interested in the awakening sex class - consciousness of women .

		As he grew older `` he found that Early Institutions lost their interest , but that
Early Woman	ORGANIZATION	became a passion .

		Without un - derstanding movement of sex , history seemed to him mere pedantry . ''

		He `` felt sometimes convinced that the Church had been made by the woman chiefly as her protest against man that the man had over - thrown the
Church	ORGANIZATION	chiefly because it was feminine .

		After the overthrow of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the woman had no refuge except such as the man created for himself .

		She must , like the man , marry machinery . ''

		But in the presence of this problem , as of all others , he whimsically confesses his helplessness .

		`` The Mar - guerite of the future could alone decide whether she were better off than the
Marguerite	PERSON	of the past ; whether she would rather be victim to a man , a church , or a machine . ''

		One of the most attractive passages in this record of his later years is the recol - lection of his delight in youth , and his friendship with two winning and radiant spirits ,
Bay Lodge	LOCATION	and
Joseph Trumbull Stickney	PERSON	.

		Of Bay Lodge he wrote the biography which was published anony - mously .

		- In all this we see the effort after the unattainable , the love of the impossible the note of Quixotism in
Adams	PERSON	' mind .

		And indeed there is something fundamentally Quixotic in the way in which
Adams	PERSON	' brain was heated by such books as Judge
Stallo	PERSON	's Scientific Concepts , and
Karl Pearson	PERSON	's
Grammar of Science	ORGANIZATION	, as was the
Knight of La Mancha	ORGANIZATION	's by his romances of chivalry .

		But to dismiss the matter thus would be to lose the true meaning of
Henry Adams	PERSON	' character .

		It was a kind of Quixotism worthy of a New Englander that led
Adams	PERSON	, with - out religion , sex , or science , to try to impose a unity on the world as complete as the Summa of Saint
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, to learn the secret of the most potent force the western world had ever felt , to make himself `` an instrument of measure , a barom - eter , pedometer , radiometer , of thought motion '' and the reactions of man and nature .

		He scorned the easier way of pragmatic philosophies , and grappled with the multiplicities of his universe in the spirit of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's Grammarian .

		And he has left a record of his search and struggle and failure , shot through with cynicism , irony , and self-contempt , and yet as sincere , moving , and significant as any that has ever come from
New England	LOCATION	.

		One unity he achieved or rather maintained in the face of betrayal without and distrust within himself a unity of attitude as complete as that of Cotton Mather , or
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	, or
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	.

		Edu - cation was in a sense to
Adams	PERSON	what religion was to them , the one the approved method of our day as the other was of theirs .

		It was not exactly
Adams	PERSON	' fault that while their faith led them to the City of God ,
Adams	PERSON	' led only to the reductio ad absurdum .

AIKEN	ORGANIZATION	.

		1918 THE DIAL 473
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	I T is UNCOMFORTABLE but true that a living organ - ism retains much of the fascination of life , even when exposed upon the dissecting-table and to the instrument of the surgeon .

		Thus we approach the yet sprouting body of this world of
Compton Mac	ORGANIZATION	- kenzie with a not unconscious heightening of per - ception : our ringers itch to have their way with something so indubitably alive .

		And perhaps our philosophy , ever obsequious , can establish some sort of intellectualization of our appetite , and so , as its way is , edge our lust .


George Moore	PERSON	has told us that good writing like good bronze assumes with the passage of the years an enriching patina .

		There can be no question that an extraneous charm is now and then bestowed by time upon a literary work , as , for example , that inestimable naivete which is for us the prevailing attraction of so much of the literature of the Middle Age , and which , inactive to the medievals them - selves , comes into being as an esthetic value only when these writings are observed with the perspec - tive given by our own sophistication .

		But surely the difference between a bronze and a book is in this respect fundamental : that in the case of the former both the revealing material and the subject matter remain to us forever familiar and therefore wholly effective the substance of bronze and the naked body we do perforce know ; while in the case of the latter the same conditions absolutely do not hold all the scholarship in the world will not make us quite at home among words and idioms to which we were not born , and the life of another time in all its crisply minute detail genius itself can not reconstitute .

		Thus both the language and the world of bygone literature , be they never so mani - festly alive , must for us remain in some part or other merely potential , always do somewhere de - pend for their ultimate effect upon some precious item which , in the alien atmosphere of our own intelligence , can not , so to speak , go off .

		They have not the wholly active cogency , the triumphant im - mediacy , of the work of our own day .

		The years also have their artillery , and wheresoever this can - nonade does not efface utterly , it yet does so batter and demolish the irremediable detail of these edi - fices of language as more often than not to leave them shorn of all their complicated loveliness , bare deponents to the ponderous animosity of time .

		This being so , we at once perceive the fatuity of at least one of that impressive circle of penguin - like follies which dominate our particular epoch .

		The artists and the critics of our time are at one in their reverence for the verdict of posterity and no trust is thought too sheep-like if only it be put in the dispensations of that particular judgment - seat : it is not for us to pass verdict ; it is for us to plead across the centuries , prayerfully , to those more competent .

		In support of this attitude we may note the fact that the subject matter chosen by contempo - rary writers is likely to be of a nature congenial to us also , and therefore capable of seducing us into an estimate of worth which the `` artistry itself does not warrant .

		There is , besides , the evidence that in the past great artists have not seldom been ignored both by the ruck of their contemporaries and , now and then as was
Kleist	PERSON	by Goethe by their peers .

		This indefeasible fact that the coevals of a great artist do often ignore him , while the next genera - tion learns to speak of him with at least lip-rever - ence , would seem , to one who has probed this later generation and found how little it really cares , rather to demonstrate how utterly without concern of un - distinguished humanity all distinguished art must forever be , than anything more apposite to our argu - ment .

		As for
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Kleist	PERSON	here we have an example of how an artist can be so enveloped in his own type of work as to be honestly incapable of com - prehending even the masterpiece of a different genre .

		The question of contemporaneity would indeed ap - pear to be quite beside the point .

		Thus following the same
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	we find him prostrate before the insipid , but classical ,
Apollo Belvidere	LOCATION	, while amid the grotesque , but insistently real , detritus of the Middle Age he walks very erect indeed .

		As to the likelihood of our better judgment being hood - winked by subject matter culled and seasoned in accord with the taste of our own time , here again
Goethe	PERSON	's whole-hearted acceptance of that fashion - plate Apollo we might almost borrow his own favorite word and outrageously turn it against him , for is there not in the bearing of that gracile neck and head a suggestion , barely a suggestion , of the artig ?

		illuminates the difficulty .

		Surely we can - not discover in this bric-a-brac deity an imaginative conception to justify one tithe of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's adulation , and as surely we must seek not only in the classical treatment but also in the subject itself for the secret of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's fall .

		Let us out with the atrocious fact the Apollo Belvidere unwittingly embodied the pldnzend ideal , albeit somewhat stripped , of what in the eyes of the court-circle of
Weimar	LOCATION	a sun god and a gentleman muss und soil sein .

		Having remarked that seventeen centuries in which to grow away from a vulgar taste for subject matter could not 474 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	save Goethe , not even him ; you and I , with all his - tory shown up as so alarmingly seductive , see no cause to reserve any special misgiving for the subject matter of those who are , after all , our neighbors .

		But if there is then no good reason why we can not judge of our contemporaries at least as well as of the past , we have already seen that there are on the other hand the best reasons why we Can savor and so appraise the work of our own period better than that of any other ; and carrying this argument to its ultimate point though not , we hope , into the realm of the absurd we may even go so far as to state that in some cases it is not after an artist 's death , but during his life , that we can speak of him with most assured finality .

		Hence , our appetite for the living organism some - what laboriously justified , we roll up our sleeves and with a clear conscience and a keen zest , we advance to the dissecting-table and the not yet , we hope , wholly dead subject of
Compton Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	.

		This novelist , if we rightly interpret his attitude toward life , was never a particularly lively one , and at first blush he might seem to have been , for a clinic in vivisection , not well chosen .

		Yet , despite the author 's negative personality , the atmosphere in these books is so thick , the incidents are so multi - farious , the characters are so myriad , that in setting out to discuss them we have positively the sensation of disentangling , nay , of disenveloping ourselves in order first to free our head , and then , with such wits as we can collect , to speak .

		And if other novelists , notably
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, are ready to immerse us in an even more obviously brawling and seething vat of humanity , nevertheless we are not tempted to relin - quish Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	.

		For he still has among con - temporary writers of distinction one characteristic which marks him beyond peradventure as our man .

		He alone in each succeeding novel The Passionate Elopement antedates the sequence continues to fol - low out the ever-widening development of groups and persons always related to one another .

		We thus experience in his work to a peculiar degree that sen - sation of immediacy of contact and of precious familiarity with the subject matter which we deem of value ; and in a realistic form of art like the novel this fact is surely more obviously important than anywhere else at all .

		So accustomed are we indeed to these beloved figures that only after a moment 's reflection should we be astonished at hav - ing recognized not in a new book ' but upon a new street Mr.
Michael Fane	PERSON	or Mr.
Ronald Walker	PERSON	.

		These volumes are all merely installments of con - temporary life , though , to be sure , in the case of Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's latest indiscretion , the cinematographic
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- , we might perhaps with more exactitude speak of it as a new reel .

		Avidly we strain our eyes upon the flickering scene and when the firm of
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	introduces an old favorite we obediently quiver .

		Then , too , it flatters our sense of importance to know that by buying or not buying the scarlett
Sylvia	PERSON	we may make or mar her matrimonial prospects with that parti , her half-cousin
Michael	PERSON	: it is not less pleasant to have one 's finger in the destiny of an imaginary character than in that of a real person .

		These books are knit together in the most unex - pected and ingenious ways .

		In Youth 's Encounter we had read how
Michael	PERSON	, in his ecclesiastical pu - berty , `` accompanied Mr.
Prout	PERSON	... to a reception ... in honour of the Legitimist Emperor of Byzan - tium '' and of how ``
Michael	PERSON	was very much im - pressed by kissing the hand of an Emperor , and even more deeply impressed by the Scottish piper who marched up and down during the light refreshment . ''

		... In
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	we are the more sharply diverted at encountering once again this identical Emperor and piper and at seeing them through the bright , unecclesiastical eyes of
Sylvia	LOCATION	, - for the nonce ravishingly en prince incognito .

		When we re-read so piquantly humorous a scene as this presentation of the child
Sylvia	PERSON	to the Emperor , we must confess that Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	is on occasion remarkably alive .

		Then we remember another brilliant development of a scene only suggested in Sinister Street .

		We recall how vainly the knight-errant
Michael	PERSON	rang the bell of that Mulberry Cottage wherein was incarcerated Lady Lily : now what is not our excitement at being in this new volume admitted where Sir
Michael	PERSON	, for all his prowess , could not penetrate , and at finding within the donjon the immense Mrs.
Gainsborough	PERSON	and at learning from her lips that the `` ping-ping - pinging '' got even to her nerves , and that she felt herself `` coming out in black spots like a domino '' ?


Henry James	PERSON	, in his essay on The New Novel , pointed out the episodic character of those books which , up to that time -LRB-
1914	DATE	-RRB- ,
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	had published : he spoke of `` rounded episodes strung on the loose cord as so many vivid beads . ''


Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	is even more brazenly an out and out string - ing of episodes , but this new lot of beads is so thump - ingly vivid as , we are sure , to enchant the eyes of whatsoever barbarous peoples may be ventured among for their bartering .

		`` Why should n't you set out to have an adventure ? ''

		ejaculates to herself the already sea-worn heroine , cast up like her classical prototype , Mr.
Ulysses	PERSON	, only this time upon Sulphur - ville ,
Indiana	LOCATION	, a reef none the less grisly because un - noted in the Homeric chart .

		Why not indeed ?

		we echo ; and if you happen to be the author of a series of novels elaborating the fortune of a group of THE DIAL 475 more or less fictionally related people , then most pertinently , Why not ?

		For whatsoever befalls any member thereof does incontrovertibly concern the whole family , and I do not think I overreach myself in speaking of these books as of a family history .

		Such in the last accounting infallibly they are , not only in the dovetailing of incident from volume to volume , but also , as we shall see , in a certain blood - resemblance which characterizes , if not everybody mentioned , at least all those who are of
Mother Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	's especial brood .

		There being then , as in the annals of all good families , precious little unity of plot , we see no reason at all why Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	can not afford to spread himself a bit , the expenditure continuing , bien entendu , to be within the same multiparous family .

		In this latest reel , not only are the beads more than heretofore gaudy , but also they seem , more often than not , to have been chosen for an exotic quality in their coloring .

		Our eyes held fast by the palpitant screen , we are willy-nilly flicked from
France	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	to Eng - land to
Belgium	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	to
Brazil	LOCATION	to the Argentine to
France	LOCATION	to
Spain	LOCATION	to
Morocco	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	, and as , not yet wholly dazed , we remark our much-traveled heroine entering a taxi bound for
Charing Cross	ORGANIZATION	and God knows where , abruptly the light goes out .

		We must be pardoned if our minds as well as our eyes do now and then blink .

		Yet `` Sylvia 's imagination , '' we are told , `` was captured by the life she led at
Earl	ORGANIZATION	's Court '' : so we too glory in this
Earl 's Court	ORGANIZATION	of a world and pray that Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	, no matter to what fabulous age and wisdom the years ripen him , may never outgrow this youthful penchant toward forays on the outlandish .

		In
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	her author begot a child after his own heart .

		Life had always offered itself to her contemplation , whether of the past or of the future , as a set of vivid impressions that formed a crudely colored panorama of action without any emotional light and shade , the inter - vals between which , like the intervals of a theatrical performance , were only tolerable with plenty of chocolates .

		Is it to be wondered at she should so breathlessly follow the good counsel of Mr.
Gustard	PERSON	: `` You get out and about , my dear .

		That 's my motto for the young '' ?

		Sylvia is indeed the proper heroine for a tale of adventure , but is she not also a typical child ?

		And is not childhood the most apt field for the dis - play of
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	's own talents ?

		His mind appears to be without discipline and in the gay sprawling of his imagination he appears to find complete satisfac - tion .

		Such being the case , would it not be clear even though we did not hold as irrefutable argument those unforgotten children ,
Jenny Pearl	ORGANIZATION	and
Michael	PERSON	.

		Fane that in the depiction of the always disjointed and often incoherent experience of childhood , Comp - ton
Mackenzie	PERSON	would find his own last ?

		In the epilogue to Sinister Street he points out that on the final page
Michael Fane	PERSON	is growing up , `` and for me his interest begins to fade . ''

		For some of us , I fear , the fading , though never obliteration , set in several hundred pages earlier this emphatically not from any weakening in the later centuries of that sustained work , but quite simply because as a child
Michael	PERSON	was unique , while at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and in the underworld he is one among many .

		For other children have always clinging about them an indefinable some - thing which foreshadows the inevitably unlovely man , a something perhaps not so definite as the ill - boding legs of the tadpole , and yet not less obvious and repellent to the discerning eye , while from such birthmarks these children of
Compton Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	are blessedly and forever exempt .

		Those of us who are not content devoutly to accept such boons as gods and novelists bestow , but must forever question why , will inquire the reason for this unnatural im - munity .

		Let us out with the poor truth : these children are not flesh and blood ; they are the decora - tive and mobile objects which the mature imagina - tion loves to dress up in the sweet guise of childhood .

		We may therefore read these smooth pages with the happy assurance of not brushing upon the really tooth and nail quality of childhood .

		`` There is only one tragedy for youth . ''

		`` And that is ? ''

		`` Age , '' said the stranger .

		And in this world of
Compton Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	it is even sadder than in real life that people should grow up .

		Having seen others of this fellowship put on the dull apparel of maturity , we can not but dread the opening of that next volume which shall , it is intimated , give us
Michael Fane	PERSON	a man .

		Even though that delicious mirage of Mackenzian childhood has long since evap - orated from him , yet youth and Oxford have con - tinued to cover a multitude of sins .

		Before stepping within that most modern develop - ment of the deus ex machina , the taxicab for
Charing Cross	ORGANIZATION	,
Sylvia	PERSON	takes us into her confidence to the extent of stating that she is `` off with the raggle - taggle gipsies . ''

		On divers other occasions in the course of her wanderings she has both spoken and chanted the same bit of cheering news .


Michael Fane	PERSON	, too , at a decisively early age , had `` made up his mind in the beeswaxed dining-room that it was better to be a raggle-taggle wanderer than anything else . ''

		The title of Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's announced volume ,
Sylvia	PERSON	and
Michael	PERSON	, supports our expecta - tion that Fate has in store for
Sylvia	LOCATION	, in whatsoever further gavottings the prestidigitatious Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- kenzie mav even now have up his sleeve , the desirable 47 6 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	position of Vis a Vis to
Michael Fane	PERSON	.

		Also we must admit that , with the best intentions in the world , Mr.
Fane	PERSON	has heretofore eminently stuck to the bees - wax .

		We thus perceive the reason for that gran rifiuto which
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	in her tout ensemble , we regret to say , discovers .

		That she may find favor with the well-known sweet tooth and patrician stomach of
Michael Fane	PERSON	, the Sapphic bitter-ender of Sinister Street has now been diluted into a young lady whose favorite pastime is to fancy herself a gipsy .

		`` Tell them , my dear , I 'm quite simple .

		I represent the original conception of the
Hetaera	LOCATION	, a companion .

		I do n't want to be made love to , and every man who makes love to me I dislike . ''

		Thus , under the exigencies of Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's match-making , we must watch go by the board to - gether both our ancient
Sylvia	PERSON	and our ancient his - tory .

		But , sentimental considerations apart , we have good cause to regret this change in
Sylvia	LOCATION	; for what might have been that rarest of things , a bona fide picaresque novel , has , to save this lady 's face , been unmannerly sacrificed .

		Despite those three months , which we knew we could depend on Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	not to throw upon the screen ,
Miss Scarlett	LOCATION	remains through all her escapades inescapably a lady : we knew in advance she would be both at homeland a success in that select boarding-school .

		Such , even in the .

		land of make-believe , are the harsh terms of matrimony that
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	must forever keep one finger on the home base which is gentility .

		She plays at being a waif quite as
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	once did at being a shepherdess ; and we are reminded that as , if we may believe porcelain , shepherdesses once were , so waifs now are and not merely in the cinema le dernier cri .

		Two so opposite women as
Pauline	PERSON	and
Sylvia	PERSON	both find that
Michael Fane	PERSON	`` regards '' life more as a portrait by
Van Dyck	ORGANIZATION	would do than as a human being .

		We ourselves are regretfully aware that he becomes his well-cut flannels , and we are not long discovering that poses which in satin breeches were entirely delightful , when rehearsed in freshly ironed trousers possess a certain quite unaccountable ridi - cule .

		Also we have a shrewd suspicion that all Van Dycks were not in real life unintermittently Van Dycks .

		It has been whispered that the great war will discover
Michael	PERSON	a diplomat in
Bucharest	LOCATION	: for ourselves , we can only observe that we deem Mr.
Fane	PERSON	eminently suited to a diplomatic career and that we are convinced he will comport himself be - comingly , be the situation never so Balkan .

		Yet brilliant as may well be his future , we shall find it hard to forget that he has upon his past the indelible stain of having ruined the character of Sylvia Scar - lett and thus dished what might otherwise have been a thoroughly corking novel .


Lily Haden	PERSON	, the sweet whore of
Michael	PERSON	's `` adora - tion , shares with his mother and
Magdalen Tower	ORGANIZATION	the oft-repeated adjectival phrase of ' `` slim and love - ly . ''

		No reason is obvious why the limits of this corporation should not be indefinitely extended .

		Not even at Mr.
Ziegfeld	PERSON	's
Midnight Frolic	ORGANIZATION	are we introduced to so many beautiful girls with beau - - tiful names ; and now and then , with flutterings of _ the heart and for ever so tiny a moment , we are permitted , with a restrained ecstasy , to finger the `` delicate havoc '' of their lingerie .

		Are they then , glossy and strokable as they incontrovertibly are , not also `` slim and lovely '' ?

		Surely in these
Fortu	LOCATION	- nate Islands every lady is a Lily ; while Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- kenzie himself has the unique distinction of being the only modern chef to have mastered , clever dog that he is , the recipe for that Greek dish known s leiriopolphanemone .

		But let not the gentle reader be unduly aff rayed : though in Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's troupe the role of primt donna is so indisputably sung by Aphrodite , yet her circumspect manager takes good care never to let her out upon the stage without that she has first assumed her prophylactic fleshings .

		For like
Charles Lovely	PERSON	, the suave hero of
The Passionate Elopement	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	too would seem to have inherited the motto Sum decorus .

		And this passion for propriety goes far deeper than any circumscription he may hare put upon that most nimble of heathen goddesses : indeed it so permeates this world to the very core that with Beau Ripple we also `` could wish for a ... less ordered abandon . ''

		The polished floor , the intricate parquet , of this demure society is never broken through , and consequently we never breathe the harsh air of earth .

		Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	steps about , now here , now there , with the assurance of * demi-mondaine in her boudoir : he is blandly un - aware that in the meantime his universe has gone irretrievably dinky .

		It is a world of tumbled chest - nut hair , very fit indeed to be rumpled absently with that feminine absorption which is shared by both the vaporous Mrs.
Fane	PERSON	and our delicious author .

		But in the end we are cloyed by these too elaborate blandishments , these too lush experiences , these too verdant grasses , these too blue dissolving eyes , and everywhere and evermore the too ubiquitous caress of rose-touched flesh .

		We accuse Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	of slapping on his marmalade with a trowel .

		The Passionate Elopement , containing as it does so quintessential and intriguing a decoction of life at an eighteenth century Spa the burgundy , the cockfight , the Pump-Room , and the Chinese Mas - querade might , appropriately enough to the period in question , but more especially because of the highly polished and frankly artificial style of workmanship ,
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 477 be likened to a piece of genuine lacquer .

		Our only quarrel with
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	is that he has continued in these later volumes , which deal with contemporary life , to employ the same lacquer tech - nique .

		From
Curtain Wells to Sulphurville	ORGANIZATION	is a long way and we would he had not traversed it .

		We recall the Latin poet 's `` caelum non animum mutant , qui trans mare currunt '' yet with the ad - dendum , gleaned from these books if from nowhere else , that the traveler , to be a successful one , really must so change his heart .

		In the last analysis Comp - ton
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	is , however outwardly genteel , at heart a fantast , and we can , I think , lay it down as a general law that , come what may , fantasts ought never to buy railway tickets to health resorts in
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		When they not only do so , but also refuse to adapt their costume to the new environment , the outcome is by no means happy .

		The laid-on finish of
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	, though not so damnatorily thick as that which encases the prodigious and invertebrate mummy of Sinister Street , would , like most of the lacquer of today , more accurately be termed a glaze or varnish than anything more aristocratic .

		We itch to unclasp our jacknife and peck out a few authentic splinters .


Compton Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	himself appears to have chafed in this unreal world of his own making .

		His hero ,
Michael Fane	PERSON	, reacting against the unnatural estheticism of his life at
Oxford	LOCATION	, seeks contrast in the strenuous vices of
Neptune	LOCATION	Crescent ' and the Cafe d'Orange .

		Among us mortals evil has always been the most obviously real of our experiences , and we discern that
Michael	PERSON	's instinct has here turned him in the right direction .

		Also , there is no denying it , in the search for Lily ,
Mackenzie	PERSON	has laid hold on an essentially romantic subject .

		Why then does it all peter out so dismally , and into a mere dull unpleasantness , a splay suggestion of the sinister ?

		We are told that
Michael	PERSON	`` could not remember any period of his life when the speculum of hidden thought had not reflected that shadow of evil which overcast the manifestations of most ordinary exist - ence . ''

		Yet we ourselves can find in this character , as indeed in his creator , no sensation sufficiently in - tense to dignify with that powerful word .

		The sense of evil , like most other moral qualities , ulti - mately depends for its vitality upon strength of will : to sustain that experience of profound thwarting which is to sense evil , we must first have profoundly desired .

		Its absence in our author and his hero would thus jibe with our other impressions of
Mac	ORGANIZATION	- kenzie .

		Now , whatever else romance may or may not require , there must certainly be , unless it is to deliquesce into sugar , a real sense of evil .

		Hence
Michael	PERSON	's complete failure to experience either more evil or more romance than he could have gathered from a slumming trip in a sight-seeing motor bus .

		We can but pity Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	, who , in this grand sortie from his ivory tower , has so immeasurably fallen short of attaining those acrid waters of reality after which he , like ourselves , must indeed have ached .

		But let us not forget that none are so perverse as those who demand from every work of art that same brackish water of unfiltered truth .

		The works of
Compton Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	belong confessedly to the literature of escape , and most precious to our bruised souls is the anodyne they so copiously afford .

		First the
Columbine	ORGANIZATION	had pirouetted across and made a light fantastic entrance into the shadow of the house at the extreme corner .

		Presently came the Pierrot with a lantern swaying atop of a long pole .

		Up and down the sheet he had danced with incredible agility , until a Pulcinello shook his bells from the window of the house , and he floated away gathering giant size as he went .

		Then came Harlequin , dancing almost more beau - tifully than
Pierrot	LOCATION	, and a quiet murder was done in the laurel shadows around the house .

		Pierrot lay dead and Harlequin , the slim and debonair assassin , had donned his vizard : Columbine wept awhile until the lights were turned up , when everybody agreed that the whole per - formance was in the best of taste and vastly well executed .

		These Columbines and Pierrots and
Harlequins	PERSON	are the Olympians of this unreal world .

		They flit in and out the pages of
Mackenzie	PERSON	pious decadent that he is not less insistently than do those elder gods and goddesses dominate the hexameters of Homer .

		The paragraph I have quoted from
The Passionate Elopement	ORGANIZATION	is but one of many in that book consecrate to these imponderable deities ; to the bitter tale of
Jenny Pearl	ORGANIZATION	their antics are a shadowy and ironic commentary ; it is in the dress of a Pier - rette that
Michael	PERSON	is made to find his long-sought Lily ; while the youthful
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	is more than once assigned to that same role , and it is when so costumed that her grave tremolo wins its way to the heart of the boy
Michael	PERSON	that
Michael Fane	PERSON	whom she is fated one day , unrecognized , to love .

		It is fitting that a man 's first book should be his most characteristic ; for the experience of this world is provokingly alike for us all , and with its tedious thread we swathe about our individualities until at the end we are but so many identical cocoons .

		Thus in
The Passionate Elopement	ORGANIZATION	we find many passages where the author lays emphasis upon the unreality of his people and their lives .

		`` Let me tell you that the hearts of the Lovelys are all of a piece and 't is cardboard . ''

		`` To such cardboard emotions was this lady come . ''

		In
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	we come upon the same word , again deftly employed : `` The old gen - tleman forthwith postured with his thin legs like a cardboard antic at the end of a string . ''

		While in Sinister Street `` All my standards are falling to pieces , '' thought
Michael	PERSON	.

		`` Heroes and heroines 478 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	are all turning into cardboard .

		If I do n't make some effort to be true to conviction , I shall turn to card - board with the rest . ''

		In the
Passionate Elopement Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	speaks thus of the Assembly where his hero is to fall in love : The melody to which these marionettes were dancing possessed a strange quality ... Whatever it had of definite character lay in the half bashful invitation to dance , as if some ghostly puppet-master , pale and stately , were beckoning to his performers .

		All this is not likely to lead us to take our author 's characters too seriously , nor to make us weep at true love 's piteous tale ; yet we are satisfied and do not ask for more : we do but sit and wonder how vastly well the whole performance is executed .

		Comp ton
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	is himself a puppet-master and one of consummate art .

		But upon his carefully ordered stage and among his tenuous and punctual marionettes there has strayed one human girl , alive and passionate and tragically real .

		Whence came she ?

		P'rom what fire is she a spark ?

		Dear and ardurous sister of the sun and moon , she burns her way through the murk and fog of
London	LOCATION	.

		How did the astute wire-puller capture her ?

		By what strange quirk of fortune is she obedient to him ?

		It is indeed
Carnival	ORGANIZATION	where such paradoxes walk .

		Her hard and agate-like Cockney idiom cuts and gashes the silken preciosities of
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	, and we do not regret those lustered surfaces , recognizing in her lan - guage the pure gold of life 's own mint .

		She takes this world so gallantly that we are all her lovers .

		But to think of
Jenny Peart	PERSON	as a woman is crudely to fumble her personality ; it is her privilege , when she is most herself , to be without sex , not as the old who are neither man nor woman , but as the child who is both .

		It was foolish of her to wish to have been born a boy , for in her the perfect grace of girlhood was already touched with the fine sufficiency of the male .

		When
Jenny	PERSON	falls in love we somehow feel it as an artistic error , as a violent profanation of her essential being .

		She should have remained a keen and ardent image of youth .

		The mere thought of her loving a man gives us pain : it is to destroy that valiant posture which has been our heart 's undoing .

		If our perhaps too jealous love of this battered heroine makes us regret the advent of any lover at all , then , after we are well rid of
Maurice Avery	PERSON	, what do we feel toward the engulfing Mr.
Z. Trewhella	PERSON	?

		To have this flower of a book , which might otherwise have been wholly cherished by every gentle heart , so brutally dyed with the carmine of a melodramatic close does not encourage speech .

		We shall confine ourselves to pointing out that this ghastly marriage is artistically as unnecessary as it is humanly offensive : plot and tragedy sufficient there were without it .

		Jenny herself could not have grown old , but the increasing disparity between her fragile soul and its accumulating burden of experi - ence was the true tragedy .

		As , one by one , that old bitch ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	, brought forth her sickening progeny ,
Jenny Pearl	PERSON	, like
King Oedipus	LOCATION	, would indeed have become an object of pity and fear .

		The Orient Pal - ace of Varieties might well have framed the last act : under that merciless calcium , her soul at bay , she should have danced on alone .

		Besides the ballet-girl of
Carnival	ORGANIZATION	, there is in
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	's world at least one other real thing , and where
Jenny	PERSON	was only an incident , however poignant and jagged ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	occupies a singularly central position .

		Not only are all the males either just going up or just come down , but the females , too , through either marriage or the Oxford theater or some other feminine wile , invariably achieve con - nection with this great lion of their society .

		Like many other lions , this grave university might seem but ill at ease in so assorted a gathering .

		But , if we look more closely , we perceive that , instead of one , there are at least three Oxfords , and that two of them would have no reason at all to be above hob - nobbing with our novelist , who , on his side , has the good sense to make no move toward buttonholing that other
Oxford	LOCATION	which , medieval and intransigeant and rude , shoulders grimly on through the cluttered and squeaking thoroughfare of our time .

		When a young man matriculates at
Oxford	LOCATION	, it is by no means to sit at the feet of the Middle Age .

		To the sharp contrary , he finds himself jammed head foremost into a monstrous hugger-mugger of games , , talk , drink , lectures , and motor-cycles .

		If he be so sifted a personality as
Michael Fane	PERSON	, books , it is true , and the indirect estheticisms of guarded friend - ship , will gradually emerge to play their less dis - hevelled part .

		Though medieval
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, in a dozen philosophies and prayers , is even yet intractably alive , and though we may , among the intimate austerities of
Merton	LOCATION	, even now track him home to the bleak disclosure of Mob Quad , nevertheless , the undergraduate , however receptive and intelli - gent , goes on his bright way untouched .

		For the
Oxford of Duns Scotus	ORGANIZATION	is preoccupied by other things , and has concern neither for our transitory world nor for those gay fragments of it which so blithely drift between enduring gates .

		The material
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, she of the tattered buildings and the glittering streams , makes the third of this uncouth trinity .

		How strange that all her serious wealth should have been appointed to cup so dry a faith , and how ironic do we feel the endurance of those gates and chimes where their lovers pass so quickly !

		But it is not strange that
Compton Mac	ORGANIZATION	-
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 479 kenzie , himself an Oxford man , should , in the per - son of these imaginary figures , return again and again to the charmed precincts of his own college , there to rest beneath skies heavy with calm and there to meditate upon the tarnished pewter of waters forever stagnant .

		The author of Sinister Street is the master of a style at once grave and fluid , and nowhere else could this nebulous gravity be so appropriate as in describ - ing `` her spires like grey and graceful shapes of mist '' and the `` immaterial domes '' of that `` moist heart of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The atmosphere of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is indeed so viscous as almost to partake of the nature of water ; nay , there are days when one can have the sensation , fancifully at least , of crushing it be - tween one 's fingers .

		If then , to the eye of memory , her buildings waver and are insubstantial , it is only because they amalgamate with that fluidity which is their element .

		In the conveyance of just this wet , embodied atmosphere , and of the grave lights and values with which it is impregnated , consists the genius of
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	.

		When in
Flashers Mead	ORGANIZATION	perhaps the most perfect , if least diverting , of these books he chooses an abode for Guy , the choice is a garden where `` every path had its own melody of running water . ''

		That in this particular volume
Mackenzie	PERSON	does not venture to quit these water - meadows might suggest to the cynic the reason for the tale 's perfection .

		At any rate , we ourselves do find in the golden haze of
Carnival	ORGANIZATION	, in the dusty glamour of Sinister Street , and in the too pervading aqueous chill of
Flashers Mead	ORGANIZATION	, the chief esthetic value of these three most considerable of his books .

		Meantime , it is not merely
Michael Fane	PERSON	who is `` an organic part of this tutelary landscape '' : with the startling exception of
Jenny Pearl	PERSON	, they are all but shifting nuclei , more or less vaguely perceptible , in that circumambient atmosphere ; and , even when they momentarily crystallize , they still remain em - bedded in that spongy matrix of stars and mist .

		In
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	, it is true , we do observe a notable clearing of the atmosphere , but only to dis - close the wires by which are jigged across the scene these agitated marionettes .

		A discerning producer like Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	should not again risk his charges in the lucid air of
North America	LOCATION	.

		But perhaps we need not attribute to this young English - man 's temerity in having ventured among us the shortcomings of his latest book .

		That valuable aura we so greatly miss may well have been brushed aside by those rude hands which , riotously at
Athens	LOCATION	, so saith Pheme , destroyed the original manuscript .

		Having read before of that riotous and violet - crowned city , we can but feel that whatever we have lost of atmosphere has been well made up to us by the thrill of sudden realization we still dabble in the same stream of life wherein once floated the violet - crowned city .

		When indeed we fully grasp the character of this world that our contemporary has for our de - lectation so artfully staged , we recognize how short is the way from
Sylvia Scarlett	PERSON	back to the
Athens	LOCATION	of our history books .

		For it is not only children that Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	forever beholds in the undying .

		sweetness of the past ; on the contrary , such turns out to be his congenital manner of sight : he who , perhaps more richly than any other , is engaged in giving us our own time is thus forced by his inability to relish the gritty truth into serving all his people and his places garnished with the greens of long ago .

		Sylvia and
Athens	LOCATION	and the Oxford of
Michael Fane	PERSON	all subsist together in that region where sentiment holds unconscious dominion , and whence the sour realities of our physical being are finally banished ; and it is precisely because this world , like this child - hood , is not real , but really glamorous , that we read and love him .

		Not for nothing did
Michael	PERSON	find in an old print of
Magdalen Tower	ORGANIZATION	, more than in any real experience or vision , `` the profoundest revela - tion '' of his beloved city ; for the world to which
Compton Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	's forever tends is that of a dear - ly cracked and faded and discolored print .

		We at length perceive how tremendously right we were not to hesitate to probe for a sane estimate of this yet so bewilderingly and centrifugally activating genius : tomorrow we might well have been blind to the sweet fault of our author , and , being human , have gravely mourned the passing of a world which we now only too well know does not exist .

		The old house overlooked such a wide thoroughfare that the view , while it afforded the repose of movement , scarcely ever aroused a petty inquisitiveness into the actions of the passers-by .

		The traffic of the thorough - fare like the ships of the sea went by merely apprehended , but not observed .

		The big bay-window hung over the street like the stern-cabin of a frigate , and as
Michael	PERSON	sat there he had the impression of being cut off from communication , the sense of perpetually leaving life astern .

		Such a room is peculiarly appropriate amid the life of a great university , where , so often that we come scarcely to wonder , even our friends inexplicably drop out of view .

		Yet it is not only at
Oxford	LOCATION	and in the person of
Michael Fane	PERSON	that his creator so regards existence , and we who voyage with him as pilot with him forever look astern .

		As we gaze from out that gilded port , upon our apprehension there obtrudes no object vulgarly real : in the past there is no vulgar and in the past there is no real .

		As we muse upon the ornate litter of a recessive world , that sea haze which is almost poetry absorbs and obliterates all .

		SCOFIELD
THAYER	ORGANIZATION	.

		480 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	A Mirror of the
Middle West	LOCATION	IN o EASTERNER , born forlornly within the sphere of
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, or
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, can pass very far beyond the Alleghanies without feeling that American civilization is here found in the full tide of believing in itself .

		The flat countryside looks more ordered , more farmlike ; the Main Streets that flash by the car-windows somehow look more robust and communal .

		There may be no less litter and scrubbiness ; the clustered houses of the towns may look even more flimsy , undistinguished , well-worn ; but it is a litter of aspiring order , a chaos which the people are insensitive to because they are living in the light of a hopeful future .

		The East has pretty much abandoned itself to the tides of immigration and industrial change which have overwhelmed it : no one really believes that any - thing startling will be done to bring about a new heaven and a new earth .

		But the intelligence of the West seems to live in apocalyptic sociological not socialistic , however dreams .

		Architects and busi - ness men combine half-heartedly to `` save
New York	LOCATION	'' from the horrors of the Jewish clothing - trade invasion , but
Chicago	LOCATION	draws great maps and sketches of a city-planning that shall make it not only habitable but radiant and palatial .

		Hope has not vanished from the
East	LOCATION	, but it has long since ceased to be our daily diet .


Europe	LOCATION	has infected us perhaps with some of its world-weari - ness .

		The East produces more skeptics and spiritual malcontents than the
West	LOCATION	.

		For the
Middle West	LOCATION	seems to have accomplished most of the things , industrial and political , that the
East	LOCATION	has been trying to do , and it has done them better .

		The
Middle West	LOCATION	is the apotheosis of American civilization , and like all successes it is in no mood to be very critical of itself or very examinatory as to the anatomy and physiology of its social being .

		No Easterner with
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	's human and literary experi - ence would write so complacently and cheerfully about his part of the country as Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	writes about
The Valley of Democracy	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Scribner ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- .

		His self-confidence is the very voice of the
Middle West	LOCATION	, telling us what it thinks of itself .

		This , we say as we read , must be the inner candor which goes with the West that we see with our eyes .

		So we like Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's articles not so much for the information they give us as for the attitudes they let slip , the unconscious revelations of what the people he is talking for think important .

		It is not a book of justification , although he would rather anxiously have us take not too seri - ously the political vagaries like Bryanism and Progressivism .

		And he wishes us to miss none of the symphony orchestras and art institutes that evi - dently now begin to grow like grasshoppers on the prairies .

		He treats himself rather as an expositor , and he is explicitly informational , almost as if for a foreign country .

		He sometimes has an amusing air of .

		having hastily read up and investigated Western wonders and significances that have been not only common material in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	magazines , but matter of despairing admiration on the part of those of us who are general improvers of mankind .

		He is naive about the greatness of
Chicago	LOCATION	, the vastness of agricultural production , the ravages of culture among the middle classes .

		He is almost the profes - sional Westerner showing off his prize human stock .

		Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	does well to begin with the folksi - ness of the
West	LOCATION	.

		No one who has experienced that fine open friendliness of the .

		prosperous
Middle Westerner	LOCATION	, that pleasant awareness of the alert and beneficent world we live in , can deny that the Mid - dle West is quite justified in thinking of itself as the real heart of the nation .

		That belief in the ulti - mate good sense , breadth of vision , and devotion to the common good , of the `` folks back home , '' is in itself a guaranty of social stability and of a pros - perity which implies that things will never be any different except as they slowly improve .

		Who can say that we have no Gemutlichkeit in
America	LOCATION	, when he runs up against this warm social mixability which goes so far to compensate for the lack of intellectual nuances and spontaneous artistic sensibilities ?

		Of course the
Middle West	LOCATION	has to pay for its social responsiveness in a failure to create , at least in this day and generation , very vigorous and diverse spiritual types .

		An excessive amiability , a genius for adaptability will , in the end , put a premium on conformity .

		The Westerner sincerely believes that he is more averse to conventionality than the
East	LOCATION	- erner , but the latter does not find him so .

		The heretic seems to have a much harder time of it in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Classes and attitudes that have offended against the `` folks ' '' codes may be actually outlawed .

		When there are acute differences of opinion , as in the war , society splits into bitter and irreconcilable camps , whereas in the East the undesirable have been allowed to shade off towards limbo in gradual de - grees .

		When hatred and malice , too long starved by too much `` niceness , '' do break out from the natural man , they may produce those waves of per - secution and vindictiveness which , coming from a so recently pacifist West , astonished an East that was no less densely saturated with aliens but was more
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 481 conversant with the feeling that it takes all kinds of people to make a world .

		Folksiness evidently has its dark underlining in a tendency to be stampeded , by herd-emotion .

		`` Social conscience '' may become the duty to follow what the mob demands , and de - mocracy may come to mean that the individual feels himself somehow expressed his private tastes and intelligence in whatever the crowd chooses to do .

		I have followed Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	in his speaking of the
Middle West	LOCATION	as if he thought of the region as a unit .

		He does speak as if he did , but he does not really mean it .

		Much as he would like to believe in the substantial equality of the people in
the Valley	LOCATION	of Democracy , he can not help letting us see that it is but one class that he has in mind his own , the prosperous people of the towns .

		He protests against their being scornfully waved aside as bourgeoisie .

		`` They constitute the most interesting and admirable of our social strata . ''

		And he is quite right .

		Cer - tainly this stratum is by far the most admirable of all the middle classes of the world .

		It is true that `` nowhere else have comfort , opportunity , and aspira - tion produced the same combination . ''

		He marvels at the numbers of homes in the cities that can not imaginably be supported on less than five thousand a year .

		And it is these homes , and their slightly more impoverished neighbors , who are for him the `` folks , '' the incarnate
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		The pro- letarian does not exist for him .

		The working - classes are merely so much cement , filling in the bricks of the temple or , better , folks in embryo , potential owners of bungalows on pleasant suburban streets .

		Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's enthusiasm is for the college-girl wife , who raises babies , attends women 's clubs , and is not afraid to dispense with the unattain - able servant .

		It is for the good-natured and public - spirited business man , who goes into politics because politics in the
Middle West	LOCATION	has always been con - cerned with the prosperity of the business com - munity .

		But about the economic foundation of this class Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	sounds as innocent as a babe .

		Take his attitude towards the farmer .

		You gather from these pages that in the
Middle West	LOCATION	the farmer is a somewhat unfortunate anomaly , a shadow on the bright scene .

		Farming is scarcely , even a respectable profession ; `` the great grand - children of the Middle Western pioneers are not easily persuaded that farming is an honorable calling '' !

		He hints darkly at a decay in fiber .

		Only one chapter out of six is given to the farmer , and that is largely occupied with the exertions of state agencies , universities , to lift him out of his ignorance and selfishness .

		The average farmer has few of the admirable qualities of the Valley of -RRB- emocracy .

		He is not `` folksy '' ; he is suspicious , conservative , somewhat embittered , little given to cooperation ; he even needed prodding with his Liberty bonds .

		In Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's pages the farmer becomes a huge problem which lies on the brain and conscience of a
Middle West	LOCATION	that can only act towards him in its best moments like a sort of benevolent -
Charity Organization Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` To the average urban citizen , '' says Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	, `` farming is something remote and uninteresting , car - ried on by men he never meets in regions that he only observes hastily from a speeding automobile or the window of a limited train . ''

		It would take whole volumes to develop the im - plications of that sentence .

		Remember that that urban citizen is Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's
Middle West	LOCATION	, and that the farmer comprises the huge bulk of the population .

		Is this not interesting , the attitude of the prosperous minority of an urban minority a small but significant class which has in its hands all the non-productive business and political power towards the great productive mass of the people ?

		Could class division be revealed in plainer terms ?

		This Middle West of Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's class sees itself as not only innocent of exploitation , but full of all the personal and social virtues besides .

		But does the farmer see this class in this light ?

		And Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	has given us in one of his books an analysis of this society which may explain why : `` The American country town and small city , '' he says , `` is a business community , that is to say it lives for and by business traffic , primarily of a merchandising sort ... Municipal politics is con - ducted as in some sort a public or overt extension of that private or covert organisation of local in - terests that watches over the joint pecuniary benefit of the local businessmen .

		It is a means ... of safe-guarding the local business community against interlopers and against any evasive tactics on the part of the country population that serves as a host ... The country town is a product and exponent of the American land system .

		In its beginning it is located and ` developed ' as an enter - prise of speculation in land values ; that is to say it is a businesslike endeavor to get something for nothing by engrossing as much as may be of the increment of land values due to the increase of population and the settlement and cultivation of the adjacent agricultural area .

		It never -LRB- hitherto -RRB- loses this character of real-estate speculation .

		This class likes to say sometimes that it is `` carrying the farmer . ''

		The Modern Point of View and the New Order IV I FREE INCOME NDUSTRY of the modern sort mechanical , special - ized , standardized , drawn on a large scale is highly productive .

		When this industrial system of tfie new order is not hindered ' by outside considerations it will yield a very large net return of output over cost counting cost in terms of man power and necessary consumption ; so large , indeed , that the cost of what is necessarily consumed in productive work in the way of materials , mechanical appliances , and subsistence of the workmen is inconsiderable by comparison .

		The same thing may be described by saying that the necessary consumption of subsist - ence and industrial plant amounts to but an incon - siderable deduction from the gross output of indus - try at any given time .

		In fact , so inordinately productive is this familiar new order of industry that in ordinary times it is forever in danger of running into excesses and turning out an output in excess of what the market that is to say the busi - ness situation will tolerate ; so that there is com - monly a large volume of man power unemployed and an appreciable proportion of the industrial plant lying idle or half idle .

		It is quite unusual , perhaps - altogether out of the question , to have nearly all the available plant and man power running at full capacity even for a limited time .

		In ordinary times unemployment is chronic , being only a question of more or less .

		It is , of course , impossible to say how large , the net aggregate product over cost would be counting the product in percentage of the necessary cost in case this industrial system were allowed to work at full capacity and with free use of all the available technological knowledge .

		There is no safe ground for an estimate , for such a thing has never been tried , and no near - approach to such a state of things is to be looked for under the existing circumstances of ownership and control .

		Even under ` the most favor - able conditions of brisk times the business situation will not permit it .

		There will at least always be .

		1918 THE DIAL 483 an indefinitely large allowance to be reckoned for work and substance expended on salesmanship , ad - vertising , and competitive management designed to increase sales .

		This line of expenditures is a neces - sary part of businesslike management , although it contributes nothing to the output of goods , and in that sense it is to be counted as a necessary deduction from the net productive capacity of the industrial system as it runs .

		It would also be extremely diffi - cult to make allowance for this deduction , since much of it is not recognized as such by the men in charge and does not appear on their books under any special descriptive heading .

		In one way and another , and for divers and various reasons , the net production of goods serviceable for human use falls considerably short of the gross output , and the gross output is always short of the productive capacity of the available plant and man power .

		Still , taken as it goes , with whatever handicap of these various kinds is to be allowed for , it remains patently true that the net product greatly exceeds the cost .

		So much so that whatever is required for the replacement of the material equipment con - sumed in production , plus `` reasonable returns '' on this equipment , commonly amounts to no more than a fraction of the total output .

		The resulting margin of excess product over cost plus reasonable returns on the material equipment is due to the high produc - tive efficiency of the current state of the industrial arts , and is the source of that free income which gives rise to intangible assets .

		The distinction be - tween tangible assets and intangible is not a hard and fast one , of course , but the difference is suffi - ciently broad and sufficiently well understood for use in the present connection , so long as no pains is taken to confuse these terms with needless technical verbiage .

		To avoid debate and disgression it may be re - marked that `` reasonable returns '' is also here used in the ordinary sense of the expression , without fur - ther definition , as being sufficiently understood and precise enough for the argument .

		The play of motives and transactions by which a rough common measure of reasonable returns has been arrived at is taken for granted .

		A detailed examination of all that matter would involve an extended digres - sion , and nothing would be gained for the argument .

		According to the traditional view , which was handed on from the period before the coming of cor - poration finance , and which still stands over as an article of common belief in the certified economic theories , `` capital '' represents the material equip - ment , valued at its cost , together with funds in hand required as a `` working capital '' to provide materials and a labor force .

		On this view corporation securi - ties are taken to cover ownership of the plant and the needed working capital ; and there has been a slow - dying prejudice against admitting that anything less tangible than these items should properly be included in the corporate capitalization and made a basis on which to issue corporate securities .

		Hence that stubborn popular prejudice against `` watered stock '' which corporation finance had to contend with all through the
latter half of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		`` Watered stock '' is now virtually a forgotten issue .

		Corporation finance has disposed of the quarrel by discontinuing the relevant facts .

		There is still a recognized distinction between tangible assets and intangible ; but it has come to be recognized in cor - poration practice that the only reasonable basis of capitalization for any assets , tangible or intangible , is the earning-capacity which they represent .

		And the amount of capital is a question of capitalization of the available assets .

		So that , if the material equipment , for instance , is duly capitalized on its earning-capacity , any question as to its being `` wa - tered '' is no longer worth pursuing , since stock can be said to be `` watered '' only by comparison with the cost of the assets which it covers , not in relation to its earning-capacity .

		The latter point is taken care of by the stock quotations of the market .

		On the other hand , intangible assets neither have now nor ever have had any other basis than capitalization of earning-capacity , and any question of `` water '' in their case is consequently quite idle .

		Intangible assets will not hold water .

		Corporation finance is one of the outgrowths of the new order .

		And one of the effects wrought by corporation finance is a blurring of the distinction between tangible assets and intangible inasmuch as both are now habitually determined by a capitali - zation of earning-capacity , rather than by their ascertained cost , and it is difficult , if not impossible , to draw a hard and fast line between that part of a concern 's earning-capacity which is properly to be assigned to its plant and that which is due to its control of the market .

		Still , an intelligible distinc - tion is maintained in common usage , between tan - gible assets and intangible , even if the distinction is somewhat uncertain in detail ; and such a distinction is convenient , so long as too sharp a contrast between the two is not insisted on .

		The earning-capacity of the tangible assets i presumed to represent the productive capacity of the plant , considered as a mechanical apparatus for the production of goods or services ; it is presumed to rest on the market value of the mechanical output of the plant .

		The plant is a productive factor be - cause and in so far as it turns to practical account the state of the industrial arts now in use the com - THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	munity 's joint stock of technological knowledge .

		So soon , or so far as the plant and its management falls short of meeting the ordinary requirements of this current state of the industrial arts , and of making use of such technologcial knowledge as is commonly employed , the whole works ceases by that much to be a productive factor .

		The productive efficiency , and the productive value , of any given item of indus - trial equipment is measured by its effective use of the technological knowledge current in the com - munity for the time being .

		So also , the productive value of any given body of natural resources land , raw materials , motive power is strictly dependent on the degree in which it fits into the industrial system as it runs .

		This dependence of productive value on conform - ity to and use of the state of the industrial arts is constantly shown in the case of land and similar natural resources by the fluctuation of rental values .

		Land and other resources will be more valuable the more suitable they are for present and prospective use .

		The like is true for the mechanical equipment , perhaps in a more pronounced degree .

		Industrial plant , for instance , is always liable to depreciation by obsolescence in case the state of the industrial arts changes in such a way that the method of work em - bodied in any particular article of equipment is dis - placed by new and more suitable methods , more suitable under the altered circumstances .

		In such a case , which is of very frequent occurrence under the new order of industry , any given plant , machine , or similar contrivance may lose all its value as a means of production .

		And so also , on the other hand , a given plant , as for instance a given railway system or dock , may acquire additional productive value through changes in the industrial system which make it more suitable for present use .

		Evidently the chief , or at least the indispensable , element of productive efficiency in any item of indus - trial equipment or resources is the use which it makes of the available technological knowledge ; and evidently , too , its earning-capacity as a productive factor depends strictly on the same fact the usu - fruct of the state of the industrial arts .

		And all the while the state of the industrial arts , which the industrial equipment so turns to account for the benefit of its owner , continues to be a joint stock of industrial knowledge and proficiency accumulated , held , exercised , increased , and transmitted by the community at large ; and all the while the owner of the equipment is some person who has contributed no more than his per capita quota to this state of the industrial arts out of which his earnings arise .

		In - deed , the chances are that the owner has contributed less than his per capita quota , if anything , to the common fund of knowledge on the product of which he draws by virtue of his ownership , because he is likely to be fully occupied with other things such things as lucrative business transactions , for instance , or the decent consumption of superfluities .

		And at this point the difference between tangible assets and intangible comes in sight , or at least the ground of the habitual distinction between the two .

		Tangible assets , it appears , are such assets as repre - sent the earning-capacity of any mechanically pro- ductive property ; whereas intangible assets represent assured income which can not be assigned to any specific material factor as its productive source .

		In - tangible assets are the capitalized value of income not otherwise accounted for .

		Such income arises out of business relations rather than out of industry ; it is derived from advantages of salesmanship rather than from productive work ; it represents no contri - bution to the output of goods and services , but only an effectual claim to a share in the `` annual divi - dend '' on grounds which appear to be legally hon - est , but which can not be stated in terms of mechani - cal cause and effect , or of productive efficiency , or even in any terms that involve notions of physical dimensions or mechanical activity .

		When the theoreticians explain and justify these returns that go to adroit salesmanship , or `` manager - ial ability , '' as it is also called , it invariably turns out that the grounds assigned for it are of the nature of figures of speech metaphor or analogy .

		Not that these standard theoretical explanations are to be set aside as faulty , inadequate , or incomplete ; their great volume and sincerity forbid that .

		It is rather that they are to be accepted as a faithful account of an insubstantial fact in insubstantial terms .

		And they are probably as good an account of the equitable distribution of free income as the principles of the modern point of view will tolerate .

		But while intangible assets represent income which accrues out of certain immaterial relations be - tween their owners and the industrial system , and while this income is accordingly not a return for mechanically productive work done , it still remains true , of course , that such income is drawn from the annual product of industry , and that its productive source is therefore the - same as that of the returns on tangible assets .

		The material source of both is the same ; it is only that the basis on which the income is claimed is not the same for both .

		It is not a difference in respect of the ways and means by which they are created , but only in respect of the ways and means by which these two classes of income are intercepted and secured by the beneficiaries to whom they accrue .

		The returns on tangible assets are assumed to be a return for the productive use
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 485 of the plant ; returns on intangible assets are a re - turn for the exercise of certain immaterial relations involved in the ownership and control of industry and trade .

		, Best known by name among intangible assets is the ancient rubric of good-will , technically so called , which has stood over from before the coming of the new order in business enterprise .

		This has long been considered the original type-form of intangible assets as a class .

		By ancient usage the term denotes a customary preferential advantage in trade ; it does not describe a body of benevolent sentiments .

		Good - will has long been known , discussed , and allowed for as a legitimate , ordinary , and valuable imma - terial possession of men engaged in mercantile enter - prise of all kinds .

		It has been held to be a product of exemplary courtesy and fair dealing with custo - mers , due to turning out goods or services of an in - variably sound quality and honest measure , and indeed due to the conspicuous practice of the ordi - nary Christian virtues , but chiefly to common hon - esty .

		Similarly valuable , and of a similarly imma - terial nature , is the possession of a trade secret , a trade-mark , a patent right , a franchise , any statutory monopoly , or a monopoly secured by effectually cor - nering the supply or the market for any given line of goods or services .

		From any one of these a profit - able advantage may be derived , and they have there - fore a market value .

		They afford their possessor a preferential gain , as against his competitors or as against the general body of customers which the state of the industrial arts and the strategic organization of business throws in his way .

		After the analogy of good-will , it has been usual to trace any such spe - cial run of free income to the profitable use of a special advantage in the market , which is then appraised as a valuable means of gain and comes to figure as an asset of its possessor .

		But all this goes to explain how these benefits go to these bene - ficiaries ; it does not account for the fact that there is produced a net output of product available for free distribution to these persons .

		These supernumerary and preferential gains , `` ex - cess profits , '' or whatever words may best describe this class of free income , may be well deserved by these beneficiaries , or they may not .

		The income in question is , in any case , not created by the good deserts of the beneficiaries , however meritorious their conduct may be .

		Honesty may conceivably be the best policy in mercantile pursuits , and it may also greatly serve the convenience of any community in which an honest merchant is found ; yet honest deal - ing , strictly speaking , is an agency of conservation rather than of creation .

		A trade secret may also be profitable to the concern which has the use of it , and the special process which it covers may be espe - cially productive ; but the same article of technologi - cal knowledge would doubtless contribute more to the total productivity of industry if it were shared freely by the industrial community at large .

		Such technological knowledge is an agency of production ; but it is the monopoly of it that is profitable to its possessor as a special source of gain .

		The like applies to patent rights , of course .

		Whereas monopo - lies of the usual kind , which control any given line of industry by charter , conspiracy , or combination of ownership , derive their special gains from their ability to restrain trade , limit the output of goods or services , and so `` maintain prices . ''

		Intangible assets of this familiar kind are very common among the business concerns of the new order , particularly among the larger and more pros - perous of them , and they afford a rough measure of the ability of these concerns profitably to restrict production .

		The very large aggregate value of such assets indicates how imperative it is for the conduct of industrial business under the new order to restrict output within reasonable limits , and at the same time how profitable it is to be able to prevent the exces - sively high productive capacity of modern industry from outrunning the needs of profitable business .

		For the prosperity of business it is necessary to keep the output within reasonable limits ; that is to say , within such limits as will serve to maintain reason - ably profitable prices ; that is to say , such prices as will yield the largest obtainable net return to the concerns engaged in the business .

		In this connec - tion , and under the existing conditions of invest - ment and credit , `` reasonable returns '' means the same thing as `` the largest practicable net returns . ''

		It all foots up to an application of the familiar prin - ciple of `` charging what the traffic will bear '' ; for in the matter of profitable business there is no rea - sonable limit short of the maximum .

		In business the best price is always good enough ; but , so also , noth - ing short of the best price is good enough .

		Buy cheap and sell dear .

		Intangibles of this kind , which represent power to control the rate or volume of output , are alto - gether the most common of immaterial assets , and they make up altogether the largest class of intangi - bles and the most considerable body of immaterial wealth owned .

		Land values are of much the same nature as these corporate assets which represent capitalized restriction of output , in that the land values , too , rest mostly on the owner 's ability to withhold his property from productive use and so drive a profitable bargain .

		Rent is also a case of charging what the traffic will bear ; and rental values should properly be classed with these intan - 486 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	gible assets of the larger corporations , .

		which are due to their effectual control of the rate and volume of production .

		And apart from the rental values gf land , which are also in the nature of monopoly values , it is doubtful if the total material wealth in any of the civilized countries will nearly equal the total amount of this immaterial wealth that is owned by the country 's business men and investors .

		Which evidently comes to much the same as saying that something more than one-half of the net product of the country 's industry goes to those persons in whom law and custom vest a plenary power to hinder production .

		It is doubtful if the total amount of this imma - terial wealth exceeds the total material wealth in the advanced industrial countries , although it is at least highly probable that such is the case , particu - larly in the richer and more enlightened of these countries as , for instance , in
America	LOCATION	or the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, where the principles of self-help and free bargain have consistently had the benefit of a liberal that is a broad construction .

		The evidence in the case is not to be had in such unambiguous shape as to carry positive proof , for the distinction between tangible assets and intangible is not consistently maintained or made a matter of record .

		So , for instance , it is not unusual to find that corporation bonds railroad or industrial which secure their owner a free income and are carried as an overhead charge by the corporation , are at the same time a lien on the corporation 's real property ; which in turn is likely to be of less value than the corpora - tion 's total liabilities .

		Evidently the case is suffi - ciently confusing , considered as a problem in the economic theory of capital , but it offers no particu - lar difficulty when considered as a proposition in corporation finance .

		There is another curious question that will also have to be left as a moot question , in the absence of more specific information than what is yet available more a question of idle curiosity , perhaps , than of substantial consequence .

		How nearly is it likely that the total gains which accrue to these prosperous business concerns and their investors from keeping the output within profitable limits will equal the total loss suffered by the community as a whole from the incidental reduction of the output ?

		Net produc - tion is kept down in order to get a profitable price for the output ; but it is not certain whether the net production has to be lowered by as much or more than the resulting increased gain which this business - like strategy brings to the businesslike strategists .

		The strategic curtailment of net production below productive capacity is net loss of the community as a whole , including both the business men and their customers ; the gains which go to these business con - cerns in this way are net loss to the community as a whole , exclusive of the business concerns and their investors .

		The resulting question is , therefore , not whether the rest of the community loses as much as the business men gain that goes without saying , since the gains of the business men in the case are paid over to them by the rest of the community in the enhanced -LRB- or maintained -RRB- price of the prod - ucts but rather it is a question whether the rest of the community , the common man , loses twice as much as the business concerns and investors gain .

		The whole case has some analogy with the phe - nomena of blackmail , ransom , and similar enter - prises that aim to get something for nothing ; al - though it is carefully to be noted that its - analogy with these illegitimate forms of gainful enterprise must , of course , not be taken to cast any shadow of suspicion on the legitimacy of all this businesslike sabotage that underlies this immaterial corporate capital and its earning-capacity .

		In the case of blackmail , ransom , and such like illegal traffic in ex - tortion , it is known that the net loss suffered by the loser exceeds the net gain which accrues to the bene - ficiary , by as much as the cost of enforcement plus the incidental inconvenience to both parties to the transaction .

		At the same time , the beneficiary 's sub - sequent employment and consumption of his `` ill - gotten gains , '' as they are sometimes called , whether he consumes them in riotous living or in the further pursuit of the same profitable line of traffic all this , it is believed , does not in any degree benefit the rest of the community .

		As seen in the perspective of the common good , such enterprise in extortion is be - lieved to be quite wastefully disserviceable .

		Now , this analogy may be taken for what it is worth ; `` analogies do not run on all-fours . ''

		But when seen in the same perspective , the question of loss and gain involved in the case of these intangible assets and their earning-capacity falls into something like this shape : Does the total net loss suffered by the community at large , exclusive of the owners of these intangibles , exceed two hundred per cent of the returns which go to these owners ?

		or , Do these intangibles cost the community more than twice what they are worth to the owners ?

		the loss to the community being represented by the sum of the overhead burden carried on account of these intangibles plus the necessary curtailment of pro- duction involved in maintaining profitable prices .

		The overhead burden is paid out of the net annual production , after the net annual production has been reduced by so much as may be necessary to `` maintain prices at a reasonably profitable figure . ''

		A few years ago any ordinarily observant person
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 487 would doubtless have answered this question in the negative , probably without hesitation .

		So also ; any ordinarily intelligent votary of the established order , as , for instance , a corporation lawyer , a commercial trade journal , or a trade-union official , would doubt - less , at that period , have talked down such a question out of hand , as being fantastically preposterous .

		That would have been before the war experience be - gan to throw light into the dark places of business enterprise as conducted under the new order of industry .

		Today it is to be admitted with such emotion as may come to hand this question is one which can be entertained quite seriously , in the light of experience .

		In the recent past , as matters have stood up to the outbreak of the war , the ordinary rate of production in the essential industries under businesslike management has habitually and by de - liberate contrivance fallen greatly short of produc - tive capacity .

		This is an article of information which the experience of the war has shifted from the rubric of `` Interesting if True '' to that of `` Com - mon Notoriety . ''

		The question as to how much this `` incapacity by advisement '' has commonly amounted to , may be attempted somewhat after this fashion .

		Today , under compulsion of patriotic devotion , fear , shame , and bitter need , and under the unprecedentedly shrewd surveillance of public officers bent on maxi - mum production , the great essential industries con - trolled by the vested interests may , one with another , be considered to approach perhaps even conceiv - ably to exceed a fifty per cent efficiency , as counted on the basis of what should ordinarily be accom - plished by use of an equally costly equipment having the disposal of an equally large and efficient labor force and equally good natural resources , in case the organization were designed and managed with an eye single to turning out a serviceable product , in - stead of , as usual , being managed with an eye single to private gain in terms of price .

		To the spokesmen of `` business as usual '' this rat - ing of current production under the pressure of war needs may seem extravagantly low ; whereas , to the experts in industrial engineering , who are in the habit of arguing in terms of material cost and me - chanical output , it will seem extravagantly high .

		Publicly , and concessively , the latter speak of a twenty-five per cent efficiency ; in private , and con - fidentially , they appear disposed to say that the rat - ing should be nearer to ten per cent than twenty - five .

		To avoid any appearance of an ungenerous bias , then , present actual production in these essen - tial industries may be placed at something approach - ing fifty per cent of what should be their normal productive capacity in the absence ^ > f a businesslike control looking to `` reasonable profits . ''

		It is neces - sary at this point to call to mind that the state of the industrial arts under the new order is highly productive beyond example .

		This state of the case , that production in the essential industries presumably does not exceed fifty per cent of the normal productive capacity , even when driven under the jealous eye of public officers vested with power to act , is presumably due in great part to the fact that these officers , too , are capable business men ; that their past training and present bent is such as has been given them by long , exacting , and successful experience in the businesslike manage - ment of industry ; that their horizon and perspective in all that concerns industry are limited by the frame cxf mind that is native to the counting-house .

		They , too , have learned how to think of industry and its administration in terms of profit on investment , and , indeed , in no other terms that being as near as their daily work has allowed them to take stock of the ways and means of industry .

		So that they are still guided , in some considerable part , by considera - tions of what is decent , equitable , and prudent in the sight of conservative business men ; and this bias necessarily goes with them in their dealings with those ubiquitous , intricate , and systematic disloca - tions of the industrial system which have been found profitable in the management of industry on a foot - ing of competitive sabotage .

		They still find it rea - sonable to avoid any derangement of those vested interests that live on this margin of intangible assets .

		In so characterizing the situation there is , of course , no inclination to impute blame to these busi - nesslike officials who are patriotically giving their best abilities and endeavors to this work of enforc - ing an .

		increased production in the essential industries and diverting needed labor and materials from the channels of waste ; nor is it intended to cast asper - sions on the good faith or the honorable motives of those grave captains of industry whom the officials find it so difficult to divert from the business man 's straight and narrow path of charging what the traffic will bear .

		`` They are all honorable men . ''

		But like other men they are creatures of habit ; and their habit of mind is the outcome of experience in that class of large and responsible business affairs that lie somewhat remote from the domain of tech - nology , from that field where the mechanistic logic of the industrial arts has something to say .

		It is only that the situation as here spoken of rests on settled usage , and that the usage is such as the busi - nesslike frame of mind is suited to ; at the same time that this businesslike usage , of fixed charges , vested interests , and reasonable profits , does not fully com - port with the free swing of the industrial arts as ' 488 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	they run under the new order of technology .

		Nor is there much chance of getting away from this situ - ation of `` incapacity by advisement , '' even under pressure of patriotic devotion , fear , shame , and need , inasmuch as the effectual public opinion will scarce - ly entrust the conduct of its serious interests to any other than business men and business methods .

		To return to the argument .

		It may be conceded that production in the essential industries , under pressure of the war needs , rises to something like a fifty per cent efficiency .

		At the same time it is presumably well within the mark to say that this current output in these essential industries will amount to something like twice their ordinary out - put in time of peace and business as usual .

		One - half of fifty per cent is twenty-five per cent ; and so one comes in sight of the provisional conclusion that under ordinary conditions of businesslike man - agement the habitual net production is fairly to be rated at one-fourth of the industrial community 's productive capacity presumably under that figure rather than over .

		In the , not unusual , absence of all reflection this crude estimate may seem recklessly hasty ; per - haps it may even be thought scandalously unflatter - ing to our substantial citizens who have the keep - ing of the community 's material welfare ; but a degree of observation and reflection will quickly ease any feeling of annoyance on that score .

		So , for instance , if the account as presented above does not appear to foot up to as much as the conclusion would seem to require , further account may be taken of that side-line of business enterprise that spends work and materials in an effort to increase the work to be done , and to increase the cost per unit of the increased work , all ^ for the benefit of the earnings of the concern for whose profit it is arranged .

		It may be called to mind that there still are half a dozen railway passenger stations in such a town as
Chicago	LOCATION	, specially designed to work at cross purposes and hinder the traffic of competing railway corporations ; that on the basis of this ingeniously contrived retard - ation of traffic there has been erected a highly pros - perous monopoly in the transfer of baggage and passengers , employing a large equipment and labor force , and costing the traveling public some millions of useless outlay yearly , with nothing better to show for it than delay , confusion , wear and tear , casualties and wrangles , twenty-four hours a day ; and that this arrangement is , quite profitably , dupli - cated throughout the country as often and on as large a scale as there are towns in which to install it .

		So again , there is an exemplary weekly periodical of the most widely reputable and most profitable class , with a circulation of more than two million , which habitually carries some sixty to eighty large pages of competitive advertising matter , at a time when the most exacting economy of work and ma - terials is a matter of urgent and acknowledged pub - lic need , with nothing better to show for it than an increased cost of all the goods advertised , most of which are superfluities .

		This , too , is only a typical case , duplicated by the thousand , as nearly as the businesslike management of the magazines and news - papers can achieve the same result .

		These are famil - iar instances of business as usual under the new order of industry .

		They are neither extreme nor extraordinary .

		Indeed the whole business com - munity is run through with enterprise of this kind so thoroughly that this may fairly be said to be the warp of the fabric .

		In effect it is an enterprise in subreption ; but in point of moral sentiment aijid conscious motive it is nothing of the kind .

		All these intricate arrangements for doing those things that we ought not to have done and leaving undone those things that we ought to have done are by no means maliciously intended .

		They are only the ways and means of diverting a sufficient share of the annual product to the benefit of the legitimate beneficiaries .

		But this apparatus and procedure for capturing and dividing this share of the community 's annual dividend is costly one is tempted to say unduly costly .

		It foots up to , perhaps , something like one-half of the work done .

		And yet , as a busi - ness proposition it seems sound enough , inasmuch as the income which it brings to the beneficiaries will presumably foot up to something like one-half of the country 's annual production .

		There is nothing gained by finding fault with any of this businesslike enterprise that is bent on getting something for nothing , at any cost .

		After all , it is safe and sane business , sound and legitimate , and carried on blamelessly within the rules of the game .

		One may also dutifully believe that there is really no harm done , or at least that it might have been worse .

		It is reassuring to note that at least hitherto the burden of this overhead charge of fifty per cent , plus has not broken the back of the industrial community .

		It also serves to bring under a strong light the fact that the state of the industrial arts as it runs under the new order is highly productive , inor - dinately productive .

		And , finally , there should be some gain of serenity in meditating on how singu - larly consistent has been the run of economic law through the ages , and recalling once more the reflec - tion which
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	arrived at some half a century ago , that `` hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day 's toil of any human ^ being . ''

		1918 THE DIAL 489 The People 's Theater 1 ICTURE THREE eminent specialists one American , one English , and one French together in some hushed antechamber beyond which lies
Thalia Mel	ORGANIZATION	- pomene , near to death by reason of her trafficking with lovers , panders , parasites .

		What news , what hope , we ask of them , for she has been our friend in happier days .

		Dr.
George Jean Nathan	PERSON	makes no pretense at being anything but a diagnostician .

		He reports her plight as desperate , but perhaps not be - yond hope .

		Although we suspect him of belonging to her inner circle , he goes away to supper at the Ritz with a smile and a jest directed at the lady 's character and the company she keeps .

		Dr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	declares that she is dead or as good as dead already , and that we are wasting our sympathy and our time .

		Accordingly he hurries away to a certain castle in
Florence	LOCATION	where he has a confinement case the expected birth of an infant of whose paternity we are not left in doubt .

		Dr.
Remain Rolland	PERSON	takes the matter far more seriously .

		Yes , decidedly there is hope , but only if we will throw all of the old medicines out of the window and administer a specific which he has carefully prepared to meet the given case .

		He leaves the bottle in our hands , and tiptoes out .

		It is in some such figure as this that the varying points of view of these three men present themselves to the imagination .

		Let us examine each of them in turn and extract 1 such wisdom as we can .

		The subject is a vital one ; for aside from the joy it brings , the theater , as
Mercier	PERSON	declared , `` is the most po - tent and direct means of strengthening human rea - son and enlightening the whole nation . ''

		The Popular Theater -LRB-
Knopf	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- is a sub - ject which easily lends itself to the note of cynical humor native to the talent of Mr.
George Jean Nathan	PERSON	.

		But why this parade of sheer futility why write a book about anything as bad as all that ?

		Why indeed !

		It is because he is enamored , I am enamored , you , dear reader we , they , he , she all are enamored of the Idea of the Theater .

		It holds us , it thrills us , and Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	most of all .

		Despite his protestations of boredom , his lethal draughts of
Edmond de Goncourt	ORGANIZATION	, and the draft on the back of his neck , we feel sure that each night he would be nowhere but in his allotted seat , hoping against hope for the remembered old or some new rapture which only the theater has the power to arouse .

		Poor flagellant of Broadway !

		he loves his self-inflicted torture and the echo of his own sardonic laughter , which is really a cry of pain .

		Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	does not moralize about the theater ; he has little to say concerning its past , and nothing of its future , but paints an authentic portrait , touched with amiable malice , of what is passing under the spotlights in the general latitude and longi - tude of
Longacre Square	LOCATION	.

		Despite the fact that the book represents only a season 's crop of maga - zine ephemerae it is full of humor , knowledge , and ' good sense ; but the humor is tinctured with acidity , the knowledge highly specialized , and the good sense that of Mr.
Worldly Wiserr	PERSON	in especially when these are contrasted with the gayety , the culture , the spiritual wisdom of Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's occasional commentaries on the popu - lar theater of
Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, from far-dis - tant
Florence	LOCATION	in The Marionette , the little maga - zine that has succeeded The Mask are quite as witty as Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	's , and they are informed with a wisdom to which the latter will never attain so long as he continues to circle about the , white lights of Broadway .

		Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	, in his preface , haz - ards the opinion that into the popular theater is coming an infusion of young blood , of fresh ideas , and a new esthetic which may save it from softening of the brain .

		To Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, on the contrary , these things are in the nature of saline injections to keep alive a little longer a body doomed , if not already dead .

		He abjures every sincere artist who has anything to contribute to withhold the gift , since it will immediately be seized upon by the predatory powers that own and rule the theater , and turned to account in imparting a factitious flush of health to a fatally diseased organism .

		When it is proposed to close the
London	LOCATION	theaters at nine-thirty o'clock as a fuel-saving measure , `` Why not at eight-thirty ? ''

		suggests Mr.
Craig	PERSON	.

		He believes that the theater will have to perish in order to be born , and that all actors should die of the plague .

		.

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	so loves the Idea of the Theater that he has exiled himself in order to discover and develop , far from the pestilential atmosphere of the rialtos , what he conceives to be the Art of the The - ater .

		He claims for the theater an independent esthetic , involving the organization of linear and spatial rhythms , a synthesis of space , sound , move - ment , and light .

		He would restore the theater to its original estate that of a temple for the symbolical representation of mysteries ; and in place of a master of revels he demands , in effect , an artist-priest , `` a man who wants nothing for himslf ... but nothing short of ALL for the theater . ''

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	is clairvoyant in vision , logical in thought ; he has the high courage to follow where his 49 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	vision leads and to realize his thought in action ; his position with relation to the theater of the future is enviable and secure .

		But even if we grant him ideal conditions and the complete realization of his dream , it is doubtful if he would ever succeed in making the public eat out of his hand : in so far as he has tried it he has failed .

		For Mr.
Craig	PERSON	is a fastidious artist , scornful of democracy ; he requires for audience `` a pit of kings '' that is , those sensitive to beauty , like himself .

		A product of that aborted estheticism which raged in
England	LOCATION	at the time when he was born , he was never permitted ar ; ugly plaything by his beautiful mother and beauty - oving father ; thus was he pre - pared for his high destiny , that of developing the Art of the Theater .

		Now beauty is something that the theater of the future can not do without , but neither can it do without poetry , passion , and the stir of life .

		These things Mr.
Craig	PERSON	is incapable of supplying in any form intelligible and acceptable to the mass of humankind .

		For him there is poetry in linrand mass , passion in light and color , and the stir of life in the movement of marionettes ; but such abstractions will never satisfy those simple souls that crave the concrete above all else .

		M. Remain
Rolland	PERSON	seems nearer than Mr.
Craig	PERSON	to a solution of the problem of the popular theater by just so much as he appears to be nearer to the movement of the modern consciousness .

		In The People 's Theater -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- he shows an aware - ness to the changed conditions which , by reason of the rising tide of democracy , must govern the the - ater .

		Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	describes the transitional theater , gives us a snapshot of an edifice at the moment of its collapse ; Mr.
Craig	PERSON	has always in mind the ulti - mate theater , when men shall have become as gods or little children ; while
M. Rolland	PERSON	concerns him - self with what he conceives to be the needs of the theater of tomorrow of triumphant democracy : The People 's Theater is the key to a new art world , which art has hardly caught sight of .

		We have reached a parting of the ways , beyond which lies an almost total - ly unexplored land .

		Two or three more venturesome spirits have gone ahead .

		But the instinct of the people should have guided these artists .

		The people speak fraakly , and their preferences leave no possible room for doubt .

		But what artist cares in the least what the public wants ?

		They consider it contemptible not to feel contempt for the people .

		And by the people he does not mean the bourgeoisie , but the workers the long denied .

		Everything that Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	has to say about the popular theater and the psychology of its audiences is doubtless true , but it is of the bourgeois theater that he is speaking ; for that , and our feeble attempts at an esthetic the - ater , are the only ones we have to show .

		Doubt - less the cinema might be considered in the light of a people 's theater , were it a theater in the true sense and not an animated storybook .

		The circus , melo - drama , and burlesque are the nearest things we have to a people 's theater , and they are far more worthy of serious consideration than the entertainments upon the discussion of which Mr.
Nathan	PERSON	wastes his wit and good print paper .

		The circus is universal in its appeal , and in more skilful and intelligent hands might be made a thing of beauty and wonder without abating anything o ' f its popular appeal .

		The great Greek dramas and the Shakespearean plays are in the last analysis melodramas pure and simple .

		As
M. Rolland	PERSON	says , `` there is no form so difficult and so sublime as great poetic medodrama . ''

		Burlesque , in the form of the revue , could be made into a criticism of life , doing more effectively and more amusingly what the newspaper cartoons now do .

		But according to
M. Rolland	PERSON	, the people 's theater will be different from all these more beautiful , noble , and impressive while at the same time re - taining and sublimating the elements that give them popularity .

		So far as melodrama is in question , these elements he agrees with
M. Georges Jubin	PERSON	in believing to be `` Mingling of pleasing and painful emotions , True realism , Simple morality , and Get - ting one 's money 's worth . ''

		He lays great stress on the possible value of a developed form of historical drama ; he sees possibilities in the rustic drama , and in popular legends and tales .

		He is opposed to the portrayal of unrelieved misery before the people , as in
Hauptmann	LOCATION	's The Weavers and
Tolstoi	PERSON	's The Powers of Darkness such pieces should be reserved for the rich and idle , to whom they might do some good .

		Joy , energy , and intelligence he declares to be the fundamental requisites of the people 's theater .


M. Rolland	PERSON	's program , it will be seen , savors a little of `` assimilating the public taste in order to re - produce it . ''

		His idea is to synthesize and sublimate those elements in the theater of the past and of the present that survive , the severe test he puts them to .

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	disdains such caution and such com - promise for him the new theater must be really new .

		In spite of
M. Rolland	ORGANIZATION	's scholarly analysis , in spite of his brilliant deductions from known premises , I can not conquer a certain skepticism .

		The reason for this is plain when the translator 's preface is referred to : these essays were written some fifteen years ago .

		This makes them as unre - liable as an old map of
Europe	LOCATION	will be after the peace conference .

		Doubtless
M. Rolland	PERSON	knew , or thought he knew , what the people wanted then , and what would be good for them ; but does he know , does anyone know , what they want now ?

		The men who by millions have gone forth to battle , looking death and devastation in the face ; the women
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 49 who by millions have salted their scant food with tears have not dramas been enacted before their eyes and experienced in their secret hearts that will render intolerable everything that any save such as they themselves may be able to formulate for their solace or their delight ?

		A mystery surrounds these souls into which we can not penetrate .

		I remember sitting one night
last winter	DATE	or rather , early one morning at a table among a com - pany of friends in
New York	LOCATION	's most sumptuous and beautiful pleasure garden , watching the kaleidoscopic progress of the
Midnight Follies	ORGANIZATION	, staged by
Joseph Urban	ORGANIZATION	and presented by the cleverest entertainers that ` big salaries could bribe .

		Food , wine , tobacco , grace , beauty , wit , laughter made an intoxicating brew .

		Everyone seemed in an ecstasy of happiness , when suddenly - I noticed standing behind a near-by table and looking fixedly at the stage an American officer of aviation , with the double wings on his breast .

		He was young , hardly more than a boy ; beautiful as
Dionysus	LOCATION	, graceful as a faun ; but the look in his eyes belonged neither to the present , nor to any past the world has witnessed : it was fixed and far the look of vigil .

		The soul of him was in some other dimension of space .

		I have never been able to forget this youthful figure , nor the expression of those eyes .

		So now , when people talk or write about the theater , and `` what the public wants '' I conjure up his image , and I wonder what he wanted then or may be wanting now .

		Then I know that all their talk is idle : that only the future can know the future 's needs .

		CLAUDE
BRAGPON	PERSON	.

		Destinies and Dynasties A BOOK of the hour that is also a book for the fu - ture is a book of assured fortune , and such is
Roger Bigelow Merriman	PERSON	's Rise of the Spanish Empire -LRB- 2 vols. ,
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 7.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		It falls in an hour of the keen revival of interest in things Hispanic , when schools , endowments , merchants , and statesmen are all , in their varied capacities , endeavoring to bring the colonial Spains of
America	LOCATION	within the range of North American sympathies ; and it contributes to this movement , as its publishers announce , an `` indis - pensable background for the study of Spanish Amer - ica . ''

		It also falls in an hour when the attention of the whole world is drawn by a terrible fascination to the problem of imperialism and of the ambition of na - tions and `` races to rule their fellow races and nations ; and it affords a study in example of '' the rise of empire an empire second to none in geographical pretension or in grandiosity of motive , and , though now fated and fallen , related by dynastic ties to the powers whose vainglory is recorded in daily blood .

		These , two interests alone assure the book 's wide reading .

		Its qualities merit this .

		Not , let it be understood , that we have here the qualities of literary greatness .

		The author is far too modest to claim for himself -LRB- what his pub - lishers advertise -RRB- the character of another
Prescott	PERSON	.

		Professor
Merriman	PERSON	writes without imagination almost painfully so and with no obtrusion of phi - losophy .

		His virtues are the pedagogic virtues of comprehensible organization , of clear and straight - forward expression , of conscientious scholarship ; one 's sense of the outline is never lost by absorp - tion in the situation ; there are no precipitations out of time into a past reality .

		If it may be so put , here is linear history which is history made with no rest in the transverse complexities of a single hour and event which is history in the making .

		This is of course a damage ; all the vivification of facts is demanded of the reader , who must , if he follow the author , retrace his course several times in order to obtain a comprehensive notion of the face of affairs in a single epoch .

		For the sake of clarity , which is achieved , Professor
Merriman	PERSON	has analyzed Span - ish history into a cluster of episodic developments , each , followed through before returning to its neigh - bor ; but the method has necessarily sacrificed that illusion of contemporaneity which makes the imagi - native charm and , indeed , the literary greatness of histories .

		But its matter is the book , and there is interest enough in the plain narrative of facts .

		As your true historian must , Professor
Merriman	PERSON	has conceived his subject as a story , with a proper beginning and middle and end , and with a guiding theme , a plot properly motivated .

		The beginning of the story is the career of the legendary
Pelayo	PERSON	, who early in the eighth century gathered a handful of Visi - gothic Christians to withstand the
Saracens	LOCATION	, and laid the foundations of the Christian state of Astur - ias ; the end -LRB- to be reached when volumes III and IV of the work are published -RRB- comes with the unity of the Iberian peninsula under
Philip II	PERSON	, with
Spain	LOCATION	the first state of
Europe	LOCATION	, and her empire the vastest the world had seen .

		The plot is the continu - ity of the effort of the Iberian peoples to clear their home of the Moslem and to carry their conquests into
Africa	LOCATION	and beyond the seas ; of a struggle for freedom and a struggle for empire ; of the Recon - 492 THE DIAL Noyember 30 quest and of the Conquests .

		And the motive of this plot counterplotted less by the resistance of those who suffer conquest , for the most part easily , than by the separatist instincts of the Spanish peoples and the meddlesome follies of dynasts is , interestingly enough , the imperialistic destinies of the race , its restless demand for expansion , for a place in the sun , for lordship among men .

		With such material and such a theme , who can deny the interest ?

		In the two volumes before us Professor
Merriman	PERSON	carries his story to the end of the reign of
Ferdi	LOCATION	- nand , the Reconquest completed ,
America	LOCATION	discov - ered , and the die cast for the Hapsburg connections of the Spanish throne .

		Through the long-drawn medieval moils
Spain	LOCATION	found herself , more by fum - bling than by conscious policy .

		The Castilians , shut off east and west by the Catalonians and
Lusitan	PERSON	- ians , north by the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	, and south by the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	, were compressed mainly by their own isolation .

		The men of
Aragon	LOCATION	, and more particularly of Cata - lonia , turned energetically seaward toward the islands and coasts of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, the foot of
Italy	LOCATION	, and the
Levant	PERSON	.

		The happy and chance union of Ferdinand and
Isabella	PERSON	united the two groups , as it were in one day throwing a hitherto * obscure province into the strategic center of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean affairs and -LRB- thanks to
Columbus	LOCATION	-RRB- giving it the hegemony of new seas and continents .

		There are , indeed , few changes of fortune in history more obviously adventitious than the series of almost bizarre accidents which in a generation created the greatness of ,
Spain	LOCATION	.

		From the new powers thrust upon her .

		came her unrivalled glories ; but with these powers came responsibilities which , little understood and less prepared for , were to prove her tragedy .

		Curiously 4 the chance element , obvious as it is , is obscured in Professor
Merriman	PERSON	's narrative by his prepossession with the notion of destiny .

		Not only is
Spain	LOCATION	fated to have empire but , even if blindly , she wills empire ; from the medieval time onward this is the unity of her history as he sees it ; and it is the motive which unites in one movement the struggle for freedom and the struggle for foreign dominion .

		Further , despite his perfunctory refer - ences to democratic ideals , the historian is clearly imperialistic ; his sympathies are with the expansion .

		Almost reasonlessly so , the reader is tempted to think , for neither in picture nor in theory is this Spanish will-to-rule once made clear .

		We are shown motives enough for the conquests that are made the love of freedom , first and most noble ; the Crusader 's zeal , Christian against Moslem ; com - mercial afnbitions , thirst for plunder , arrogance of kings , outlaw adventure ; but the imperialistic des - tiny , supposed to animate all these through the long course of centuries this remains to the end as mystical a thing as is
Germany	LOCATION	's expansionist Drang today .

		To be sure , statesmanlike monarchs looked to the unification of the Iberian states , and ambitious mon - archs aspired to foreign dominions ; here were mo - tives , conscious and intelligible , able to employ to their own ends both the worthier and the meaner impulses of commoner men .

		But in Spanish history as Professor
Merriman	PERSON	conceives and portrays it , the destinies of the people are as often defeated as realized by the deeds of the dynasts .

		Able monarchs create wide realms and then divide them , for future quarrels , among their children ; royal marriages are made for the sake of political alliances which are never realized or pass ephemerally .

		The dynasts themselves , endeavoring to mold destiny , are but its toys , or if their deeds bear action it is to their own mischief .

		The career of
Ferdinand	ORGANIZATION	and
Isabella	LOCATION	, to which a volume is deservedly given , is at once the crux and illustration of Spanish history .

		A marriage carried through every adventurous difficulty at last unites thfe two most powerful Iberian states , and creates a
Spain	LOCATION	.

		But the offspring of that marriage , in spite of the careful schemes of the parents , brings a Hapsburg ruler to the Spanish Empire and a per - version of all that destiny had seemed to decree .

		Cer - tainly the outcome of the career of the Catholic kings illustrates one truth before all that , grant - ing with Professor
Merriman	PERSON	that a people has destinies , never should these be trusted to the shift - ing fortunes which beset dynasties ; that way lies destruction .

		It is Professor
Merriman	PERSON	's own con - clusion that `` it was the bitterest irony of fate that at the very moment when
Spain	LOCATION	's national unity had been attained , her national independence should have been lost . ''

		Incidentally , this conclusion seems to point to a distinction between
Reconquest and Conquest	ORGANIZATION	which is too sharp to be missed .

		For `` national independence '' is quite another thing than is empire , and it is national independence which , through empire , the Spanish people failed to retain .

		If there are national destinies , as there are national aspirations , let them be never linked with the petty affairs of kings .

		It is well in a day such as ours to contemplate the courses of history in the glass of eternity and the past is one with the eternal in its changelessness .

		No reader can turn from The Rise of the
Spanish Empire	ORGANIZATION	without thanks to its author for the reflection it stimulates ; within which foremost will stand the clear fact that , whether to make or to mar , men 's conduct is the key to their fates , human destinies are human responsibilities .

BURR ALEXANDER	ORGANIZATION	.


1918	DATE
THE DIAL 493 League of Free Nations Association	ORGANIZATION	STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES J.HE OBJECT of this Society is to promote a more general realization `` and support by the public of the conditions indispensable to the success , at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	and thereafter , of American aims and policy as outlined by President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		The particular aims , such as the liberation of Bel - gium ,
Serbia	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	, and
Bohemia	LOCATION	, and their future protection from aggression , and
America	LOCATION	's own fu - ture security on land and sea , are dependent upon , ' the realization of the more general aim of a sounder future international order , the corner-stone of which must be a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purposes of such a League are to achieve for all peoples , great and small : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Security : the due protection of national exist - ence .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Equality of economic opportunity .

		Both these purposes demand for their accomplish - ment profound changes in the spirit and principles of the older international statecraft .

		The underly - ing assumption heretofore has been that a nation 's security and prosperity rest chiefly upon its own strength and resources .

		Such an assumption has been used to justify statesmen in attempting , on the '' ground of the supreme need for national security , to increase their own nation 's power and resources by insistence upon strategic frontiers , territory with raw material , outlets to the sea , even though that course does violence to the security and pros - perity of others .

		Under any system in which ade - quate defense rests upon individual preponderance of power , the security of one must involve the inse - curity of another , and must inevitably give rise to covert or overt competitions for power and territory dangerous to peace and destructive to justice .

		Under such a system of competitive as opposed to cooperative nationalism the smaller nationalities can never be really secure .

		Obviously Belgians ,
Jugo	LOCATION	- slavs .

		Poles , Czechoslovaks Will not be secure if they have to depend upon their own individual , unaided strength .

		International commitments of some kind there must be .

		The - price of secure nationality is some degree of internationalism .

		The fundamental principle underlying the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is that the security and rights of each member shall rest upon the strength of the whole League , pledged to uphold by their combined power international arrangements ensuring fair treatment for all .

		The first concern of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is to find out what those arrangements should be , what rules of international life will ensure justice to all , how far the old international law or practice must be modified to secure that end .

		It is to the interest of the entire world that every nation should attain its maximum economic development , provided it does not prevent a similar development of other nations .

		The realization of this aim depends upon a gradually increasing freedom of mutual exchange with its re - sulting economic interdependence .

		It is certain , for instance , that if anything approaching equality of economic opportunity as between great and small , powerful and weak , is to be obtained , the following must be guaranteed for all on equal terms : -LRB- a -RRB- No state shall accord to one neighbor privileges not accorded to others this principle to apply to the purchase of raw material as well as to access to markets .

		Equality of economic opportunity does not mean the abolition of all tariffs or the abolition of the right of self-governing states to determine whether Free Trade or Protection is to their best interests .

		-LRB- b -RRB- States exercising authority in non-self-govern - ing territories shall not exercise that power as a means of securing a privileged economic position for their own nationals ; economic opportunity in such territories shall be open to all peoples on equal terms , the peoples of nations possessing no such territories being in the same position eco - nomically as those that possess great subject em - pires .

		Investments and concessions in backward countries should be placed under international con - trol .

		-LRB- c -RRB- Goods and persons of the citizens of all states should be transported on equal terms on interna - tional rivers , canals , straits , or railroads .

		-LRB- d -RRB- Landlocked states must be guaranteed access to the sea on equal terms both by equality of treat - ment on communications running through other states , and by the use of seaports .

		The first task is legislative in its nature .

		The problem is to modify the conditions that lead to war .

		It will be quite inadequate to establish courts of arbi - tration or of law if they have to arbitrate or judge on the basis of the old laws and practices .

		These have proved insufficient .

		It is obvious that any plan ensuring national secur - ity and equality of economic opportunity will involve a limitation of national sovereignty .

		It is here par - ticularly that the success of the
League	ORGANIZATION	will demand the doing of the `` unprecedented things '' mentioned by President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		States possessing ports that are the natural outlet of a hinterland occupied by another people will perhaps regard it is an intoler - able invasion of their independence if their sov - ereignty over those ports is not absolute but limited by the obligation to permit of their use by a foreign and possibly rival people on equal terms .

		States 494 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	possessing territories in
Africa	LOCATION	or
Asia	LOCATION	inhabited by populations in a backward state of development , have generally heretofore looked for privileged and prefer - ential treatment of their own industry and commerce in those territories .

		Great interests will be chal - lenged , some sacrifice of national pride demanded , and the hostility of political factions in some coun - tries will be aroused .

		Yet if , after the war , states are to be sb it out from the sea ; if rapidly expanding population find them - selves excluded from raw materials indispensable to their prosperity ; if the privileges and preferences enjoyed by states with overseas territories place the less powerful states at a disadvantage , we shall have reestablished potent motives for that competition for political power which , in the past , has been so large an element in the causation of war and the sub - jugation of weaker peoples .

		The ideal of the se - curity of all nations and `` equality of opportunity '' will have failed of Realization .

		Both President
Wilson	PERSON	and
Lord Grey	ORGANIZATION	have in - sisted that the creation of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	must be an integral part of the settlement itself .

		Both have indeed declared that if it is not established at that settlement , it is never likely to be .

		The reason is obvious .

		If .

		the
League	ORGANIZATION	is not a political reality at the > time that the territorial read - justments come to be discussed ; if , as in the past , nations must look for their future security chiefly to their own strength and resources , then inevitably , in the name of the ` needs of national defense , there will be claims for strategic frontiers and territories with raw material which do violence to the principle of nationality .

		Afterwards those who suffer from such violations would be opposed to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	because it would consecrate the injustice of which they would be the victims .

		A refusal to trust to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, and a demand for `` material '' guarantees for future safety , will set up that very ferment which will afterwards be appealed to as proof that the
League	ORGANIZATION	could not succeed because men did not trust it .

		A bold `` Act of Political Faith '' in the
League	ORGANIZATION	will justify itself by making the League a success ; but , equally , lack of faith will justify itself by ruining the League .

		Just as the general acceptance of the principles of the League must precede the territorial settlement , so must it precede attempts to reduce armaments .

		The League should not be , in the first stage , a pro- posal to relinquish arms , but to combine them ; it should be an agreement upon the methods by which they can be used in common for common security .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is not an alternative to the use of force , but the organization of force to the end that it may be effective for our common pro- tection .

		If nations can be brought to realize that they can in truth look to the League as the main guaranty of political security and economic opportunity , that those things do not demand unwilling provinces as sources of man power or raw material , nor seaports as a condition of economic development , then one of the main obstacles to the liberation of subject nationalities will have been removed , and the solu - tion of the specific problems of
Poland	LOCATION	,
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	,
Jugoslavia	LOCATION	, and the self-deter - mination of the peoples of
Turkey	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, will have been enormously facilitated .

		The administrative machinery of a workable internationalism already exists in rudimentary form .

		The international bodies that have already been established by the Allied belligerents who now number over a score to deal with their combined military resources , shipping and transport , food , raw materials , and finance , have been accorded immense powers .

		Many of these activities particularly those relating to the international control of raw material and shipping wilhhave to be continued during the very considerable period of demobiliza - tion and reconstruction which will follow the war .

		Problems of demobilization and civil re-employment particularly will demand the efficient representation of Labor and Liberal elements of the various states .

		With international commissions , and exercising the same control over the economic resources of the world , an international government with powerful sanction will in fact exist .

		The international machinery will need democrati - zation as well as progressive differentiation of function .

		If the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is not to develop into an immense bureaucratic union of governments instead of a democratic union of peoples , the ele - ments of -LRB- a -RRB- complete publicity and -LRB- b -RRB- effective popular representation must be insisted upon .

		The first of these is implicit in the principle , so empha - sized by President
Wilson	PERSON	, that in the future there must be an end to secret diplomacy .

		The second can only be met by some representation of the peoples in a body with legislative powers over international affairs which must include minority elements as distinct from the governments of the constituent states of the League .

		It is the principle which has found expression in the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	as con - trasted with the Federated States of the German Empire .

		If the Government of the
United States	LOCATION	consisted merely of the representatives of forty-eight states , the
Union	ORGANIZATION	could never have been maintained on a democratic basis .

		Happily it consists also of the representatives of a hundred million people .

		The new international government must make the same provision and deliberately aim to see that all the great parties and groups in the various states obtain representation .

		The assurance of the political , civil , religious , and cultural rights of minorities within states is an even more difficult problem .

		But genuinely demo - cratic parliamentary institutions in the League , en - suring some expression of minority opinion as well as complete publicity , will be a strong deterrent if not a complete assurance against tyrannical treat - ment of minorities within its constituent states .

		THE DIAL 495 Indispensable to the success of American policy are at least the following : A universal association of nations based upon the principle that the security of each shall rest upon the strength of the whole , pledged to uphold interna - tional arrangements giving equality of political right and economic opportunity , the association to be based upon a constitution democratic in character , possess - ing a central council or parliament as truly repre - sentative as possible of all the political parties in the constituent nations , open to any nation , and only such nation , whose government is responsible to the people .

		The formation of such an association should be an integral part of the settlement itself and its territorial problems , and not distinct therefrom .

		It should prohibit the formation of minor leagues or special covenants , or special economic combinations , boycotts , or exclusions .

		Differences between mem - bers should be submitted to its judicial bodies .

		Its administrative machinery should be built up from the inter-allied bodies already in existence , expanded into international bodies differentiated in function and democratized in constitution .

		The effective sanction of the association should not be alone the combined military power of the whole used as an instrument of repression , but such use of the world - wide control of economic resources as would make it more advantageous for a state to become and remain a member of the association and to cooperate with it , than to challenge it .

		All the principles above outlined are merely an extension of the principles that have been woven into the fabric of our own national life .

		In search of freedom , our forefathers turned their faces to the West , set out across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and laid the foundations of an American common - wealth .

		Even in the free spaces of the New World they could not attain independence , , unity , and democracy , in such measure as we now possess them , without struggle .

		It has remained for our genera - tion , with these things not wholly achieved , to turn our faces toward the East and set out overseas across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to aid the peoples from whom we sprang to achieve those things in the midst of the more rigid social fabric of the Old World , and against the forces of despotism , autocracy , imperial - ism , privilege , and militarism , which found their supreme embodiment in the Prussian scheme of world dominion .

		In war and in settlement we stand for the prin - ciples which have shot through each of the great epochs of American struggle .

		In our War of the Revolution , in which we '' ourselves struck for inde - pendence and nationality , we established tradition which prompts us to stand for the freedom and self-determination of the weaker peoples ; for restora - tion and reparation for
Belgium	LOCATION	and
Serbia	LOCATION	; a united and independent
Poland	LOCATION	; justice to the peoples of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	; recognition of the Czechoslovaks and the
Jugoslavs	LOCATION	; the freedom of the Russian Revolution to achieve its own destiny .

		And in our championship , through the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, of the lesser American states , we supported this funda - mental principle in one hemisphere which we now urge as a basis for both .

		In our Civil War , in which we determined whether in the New World a nation conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal , might endure , we liberated a race which we had oppressed , and made the union of free states secure .

		So now we stand for the greatest measure of autonomy , and for absolute freedom of religion , of civil liberty , of cultural de - velopment of the weaker peoples within the stronger nations , and of the native peoples of the undeveloped regions of the earth .

		And out of our civil travail through which was confirmed our union of free states , which with un - fortified boundaries and unantagonistic development stretches from ocean to ocean , we stand for the de - velopment of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	which shall bring the free peoples of the earth into a new fellowship , which shall settle their disputes by conciliation and adjudication , which shall put the economic power and armed force of the whole against the violators of justice and the disturbers of peace , and which shall be open to all nations who subscribe to its principles and by a full democratic scheme of govern - ment make themselves eligible to such an alliance of free peoples .

		So it is that President ,
Wilson	PERSON	was in line with the great currents of American tradition when he characterized this as a war `` to make the world safe for democracy . ''

		In our Declaration of Independence , our Consti - tution , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, and the Emancipation Proclamation , the
New World	LOCATION	has offered docu - ments which have contributed to the organized freedom of mankind , and in President
Wilson	PERSON	's state papers we have the elements of a new charter .

		At a time when deep-seated forces of reaction would hamper a democratic solution , and assert the old schemes of competitive militarism , of economic wars after the war , of division and bitterness and unhealed sores , such as will breed further wars and rob this one of its great culmination , we call on all liberal - minded men to stand behind the principles which the President has enunciated , and we invite them to join in fellowship with us for their realization .

		The
League of Free Nations Association	ORGANIZATION	hopes that the foregoing manifesto will appeal to all liberal-minded
Ameri	PERSON	- cans , irrespective of any political affiliations , and that it will receive their support .

		It presents in con - crete form the objects for which we have waged the war .

		These objects can be realized only by an American public opinion - vigorously supporting President
Wilson	PERSON	's advocacy of them at the peace table . -RSB-

		THE DIAL CLARENCE BRITTEN GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DBWEY In Charge of the Reconstruction Program
THORSTEIN VEBLBIi HAROLD STEARNS SCOFIELD THAYER HELEN MAROT IECHNICALLY	PERSON	, WE ARE STILL AT WAR .

		AND THE first sentence of the Espionage Act is : `` Whoever , when the
United States	LOCATION	is at war , shall , '' and so on .

		Now there is small expediency in cherishing illusions , and the chances of the law 's being repealed before the peace treaty itself is signed are , we all know , practi - cally nil .

		But can we hope that although the law will not be officially repealed its further exercise , now that the abnormal urgencies of war which it was devised to meet have come to an end , will be un - officially curtailed ?

		Can we now look forward to something like normal conditions of freedom of speech and opinion ?

		Will radicals and dissenters now be permitted to have their say , or must we expect more orgies of suppression ?

		Are we to be allowed to discuss freely the problems of the peace treaty in the spirit of the first of President
Wilson	PERSON	's fourteen points `` open covenants of peace , openly arrived at '' or is the past year 's autocratic control over opinion , patiently endured because of the im - mediacy of the German menace , to be continued ?

		Now that the military justification for the Espionage Act has disappeared , is its exercise to be carried on under the justification of preventing the anarchical opinions and examples of a large section of
Central Europe	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	from filtering in to this , as yet , sound and contentedly `` bourgeois '' republic ?

		Is the smoke barrage of `` Bolshevism '' now to be used to hide the actual suppression of honest differences of opinion and honest opposition to certain policies the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	may be pursuing ?

		We do not ask these questions lightly .

		The most momentous de - cisions in history are now being made , and the group of interests which wish these decisions to be made behind the backs of the peoples who will be affected by them is omnipotent .

		In all countries , although to a lesser degree than in the
United States	LOCATION	, the more or less chance government in control has possession of all the means of communication between peoples .

		In all countries there is an official propaganda which represents the desires of a small , interested group .

		Every sovereign country jealously guards its right to issue passports and to refuse admittance or to wel - come foreign visitors , and naturally passports are issued to those in agreement with the particular government 's views and those foreign visitors are welcomed who come to praise rather than to criticize .

		In a word , there has been established in fact , under the pressure of war , a world-wide censorship and control over the expression of opinion which can make the peace conference a mockery .

		If the peace conference is to write any treaty that will endure , or if it is to create any workable and realistic
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, conflicting interests and desires and aspirations must have due representation .

		Not only the majority opinion of all countries -LRB- and in many cases we do not even know if the so-called `` majority '' opinion is not in fact the opinion of a minority which has captured the agencies of publicity -RRB- must be rep - resented , but the minority opinion as well .

		Take a single instance
Russia	LOCATION	.

		We are about to make a de - cision of first-rate importance for the future of the world : whether we do or do not intend to recognize a government whose economic and industrial and social structure is radically dissimilar from our own .

		Is this decision to be made , as so many other decisions of this war have been made , by an autocratic clique in control of practically all organs of public opinion ?

		Or is it to be made after free and frank discussion in all the countries , where those who disagree as well as those who agree with the present policy are to have full opportunity for expressing their views ?

		Frankly , we dp not believe it will be possible to prevent freedom of discussion in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		In the latter country the forthcoming general election will give the opponents of the
Lloyd George	PERSON	policies an opportunity to have their full say .

		In both
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	the radical and opposition press has preserved a fairly wide margin of freedom of discussion and criticism even in wartime , and now that the armistice has been signed the chances are that this radical and opposition press will become even more bold and explicit .


Europe	LOCATION	, in brief , seems safe for democracy of discussion .

		But if we are optimistic about
Europe	LOCATION	, we must confess that we are pessimistic about
America	LOCATION	.

		The possibilities of the formation of any strong liberal public opinion in favor of a real
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	are slight .

		In - deed , it is symbolical of our present state of public opinion toward the issues of peace that President
Wilson	PERSON	has elected to attend the preliminary con - ferences in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		After all , the tragedy of this war is that his strongest support for the announced liberal purposes for which
America	LOCATION	entered the war comes not from his own country but from the peoples of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, who have acquired the humility of wisdom through four years of pain and disillusion .

		THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	lET IF WE CAN NOT SPEEDILY EXPECT A RELAXA - tion of the present rigorous control over American public opinion , the least we can hope for is that some leniency be now shown to those political prisoners who have been sentenced to the ferocious lengths of from ten to thirty years for having fallen foul of the Espionage and the
Selective Service	ORGANIZATION	Acts .

		The very first act of the new German Government was to grant political amnesty , and a similar generosity toward our own offenders would now be a popular act on the part of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neutral papers already comment with irony and not a little ill will at our sentencing inoffensive people like Mrs.
Stokes	PERSON	to ten years in prison for a few unimportant remarks , while the old
Prussian Government	ORGANIZATION	dared ot sentence Karl Liebknecht to more than four years , even for the crime of high treason .

		We are glad to observe that in the demobilization order `` conscientious objectors not yet under arrest '' come second on the list , although we must admit we are not certain as to just what this means .

		But would it not have been fairer to have freed precisely those conscientious objectors who are under arrest those , in a word , who have not hesitated to suffer for their convictions and beliefs and who , by just that token , are sincere ?

		When the war is over and the enemy aliens who actually plotted against us are released from internment camps , shall those whose only crime was a difference of opinion still be serving long terms in our civil or military prisons ?

		The irony of that would hardly be lost on other nations .

		As a simple matter of international good will we can not treat our heretics in our present fashion .

		We can not afford to acquire the reputation for intolerance and bigotry which other nations , under the sufferings of war , ` have learned to despise .

		And what is that treatment we accord our heretics ?

		The following extract from a letter from a conscientious objector now in the
Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks	ORGANIZATION	is more eloquent than any special pleading : In the `` hole , '' a dungeon in the sub-basement , the men are fed only bread and water , and are handcuffed to their cell doors for nine or more hours a day .

		During the first week they stand with their hands crossed at their breasts , during the second week they hang by their wrists .

		The `` screws '' -LRB- sentries -RRB- are brutal .

		I have gone down with food from the mess hall several times to observe tkem .

		The air reeks with curses , and foul drule .

		I have at heard these fellows suggest anything nearer a human reaction than a bestial laugh at some lewd tale .

		It fol - lows that these men handle the prisoners with little gen - tleness .

		`` X '' has been beaten periodically .

		I saw him dragged by the collar , choking , across the rough floor of tke corridors and the barber shop into the bath .

		One sentry knocked him down upon the cement floor , another uHiiressed him with suck brutality that he screamed with pain , and three of them forced him into the shower and scrubbed him with coarse soap .

		The Russians from
Riley	PERSON	came out of confinement yes - terday , wan and staggering .

		They have gone to work .

		Bth are religious objectors .

		Some of the Russians now in confinement have gone through the worst experiences in Jail which the worst Czars had to offer .

		They say that there they were permitted to cook their own food ` and were let alone .

		They swear that their life there was easy in comparison to this .

		Fellows who came from
Camp Sherman	LOCATION
last week	DATE	de - clined to don the prison garb .

		-LSB- On account of a religious scruple against wearing buttons , presumably because they are from slaughtered animals .

		Editor 's Note . -RSB-

		Two of them persisted .

		They were beaten into submission and the clothes were forced on them .

		For a time one of them wore his bundle around his neck , refusing to touch it , but he , too , was forcibly dressed .

		It is said that a Cap - tain witnessed the original beating and that he turned his back and walked off without interceding .

		The sentries to whom he left the job dragged the boys to the bathroom and treated them to `` X 's '' experience , scrubbing the flesh of one of them with the ubiquitous galvanic soap and a coarse scrubbing brush .

		The water was so cold that the rest of us spent scarcely three minutes under it and re - treated .

		Yet these conscientious objectors were held under it for nearly fifteen minutes .

		Corporal `` Y '' is being tried for beating up two Russians Holy Jumpers from
Texas	LOCATION	for their refusal to salute and work .

		He administered one of his pummelings in the office of the executive officer who himself had to stop the struggle , but he is being tried because his specific act was not authorized .

		The `` hole '' treatment is known by everyone in all its details and is accepted by the authorities .

		.

		Now that the armistice is signed and demobilization has actually commenced , what can be said in defense of the continuance of this kind of vindictive persecu - tion ?

		We are only laying up for ourselves a fund of hatred , which must some day spend itself in violence .


Germany	LOCATION	is beaten ; shall we celebrate our just tri - umph by adopting our enemies ' worst methods of petty persecution ?

		To ask this kind of question is not pleasant , but the truth is that anyone who sincerely cares about the good name of
America	LOCATION	must ask it .

		The whole world is observing us , and observ - ing us critically , in this question of amnesty to political prisoners .

		The whole world knows of the
Mooney	PERSON	case .

		The whole world knows of the sen - tences passed upon a few erratic and foolish-mouthed Bolsheviki in
New York	LOCATION	recently .

		If
Mooney	PERSON	is hanged , or if these political prisoners are not released when the treaty is signed , it will be a black mark against us for many a long year to come .

		IF IT IS TRUE , AS THE PUBLISHERS TELL US that the sales of Russian literature have greatly fallen off since the Revolution , we have another sad instance of how much fashion accounts for what we so often ascribe to a rise or an excellence in public taste .

		Just as most of us judge people on almost every ground except their intrinsic personal quality , so we judge books from almost every point of view except the literary one .

		The uppermost fact about
Russia	LOCATION	in the public mind at the present time is that the Russians have betrayed the Alliance and have fallen to murdering each other .

		How can books that are Russian retain their congenial savor ?

		Fur - ther , in that corruption and gloom which we felt in ` those intense modern stories , was there not the germ of present horror and madness which our censored newspapers convey so monotonously to our eyes ?

		Away with every Russian page , lest the spirit of these neurotic men infect us with their own
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 499 personal and political poisons !

		So Doestoevsky has to suffer , presumably for the sins of Trotzky , and
Tolstoi	PERSON	remains unread as our protest against the executions in
Petrograd	LOCATION	.

		Gorky would perhaps be one of the first to suffer our literary ostracism .

		Yet it would be little short of an atrocity for that marve - lous autobiography of his to be renounced , or for the succeeding volumes to be discouraged from coming out in this country .

		Chekhov still seems to appear , for two volumes of stories are announced for fall publication .

		Perhaps the publisher has put his hand to the plough , and so can not turn back .

		Or perhaps it is that our taste relents towards a writer who is so completely the literary artist and is not tainted anywhere with politics or `` views . ''

		To replace this Russian lapse , what country will assume the fashion ?

		Will it be
Denmark	LOCATION	or
Spain	LOCATION	?

		Ibanez ' translations suggest a beginning for the lat - ter country , and
Nexo	ORGANIZATION	and
Jacobsen	PERSON	have made us want much more from
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		This change in literary fashion will mean the opening up of new treasures .

		The publishers ' efforts to exploit new and harmless literary territories may bring to those of us who regard books as literature consolation for the passing of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		IHE REHABILITATION OF OUR WOUNDED AND Dis - abled soldiers has thrown a glare of light on one of the most tragic human wastes of our normal peace - time industrial methods .

		If it is possible to restore to a position of useful activity the man who has lost an arm or a leg on the battlefield , the question at once emerges , why is it not possible to restore to a valuable place in the community life the man who has lost an arm or a leg in the workshop or the con - struction camp ?

		The
Federal Board for Vocational Training	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	, in its work for the soldiers , has naturally been led to think of the future ap - plicability of this work to civilians .

		As long as a surplus labor supply exists as the margin of poor economic adjustment between production and de - mand for goods , it is almost inevitable that the in - jured workman will be cast aside , or at best given the not wholly satisfying benefits of a Workman 's Compensation Act not wholly satisfying , that is , because in the long run the average human being prefers earning his livelihood to being supported .

		But under the pressure of war necessity for high pro- duction and the shortage of labor consequent upon the draft , even a man with a major disability is worth an attempt at industrial salvage .

		It is hoped that the reconstruction period will see no let-down in the present demand for every ounce of our indus - trial and productive strength .

		If this hope material - izes , the civilian worker may confidently look for - ward to gaining one fortunate by-product from the war .

		The experience and knowledge acquired by the work of vocational educators for disabled soldiers will be increasingly put at the disposal of civilian employers and increasingly utilized by them .

		Under the bitter conditions of too many `` normal '' peace - time eras even the able-bodied and intelligent worker discovered that there was literally no place for him in the industrial scheme .

		Under present and , we hope , future conditions even the injured have their useful places .

		OBVIOUSLY THE NOVEL SHOULD BE JUST AS short or just as long as is necessary to tell its story and give a convincing sense of the fulness of life .

		In the last issue our
London	LOCATION	correspondent complained that the English novel is becoming too sketchy , that novelists have been terrorized into an absurd fear of boring us , with the result that the theme is not suffi - ciently substantiated , and consequently does not per - suade .

		But does not the novelist 's persuasiveness de - pend on his manner , on his vitality of imagination , quite as much as upon his `` saturation '' ?

		Surely he must have a vital imagination if in the words of Mr.
H. B. Fuller	PERSON	's letter on another page he is to `` surround and master '' his chosen material instead of being surrounded by the universe in the hope of get - ting `` saturated . ''

		The brilliant and pointed novelist can be quite as convincing as the saturated one .

		But it is clear that he must be briefer .

		Nothing is more boring than brilliance in too great a quantity .

		The third-rate novelists who `` throw enormous wads of language '' at their large-stomached public are wise enough to compensate with a complete vacuous - ness of content .

		As Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has become length - ier , his style has become looser and less pertinent , altogether lazier .

		You can read 600 pages of him with pleasure , because he is constantly taking longer to say less .


Arnold Bennett	PERSON	has always known the value of the run-on style , and has worked out the happiest proportions of length and content .

		But no one would want
Rebecca West	PERSON	or
Dorothy Rich	PERSON	- ardson or
James Joyce	PERSON	in much larger doses .

		Their highly charged imaginations , their originality of emphasis , their precision of phrase and modeling produce all the artistic impression they want in small compass .

		Ulysses is revealing a Joyce who already needs to be curtailed .

		The suppression of
The Rainbow	ORGANIZATION	saved
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	from the re - proach of a vast surfeit of novelistic richness .

		In On The Stairs Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	succeeded at the brevity he has long preached , though it may be an arguable question whether that novel improves on the terse histories of Lines Long and
Short	PERSON	.

		What happens to a novelist when he tries to increase his subtlety , his brilliance , and his length all at the same time is shown in
Henry James	PERSON	.

		Brevity is a tribute to in - telligence , and must be judged by its fruits .

		I HE DIAL FOR
NOVEMBER 16	DATE	INCLUDED A COM - munication from Mr.
H. L. Gantt	PERSON	entitled Idle - mindedness and Reconstruction , in which the word `` idle-mindedness '' was a misunderstanding of the manuscript .

		It should have read `` idleness , '' both in the title and in the text .

		500 THE DIAL
November 30	DATE	Foreign Comment A CURIOUS CHOICE
Edgar Sisson	PERSON	, who was instrumental in having published in this country the famous `` Sisson Docu - ments , '' which purported to show the financial help given by the German militarists to the Russian
Bol	PERSON	- sheviki , is to head the official press mission which is to accompany the
American Peace Delegation	ORGANIZATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		We call the choice curious , for inasmuch as it has been the French radical and Socialist press which has been President
Wilson	PERSON	's most consistent supporter as has also been the case in other Allied countries it was to have been expected that the man chosen for head of the press mission would be one who could at least command the confidence of that press .

		Mr.
Sisson	PERSON	does not command it .

		For in - stance ,
Le Populaire	LOCATION	, which has consistently fought for President
Wilson	PERSON	's policies against the Clerical and reactionary press , does not believe in the authen - ticity of the documents for which Mr.
Sisson	PERSON	stands sponsor .

		Will it be likely now to have confidence in him ?

		Under the title
False Documents	ORGANIZATION	,
Fabri	PERSON	- cated in
America Against the Bolsheviks	LOCATION	, Le Popu - laire of
October 11	DATE	quotes a telegram from the Italian Avanti :
The Nouvelles de Russie	ORGANIZATION	contains today the amusing story of the documents which Mr.
Sisson	PERSON	bought in
Russia	LOCATION	, and which were published at
Washington	LOCATION	, with the object of proving that the Bolshevists were in league with the Germans .

		Last
March	DATE	,
Colonel Robins	PERSON	, representative of the
American Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	in
Russia	LOCATION	, warned
Radek	PERSON	, repre - sentative of the
Commissary of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	in
Petro	LOCATION	- 1 grad , that Mr.
Sisson	PERSON	had bought from the counter - revolutionaries , for the price of a hundred thousand roubles , certain documents that gave
Colonel Robins	PERSON	the impression that they came from a lunatic asylum .


Robins	PERSON	told the same story to
Arthur Rensen	PERSON	-LSB-
Ransome	PERSON	? -RSB-

		, cor - respondent of
The Daily News	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some days after ,
Robins	PERSON	related jestingly that
Sisson	PERSON	had , at a dead loss , paid a hundred thousand roubles for what he could now get for a penny , these documents being published at the current date by the
Petit Parisien	PERSON	.

		Again in
March	DATE	, the informer ,
Sisson	PERSON	, telegraphed these documents to President
Wilson	PERSON	; but , up till then , nobody had dared to publish them .

		They now thought the political situation opportune for their publication .

		The Nouvelles de Russie concludes by de - claring that the person who published the documents is evidently speculating on the impossibility , for the reader , of verifying their authenticity .

		As soon as we receive these documents from
Moscow	LOCATION	, we shall show by concrete examples that Mr.
Sisson	PERSON	is a base imposter .

		We are convinced that
Colonel Robins	PERSON	will consider it his duty as a gentleman to confirm our assertion .

		The German press , which might naturally be ex - pected to deny the authenticity of the documents , is more amused than angry at Mr.
Sisson	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Inciden	ORGANIZATION	- tally , the
Committee of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	appointed by Mr.
Creel	PERSON	to examine into the authenticity of the docu - ments can not stomach the two important German notes in the collection .

		It says in its guarded official way : `` We do not think them to be , in their present shape , documents on whose entire text historians or publicists can safely rely as genuine . '' -RRB-

		Under date of
September 30	DATE	the
Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeit	ORGANIZATION	- ung says of them : Out of the same manufactory of forged documents the latest efforts of Entente propaganda have obviously ema - nated .

		But in spite of the unfortunate experiences con - nected with the earlier revelations , not enough has been learnt for the production of really misleading and plausi - ble bits of work .

		Documents , circulars , decrees are found , which people with even the most superficial knowledge of German affairs would at once perceive had been forged by an amateur ... In
America	LOCATION	, where amongst wide circles of people there is absolutely no knowledge of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean affairs , and where anything can be offered to the public at large , perhaps `` revelations '' of this kind may be believed to be genuine .

		It is less intelligible for us that European peoples can allow such nonsense to be put be - fore them ... Perhaps all the documents form part of thl material the publication of which as `` discovered documents '' was to have taken place after the overthrow of the Soviet Government , as is shown by the disclosures connected with the subversive intrigues of the English diplomat ,
Lockhart	PERSON	, and his colleagues .

		Lockhart 's enter - prise failed ; but it would have nevertheless been a pity if the industry devoted to the manufacture of the docu - ments had been in vain !

		... However , we venture to hope that the author of these archives will have attained greater skill before his next forgeries , for our barbarism does not prevent us from feeling sincere sym - pathy with him in his exposure as a laughing-stock .

		Communications SHOULD POETS STARVE ?

		SIR : A charming patroness of poetry , herself a poetess of charm , complains of the wages of poets wages which at present , she says , force them to `` face the grim alternative of starving or getting an en - grossing and art destroying job . ''

		And she suggests `` cases of poignant suffering caused by this condition suffering which , far from enriching the poet 's art , tends to stifle it altogether . ''

		The lady knows vastly more about poets and poetry than I. Nevertheless I can vouch for the accuracy of her information as to the wages of poets , for I have received my two , or five , or
eight dollars	MONEY	for verses : save the mark !

		an editor once sent me a check for
seventy-five cents	MONEY	.

		Truly , the laborer who keenly appreciates that he is worthy of his hire will do well to stick to potatoes , or coal , or `` best sellers , '' or some other staple for which the com - mercial demand is more vigorous than for the soul of beauty embodied in enduring verse .

		My purpose is not to question the fact , but to ask whether the complaint arising from it is pertinent .

		Will poetry itself be advanced if we provide for a race of sleek and purring poets ?

		Shall we perhaps do better to let our poets starve ?

		... compel them , for instance , before they are admitted to true poethood , to undergo the pangs of virtuous hunger and to look upon the wolf when his teeth are sharp ?

		Far be it from me to venture a dogmatic yes !

		or no !


Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, literature 's efficiency expert , in a well-read passage says :
1918	DATE	THE DIAL When he -LSB- the author -RSB- lays down the pen he ought to become a merchant , for the mere reason that he has an article to sell , and the more skilfully he sells it the better will be the result , not only for the public appreciation of his message , but for himself as a private individual and as an artist with further activities in front of him .

		But
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, grimly caustic as always , reminds us of the Spanish proverb honray provecho no caben en un saco in support of his thesis that every author degenerates as soon as he begins to put pen to paper in any way for the sake of gain .

		The best works of the greatest men all come from the time when they had to write for nothing or for very little .

		Yet Shakespeare somehow managed to wax well-to - do through the poetry of imperishable drama .

		Is the question of the poet 's material reward really vital ?

		Is the poet whose thoughts and verses are worthy to survive , cognizant in the fine frenzy of composition of his coal bin , whether it be empty ; or of his belly , whether it be full ?

		Can hardship , any more than prosperity , stifle or stimulate genius ?

		Lord
Byron	PERSON	never knew the meaning of want .

		Meredith scarcely knew the lack of it .

		Would the quality of either man 's work have been essentially different if he had been differently circumstanced ?

		The lady whom I have quoted has herself done much to keep us in mind of Whitman 's line `` To have great poets there must be great audiences too '' an economic , or if you please , psychological fact , which the potato merchant may paraphrase with his `` To have great potato merchants there must be great potato eaters too . ''

		If we have great audiences , is it unlikely that our poets shall have great rewards ?

		And in the mean - time , are we likely to find ourselves the gainers by creating artificial , uneconomic stimuli ?

		... by seating our poets in easy chairs and saying , as it were : `` Go to !

		we have provided that you shall have your lunch and dinner and breakfast without fail , and your cigarettes and carriage when you want them : do you make yourself comfortable and straightway write immortal verse ! ''

		NEIL M ' CLARK '' AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT Hon.
Joseph P. Tumulty	PERSON	, Secretary to the President ,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. DEAR SIR :
May	DATE	I ask you to call to the Presi - dent 's attention the following suggestion as a method of meeting after war conditions ?

		.

		That an
International Reserve Bank	ORGANIZATION	be incor - porated along the lines of our
Federal Reserve Bank	ORGANIZATION	, the bank to be controlled by the nations joining the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bank to have power to issue notes : said notes to be guaranteed jointly and severally by the governments controlling the bank .

		The bank 's operation to be confined solely to busi - ness of an international character and its notes to bear the same relation to the governments interested in the bank as our
Federal Reserve	ORGANIZATION	notes bear to our government , and to be issued against endorsed obligations of any government in the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The offering of this suggestion is due to the fact that it is the writer 's belief that the establishment of such a bank would immediately secure one of the inestimable advantages to be derived from a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	; and with such harmony existing in the ideas of Premier
Lloyd George	PERSON	and our President as to a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, it would seem that such a bank could be immediately incorporated by the governments of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Among some of the benefits suggested to be de - rived from the establishment of such a bank are : prevention of immediate deflation , disposition of international obligations , release of banking facilities for use in the commercial world , the creation of an international currency .

		The writer is in business and business has been immediately adversely affected by the cessation of hostilities .

		THE LENGTH OF THE NOVEL SIR : Mr.
Shanks	PERSON	' letter about the novel seems to be rather British .

		One gets the old Anglo-Saxon restiveness under form and proportion , the old Anglo-Saxon resentment over a disciplined work of art .

		Of course there are other considerations .

		.

		It may be that there still exists , after all , more leisure , more capacity for retirement into the void , than we realize .

		And it may well be that when a man pays his six shillings or more for a novel , he wants his full measure of words .

		Of course it is fine and necessary to `` rationalize and substantiate '' the `` high moments '' by `` setting them against a detailed back - ground '' ; yet selection and compression should play their part .

		The novelist may often ask , properly enough , not , `` How much can I put in ? ''

		but , `` How much can I leave out ? ''

		The question really becomes , in general , this : Shall one plunge into the jungle or the ocean , sur - rounding himself by a vast and vague environment ; or shall one select a detached bit of the universe and himself surround and master it ?

		The French mind , product of a long , well-lighted civility , usually chooses the latter course ; the English mind , more recently emerged from the dusky woods , still prefers the former .

		I regard Turgenev as the novelists ' criterion a man whose work is without peculiarities or excesses , and who brings abundanf ` material from the fresh and fruitful wilds of the North to fabricate it calmly under the time-tried exacting canons of long established and classically disciplined art-prac - tice in

		By
Joseph C. Lincoln	PERSON	.

		Apple - To borrow a rural and somewhat agrarian figure , here is a great deal of shuck but mighty little nub - bin .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	has committed himself to the belief that wherever two or three old men are gath - ered together in a spirit of garrulousness , there is a novel .

		And having struck a profitable vein in the depicting of gentle , talkative Cape Cod folk , he seems to have settled down with no apparent desire to vary the ingredients .

		Reading Shavings you get the same impression that you do in those homes where the practice of laying straw beneath the car - pet still prevails : you are continually aware of the padding .

		More than that , you are continually con - scious of the mechanism of mellowness .

		Mr.
Lin	PERSON	- coln 's old men strive for their thin humorous sallies with the unquenchable determination of college wits who have a reputation to maintain .

		They meander and chuckle and spin philosophy and emit figures of speech not so much for the purposes of the novel as for the purposes of the novelist .

		The puppet - strings are poorly concealed .

		Shavings may be un - hesitatingly commended only to those who enjoy a sustained , wholesome , and altogether conscious drawl .

		THE EYES OF
ASIA	LOCATION	.

		By
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		To say that a book has
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's name on its title page is to say that it is well written .

		No time need be spent on discussions of style ; all that is required is a brief statement of its subject matter .

		The Eyes of
Asia	LOCATION	is Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's latest develop - ment of the vein which he first touched in his cock - sure youth , when he wrote In Black and White , and to which he has subsequently returned once or twice with deeper insight , notably with In the Presence the vein , that is , of the Indian tale , not told ob - jectively or from the white man 's point of view , but through the eyes of the natives themselves .

		It is as if
Mahbub Ali	ORGANIZATION	had told the story of Kim .

		In the Presence was a Sikh soldier 's account of King Ed - ward 's funeral ; this latest little volume shows us the present war as seen by Indian soldiers who have served in
France	LOCATION	.

		A crippled
Rajput	ORGANIZATION	, decorated for heroism in action , writes to a friend his impressions of the English and the war ; an
Amritsar Sikh dic	ORGANIZATION	- tates -LRB- with delightful side remarks to the Sahib who acts as his amanuensis -RRB- a letter to his farmer brother , telling of the French people and their methods of agriculture ; an Afghan family beyond the
Border	ORGANIZATION	receives a letter from the eldest son , mingling impressions of
France	LOCATION	with minute advice as to the conduct of a blood feud ; and a homesick Mussulman of the
Punjab	LOCATION	writes to his mother of what he has learned about the value of sanitation , and of how his observation of the French has con - vinced him of the importance of educating women .

		Through all their accounts of other things , the war echoes like the throb of distant drums .

		For quiet effectiveness nothing in
Kipling	LOCATION	's earlier work excels the incident of the Indian soldiers who took the rosary of a French child , blown to pieces by a shell as she tended her grandfather 's cow , and exacted one German life for each bead .

		Pathos and humor mingle as naturally as the Book of Judges mingles savagery and sublimity ; everywhere are shrewd flashes of description and characterization .

		THE TITLE : A Play .

		By
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		Dor an ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	gives the impression of being able to go on a lark with more tenacity and purposeful - ness than any other contemporary writer .

		He is relentless in his versatility and successful .

		Most writers have to be told to abide their particular genre , but what can be done with an author who is equally popular with a serious trilogy , a light novel , philosophy , political speculation -LRB- although , we be - lieve , The
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	reproached him here for abandoning his proper metier -RRB- , a travel book , and plays ?

		It is not exactly a case of preference either .

		When Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	does shake off the Bal - zacian mud of the Five Towns , he does it so de - terminedly and whole-heartedly that he fairly wins the right to soar with wings , if he chooses .

		Yet he does not so much choose a literary form as assimi - late it .

		And if in The Title the wings are a bit fragile , and if what should have been a capital high comedy turns out to be only a capital high farce , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	himself never makes the mistake of confusing his mood or shifting his tempo .

		He warns the players in his introductory note : `` This comedy has to be played lightly throughout , in the comic spirit . ''

		This has a rather solemn ring to it , and on the whole it is a little grandiose , for if literary distinctions have any meaning at all The Title must be called a farce and not a comedy .

		We have implied that it should have been the latter , and the author himself is to blame for this reproach .

		There are some very fetching and jolly characters in the play , and we wish that they did n't have to be ex - ploited by so ingenious and amusing a fable .

		In other words , .

		if Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	were not so devilishly clever in devising his plot , he might spend more time on some of his characters .

		But from the salable point of view and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is shrewd in such things the plot is too good to lose .

		It is the story of Mr.
Culver	PERSON	's vain attempt to refuse a title in the nobility , offered by a grateful English Government .

		Mrs.
Culver	PERSON	is all for accepting it ; his boy just down from school swears that his father 's accepting the title will ' ruin his political future ; his daughter is a bantering opportunist .

		Altogether poor Mr.
Culver	PERSON	has a rather bad time of it , much to the audience 's delight -LRB- The Title is being played in THE DIAL 53 THE HISTORY OF HENRY FIELDING By

		CANTERBURY PILGRIMS AND TJIEIR WAYS .

		By
Francis Watt	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		The title of this rather pretentious book is mis - leading : one expects to find in it a more or less com - prehensive account of the customs , habits , and cir - cumstances surrounding the medieval pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint
Thomas a Becket	PERSON	, last Catholic martyr of
England	LOCATION	.

		There are , to be sure , chapters which acquaint the reader with some of these cus - toms , and scattered here and there are curious facts which help to illumine the
England of Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first four chapters are devoted to an account of the brilliant and stubborn prelate whose assassina - tion at
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	by certain hot-blooded-favorites of Henry II gave the Catholic Church an oppor - tunity to prolong its fast-loosening hold in
England	LOCATION	.

		People who are fond of taking history in small and leisurely doses will enjoy this part of the book , as they will also the chapters on
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, on
Canter	PERSON	- bury and the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most of the volume how - ever is given over to retracing , with an exactitude that is frequently tiresome , the various roads and towns favored of old by those who made of
Canter	PERSON	- bury an English Mecca .

		The author knows his subject thoroughly : every stick and stone , shrine and well is noted , its history told with unction and relish .

		But it is the kind of knowledge that sits best in the brain of a scholarly guide who might be conducting a party in person through the region : in a book most of whose readers have never been and can never hope to be within thousands of miles of Can - terbury this knowledge is not only confusing , it is positively distressing ; nor does the absence of maps improve the text .


Francis Watt	PERSON	is an accomplished antiquarian at least an accomplished virtuoso ; but in this volume he is more a pedant than a humanist , despite his earnest attempts to be the latter ex - clusively .

		Six RED MONTHS IN
RUSSIA	LOCATION	.

		By
Louise Bryant	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		If
Miss Bryant	PERSON	is a journalist who wears her heart on her sleeve , and if her book , Six Red Months in
Russia	LOCATION	, is a somewhat sketchy and not too well written volume , it has the virtues of its defects a youthful eagerness and zest and a boundless faith in the Revolution .

		The author is honestly and frankly a pleader for the Bolsheviki , whom she re - gards as composing the one political party in
Russia	LOCATION	which has the support of the great mass of the Rus - sian people .

		This partisanship , fortunately , does not mitigate her reporter 's gift for accurate observation , and her book is exceedingly valuable as a straight record of fact .

		When one surveys the amount of mean-spirited and lopsided special pleading that has been brought forward against the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	in the guise of `` objective '' books ,
Miss Bryant	PERSON	's vol - ume , even had it no intrinsic merits -LRB- and it most certainly has -RRB- , would come as a healthy and much needed corrective .

		The almost naive enthusiasm and freshness of her approach is a welcome contrast to the conventional kind of muddy vituperation .

		After all , the first essential for understanding a situation , as for beginning an argument , is to be fair to one 's opponent .

		If Miss
Bryant	PERSON	stands up so straight in being fair to the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	that she slightly leans over backward , her volume as a whole has a more honest and downright quality than has any recent book on her subject .

		She lived through the weeks before , during , and after the Bolsheviki uprising against the Kerensky regime lived through , that is , literally , and not by clinging timorously to the
American Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	and Em - bassy .

		She risked her life ; she interviewed the organizers and leaders personally ; she was on the `` inside '' of every movement ; she saw from the eyes of the people themselves .

		Here her original ro - mantic sympathy enabled her to see the facts as a more cold-blooded observer could never have suc - ceeding in doing .

		For the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	uprising was essentially a great proletarian adventure , and only those who do not inwardly shudder when they come into intimate contact with grimy realities , only those who can see the bloom of genuine aspiration beneath the dirt of violence and confusion are adequately equipped to interpret , or even fairly to observe , a new kind of mass and social overturn .

		`` The most impartial of reporters can not , when all is said and done , escape the bias of their own temperament : the point of importance here is that
Miss Bryant	PERSON	's bias is in the right direction .

		THE
OREGON	LOCATION	MISSIONS .

		By
James W. Bash	PERSON	- ford .

		Abingdon Press ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This is a carefully written history of the winning of the
Oregon Country	ORGANIZATION	; its author seeks to chronicle the just share of this romantic venture falling to each protagonist in those far off `` 54-40 or Fight '' days .

		It is a subject many historians have treated with opinions so diverse as to amount to recrimina - tions .

		Most are coming to agree that in the early , warped perspective altogether too much significance was attached to Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	's romantic ride .

		Bishop
Bashford	PERSON	finds that many historians have underestimated , and in some cases depreciated , the work of the Methodist pioneer ,
Jason Lee	PERSON	.

		Says his preface : It is due to Methodism that one of her greatest heroes should be reclaimed from the unfair estimate in which
Bancroft	ORGANIZATION	's portrayal leaves him and placed before the world in his true proportions .

		Hence the motivus scribendi to aureate Lee .

		It is greatly to the credit of the Bishop that he does not do so at the expense of others , except that he allows
Whitman	PERSON	's fading ghost about fifty per cent meed , for which he has ample historical support .

		When we have apotheosized a Methodist , a Baptist , or any other `` ist '' in these days when we are trying to think of men as citizens instead of as denomina - tional appanages , we have still to face the fact that
Jason Lee	PERSON	used bad judgment and alienated himself from those early settlers who should have recognized his greatness of personality and followed his leader - ship .

Edward E. Hale , Jr.	PERSON	, 2 vols .

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		The life is swallowed up by the letters in The Life and Letters of
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	.

		In the case of an outwardly uneventful and inwardly not highly eventful life like
Hale	PERSON	's , it is surely best to separate the journals , letters , and so on from the run - ning narrative and commentary .

		If the letters are not separated , at least they should be carefully win - nowed ; but Professor
Hale	PERSON	piously errs on the side of inclusion .

		When biographers learn measure , then indeed shall the world be a queer place .

		Neverthe - less after infinite labor
Hale	PERSON	's personality and achievement do manage to loom through the ham - pering mists .

		In the end we see him clearly as an engaging combination of the individualist and the socially minded feeler and thinker .

		Deeply interested in his ancestry , he must have felt that he was quite unlike the folk he dealt with most of the time , de - spite his spiritual kinship with all men .

		Schools he disliked , as a boy , because they imposed upon the ' individual , and he was educated at home , in the
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	fashion .

		Later , when preparing for the ministry , he insisted again on private study .

		On the other hand he developed early a social interpretation of the function of the Church not in his day so com - mon as now ; and he became , as survivors of his gen - eration very well remember , a public figure , active in manifold public affairs in
Boston	LOCATION	and the nation , rather than a parochially-minded pastor .

		The
South Church	ORGANIZATION	offered in those days an excellent oppor - tunity for a churchman of his views .

		At bottom he was a gentle , great-hearted , wise minister , whose parish extended to the general public .

		He was not fundamentally a writer , despite the fact that he be - gan to publish at the age of fifteen and kept on pub - lishing abundantly all his life .

		He was , indeed , rather disturbed that `` when a man has worked sixty years in the hope of bringing in the Kingdom ... still nineteen persons out of twenty should think of him as the author of one , two , or three stories . ''

		Regarding the inception of his most famous story , A Man Without a Country , Professor
Hale	PERSON	has little to report that is new .

		To let that man reveal himself through his own acts and words , is the worthier and more con - vincing method of showing him to the world as he really is .

		As for dogs and cats , you find yourself reading about these familiar domestics as though they dwelt thousands of miles from your fireside .

		With
Fabre	PERSON	, facts possess fascination sufficient to conjure with .

		Dixon starts out with a thesis `` the existence of real mental and moral faculties among our four - footed friends '' and with this held ever in view , he levels his lance at the word `` instinct , '' and hesi - tates at nothing .

		`` Man delights in thinking of himself as only a little lower than the angels , '' he says .

		`` Then why should he not consider the ani - mals as only a little lower than himself ? ''

		Having asked the question , he answers it , backing up his contention with all manner of evidence .

		Even newspaper claims are considered authentic corrobora - tion .

		Before he finishes , he has given animals `` a definite innate knowledge and desire to advance educationally , '' a `` definite language , '' a `` surprising knowledge of medical and sanitary laws , '' a soul and a future life .

		The Old Testament , he finds , con - tains `` much stronger evidence to the immortality of animals than it does to the immortality of man . ''

		It must be conceded that Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	has done hand - somely by his clients : every

PORTUGAL	LOCATION	, OLD AND YOUNG : An Historical Study .

		By
George Young	PERSON	.

		Oxford Press ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		If one wishes to know
Portugal	LOCATION	quickly and to know it well , especially with reference to the prin - ciples ' that brought the nation into the war on the side of the Allies , he can do little better than read Mr.
Young	PERSON	's admirable book .

		The author 's an - thology of Portuguese poetry revealed him as a highly sympathetic spirit capable of communicating his literary enthusiasm ; this historical record shows him in more sober light perhaps , but his intense interest in his subject is no less contagious .

		For - merly secretary of the British Legation in
Portugal	LOCATION	, he was admirably situated for the proper pursuit of his studies , and it is plainly evident from his results that the work was done with fervor .

		First of all Mr.
Young	PERSON	writes with a style that carries the reader along with very little effort from page to page and from age to age .

		He has a keen eye for national foibles and virtues ; he has a sense of humor ; a sense too of alliteration that at times forces the reader to divert his attention from the historical narrative and comment mentally upon the writer 's verbal vir - tuosity .

		The author moreover is not so laden with the dust of archives but that he knows the litera - ture of the country under discussion and realizes the importance played by the pen as well as by the sword .

		Indeed he emphasizes particularly that importance and shows how much of the country 's development may be traced in the work of the various writers , especially the poets .

		Quoting from the play
Patria	LOCATION	, by the national poet
Guerro Junqueiro	PERSON	, he asks his British reader to imagine a British prophet of nationalism writing such an indictment as the fol - lowing lines : New worlds I sought , new spaces broad and long , But not the more to worship and be wise .

		A cruel greed hurried my feet along , The pride of conquest made my sword-arm strong And lit the light of madness in my eyes .

		I shall not wash the blood I then did spill , With tears of twice ten thousand centuries .

		Especially is the book valuable for its extensive treatment of
Young Portugal	LOCATION	a rejuvenating spirit that has been latent for centuries and that faces with confidence the new
Portugal	LOCATION	which will emerge after the war .

		Vast problems of finance , illiteracy , and religion are in store for it ; and from what Mr.
Young	PERSON	tells us in this book , the problems will be met and solved .

		THE QUEST OF THE FACE .

		By
Stephen Graham	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1	MONEY	.75 .

		The clue to this book is probably in the first line of the prefatory note : `` The Quest of the Face was my last writing before entering the army . ''

		In a series of beautiful word tableaux the author seeks to clothe before us that inarticulate yearning of every human heart the sweet-bitterness of the elusive something which everyone feels and no one defines .

		The book is as elusive as its subject matter , but this of course is its very charm .

		The mystic quality of life takes an infinite number and diversity of shapes and forms , but there is a unity through it all , and all the saint , the drunkard , the student , the beggar , the artist , and St.
Simeon Stylites	PERSON	seek a face .

		The vision of each resembles in spirit the face the artist beholds before the rhapsody of creating .

		`` We are all seeking a face .

		Some seek it desperately , others seek it ever hopefully , some forget and remember and forget and remember again ... '' SIMPLE SOULS .

November 30	DATE	duke and a shop-girl .

		We were ourselves pro- foundly skeptical .

		At first we read because of the whimsicality of a duke 's discussing dreams with a waif in the Zoo .

		When the young woman declared that she preferred silly books ; that `` good books do n't seem human '' ; that she liked `` books where people love each other ridiculously , and do foolish , romantic things they 'd get six months for '' the human response was too strong .

		We accepted Molly in spite of preconceived prejudice .

		If the reader will take our advice he will straightway look up Molly and her duke and follow their romance .

		Mr.
Turner	PERSON	has those qualities which characterize both
Locke	PERSON	and
Snaith	PERSON	at their rare best ; Simple Souls is a brilliant first book .

		THE MADMAN .

		By
Kahlil Gibran	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		It is not strange that
Rodin	PERSON	^ should have hoped much of this Arabian poet .

		For in those parables and poems which
Gibran	PERSON	has given us in English he curiously seems to express what
Rodin	PERSON	did with marble and clay .

		Both sculptor and poet show an imagination which goes to the mountains and the elements for strength , a desire to give human things a universal quality , a mellow irony , and a love of truth which is not afraid of platitudes .

		Rodin com - pared
Gibran	PERSON	to
William Blake	PERSON	.

		But the parables collected in The Madman are more reminiscent of
Zarathustra	LOCATION	's maskings and unmaskings , of the long rising rhythms of Tagore .

		The English language never seems a fit medium for work of this nature .

		It is too angular , too resisting to hold the meanings which Oriental literature crowds as thickly and dazzingly as jewels on an encrusted sword-hilt .

		It would be interesting at least to see what a French translator would make of these poems : For what is there can quench a madman 's thirst but his own blood ?

		I was dumb and I asked wounds of you for mouths .

		I was imprisoned in your days and nights and I sought a door into larger days and nights .

		And now I go as others already crucified have gone .

		And think not we are weary of crucifixion .

		For we must be crucified by larger and yet larger men , between greater earths and greater heavens .

		WHITE NIGHTS .

		By
Fyodor Dostoevsky	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The American edition of the admirable
Garnett	PERSON	translation of
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	has got down to the shorter stories , but the seven collected in this volume show the same amazing qualities as the long novels .

		They are simpler in motive ; but they have the same rich tide of feeling , the same beautiful candor of experience .

		White Nights , called somewhat corr - temptuously by the author `` a sentimental story from the diary of a dreamer , '' is a ravishing tale of first love and its tragic loss .

		Nastenka is the same warm , utterly real , young girl we meet in so many of
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's stories with her unrepressed affec - tion and her fresh intelligence .

		No one knows better than Dostoevsky the tortured labyrinths of wounded amour propre .

		In Notes from Under - ground he traces the sufferings of a sensitive youth as he turns this way and that , through spitefulness , hatred , exalted feeling , human friendliness , as his relentless ego chases him through an environment in which he can never feel power .

		The scene with the young prostitute is a remarkable piece of in - sight .

		The rest of the stories are infinitely pathetic .

		A
Faint Heart	ORGANIZATION	portrays a weak youth who can not endure the happiness of betrothal .

		The last story Mr.
Prohartchin	PERSON	is concerned simply with the ill - ness and death of a poor , worthless old man , in a sordid boarding house , surrounded by his uncompre - hending fellow lodgers .

		Yet in its way the story is as extraordinary as
Romains	PERSON	' The Death of a Nobody .

		Only the theme is here the muffled con - flict between the living and the dying , the resent - ment of these primitive souls at a sick and half - mad old man , the hopeless indignity of death .

		It shows the power of Dostoevsky in making tragic significance out of the most worthless material , of seeing in every scrap of human experience some revelation to move the heart as no other writer can move it .

December 14	DATE	THIS MARK ON GOOD BOOKS
MR. HUEBSCH	PERSON	offers seven volumes of distinguished poetry that represent authentic contribution to modern letters .

		Making due allowance for the exaggeration to which advertisers are disposed , readers may feel assured that each - book has a genuine reason for existence and possesses claims to survival .

		Here are the seven surprises : By
JAMES JOYCE	PERSON	: Chamber Music -LRB-
$ 1.00	MONEY	-RRB- .

		A lyric sequence as delicate as a piece of Sevres ; utterly unlike what you might expect from the author of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man .

		Does it not interest you that
Arthur Symons	PERSON	should have said of Chamber Music : `` They are like a whispering clavi - chord that some one plays in the
evening	TIME	when it is getting dark .

		They are full of ghostly old tunes that were never young and will never be old , played on an old instrument .

		They are so slight , as a drawing of
Whistler	LOCATION	is slight , that their entire beauty will not be discovered by those who go to poetry ` for anything but its perfume '' ?

		Others might be quoted , but is this not enough to suggest the fragrance that you may enjoy ?

		-LSB- This is the only authorized edition of Chamber Music . -RSB-

		By
LOLA	PERSON	RIDGE : The Ghetto -LRB-
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The title of this book will recall to readers the slight shock of astonishment with which they observed a poem , several pages in length , in an issue of the
New Republic	LOCATION	early this year .

		With that poem , The Ghetto ,
Miss Ridge	LOCATION	burst on the world , and this collection seals her claim to a place among the real poets of the day .

		Her passion for righteousness , her burning revolt and her sensitiveness to beauty fall into an effortless form that is real art .

		By
JEAN STARR UNTERMEYER	PERSON	: Growing Pains -LRB-
$ 1.00	MONEY	-RRB- .

		A volume of introspective poetry that is both intensely probing and strangely passionate by one of the most unflinching of the younger group .

		With a searching honesty and an instinct for the illuminating word that is unusual , this poet 's work is , according to Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, `` full of a strong and almost stern sentiment . ''

		These poems will be cherished and reread not so much for their sculptural outlines and verbal loveliness as for their universal rhythm that will everywhere evoke a throbbing response .

		By
IRENE RUTHERFORD McLEOD	PERSON	: Before Dawn -LRB-
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Who that read Songs to Save a Soul failed to be thrilled by the ebullient youth , the spiritual rebellion and the melodic charm of that volume !

		The prophecies for '
Miss McLeod	PERSON	's future were justified by her second book , Swords for Life ; and now she presents a volume , fuller and deeper , shot with the poignancy of greater personal experience , yet as rich in its lyric quality and as true rhythmically as her earlier collections .

		It was not blindly that
Masefield	PERSON	,
W. L. George	PERSON	and others nominated her for the future .

		By
JUDITH GAUTIER	PERSON	-LRB-
JAMES WHITALL	PERSON	, TRANS - LATOR -RRB- : Chinese Lyrics -LRB-
$ 1.00	MONEY	-RRB- .

		One must rhapsodize about these ' echoes from the mediaeval Orient !

		The perfection of a Chinese ivory is suggested by these suave transliterations of quaint Asiatic poets .

		And there is a delightful prelude that tells what poets and poetry meant in ancient Chinese civilization , how the writers courted public favor and how their work was saved for posterity by Imperial favor .

		Those were Emperors !

		By ALTER
BRODY	PERSON	: A Family Album -LRB-
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		In an introduction to this volume Mr.
Louis Untermeyer	PERSON	-LRB- and whose assessment will find wider confirmation ? -RRB-

		says : Everywhere in these pages one sees the impress of an alert and original mind , of imagination fed by strength - ening fact ; of sight that is sharpened by insight ... It is a personal magic that pervades these young and passionate pages a magic that is even more haunting for being human .

		By IN
PREPARATION D. H. LAWRENCE	PERSON	: Look !

		We Have Come Through -LRB-
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Always a poet , even in his prose , as readers of Sons and Lovers , The Prussian Officer and Twilight in
Italy	LOCATION	know , his gift of expression finds an unusually happy medium in verse .

		The volume called Amores only foreshadows the passion to which
Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	gives free rein in this new book , this record of a man 's love - life the crisis and the fulfillment .

		An almost painful gift to the poetry of love that will be especially sig - nificant to students of psychoanalysis .

		Those who like to give poetry as holiday gifts and who have no prejudice against an occasional hazard are invited to send a check for the volumes selected .

		The purchase may be made of good booksellers or of the pub - lisher who will send the parcel c. o. d. if desired .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Withdraw from
Russia	LOCATION	!

		'N
MARCH 15 , 1917	DATE	the news of the abdication of the Czar was flashed round the world .

		Demo - cratic nations rejoiced ; and
America	LOCATION	, itself founded on a revolution , sent its sympathy and greeting to the people of
Russia	LOCATION	who had burst through the chains of centuries of black oppression .

		Less than a month later we ourselves entered the war against
Germany	LOCATION	.

		We had suffered very little either in property loss or in human life ; indeed our neutrality had brought us prosperity .


Russia	LOCATION	, on the contrary , had suffered all things : betrayal at the front , unpre - cedented slaughter of her soldiers , disorganization , unemployment , famine , disease .

		Her army was go - ing to pieces .

		It was not the time for the Allied nations to urge her to continue the war against
Germany	LOCATION	a war which , Bolsheviki or no Bolshe - viki , Constituent Assembly or no Constituent As - sembly , counter-revolution or no counter-revolution , it was physically impossible for her to undertake .

		Yet the Allied nations did urge her , and as a result of their urging the disastrous advance into
Galicia	LOCATION	was begun .

		It ended in perhaps the greatest retreat in history .

		And new , strange voices began to be heard in
Russia	LOCATION	, voices which asked President Wil - son precisely what he meant by his phrase a world `` safe for democracy , '' voices which challenged the aims of the Allies .


Russia	LOCATION	, these voices said , wanted a peace with `` no annexations , no indemnities , and the right of all peoples to determine their own destiny . ''

		It was a magic phrase .

		The Allied na - tions could ignore it no longer .

		We can not give in detail the tragic history of the
summer	DATE	and autumn of
1917	DATE	.

		But the main out - lines of that history , as far as
Russia	LOCATION	is concerned , are clear .

		Not once , but again and again , did the Kerensky government appeal to the Allied nations for a revision of war aims .

		Not once , but again and again , were the Russian people promised that revision .

		Yet the revision was never made .

		The secret treaties -LRB- known about all over
Russia	LOCATION	-RRB- were never repudiated .

		And inevitably the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	came into power , as much from the blundering of the Allied nations and from their unwillingness to subscribe to the tenets of real democratic peace as from any other reason .

		What the previous govern - ments had promised to the Russian people and neve had secured the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	did secure .

		The previou governments had promised publication of the secre treaties , division of the land and peace .

		The fulfilled none of their promises .

		But almost the firs act of the new
Bolshevik Government	ORGANIZATION	was the ptib lication of the secret treaties .

		The decree on land dividing the estates according to promise which we publish on another page -LRB- see Foreig Comment -RRB- , was the first official act of the ne \ government , and together with the decree on peac made great political capital for the Bolshevik Part -RRB- Although
Lenin	PERSON	apologized at the time for th haste with which the decree on land was brough out , its main provisions were later adopted by th
All Russian Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the Soviets .

		Peace * wit
Germany	LOCATION	was also procured , first by an armistic and finally by the ratification of the treaty of Bresl Litovsk on
March 16 , 1918	DATE	ironically enoug within one day of one year after the beginning of th Revolution itself .

		Following the Bolshevik success , what the whol course of events and policy has shown is that for th first time in the history of the modern world we ar confronted with an economic revolution instead o a merely political revolution .

		The Soviet Govern ment might have been captured by any one of th many political parties of
Russia	LOCATION	, the
Mensheviki the Right Social Revolutionary Party	ORGANIZATION	, even the
Lef Communist Party	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which accuse both
Lenin	ORGANIZATION	am Trotzky of being `` reactionaries '' ! -RRB-

		, and so on .

		I was as a matter of fact carried by the Bolshevi !

		Party , which , in spite of reports to the contrary gained in strength as time went on and
today	DATE	, afte over a year of its rule , has behind it the majorit support of the Russian people and can actually hop in the coming
spring	DATE	to have a
Red Army	ORGANIZATION	of per haps three million soldiers ready to lay down thei lives in its defense .

		Why ?

		What is the vita principle of the Bolsheviki that keeps them so lo ` nj in power ?

		From what background do they
spring	DATE	What do they want ?

		Although these questions deserve detailed answers we wish to state , for the sake of clearness , ou belief concerning the chief points .

		Russians regan 526
December 14	DATE	us , as well as many others in Western nations , as political infants .

		They are not content with what we glibly call democracy .

		Their hopes and aspira - tions are centered on a greater experiment than merely representative government .

		They are intense - ly communistic , more so than the people of any other country .

		They want actually to abolish the whole institution of private property .

		They want to create a government which is entirely a people 's govern - ment , a government of the workers and the poor peasants .

		They will , if they can , abolish the capital - ist class .

		Contrary to report , they bear no ill will against the intellectuals as a class , although they recognize the basic truth of the psychology of the intellectual class ; that is , they regard the intellec - tuals as parasites on the so-called capitalist class .

		Yet they hold the professions and the arts in high honor .

		Their program for universal education is extensive , and is not confined to merely vocational training .

		The Soviet Government has encouraged individual artists , subsidized theaters and the bajlet and the opera .

		It has reprinted the great classics of literature in inexpensive form for everybody .

		It recognizes the need for technical experts and for discipline of all kinds .

		Funda - mentally , however , it is interested in maintaining a workers ' government , supported , as Lenin so elo - quently phrased it in a speech before the
Moscow	LOCATION	Soviet , by `` the regular march of the iron battalions of the proletariat . ''

		One point more , perhaps , needs emphasis .

		The universality of the stories in the daily press about the `` Red Terror '' and the mass murder of the bour - geois class demands corrective .

		In the first place , there was no `` Red Terror '' before the invasion of
Russia	LOCATION	by Allied troops .

		In the second place , the executions are not irresponsible murders , but de - liberate measures of self-defense , such as any govern - ment in similar circumstances , threatened both by internal and external enemies , invariably adopts .

		In the third place , the number of them has been grossly exaggerated .

		In the fourth place , they do not begin to equal the indiscriminate slaughter of Soviet officials practiced by the invading troops -LRB- principally the Czecho-Slovaks -RRB- whenerer they are successful in overthrowing a local Soviet .

		In the fifth place , plots against the Central Soviet Gorern - ment have been persistent and unscrupulous , both on the part of the disgruntled Russians who have been expropriated or who have a political axe to grind and on the part of foreign governments , de - sirous of the overthrow of the present regime .

		In a word , the Soviet Government has adopted the con - ventionally harsh method of suppressing the at - tempts to instigate civil war in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Had the Allied Governments recognized the Soriet Govern - ment instead of attacking it , and had they given it the cooperation and assistance which it asked , it is safe to assume that fully nine-tenths of the present `` Red Terror '' would not have occurred .

		Recently , moreover , thanks to Allied intervention , the Bolshe - viki have become so strong in their internal grip on the situation that they are now in a sufficiently secure position not to need to employ the harsher measures of the `` Red Terror . ''

		The brain worker and the petit bourgeois are no longer to be op - pressed , but propitiated .

		The further the armies of the Allied Governments march into
Russia	LOCATION	the stronger becomes the movement towards reconcilia - tion within the country .

		It is an ancient phe - nomenon .

		Before the foreign enemy domestic dif - ferences vanish all become Russians .

		Well could Trotzky state that he could have afforded to pay one hundred thousand roubles for every Japanese sol - dier landed on Russian soil .

		The blundering policy of the Allied Governments has not only evoked the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	if continued , it will make all
Russia	LOCATION	support them .

		And yet this mad policy has been followed in spite of the many attempts that the Soviet Govern - ment has made to cooperate with the Allied Govern - ments .

		There was always what one might call an undercurrent of flirtation with the Allied Govern - ments .

		For us there was open friendship : even the more fanatical recognized the difference between a medieval autocracy like
Germany	LOCATION	and a liberal republic like ourselves .

		Before the B rest-Li tovsk treaty Trotzky requested the
American Army	ORGANIZATION	to send him officers to instruct the
Red Army	ORGANIZATION	and to put it in a position to fight
Germany	LOCATION	again .

		He requested the English to send him English naval offi - cers to take charge of the
Black Sea Fleet	ORGANIZATION	in order that it might not fall into the hands of the Germans .

		He even accepted the proffered help of a few French officers then in
Russia	LOCATION	, who , according to reliable witnesses , not only did not train the
Red Army	ORGANIZATION	, but abused the confidence given them to get information which was later put at the disposal of the
Czecho	LOCATION	- slovak troops .

		After the treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed - it was imperative , of course , that appear - ances should be kept up with
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Yet the
Soviet Government	ORGANIZATION	's appeal to the Allies for co - operation was constant .

		During
February	DATE	they re - quested an American railway expert to take charge of the technical details of the Russian railroads , and a little later they informally proposed to give us the right to purchase ore and other raw materials -LRB- to purchase it exclusirely , in spite of the fact that these were just the things needed then by
Germany	LOCATION	-RRB- in exchange for shipments of American goods to Rus - THE DIAL 527 sia .

		Liberal exchanges of Russian raw materials for food were guaranteed .

		Time after time the Soviet Government made direct and indirect offers of com - mercial cooperation .

		And usually they signified their complete willingness to renew the war against
Germany	LOCATION	-LRB- for they never hesitated to describe the treaty of Brest-Litovsk as no other than a robber 's peace -RRB- as soon as the army could be reorganized and supplied with necessary munitions and equip - ment .

		Not one of these many offers was acknowl - edged , much less accepted .

		There seemed to be a preconcerted plan not to recognize the Soviet Gov - ernment under any circumstances and no matter what they offered .

		Since the armistice with Ger - many they have themselves offered an armistice to the Allied nations .

		More : according to the
Daily News	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	,
Litvinoff	PERSON	, the representative until re - cently of the Soviet Government in
England	LOCATION	, has formally offered any concessions to the Allied na - tions including payment on the national debt by what gold is in
Russia	LOCATION	and by liberal concessions in return for recognition of the Soviet Government by the Allied nations and peace .

		But so far the con - sistently and sincerely friendly advances of the Soviet Government have been ignored .

		Possibly one reason for this has been the star chamber method of conducting our diplomatic rela - tions with the Soviet Government .

		If public opinion in the various Allied countries ourselves included had ever had any opportunity whatever to discuss any of these offers , the situation today might be different .

		But the news from
Russia	LOCATION	, par - ticularly since the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	have had control , has been notoriously false .

		The stories of massacre and anarchy are , of course , largely for effect , and are not to be taken seriously .

		The real truth about them is well illustrated in the article in this issue signed S. M .

		It is also well known that the various gorernmental censorships , principally the British , have suppressed actual news messages sent by accredited correspondents of accredited news associations from
Moscow	LOCATION	and
Petrograd	LOCATION	messages sent by men who were not them - selves Bolsheviki at all7 but simply honest journal - ists .

		And many are the stories of events by `` eye - witnesses '' who saw no more than the inside of a hotel in
Stockholm	LOCATION	.

		Not a word of the constructive work being done by the
Soviet Government	ORGANIZATION	has been given out by the press .

		Such simple docu - ments as we publish on another page , for example , -LRB- see Foreign Comment -RRB- are practically unknown .

		All that we are allowed are silly stories about new decrees on marriage and free love , issued -LRB- where rarely authentic -RRB- by irresponsible groups striving to put the Soviet Government in a false light .

		When a really first-rate analysis of what the Soviet Gov - ernment is doing is published like The Soviets at Work by
Lenin	ORGANIZATION	we are informed by Postmaster General
Burleson	PERSON	that it is unmailable .

		But the worst of all is the fashion in which the news about Allied intervention is distorted .

		We are led to be - lieve that Allied troops landed in
Vladivostok	LOCATION	to restore `` law and order , '' to put down the rule of an anarchical minority and to substitute a democratic government .

		It is false .

		There was quiet and the best of law and order at
Vladivostok	LOCATION	when Allied troops landed .

		The Soviet had the support and affection of the people .

		The Allied troops did not set up a democratic government : they set up a re - actionary dictatorship .

		We are prepared to prove that in every case where Allied troops have invaded Russian soil they have overthrown the popular gov - ernment and set up a temporary government resting for its support on foreign bayonets , a government reactionary and in some cases even frankly monarch - ist .

		It is safe to say that the average Ameri - can citizen would be thoroughly shocked at know - ing the kind of imperialistic and anti-demo - cratic game which is being played by our own and our Allies ' armies in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		These are facts and we think it high time that they be told .

		We do not believe that our own
Government	ORGANIZATION	wants the restoration of the monarchy in
Russia	LOCATION	or that it would support a demonstrably unpopular govern - ment forever .

		The
American Government	ORGANIZATION	would like to see in
Russia	LOCATION	a liberal and commercial re - public like ourselves a quiet , respectable govern - ment with which we could do business .

		Undoubt - edly .

		But what we should like and what we are as a matter of cold fact getting are two widely different things .

		It is no secret that powerful parties in
Japan	LOCATION	are advocating the unostentatious annexation of large sections of
Siberia	LOCATION	, and that they have no interest in seeing any stable popular government arise east of the Urals .

		It is no secret that
England	LOCATION	trembles for
Persia	LOCATION	,
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, and
India	LOCATION	, and that the Tory party would gladly crush the Russian Revolution if it exhibited any tendency towards proselytism in for - eign countries -LRB- as it has -RRB- .

		It is no secret that a cer - tain section of French governmental opinion cares not a fig what sort of a reactionary government there is in
Russia	LOCATION	, provided only it is a government that will immediately repay the foreign loan .

		In a word , our intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	may have been undertaken with the best of intentions , but the practical situation with which we are faced today is either to support reaction and imperialism or to withdraw our troops .

		Russian intervention has become for Amer - 528 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	ica a tragic anachronism since the defeat of Ger - many .

		We have neither a national nor an interna - tional interest which today legitimately sanctions the presence of our troops on Russian soil .

		It is false to our traditions to be fighting a workingman 's republic , even if we do not approve of its form or its manners .

		~ It is not in accordance with any doctrine of American national policy for us to be engaged in crushing a revolution or in crucifying the hopes and aspirations of a great and mighty people .

		It is really difficult to believe that this is the same country which in
Washington	LOCATION	's time almost had a civil war because this government refused to inter - vene in the French Revolution , on behalf of the revolutionists .

		And not even the most severe critics of the present leaders of the Soviet Government have said one-tenth as bitter things as were said of
Robespierre	LOCATION	and
Marot	PERSON	in their day .

		No ; to help crush a revolution is not in accordance with the real American tradition .

		For that reason we demand of our Govern - ment that our troops now in
Russia	LOCATION	be immedi - ately withdrawn .

		We are asking no more than
British Labor	ORGANIZATION	and
French Labor	ORGANIZATION	and Italian Labor have already officially demanded of their govern - ments .

		We are asking no more than President
Wilson	PERSON	has again and again promised to the Russian people `` We are fighting , '' said the President in his communication to the Provisional Government of
Russia	LOCATION	on
June 9 , 1917	DATE	, `` for the liberty , the self-government , and the undictated development of all peoples , and every feature of the settlement that concludes this war must be conceived and executed for that purpose . ''

		We are asking no more than would ask , if they knew the facts , and do ask , those who are aware of them , the soldiers who entered this war inspired by an honest ideal to defeat the menace of German autocracy and to bring freedom to the oppressed peoples of the world .

		Those who have given their lives on the battlefields of
France	LOCATION	will rise to reproach us if we are now false to our trust .

		We have fought for freedom , and as the President has said , the undictated development of all peoples .

		We demand that
Russia	LOCATION	have her fair chance at that freedom and self-development , and that if we are in no position to direct or guide the actions of other nations with respect to her we at least shall leave her free to work out her own destiny .

		Let a war which has not been declared by the nation we are fighting , or by ourselves , cease .

		And let those representatives of
Russia	LOCATION	who speak for the majority of the Rus - sian people and not for interested cliques of in - triguers have a voice and a hearing at the peace conference .

		We demand that freedom of communication with
Russia	LOCATION	be at once restored , and that the whole truth be permitted to appear without let or hindrance in our periodicals ; that the motives back of interven - tion , be they either political or economic or what not , be given to the American people in order that they may have full knowledge and may of them - selves determine whether or not they are willing to back up the present intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	and what is the logical further activity implied by that inter - vention .

		We demand that the open diplomacy for which the President has declared be practiced with respect to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		We demand , in a single word , the truth .

		We have lived for the last year in a poisonous atmosphere of lies and slander and in - trigue and double-dealing .

		As Americans , who honestly believe - that we speak for the sober second thought of this country and for those who have no organ of publicity or appeal , we demand that once and for all the clean wind of the truth be allowed to sweep away the false conceptions and interested propaganda which have infected the country .

		We demand of our Government a clear formulation and simple , honest statement of its Russian policy .

		We demand that that policy be based on the facts and not on lies , that that policy be American and
Ameri	PERSON	- can alone '' THE EDITORS .

		MAXWELL BODENHEIM .

		1918 THE DIAL 5 2 9
Russia	LOCATION	and the
American Press IVUSSIA	ORGANIZATION	has always been a land of mystery , a terra incognita , to us .

		During the reign of the czars our knowledge of that country was limited to stories of bureaucratic corruption , brutal oppres - sion , and Jewish massacres .

		Occasionally
Stephen Graham	PERSON	, of British fame , treated us to a eulogy of the autocratic regime which , he maintained , was best calculated to keep in proper place the many millions of ignorant and vodka-drinking peasants who worshiped their `` Little Father , '' the God - appointed head of
State and Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the Russian Revolution broke out , and the selfsame peasants , garbed in soldiers ' and sailors ' uni - forms , raised a heavy hand against their `` beloved '' Czar and with one mighty stroke swept out all vestige of his malevolent rule , we were told tales of anarchy and chaos , of the mistreatment of `` inno - cent '' army officers in the prisons of
Kronstadt	LOCATION	, of the burning of manor houses by infuriated peasants , and were constantly impressed with the belief that the Russian people were not ripe for self-govern - ment .

		The Bolshevik propaganda among the army , which met with great success because of the blunders of Allied diplomacy , the weakness of the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	, the general disorganization in the country , and the war-weariness of the masses -LRB- who are not interested in the acquisition of the
Darda	PERSON	- nelles or the freedom of the seas -RRB- , was conveniently and thoughtlessly branded as German ; and this prevented any true understanding of the whole movement .

		The very word `` Bolshevik '' sounded mysterious and threatening , but no one saw fit to explain its meaning .

		And when these same
Bolshe	PERSON	- viks came into power , and in spite of the frequent prophesies about their imminent downfall continued in power much to the disappointment and chagrin of the false prophets our newspapers became a sort of clearing-house for abuse , calumny , falsehood , and other attributes of impotent rage , lavishly heaped upon them by their conscious and unconscious enemies .

		For , really , what do we know about present-day
Russia	LOCATION	, her form of government , and the purposes of her rulers ?

		Barring advance information about massacres of the bourgeoisie , which somehow do not come off , and repeated predictions that millions are going to die for lack of food and fuel , which prediction the millions stubbornly refuse to bear out , what news do we get from that country ?

		Prac - tically none .

		Our correspondents in
Russia	LOCATION	, with one or two exceptions , do not speak the language of the people , either in the literal or in the figurative sense , do not understand their psychology , do not know their history and their heroic struggle for freedom .

		They come there with a mental equip - ment sufficient perhaps for a breezy account of a divorce trial or an enthusiastic report about a smash - ing home-run , but utterly and sadly inadequate for the comprehension of so tremendous an upheaval .

		Unable to grasp the significance of the great social phenomenon , they dwell of necessity upon the minor details , the discordant and petty elements , which they pick up on the fringes of the Revolution .

		Thus it happens that a murder or a plain hold-up is mag - nified to the proportions of anarchy and terror , and the tearful recital of a dispossessed aristocrat is taken as a proof of the country 's lawless state .

		To the total lack of intelligent understanding on the part of some is added the prejudice and bigotry of others who strenuously oppose any and all radical innovations which tend to undermine the citadel of conservatism .

		These are constitutionally unable to see any good in the Russian Revolution which does not work out in accord with the editorial views of their respective papers .

		Some of them have spent years in
Russia	LOCATION	, hobnobbing with the Czar 's officials and receiving their Russian news while sipping champagne in the cozy atmosphere of a well - appointed room , and they were shocked beyond the hope of recovery when the unshaven and noisy
Petrograd Council of Workmen	ORGANIZATION	's and Soldiers ' Deputies demanded a public statement of Allied war aims and declared for `` peace without annexa - tions or indemnities , and self-definition of peoples . ''

		The advent of the Bolsheviks completed their men - tal derangement , so that since
November 1917	DATE	they have been able to see nothing but red .

		Their optic sense has been so perverted that a political amnesty they view as a general massacre ; and their loss of reasoning capacity is evidenced by their readiness to confirm any rumor , no matter how wild and improbable , if only it is in line with their sad delusion .

		There are also those , of the yellow kind , who in order to please the editor or to satisfy their own craving for the sensational send grossly exaggerated or deliberately lying stories .

		As an illustration the following may serve .

		Some time ago a
New York	LOCATION	daily published a story by its Russian correspondent about a certain
Peters	PERSON	, the President of the
Moscow Commission	ORGANIZATION	for the Suppression , of Counter-Revolu - 53 THE DIAL
December	DATE	14 tion , who , as the story ran , `` signed death warrants day and night until he dropped from sheer physical exhaustion . ''

		The story was embellished with a few personal characteristics which portrayed the unfor - tunate victim of the correspondent as a most blood - thirsty monster in human form .

		Diligent inquiry has disclosed that the Bolsheviks have a grim habit of publishing the lists of people executed for state and other offenses , and that at the time the corre - spondent above referred to was in
Russia	LOCATION	the great - est number of persons executed in a single day in
Moscow	LOCATION	was twenty-three .

		While this number may be large enough to impress anyone with the seriousness of the anti-Bolshevik movement in Rus - sia -LRB- which movement , it must be noted , appears to be confined to the former nobility and property - owning class -RRB- , it can readily be seen that
Peters	PERSON	scarcely dropped from `` physical exhaustion '' after affixing his signature twenty-three times .

		On other days he was required to sign twelve , or eight , or five death warrants , which to a revolutionist who has experienced the `` discomforts '' of the Czar 's prison regime and who is righting against its restoration is a mere bagatelle .

		He has risked his life in the battle against autocratic tyranny and he rightly considers that its champions must either win or perish .

		The following , which is reprinted from the official Mos - cow Izvestia of
July 13	DATE	, is a typical announcement of the sort that one occasionally reads in the Russian press : During the
night	TIME	of
July 12	DATE	, by order of the Extraor - dinary
Commission	ORGANIZATION	for the Suppression of the Counter - Revolution , ten leaders of the counter-revolutionary organization , the Union for the Salvation of the Father - land and the Revolution , were shot .

		The reasons for this execution are that recent reports from the provinces state that agents of the above-named organization instigated partial armed outbreaks against the Soviet Government .

		These reports , combined with the fact , recently estab - lished , that the chief staff of this organization was work - ing out a plan for a general armed uprising , have extremely aggravated the situation , especially in view of the latest events .

		Experience has shown that the imprisonment of mem - bers of this criminal society does not attain the purpose , as , possessing an enormous amount of money , this society organizes their escape from the prisons , and they continue their criminal activity .

		The armed mutiny which was in the process of preparation threatened also the lives of many people among the peaceful population , and , there - fore , the
Extraordinary Commission	ORGANIZATION	for the Suppression of the Counter-Revolution decided to exterminate the counter-revolutionary organization at the very root and treat the leaders as open enemies caught with arms in their hands .

		The following persons , all former officers , have been executed : 1 .

		General
Popoff	PERSON	.

		2 .


B. Pokrovsky	PERSON	.

		3 .

		Sidoroff -LRB- alias Aveyeff -RRB- .

		4 .

		Dushak .

		5 .

		Kolenko .

		6 .


Rosenfeld	PERSON	-LRB- alias Rosanoff -RRB- .

		7 .

		Olgin -LRB- alias Gertzik -RRB- .

		8 .

		Ilvovsky .

		9 .

		Belooussoff .

		10 .

		Floroff .

		In justice to the Bolsheviks it must be said that they do not show partiality in the matter of execu - tions , and accord similar treatment to their own comrades when the latter commit crimes which , according to the Bolshevik legal code , are just as heinous as treason .


Hans Vorst	PERSON	, the
Moscow	LOCATION	corre - spondent of the
Berliner Tageblatt	PERSON	, whose descrip - tion of the activity of the
Extraordinary Commission	ORGANIZATION	was reprinted in the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	of
December 1	DATE	, says : It should be mentioned that the Extraordinary Com - missions proceed with the same severity as against the bourgeoisie against the abuses and dishonesty among the Soviet officials themselves .

		Among the lists of those shot one occasionally runs across reports like this : `` Commis - sary
X. Y. Z.	PERSON	, for drunkenness and misconduct , '' or `` Y. Z. , member of such and such Soviet , for drunkenness and other crimes . ''

		The list is already lengthy of the Soviet officials who have been shot for bribery and extortion .

		Our total ignorance of conditions in
Russia	LOCATION	and our hunger for news from that country explain the avidity with which we swallow all interviews with former Generals , erstwhile Princes , and British merchants who `` escape '' from
Petrograd	LOCATION	or
Moscow	LOCATION	in a first-class compartment of the wagons-lits and vie with one another in their recitals of the blood - curdling deeds of the murderous Bolsheviks .

		One of these fortunate individuals was asked in the midst of his narrative for a definition of Bolshevik , and he replied that the root of the word meant `` chaos . ''

		The reporter was much satisfied with this learned definition and recorded it for the public 's information .

		May one suggest that in this era of reconstruction , when various policies are put forward from the radical program of the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	to the very conservative proposal of the
American Manu	ORGANIZATION	- facturers ' Association to lower wages and extend working hours the American press would be greatly benefited by the abolition of yellow journal - ism and a slight change in the personnel of its foreign correspondents ?


Europe	LOCATION	is shaken by a suc - cession of revolutions .

		Empires and dynasties are crumbling to the dust .

		In place of autocracy and feudalism democracies are set up .

		Great mass move - ments are shaking the very foundations of the mod - ern political and economic order .

		Intelligent ob - servation and fair discrimination are essential to a proper understanding of the developments in the Old World , so that the New World may learn the lesson of history and not repeat the mistakes of the past .

		And the raising of the intellectual level of our correspondents in
Europe	LOCATION	, particularly in
Russia	LOCATION	, would be an important step in the educational re - construction of this country .

		p * , THE DIAL The Soviet at Work OEVENTEEN DAYS after we left the great Red Commune of
Petrograd	LOCATION	, looking out towards the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, the Trans-Siberian express was gliding along the waters of the Golden Horn of the
Far East	LOCATION	, carrying us into
Vladivostok	LOCATION	, looking from its hilly promontory out into the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		It was in a world of Soviets that we had moved across the great , slow , northern-flowing rivers , the Urals , the
Taiga	LOCATION	forests , and the steppes .

		The trainmen spoke of their Soviet ; the peasants of theirs ; the miners at
Anjarnaya	LOCATION	had greeted us with great red banners in the name of theirs .

		We had conferred with the Soviet of
Central Siberia	LOCATION	and the Far East Soviet .

		It seemed as if the whole world was taken up with this new organ , and as we stepped from the train at
Vladivostok	LOCATION	we were to find the Soviet there an exact replica of the one we had left at
Petrograd	LOCATION	, seven thousand miles away at the other end of the line .

		There is no more remarkable phenomenon in all history than the fact that in a week after the Revo - lution one sixth of the earth 's surface should in every city and village burgeon forth with this ne \ V sort of governmental apparatus ; that it should mani - fest its worth , strike its roots deeper and deeper , crowd out all rivals , resist the shock of every at - tack , and after fifteen months hold undisputed con - trol from the Arctic Ocean on the north to the Black Sea on the south , from
Narva	LOCATION	upon the Finnish Gulf to
Vladivostok	LOCATION	here on the Yellow Sea .

		All along the Trans-Siberian line the Soviets were at work upon the staggering problems that had , fallen on them .

		The armies of unemployed were swarming in all the streets .

		The dislocation , of industry following the war and the Revolution , the demobilization of twelve million soldiers , and the arbitrary shutting of fac - tories by their owners all combined to fill the cities with the workless .

		The Soviets saw the menace to their existence in these idle hands and started in to open up the factories .

		The management was lodged with the workingmen themselves and credit was furnished by the Soviet .

		Under the Kerensky re - gime , workman 's control had often proved dis - astrous .

		One of the causes was the constant de - mand for more and more pay .

		The bewildered cabinet ministers were at their wits ' ends to find a way to stop this cry for ever higher and higher wages .

		The Soviet however stopped it at once .

		The leaders first tried wage limitation on themselves .

		By de - cree of the Central Russian Soviet the maximum salary for any official of the new Russian Gov ment was fixed at 500 roubles a month , members of the Vladivostok Soviet , with the dent Soochanov at their head , pointing out the k cost of living in the
Far East	LOCATION	, voluntarily sc theirs down to '' 300 roubles a month .

		After when any workman felt within him the itching sire for a fatter pay-envelope , the question oi fellow-worker was : `` Do you want to get more Lenin or Soochanov ? ''

		This logic was unans able .

		As soon as the workmen found the fact really in their hands there came a change in 1 minds .

		Under the Kerensky regime they tended to elect a foreman for his leniency .

		U : their own government , the Soviet , they begai elect as foremen those who put discipline into shop and raised the production .

		The first tin met
Krasnoschekoff	PERSON	, the head of the Far Soviet , he was talking pessimistically about thf dustrial outlook : `` For every word I say to bourgeoisie against their sabotaging , I say ten w to the workingmen against their slackness .

		B believe the change is coming . ''

		When I saw hirr
last of June	DATE	he was in a happy , jubilant m The change had come , and in six factories he that they were producing more than ever before In the so-called `` American Works '' the wh frames , and brakes of cars , shipped from the Ur States , were assembled and the cars sent out the Trans-Siberian Railway .

		Under the
Kere	PERSON	regime these shops had been hotbeds of trouble , disturbance following close on the heels of anol The 6,000 workmen on the payroll were tur : out but 18 cars a day .

		The Soviet Committee cl the plant down and then completely reorganized shops , reducing the force to 1800 men .

		In underframe section , instead of
1400	DATE	there were 350 ; but by means of short-cuts , introduced by workers themselves , the output of that departr was increased .

		Altogether , the
1800	DATE	men on new payroll were turning out 12 cars a day - efficiency increase of more than 100 per cent man .

		One day I was standing with Soochanov on hills overlooking the shops .

		He was listening to clank of the cranes and the stamp of the trip h mers ringing up from the valley .

		`` That seems to be sweet music in your ears said .

		`` Yes , '' he replied , `` the old revolutionists us & 53 2 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	make a noise with bombs , but this is the noise of the new revolutionists . ''

		The strongest ally of the Soviet was the
Union of Miners	ORGANIZATION	.

		It organized the unemployed into little Soviets of 50 and 100 , equipped them , and sent them out to the mines along the great Amur .

		These enterprises were highly successful .

		Each man was turning out on an average of from 50 to 100 roubles worth of gold and other ore per day .

		The question of pay arose .

		One of the miners unearthed the slogan : `` To every man the full product of his labors . ''

		It at once achieved a tremendous popu - larity among the miners , who declared their loyalty to this fundamental Socialist principle ; nothing , they said , could induce them to depart from it .

		But the Soviet held a different view .

		There was a dead - lock .

		Instead of taking recourse to the historic method of settling the dispute by bombs and troops , the workingmen fought it out on the floor of the Soviet and the miners capitulated to the logic of their comrades .

		Their wages were fixed at about 15 roubles per day with a bonus for extra produc - tion .

		In a short time twenty-six poods -LRB- there are 36 pounds in a pood -RRB- of gold were accumulated at headquarters in
Habarovsk	LOCATION	.

		Against this they were preparing to issue paper money .

		The seal was a sickle and a hammer , and the design showed a peasant and a worker clasping hands and the riches of the Far East streaming out over the world .

		One of the white elephants to which the Soviet fell heir was the
Voenna Port	LOCATION	-LRB- Military Port -RRB- .

		It was a huge plant built for military and naval pur - poses , and a monument to the inefficiency of the Old Regime .

		It carried on its payroll as fine a line of grafting officials and favorites as ever decorated an establishment of the Czar .

		The barnacles on the ships of the volunteer fleet were a consequence of those upon the payroll .

		The Soviet immediately scraped these eminent barnacles off its payroll .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	retained the services of the old manager of the
Port	LOCATION	as Chief Technician .

		For these prole - tarians recognized the necessity of experts , that they were not to be found in their own ranks , and that they must pay the price for them .

		Some of these bourgeois administrators received a salary five or ten times greater than any of the commissaires .

		For the first time the working-class set out to buy brains in the same way as the capitalist class had done here - tofore .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	took upon itself the task of shift - ing the production from implements of war to im - plements of peace .

		They introduced a system of strict accounting .

		This showed that the new plows and weights were being produced at a much higher cost than the same articles could be imported from abroad .

		They then set to work changing the ma - chinery and speeding it up .

		Many machines and ships were brought in for repairing .

		When a par - ticular contract was not completed at the end of the eight-hour day the foreman would give a state - ment about the condition of the work and the number of extra hours required .

		Then the men , taking new pride in the speediness of the work , often voted to stick by the job , even if it took all night .

		With this went a vote of increase of pay for the foreman .

		Under the old administration most of the workers had had to spend from one to three hours in coming to the factory .

		Only the old officials had quarters convenient to the
Port	LOCATION	.

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	immedi - ately started the building of new quarters for the workers .

		A host of new devices were introduced to promote the saving of time and to prevent the wast - ing of energy , with the consequent elevation of the esprit de corps .

		The long line of employees , waiting in turn to receive their pay envelopes , was abol - ished by appointing one man to receive the pay for every two hundred .

		They had an unfortunate experience in the selec - tion of one of these men , who was so constituted that he could resist everything but temptation .

		Having received the two hundred pay envelopes , he started out to distribute them and then thought better of it .

		No one knows how it happened .

		Part of the men said it must have been some devil of a bourgeois who whispered into the ears of this weak comrade and drove from his mind all thought of his family , his shop , his Soviet , and the Revolution .

		At any rate he was found later beside some empty vodka bottles with his pockets empty too .

		When he re - covered from his happiness he was broughrbefore the shop committee and charged with breach of Revolu - tionary honor and treason to the
Voenna Port	LOCATION	.

		The Grand Session of the Revolutionary Tribunal was held in the main shop with the
1500	DATE	men on the jury .

		The verdict was `` Guilty ! ''

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	then proposed that the jury should vote on one of the three following sentences : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Summary dis - missal and blacklisting , so that the culprit would be effectually barred from all further employment .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Dismissal , but the payment of his wages to his wife and children continued .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Pardon and re - instatement .

		They voted for proposition number two , thus attaching a definite stigma to his derelic - tion and at the same time sparing his family from suffering .

		But this did n't bring back the money to the unfortunate two hundred . '

		The men voted , thereupon , to take the loss upon themselves .

		The loss of the two hundred was evenly distributed among the whole fifteen hundred .

		THE DIAL 533 The verdict of the working-class upon the Soviet as an institution is that it has made good .

		Towards the mistakes and failures of the Soviet the attitude they take is the same a man takes towards his own mistakes and failures a very lenient one .

		Out of their experience the workers have gained confidence .

		They went far enough to know that they can organize industry .

		Having passed through the period of strife and discouragement , they began to feel a sense of elation at their own successes .

		They would have been still more elated had it not been for their enemies , who were constantly hatching some new conspiracy to kill their Soviet .

		Just as things were running well in the shop , the men were compelled to drop their tools and take up their rifles ; the railroads , instead of carrying food and implements , were compelled to carry ammuni - tion and troops .

		The workmen , instead of strength - ening and extending the new State apparatus , had to rally to the defense of the ground on which they stood .

		After
Kaledin	PERSON	and
Korniloff	PERSON	had been beaten the counter-revolutionary forces backed by foreign capi - tal put their hopes in
Semyenof	LOCATION	,
Orloff	PERSON	, and
Kalmi	PERSON	- koff .

		Regiments of officers , monarchists , adventur - ers , Khun-Khuz bandits , and Japanese mercenaries were formed in
Manchuria	LOCATION	and kept attacking the frontiers of the workingman 's republic .

		It was the regular detachments of the
Red Army	ORGANIZATION	that bore the brunt of these raids .

		As soon as the enemy broke through , the cry of `` The Socialist Fatherland is in danger ! ''

		was raised .

		Into every village and factory hurried the call to arms .

		Each formed its little detachment , and along the roads and pathways they marched up into the Man - churian Mountains , singing sometimes a revolution - ary hymn and sometimes folk songs of the village .

		Poorly equipped and poorly fed , they voluntarily advanced to pit themselves against a merciless foe , splendidly armed and trained .

		The
Red Army	ORGANIZATION	and the Red Guard showed a a manifest lack of the iron discipline of the regular national armies .

		But it had an elan which all others lacked .

		I talked much with these peasants and workers who for weeks had been lying out on the hillsides in the rain and the cold .

		`` What made you come and what keeps you here ? ''

		I asked .

		`` Well millions of us dark people , '' they replied , `` had to go out and die for the government of the Czar in the old days ; surely we should all be cowards if we did n't go out and fight for a government that is our own ! ''

		`` Our own government ! ''

		That was the expres - sion one constantly heard .

		The opportunity which the Soviets had thus given them to become masters of their own fate , rulers of their own life , is the reason why the workmen cherished their Soviet and why they had been ready to die for it .

		And this loyalty is not merely loyalty to an institution which gives them higher wages and shorter hours .

		It has a social and spiritual content .

		I remember a session of the
Vladivostok	LOCATION	Soviet when one of the Right was making a furious attack upon the Soviet at a time when the food rations had been limited .

		`` The Bolsheviks promised you lots of things , '' he said , `` but they did n't give them to you , did they ?

		They promised you bread , but where is it ?

		Where is the bread that .

		.

		? ''

		The words of the speaker were drowned in a storm of whistles and hisses .

		The devotion of the Russian workman to the Soviet is not based solely upon the material returns that are given to him .

		It has given him other values : a very human government a government which is the outgrowth of his other institutions the
Artel	ORGANIZATION	and the Mir , a government that he can understand , a government in which he feels a very present sense of ownership .

		In this last particularly lies the force which makes him a zealot for the Soviet .

		For the work - ingman is just like any other human being : he likes power .

		And once having tasted he is loath to let it go ; and once having lost it he strives for it again .

		As the Soviets are brought down by the Allied troops the Soviet becomes enthroned in the hearts of the masses .

		Every peasant and workman who falls before the Allied guns in the defense of the Soviet only roots deeper the loyalties to his institu - tion .

		The Soviet - is only silenced .

		It is not de - stroyed .

		It goes underground and becomes an object of religious devotion .

		f Supposing the Allies are able to smash the Soviets and then , proclaiming a grand philanthropy , go into
Russia	LOCATION	with all sorts of economic help .

		Sup - posing they pour into that country unlimited stores , Red Cross supplies , and railroad equipment .

		Will that satisfy the Russian workingmen and peasants ?

		Will that atone to them for the destruction of their Soviets ?

		Only those who are totally ignorant of the social significance of the Soviets can believe that , Only those who are unaware of the spiritual con - tent of the Revolution to the Russian masses will attempt to bribe them .

		`` The conquest of the Revolution '' one hears that over and over again .

		And that means not only the conquest of bread .

		It is the conquest over the houses and cities they live in , the shops and lands they work in , a conquest of government the Soviet .

		ALBERT
RHYS WILLIAMS	PERSON	.

		534 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	I A Story - Teller 's Holiday N A STORY-TELLER 'S HOLIDAY ,
George Moore	PERSON	's latest and nearest approach to the perfectly confi - dential -LRB- issued by
Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	for the
Irish Folklore Society	ORGANIZATION	; limited edition ,
$ 10	MONEY	-RRB- , our friend of deathless middle-age is discovered on a familiar scene .

		Self-revelation is taken up as easily as if it had never been dropped ; the old properties have scarcely needed a dusting .

		Moore Hall even looms again , and one gathers with sorrow that it is passing into other hands , though one is not very clear on the matter not unpleasantly clear and not confused at all .


Moore	PERSON	rid himself long since of that juggler 's ambition to keep more than one object in the air at a time , so that no perplexities hinder the soft satis - faction of things that are forever taking leave .

		Halfway through the book , reminiscence con - denses and takes shape in stories on a theme , or rather the refinement of a theme , which Boccaccio probably thought he had pretty well exhausted .

		It is not inappropriate that the Irish Renaissance should have found a new quill for this ancient itch .

		Boccaccio would have been envious ; but he might also have been impatient .


Moore	PERSON	's story of the temptation of the saints by the saints for the greater glory of
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	lingers along with as many tan - talizing pastoral interruptions as the story of Daphnis and
Chloe	PERSON	.

		And while
Moore	PERSON	, knowing Christian doctrine better than Longus , did not have to resort to an improbable innocence to stave off the event ,
Boccaccio	PERSON	would still have been impatient .

		A quotation here from
The Nuns of Crith Gaille	ORGANIZATION	may be of use : `` In - the South , '' said
Brother Marban	PERSON	, `` the blood is hotter than it is in the
North	LOCATION	.

		Ah ! ''

		the Mother Abbess grunted , `` true for you .

		It 's in holy
Ireland	LOCATION	only that strength is given to man to best temptation ; and now , for it 's getting late , which of us is going to ... '' But this is neither
Italy	LOCATION	nor
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		An American 's annoyance at
Moore	ORGANIZATION	's interrup - tions is likely to be more complex than an Italian 's , because the American is generally under more con - straint .

		In spite of his editors the American still has a taste for what is not entirely nice in literature .

		The influence of the editors , however , becomes evi - dent as soon as he makes up his mind to the plunge .

		Like a boy of twelve he will have had to assume much inward bravado ; his conscience will be sternly clamped down ; his heart will beat rapidly .

		And being finally ready for the worst , he will insist on having it unadulterated .

		Anything less than the worst will naturally seem an impertinence or even an insult .

		The only interruption that he could possibly excuse would be from the moral idea , the familiar moral idea which purifies vaudeville .

		Alas , in A Story-Teller 's Holiday the familiar moral idea is not to be found .

		What is not nice is interrupted by what is more or less beautiful an intolerable interruption .

		Would any American have looked for the clear singing finish to
The Nuns of Crith Gaille	ORGANIZATION	; would he be apt to like it ?

		Not at first .

		Later perhaps , he would remember the expurgated Odyssey of his high school days , and how when
Circe	ORGANIZATION	had changed the sailors back from swine into men they appeared `` taller than before they were , and hand - somer far , and pleasanter to look upon . ''

		In this way he would get back to the moral idea , though not exactly the familiar one .

		Let me hasten to add that probably no such moral idea was in
Moore	PERSON	's mind when he wrote The Nuns of
Crith Gaille	PERSON	, and that if it was there , he had it well under control .

		The mind of the reader is a different affair .

		One frequently hears of persons who claim to have been converted to a new and freer mode of life by one of
Moore	ORGANIZATION	's hovels or stories .

		Art 's misfortune it surely is to be open to `` interpre - tation '' at all hours of the night by the first comer with a prejudice , a prejudice sometimes that has hitherto gone unrecognized by its possessor .

		At the same time I am not going to set about correcting wrong impressions by trying to appreciate the ex - clusively artistic triumphs of these delicately joined indelicacies .

		For one thing it would be superfluous .

		Few writers are more frankly awake than
George Moore	PERSON	to the merits of their own work , and he has been at some pains to celebrate the fine points of each one of these stories .


Moore	PERSON	's self-celebrations always seem more trust - worthy than other people 's .

		- We can not doubt him when he tells us what part of a story is the best part , or when he tells us where the parts came from and how they were put together .

		De Gourmont and others have contradicted Foe 's account of how he wrote The Raven , but no one is likely to con - tradict
Moore	PERSON	as to his cool way with situations .

		And nothing in the stories contradicts him either .

		Indeed we have been aware for some time that he either could or would not commit himself in any prose narrative .

		His fortune is tied up ; it is no longer available as it once was for the risk of being ridiculous .

		Since particulars here would simply be confusing , I may leave everyone to think for himself of some early book of
Moore	ORGANIZATION	's that seems silly to him .

		This should be easy enough ; but to think of a later book of
Moore	ORGANIZATION	's , a book written since Hail
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 535 and Farewell , which seems silly will be more dif - ficult .

		In fact , as I said ,
Moore	PERSON	appears to have ceased altogether to run this salutary risk of being ridiculous , and equally he seems to have lost his ability to strike fire .

		Without trying further to connect these two observations , I will point to
The Brook Kerith	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is nothing silly in
The Brook Kerith	LOCATION	; it could no more be ridiculous than a well chosen collection .

		A collection of literary objets d'art it certainly is a marvelous collection adroitly disposed .

		Every bit of character , incident , scenery that appears in it is of the very highest quality .

		Yet one looks in vain for anything to equal the last heroic scene of
Esther Waters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Brook Kerith	ORGANIZATION	is held together by a sustained grayness such as we do not often find .

		In a measure
Moore	PERSON	's consistently gray palette is responsible for this not altogether agreeable effect , but only in a measure .

		Turgenev proved very well with his color - less intensity that grisaille in literature is capable of life and vibration .

		Intensity .

		Decidedly we shall have to fall back on this reliable tertium quid when we are finding fault with
The Brook Kerith	ORGANIZATION	and the stories of A Story-Teller 's Holiday .

		Where we can , however , we may as well be ex - plicit .


Moore	PERSON	's inadequacy when he comes to deal with people and atmospheres which he has never experienced is not anything one needs be vague about .

		Without a doubt he wanted to do the exotic and do it down to the ground .

		His ideas on transla - tion tell us as much .

		In The Confessions of a Young Man he announced that the translator had failed miserably who had failed to bring over even a little of the original 's strangeness .

		No detail seemed to him insignificant or obscure enough to permit any other than word for word translation .

		Perhaps his statement of this principle is exagger - ated exaggeration has been always his favorite way of showing his contempt for principles , even his own principles but the principle itself is a much health - ier one than that of the translators who were then in fashion .

		What a relief it is even now to turn to an interlinear after the sweetness and light of shall we say
Jowett	PERSON	's Plato !

		Unfortunately , writing The Brook
Kerith	PERSON	was hardly the same thing as translating .

		Moore had here to give new life to something which had never come within the range of any one of his keen five senses .

		The sixth romantic sense that should have helped him he had not at all .

		In its place was a fine literary sense , serviceable enough for arranging his own sensations , but of no use in gathering new sensations out of other people 's reports .

		In a few years The Brook
Kerith	PERSON	will probably be thought of if this is not too strong a verb as are
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's or
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	's South American tragedies .

		It will be remembered , without being read , as a classical writer 's attempt to be romantic .

		Nothing abso - lutely forbids such a writer an exotic subject ; onlj remoteness , if not a help , will surely be a hindrance .

		In Impressions and Opinions
Moore	PERSON	wrote about
Verlaine	PERSON	, whom he had met , and about
Rimbaud	PERSON	, whom he had never met .

		His remarks about the poems of both are sensible enough .

		But when he comes to the men , he does well by
Verlaine	PERSON	and badly by
Rimbaud	LOCATION	.

		Lies , per se , are sufficiently harmless but what lies !

		Rimbaud has immured himself forqver in a convent by the Red Sea .

		He has been seen digging the soil for the grace of God .

		`` The Mediaevalism of this strange story , '' says
Moore	PERSON	, letting the cat out of the bag with a sigh of literary contentment , `` has always had a singular fascination for me . ''

		A singular fascination it must have been , to have led its victim so frequently of late into regions where he was at a disadvantage with even so humble a romancer as
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		But the final touch in the picture of
Moore	PERSON	as connoisseur came when he began ostentatiously to rewrite his old books .

		Clearly it was a case of rearranging the collection .

		No author who regarded his work as sacred or inspired could have made such extensive changes .

		Turgenev in his old age was afraid that his sole touch would contaminate the work of his prime .

		On the other hand many authors who do not think their work sacred are still kept from revising it by a feeling quite as strong , a feeling of disgust .

		As soon as a book has left their hands it is dead ; the next stage is putrefaction .


Moore	PERSON	has no feelings of this sort either .

		His appraising eye regards failures and successes without awe and without repugnance .

		He does not hesitate to relate the intimate history of every one of his creations , even of those which were evidently conceived in sin .

		He is writing now , so he tells us in his preface , for men and women of letters , so that there is no danger of wounding sensitive feelings .

		Yet perhaps even to men and women of letters so much talk about incident , scenery , and character will seem unworthy in a generation which prides itself on having ban - ished the subject from painting .

		- Of course we may say that
Moore	PERSON	's interest in these things is as beautiful morally as the enthusiasm of an old gentleman at work in his garden ; but moral consolation is not the precise thing we arc looking for in A Story-Teller 's Holiday .

		What really makes up to us for the absence from these stories of epic grandeur , lyric intensity , and so forth is the extraneous matter which precedes and follows the stories , comes between and permeates 536 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	them .

		If the proposition which I have perhaps foolishly been trying to prove is true , and
Moore	PERSON	will never write another novel as good as
Esther Waters	PERSON	, the world is still not much the poorer .

		One novel is quite enough for a novelist to be sur - vived by , the number of good novels and stories even in English being really excessive .

		Not so with memoirs .

		Had
Moore	PERSON	filled A Story-Teller 's Holiday entirely with stories , he would not have had time to immortalize in a few words the Irish rebellion .

		And had he been busy with novels all this while , he would not have given the Irish Renais - sance a chance of being remembered for a long time after the greatest event in history has been for - gotten .

		Two , such writers off memoirs are not likely to be seen in the same fifty years , and unless
Moore	PERSON	turns his attention to the greatest event it may conceivably fail to take its place in history at all .

		Yet even such a calamity might seem providential to serious persons who remembered
Moore	PERSON	's habit of making whatever he writes about a little funny .

		This blight of absurdity is largely due to the shrinkage which things of great importance to the world undergo when they pass into
Moore	PERSON	's me - moirs .

		Here the author is the important thing , and it is natural that as objects get farther from him they should approach the vanishing point .

		From the center of the picture
Moore	PERSON	's concerns and unconcerns , his likes and dislikes , range away toward the horizon .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	once complained that
Moore	PERSON	had been careful to observe himself , his likes and dis - likes , from so many different angles that it was not possible to guess at his true nature .

		In this essay we seem to see Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	roaming hungrily in search of food for paradox .

		And we seem to see his inevitably logical mind , baffled at all points by unresisting fluidity , finally hitting upon
Moore	PERSON	's evi - dent desire to describe himself , as the only thing contradictable .

		Everywhere else
Moore	PERSON	had fore - stalled his by stating his own contradictions .

		For once however let us do the difficult thing and give Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	the benefit of a doubt .

		Per - haps in The Confessions of a Young Man he di - vined already what later was to become so clear in Hail and Farewell : that
Moore	PERSON	was anxious not so much to reveal himself as to form an opinion about himself , and then to confirm and promulgate it .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	may have foreseen this develop - ment without being able to put his disapproval where it belonged .

		Even so , there was not so very much cause for disapproval in the discovery that
Moore	PERSON	was making himself a pose or attitude .

		The bad odor attaching to these words is entirely of modern construction .

		The ancients regarded pose as the highest form of man 's creative activity ; even so recent a work as the Anglican Hymn Book seems to aim principally at making its readers self-conscious .

		If we pretend to despise a man as a poseur without regard to his pose , it is simply because we have become so false that it hurts us to talk frankly about our falseness .

		It goes without saying that everyone with imagina - tion acts a part , what sort of an exhibition he makes of himself depending on his taste and on the taste of his audience .


Moore	PERSON	, I suppose , is not posing , like the readers of the Anglican Hymn Book , for a crowd of invisible witnesses .

		Who can say ?

		Doubtless he is ^ his own audience and model .

		At the very most there should be so little conflict between
Moore	PERSON	's pose and his natural inclinations that our only possible objection to accepting his own account of himself would be that he did not tell the whole story .

		We might find it hard , for instance , to understand how a man could go so long unassassinated who invariably came out on top in conversation .

		But then , who really wants to know the whole story , and of what use is art anyway if it does not improve in some respect on life ?

		When we think of
Moore	PERSON	we always think of the feminine temperament passive , swayed by every impulse , yet parasitic , ungrateful , hard toward the world 's opinion , proud to be `` ashamed of noth - ing but of being ashamed . ''

		So he had described himself , and so he is to be known .

		With such an accommodating framework we might expect considerable vagaries .

		Yet when we look into the matter we find that even the details of
Moore	ORGANIZATION	's pose have remained unaltered since the beginning .

		There may have once been a time in the dim ages before The Confessions of a Young Man when
Moore	PERSON	admired Zola and said so .

		Later he said that he did so no longer ; and this is almost the last record of his having .

		publicly changed his mind .

		Admirably continuity , sometimes hard to under - stand .

		That a man should hate
Stevenson	PERSON	all his life long is comprehensible enough , but what are we to say of a man who never tires of praising Manet and Degas ?

		This self-consecrated sparrow of the love of girls is , when it comes to male artists , faith - ful as the swan .

		-LRB- My zoological parallel is not disagreeably meant , however . -RRB-


Moore	PERSON	's dislikes are not only more comprehensible than his admirations ; they are more influential , sounder .

		They might be described as the very soundest dislikes of the last fifty years in
England	LOCATION	.

		The dislikes of
Henley	LOCATION	,
Symons	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	, and others , including the academic critics , are as nothing compared with
Moore	PERSON	's , which are as vital now as they were when he first put them into the world , or
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 537 more correctly into
England	LOCATION	.


Moore	PERSON	is the
Sainte	PERSON	- Beuve of his generation in
England	LOCATION	, a creator of values , negative values a sort of negative Sainte-Beuve .

		Need one argue that a negative Sainte-Beuve , if not actually better than a positive one , is still better than no Sainte-Beuve at all ?

		Granted that many of
Moore	PERSON	's dislikes were from
Paris	LOCATION	, is it not to his credit that he made them a part of himself , and a part of the best critical thought that is being expressed in English today ?

		The dis - like of
Huysman	PERSON	's for ideas in literature , which that bleak American aristocrat , Mr.
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	, was lately airing who brought it across the Channel if it was not
Moore	PERSON	?

		, Let us also remember that
Moore	PERSON	did something for us , and be thankful : ``
Henry James	PERSON	, '' he said , `` went to
France	LOCATION	and read
Turgenev	LOCATION	;
W. D. Howells	PERSON	stayed at home and read
Henry James	PERSON	. ''

		In comparison with such immortal dislikes ,
Moore	PERSON	's admirations seem a little trivial , and one suspects that he is not wholly unconscious of this bad impression .

		There may have been a time , as I said , when he really admired Zola and Balzac and Manet and the rest .

		That he turned on Zola so frankly was partly Zola 's fault .

		But the others have got off little better .

		As
Moore	PERSON	's pose devel - oped , serious admirations became more and more burdensome .

		To free himself he resorted to a method more tender than the one he had used with Zola , but no less sure .

		The case of Balzac is - typical .

		How many times has
Moore	PERSON	praised Balzac with luxuriant praises ?

		How many times has he repeated Balzac 's story of the Spanish nobleman who was compelled to chop off the heads of all his relatives ?

		Moore knows as well as the next man that this story is not one that will stand retelling , still less repeating .

		Yet here it is again in A Story - Teller 's Holiday , related with as much high serious - ness as ever .

		Thus gently and surely does
Moore	PERSON	disengage himself from the clutch of his admira - tions , so gently and so surely that before we are aware that anything is happening , a great man has vanished utterly , and in his place is left only the glow of a splendid insincerity .

		Turgenev alone has so far eluded this apocolocyn - tosis ; he is still
Moore	PERSON	's better self , the only sign of a divided allegiance .

		In time he too will magically go the way of the rest , and the grandest pose of our age will be without a flaw .

		WATSON >
JR A League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	and Economic Freedom A .

		LTHOUGH the previous articles in this series have asserted that the hopeful approach to a concert of nations is along the economic road which should aim to further common interests , rather than by the negative and legal road which should content itself with litigation and the adjudication of disputes , the problem of the economic equality of nations , which constitutes the third of President
Wilson	PERSON	's conditions -LRB- and with which any real adjustment of colonial problems is bound up -RRB- has been reserved for this concluding article .

		What does `` equality of trade conditions '' mean , and how is it to be achieved and guaranteed ?

		The President has contributed to clarification of the ` thesis .

		It precludes economic boycotts and selfish economic combinations ; it pre - cludes , as he unequivocally states , all preferential trade arrangements .

		Access to raw materials may be assumed to mean guarantees of outlet to the sea , with the free ports and the internationalized railways and watercourses necessary for adequate commercial use of such ports .

		But obviously equalization of trade conditions among nations demands something more .

		It has been demonstrated that more is needed to secure freedom and equality of conditions be - tween individuals than to declare them legally all free and equal , while leaving them to unrestricted competition with one another .

		Immense inequality of power is ^ compatible with formal equality .

		The same thing will surely develop with respect to any merely legal equality among nations .

		Certain natiops have a tremendous superiority in population , natural resources , technical progress in industry , command of credit , and shipping .

		Nothing better calculated to develop actual inequality of trade re - lationship among natiorft could well be found than a system which set up a nominal mathematical equality and then threw matters practically into the hands of the present big nations .

		Under the old regime it was at least an object for every power - ful state to attach to itself and its sphere of influence a certain number of the smaller and weaker states .

		To some extent the former were compelled to bid , by grant of economic concessions , for the support of the latter .

		A
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	which deprived economically weak states of all the advantages as well as disadvantages of the old system of groupings would merely leave them to be devoured by the competition with one another of the three or four big states of the world .

		This may account for the fact that as yet nations 538 THE DIAL like
Spain	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	have not been seen to manifest enthusiasm for the project of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		How can they be sure that , in effect , it is not a combination of , say , the
United States	LOCATION	and the British Empire , with incidental concessions to
France	LOCATION	, to control the commerce of the world , and to achieve , with no violation whatever of political equality , virtual subjugation of all other peoples ?

		The question doubtless puts the matter with harsh exaggeration , but it suggests that a nation like , say ,
Italy	LOCATION	can not be expected to engage heartily in the new system of international organization unless she has some assurance in details as to how her economic interests are to be protected .

		Her primary question and that of other nations similarly situated will be : does the new system enable the more powerful peoples to take advantage of our weaknesses , or will it be so constituted as not merely to reenforce whatever strong points we possess with respect to the world 's markets , but actually to make good our deficiencies ?

		Shall we be given legally guaranteed access to coal and iron , but exacted at the highest prices that the market will bear -LRB- including a virtual monopoly of the world 's shipping by other nations -RRB- , or will administrative commissions of the League equitably survey the whole field and see to it that we get that relative share of the world 's resources which an adequate development of our own powers requires ?

		Shall we have to compete under onerous terms for the world 's capital and credit , or will there be some assurance that credit will be equitably assigned to us for , say , such a development of our own hydroelectric power as will make us less eco - nomically dependent upon the very nations which supply the credit ?

		Such questions may seem to answer themselves .

		They may appear to exact a spirit not merely of justice but of altruism toward economically weak peoples , which it is hopelessly Utopian to forecast .

		Even so , the questions are * worth putting even if only to suggest that the basic problems of an effect - ive
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	involve more than a sur - render of that arbitrary irresponsible political power we call national sovereignty , that they also involve surrender of ruthless economic activities which , to last analysis , rest only upon the possession of superior power due to accidents of position and history .

		But after all , the questions do not assume a fantastic altruism on the part of the bigger nations .

		They do assume , however , an enlightened self-interest en - lightened enough to see that some price must be paid for an adequate guarantee against the recur - rence of wars which , even when valued in the most materialistic of cash terms , are indefinitely more costly than the charges imposed by the economic self-restriction in question .

		Not only this , but also enlightened enough to look ahead and weigh the advantages of trade , extended over a long period , with a nation growing in internal prosperity , against immediate trade profits based upon taking advan - tages of a nation 's needs and calculated to keep it in industrial subjection .

		For in the long run this is the only question .

		Does trade flourish better and pay better with a weak and impoverished customer or with one having increasing wants because of increasing power to supply them ?

		This , in last resort , is the question of a narrow protectionism versus an intelligent free trade .

		And thus we arrive , although perhaps by an unexpected route , at the heart of the question of the meaning of equality of trade conditions and the removal , as far as possible , of economic barriers .

		The classic doctrine of international free trade was hopelessly defective in that it entirely overlooked the need of intelligent supervision and positively controlling action if real equality of conditions is to be secured .

		The classic doctrine was bound up with the dogma of laissez faire among nations , and that doctrine was bound to work as fatally applied to nations as when applied to the relation of indi - viduals .

		The doctrine rested upon the fantastically unreal theological doctrine of the goodness of Nature when left to herself , and of the natural harmony of interests .

		It ignored the fact that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	means only the existent distribution of power , and that to fall back on the existent dis - tribution of relative strength and weakness in the present world of states is to leave the destiny of the world at the mercy of rapacious economic prowess .

		Against such a dogma the protective policy has stood , however stupidly , for the need of some kind of human direction of natural forces .

		In other words , any practicable and any desirable general adoption of a policy of international free trade means the development of powerful inter - national administrative commissions dealing with such matters as equality of labor standards , the regulation of shipping , and , for some time to come , of food , raw materials , and immigrants , and above all of the exportation of capital and the distribution of the available credit of the world .

		Equality of trade conditions means equalization of conditions ; it can not be secured without giving to the mainte - nance of peace the same kind of intense intellectual labor , study , and foresight which has gone to the conduct of the war the same in kind , but con - tinued and persistent as well as comprehensive and impartial in scope .

		If a particular nation would gain in trade by keeping up low labor standards , then there must be power to penalize the commerce
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 539 of that nation as a means of equalization .

		If it overstimulates science and industry along lines cal - culated to make other nations dependent upon it at a critical juncture as
Germany	LOCATION	developed the dye industry as an adjunct to explosives then that must be dealt with as an international government would deal with an excess cultivation of an armed force .

		The problem is indeed difficult and complex .

		But its solution is not Utopian .

		It requires , let it be repeated , exactly the same kind of cooperating ability of experts of all sorts which within a year took
America	LOCATION	from a peace basis to an effective war basis .

		The mobilization of the necessary variety and scale of forces was possible because of the faith and devotion behind the cause .

		That is the issue which faces the world , and especially the
United States	LOCATION	, with respect to the organization of the world on the basis of international democracy .

		The resources and abilities are at hand , if we choose to use them .

		The question is as to the depth and endurance of our desire .

		JOHN DEWEY .

		The New Forces in British Labor B RITISH TRADE UNIONISM , not unlike American Trade Unionism , is conservative not only in tem - perament but also in form of organization .

		It has a long history behind it , and with the lapse of time it has accumulated traditions and vested interests which are difficult to dislodge .

		It has adapted itself painfully and imperfectly to the changing industrial conditions and its power of resistance to change is so great that movements of innovation are virtu - ally compelled to begin as `` rebel '' movements , with something like defiance of constituted
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	authority .

		Were the leaders of Trade Unionism men of wide sympathy and imagination there is little doubt that these `` rebel '' movements could be absorbed with comparatively little dislocation into the body of the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	movement ; and even as things are , the process of absorption is slowly taking place .

		Sooner or later
British Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	- ism will settle down to new forms of organization and new lines of policy , but the slowness of the change and the constant struggle which accompanies it are sorely hampering Labor in dealing with the problems of Reconstruction .

		The new forces which have arisen in the
British Labor	ORGANIZATION	movement during the war are mainly of two kinds .

		First there are the various organized `` rank and file movements '' of an unofficial character which have come into prominence during the war period ; and second there is the huge growth in the organiza - tion of the less skilled male workers and of women .

		Both these groups of forces will necessitate large changes alike in the structure , in the administration , and in the policy of Trade Unionism ; but the change will certainly not be accomplished in time for the period of Reconstruction .

		Nevertheless the new forces , though they will not have settled down into their future place in the machinery of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	- ism , will inevitably , even in their half-organized state , exercise a most powerful influence upon the resettlement of industry .

		The two groups of forces to which I have re - ferred are essentially different , though they
spring	DATE	to some extent from a common impulse .

		The first group is in the main a movement among workers who were already organized before the war towards a new form of organization ; the second is in the main a movement towards organization among workers who were previously unorganized .

		The first is to a considerable extent a movement away from the old `` defensive '' idea of Trade Union pur - pose towards a new `` offensive '' idea of the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	as the nucleus for a new form of industrial control ; the second is still largely a movement of mutual defense among workers who have hitherto lacked even the elements of organized self-protec - tion .

		But , while this is true in the main , the move - ment among the less skilled workers is also accompanied by a `` rank and file '' movement within itself , in which the offensive idea of the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	as a nucleus for workers ' control of industry is largely present .

		Thus the two movements , while they remain distinct , interpenetrate and join hands on many points .

		The rise of these new forces presents at once dangers and reasons for hope to
British Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		If they can be effectively combined into a single move - ment , the whole force of the British Labor move - ment will be enormously increased .

		If on the other hand the growing tension between the skilled and the less skilled workers develops into open conflict in the period after the war , it is only possible at the best to look for a final reconciliation and strength - ening of forces at the end of a long period of disorganization and defeat .

		It is too soon to say which of these things will happen , but the outlook can not be regarded as hopeful , despite the forces in both groups which are working for reconciliation .

		54 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	The outstanding development of organization among the skilled workers during the war period is the shop stewards ' movement .

		This movement , while it is not wholly new , has during the war assumed new forms , which have very largely changed its character .

		For many years before the war it was the practice for certain Trade Unions in certain districts to appoint , in addition to the ordinary
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	officials , workshop stewards , or delegates , in the various factories .

		The principal duty of these stewards was to see that newcomers joined the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and that members paid their con - tributions promptly .

		In most cases they had no power of negotiation on behalf of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, though in a few trades their functions were wider and an able man could raise the post of steward to a certain degree of importance .

		On the whole it may be said that before the war , while the shop steward existed as an institution , he had shown few signs of the importance which he has acquired during the war .

		Abnormal conditions have no doubt had much to do with the rapid growth of the shop stewards ' movement during the war .

		The rapid changes in workshop organization , due to changes in productive methods and to the growth of dilution , the restric - tive conditions imposed by the Munitions of War Acts and other war-time enactments , and the gen - eral intensification of industrial life , have all given rise to a large number of workshop problems calling for immediate action and solution .

		Moreover war - time conditions have to some extent hampered the freedom of the official
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	movement and , by increasing its remoteness irom workshop life , have forced the `` rank and file '' workers to the im - provisation of a substitute .

		Thus , while the crea - tion of official shop stewards of the old type has gone on apace , there has also sprung into prominence a new type of steward , unofficial or at the most semi-official , arrogating to himself considerably wider powers ; and the growth of this type of stewards has operated to cause an extension in the powers of stewards of the old official type .

		Thus there has grown up , in most important fac - tories , a body of shop stewards only imperfectly coordinated with the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	movement out - side the workshops .

		Nor has the new movement stopped short at this point .

		The `` rank and file '' stewards from the various factories in a district have come together to form a local Shop Stewards ' and
Workers ' Committee	ORGANIZATION	, which has in some cases become a powerful rival to the official District Com - mittees of the various Trade Unions .

		And finally , repeated and more or less successful attempts have been made to link up the various Workers ' Com - mittees in a single national `` rank and file '' organi - zation , independent in its action of the national Trade Unions to which its members continue to belong .

		The policy of the Shop Stewards ' and Workers ' Committee movement has been throughout aggres - sive and militant .

		It is a `` rank and file '' organiza - tion in revolt against the slowness and sectionalism of official Trade Unionism .

		In particular its members stand for amalgamation of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	forces , and for the supersession of a narrow Craft Unionism by broader forms of organization by in - dustry or class .

		One of the greatest obstacles to efficient
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	action during the war has lain in the multiplicity of competing and often hostile Trade Unions , and the difficulty of securing a common policy among these Unions has '' been one of the principal factors in forcing the shop stewards ' movement into unofficial lines .

		Officialism has too often meant also sectionalism and lack of coordina - tion ; and consequently movements based on a wider idea than that of craft are almost forced to be un - official , at least in their early stages .

		Such is the shop stewards ' movement which the war has created .

		It remains to see what will come out of it .

		Already it has won a certain measure of official recognition .

		A number of the principal en - gineering Trade Unions have signed an unsatis - factory agreement with the Engineering Employers ' Federation providing for the recognition of shop stewards in workshop negotiations .

		By far the largest
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	concerned , the
Amalgamated Society of Engineers	ORGANIZATION	, refused to be a party to this agreement , but is now negotiating for a fuller measure of recognition on the same lines .

		And with recognition of shop stewards by the employers necessarily goes the recognition of shop stewards by the Trade Unions themselves , as an essential part of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	official machinery .

		The shop stewards , then , are certainly destined to play an important part in the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	move - ment after the war .

		What , we must ask , is their real significance ?

		It lies in their position as repre - sentatives directly chosen by the Trade Unionists in the various workshops and factories .

		The whole orientation of the new forces in the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	world is towards the securing by Labor of a greater measure of control over the actual conduct of in - dustry .

		As soon as this demand for control begins to translate itself from theory into practice it must asume a `` workshop '' form .

		The only place in which Trade Unionists can effectively begin to exercise control is in the workshops .

		The real significance , therefore , of the shop stew - ards ' movement lies in the fact that it does provide at least the nucleus of the machinery through which THE DIAL Trade Unionists can hope , by gradual extensions of their power , to assume control in the workshops .

		It may be agreed that it is at present ill-prepared for any such drastic step ; but wherever the move - ment shows real signs of stability the more far - seeing stewards are beginning to work out the immediate problems of control .

		This is the case especially where systems of payment by results are in operation ; for the demand is being made by the more constructive stewards that the working of such systems shall pass , by way of collective bargain - ing , into the hands of workshop committees con - sisting of stewards directly representing the workers employed in the shops .

		Another demand of immedi - ate workshop importance is that the appointment of charge-hands and workshop foremen shall be trans - ferred from the management to the workers em - ployed in the shops ; that is , virtually , that the shop stewards shall take the place of the foremen ap - pointed by the management .

		Whatever the immediate fate of these proposals may be , there can be no doubt that the effect of the shop stewards ' emergence will be seen in a far greater concentration - of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	activity on problems of workshop control , and a consequently greater orientation of the whole -
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	movement in the direction of control .

		The only thing that can prevent a considerable increase in
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	control over industry after the war is dissension in the ranks of the workers .

		The chances that this dissension will be avoided we shall be better able to estimate when we haye discussed the second new movement of the war period the growth of organization and consciousness among the less skilled workers and its effects upon relations be - tween the less skilled workers and the skilled crafts - men who form the greater part of the shop stewards ' movement .

		This problem must be reserved for an - other article .

G. D. H. COLE	PERSON	.

		Sauce for the Gander and Sawdust for the Goose IF , AS SOME critics assert , literature tends to be - come unduly feminized , a balance in the arts may be considered struck by the masculinization of the theater .

		In this particular connection the theater is not to be understood as the drama , which in its highbrow connotation may be considered a near rela - tion to literature and perhaps tarred with the same brush by the devitalizing feminine hand .

		The theater from another aspect is the commercial under - taking that maintains a `` full house '' and makes `` good money . ''

		It is seldom that `` the play 's the thing '' that does this .

		It is more often the `` show , '' and our most frequented theaters are filled by shows .

		We have been sated with comments on the extent to which the senses of the tired business man are titivated by the girl and music show .

		Less obvious perhaps is the nature of the appeal to what may pass for his mind .

		Yet it is here that the discerning eye may observe in operation the creative genius of those practical psychologists who are carrying on their experiments in the laboratory of the theater .

		If the appeal to the senses through the song and dance were all that is required by the elements of human nature catered to , then the old vaudeville performance would answer the purpose .

		But as man , even in the state of mental dilapidation that succeeds the daily grind , is a reasoning or more accurately , a rationalizing being his complete sat - isfaction demands food for the spirit as well as for the flesh .

		The show therefore remains in essence a play .

		It is hung upon a framework , however flimsy , of plot ; and the exhibition of the human body in action , figures however grotesquely the opera - tions of the human mind .

		Even the songs and dances are about something , be it something less than nothing .

		The types of human beings portrayed have some verisimilitude and stimulate emotional reactions of sympathy or antipathy , admiration or contempt , attraction or repulsion .

		They must above all , unless unwelcome mental effort is applied , make easily possible the identification of the auditor with the actor .

		What the theatergoer craves is the infan - tile gratification of saying to himself , like a child with eagerly stabbing finger in a picture book , `` That 's me . ''

		The princess
Mathilde	PERSON	expressed what everyone feels when she confessed , `` Je n'aime que les romans dont je voudrais etre F heroine . ''

		The play is the phantasy acted by ` real instead of imag - inary figures the daydream come true .

		But as it is only the young or those confirmed in perpetual youth by the fixative of a supreme egotism who can readily picture themselves as brave and beautiful , ' the world of the theater can offer greater compensa - tions for the deficiencies of the world of reality by refraining from too much idealization of the human nature that is to be pandered to .

		The competent authors and actors who devote their talents to these psychological subtleties with an eye single to the emotional satisfaction of their sex , seem to overlook completely the fact that 542 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	women as well as men frequent the theater , and that they also have emotions which seek an outlet denied or limited by real life .

		Passing over the obvious failure of the lips or the legs of the chorus girl in any scheme for satisfying the senses of women spectators , let us consider the types of speaking parts devised to make their appeal to mind and heart .

		Almost any one of a dozen comedies to be seen and heard at any one time in our metropolitan playhouses would serve as an illustration .

		Take for instance the one where the leading lady a young person whose face , figure , voice , and clothes make her the cynosure of every masculine eye evidences a total indifference to the suit of an entrancing French aviator , equipped with a smart outfit , a glorious physique , a fascinating manner , a melodious voice , an engaging accent , and apparently all the physical , and intellectual , perfec - tions that characterize these supermen , enhanced by the mysterious charm of the Latin a figure in short to thrill the soul of any woman .

		x To this paragon the heroine perversely prefers a homely commonplace civilian , who offends the feminine eye in a ridicu - lous costume , boasts of feats that he has never per - formed , exhibits physical and moral cowardice and ineptitude , and is altogether insignificant and despic - able .

		This contemptible little whippersnapper not only wins the leading lady but captivates all the pretty chorus girls , while the embodiment of every manly virtue and Gallic allurement is left stranded at the fall of the curtain without the conquest of so much as a supernumerary on the stage .

		The tired business man for whose relaxation and restoration this edifying production is designed doubtless derives ample satisfaction in the spirit and in the flesh .

		His senses are pleasantly titivated by the twinkling toes of a score of pretty girls , and the cravings of his soul are sated by what is dished up as the plot .

		Since he is himself probably possessed of insignificant personal charms , common - place intellect , and undistinguished character , he finds it pleasing that the leading man in the comedy should be an individual of similar if not inferior type and should be preferred by the embodiment of all feminine fascination to a man who represents youth , beauty , and heroism .

		He is thus enabled to bask in the warm confidence that since the best is none too good for the likes of him , or for one to ` whom he can without undue vanity feel himself su - perior , this is indeed the best of all possible worlds where , even if none but the brave deserves the fair , none but the coward gets her , and where self - criticism is superfluous .

		But what of the woman condemned to sit through such a representation of human psychology ?

		To her the capers of the chorus girls are not alluring but menacing , and the charms of the leading lady are not a stimulant but a depressant , since they discour - agingly realize a degree of physical perfection to which she can not aspire .

		That such a paragon of unattainable fascination as the heroine should fall in love at first sight with a man as commonplace as her own husband or lover , produces uneasy reflec - tions as to the type of woman his type of man may so readily command , and speculations as to the effect of such an exhibition on his personal regard for her .

		In so far as she is able to identify herself with the beautiful lady on the stage , she finds her emo - tional outlet blocked by the creature 's perverse pref - erence for the inferior masculine type .

		Her atten - tion strays from the caricature of manhood in the center of the stage to the real hero and prince in dis - guise , near the wings .

		Her heart cries out to the lady actress : `` Have you eyes ?

		Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed , And batten on this moor ?

		Ha !

		Have you eyes ? ''

		Apparently ladies of the stage , when professionally engaged in the performance of man-made plays , have n't eyes ; but the ladies of the audience , like the men , have eyes and also the usual outfit of normal instincts .

		Every ordinary masculine emotion is catered to by these girl and music shows , but what sop is thrown to the starved feminine hanger-on ?

		This feast of unreason is for her a famine .

		As show girls have become more showy , leading men have become steadily more insignificant .

		It is no longer demanded that an actor should have even passably good looks , though beauty is indispensable to the actress .

		Of course women , with their larger tolerance in such matters , can love men who are not handsome , on as well as off the stage .

		To them the beauty that is preferred is not of the face but of the mind .

		But they do like a man to be manly especially on the stage .

		They like to look up to men rather than down on them on the stage .

		The feminine plot is
King Cophetua	LOCATION	and the Beggar Maid ; the masculine , Beauty and the
Beast	LOCATION	.

		It was to this sad pass , from the feminine point of view , that the theater had come when the war , the solvent as well as the compounder of human difficulties , brought on the boards plays subtly if unintentionally devised to satisfy the emotional de - mands of women .

		There began to appear the so - called `` recruiting play , '' and before the entranced gaze of women 's eyes the hitherto girl-infested stage became filled with noble specimens of manhood , handsome , well built , athletic creatures , beautifully caparisoned in khaki , navy or horizon blue men marching , men in trenches , men going over the top
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 543 in No ` Man 's Land , in hospitals , invalided home , armless , legless , wounded , blinded , shell-shocked , and dying men but men , brave men , merry men , adorable men real men !

		Look about over the audience at one of these plays when the lights go up , and when the lights are down listen to the music of the fountains of falling tears .

		It is a great religious revival , an orgy of feminine emotion .

		The only men present under forty are in uniform .

		Others would be uncom - fortable .

		If the purpose of the representation was recruiting , it must have been fulfilled by means of the `` indirect influence '' of which so much was heard in ante-suffrage days .

		A careful scrutiny of the audi - ence would indicate that the closest relation that most of those present could have to a possible recruit would be that of aunt .

		It is a gathering of women weeping for the men they have not got .

		The beau - tiful soldier-actor on the piano stool , a `` real '' soldier , recognizes what he is up against .

		He en - courages the audience to join in the chorus of a trench song with a jaunty `` tune up girls . ''

		The `` girls '' tune up , and the men 's chorus on the stage gives way before the chorus girls in the orchestra .

		f. Women have at last , thanks to the war , per angusta ad augusta , come into their own .

		It is again possible , as in Elizabethan days , to witness a play where the players are all or practically all men .

		This reform in the drama should be perpetuated .

		Here is a permanent after-war career for large num - bers of its survivors .

		The profession of stage hero and chorus man in reminiscent war-plays should attract those who become physically or mentally un - fitted for the exactions of industrial or commercial life .

		The equal rights that women demand should include equality of opportunity for emotional sat - isfaction in the musical comedy of the future , and in the public utility or futility of the theater .

VIDA CLARKE	PERSON	.

		The Modern Point of View and the New Order v .

		THE VESTED INTERESTS ARE certain saving clauses in common use among persons who speak for that well-known order of pecuniary rights and obligations which the mod - ern point of view assumes as `` the natural state of man . ''

		Among them are these : `` given the state of the industrial arts '' ; `` other things remaining the same '' ; `` in the long run '' ; `` in the absence of dis - turbing causes . ''

		It has been the praiseworthy en - deavor of the votaries of established law and custom to hold fast the good old plan on a strategic line of interpretation resting on these provisos .

		There have been painstaking elucidations of what is funda - mental and intrinsic in the way of human institu - tions , of what essentially ought to be , and of what must eventually come to pass in the natural course of time and change , as it is believed to run along under the guidance of those indefeasible principles that make up the modern point of view .

		And the disquieting incursions of the new order have been disallowed as not being of the essence of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's contract with mankind , within the constituent prin - ciples of the modern point of view .

		Now , as has already been remarked in an earlier paper , the state of the industrial arts has at no time continued unchanged during the modern era ; conse - quently other things have never remained the same ; and in the long run the outcome has always been shaped by the disturbing causes .

		All this reflects no discredit on the economists and publicists who so have sketched out the natural run of the present and future , since their reservations have not been observed .

		The arguments have been as good as the premises on which they proceed , and the premises have once been good enough to command unques - tioning assent , although that is now some time ago .

		The fault appears to lie in the unexampled shifty behavior of the latter-day facts .

		But however shifty , these facts , too , are as stubborn as others of their kind .

		The system of free competition , self-help , equal opportunity , and free bargaining , which is contem - plated by the modern point of view , assumes an industrial situation in which the work and trading of any given individual or group can go on freely by itself , without materially helping or hindering the equally untrammeled working of the rest .

		It has of course always been recognized that the coun - try 's industry makes up something of a connected system , so that there would necessarily be some degree of mutual adjustment and accommodation among the many self-sufficient working units which together would make up such an industrial com - munity ; but these working units have been con - ceived to be so nearly independent of one another that the slight measure of running adjustment 544 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	needed could be sufficiently taken care of by free competition in the market .

		This assumption has of course never been altogether sound , at any stage in the industrial advance ; but it has at least been within speaking distance of facts so late as the eighteenth century .

		It was a possible method of keeping the balance in the industrial system before the coming of the machine industry .

		Quite evi - dently it commended itself to the enlightened com - mon sense of that time as a sufficiently workable ideal so much so that it then appeared to be the most practical solution of the industrial and social difficulties which beset that generation .

		It is fairly to be presumed that the plan would have been suf - ficiently workable if the conditions which then pre - vailed had continued unchanged , if other things had remained the same .

		That was , in effect , before the coming of the machine technology and the later growth of population .

		But as it runs today , according to the new indus - trial order set afoot by the machine technology , the carrying-on of the community 's industry is not well taken care of by the loose corrective control that is exercised by a competitive market .

		That method is too slow , at the best , and too disjointed ; besides which , it does not work .

		The industrial system is now a wide-reaching organization of mechanical processes which work together on a comprehensive interlocking plan of give and take , in which no one section , group , or individual unit is free to work out ts own industrial salvation except in active copart - nership with the rest , and the whole of which runs on as a moving equilibrium of forces in action .

		This system of interlocking processes and mutually de - pendent working units is a more or less delicately balanced affair .

		Evidently the system has to be taken as a whole , and evidently it will work at its full productive capacity only on condition that the coordination of its interlocking processes be main - tained at a faultless equilibrium , and only when its constituent working units - are allowed to run full and smooth .

		But a moderate derangement will not put it out of commission .

		It will work at a lower efficiency , and continue running , in spite of a very considerable amount of dislocation as is habitually the case today .

		At the same time any reasonably good working efficiency of the industrial system is conditioned on a reasonably good coordination of these working forces , such as will allow each and several of the working units to carry on at the fullest working capacity that will comport with the unhampered working of the system as a balanced whole .

		But evidently , too , any dislocation , derangement , or re - tardation of the work at any critical point which comes near saying at any point in this balanced system of work will cause a disproportionately large derangement of the whole .

		The working units of the industrial system are no longer independent of one another under the new order .

		This state of things would reasonably suggest that the control of the industrial system had best be entrusted to men skilled in these matters .

		The industrial system does its work in terms of mechan - ical efficiency , not in terms of price .

		It should accordingly seem reasonable to expect that its con - trol would be entrusted to men experienced in the ways and means of technology , men who are in the habit of thinking about these matters in such terms as are intelligible to the engineers .

		However , by historical necessity the discretionary control in all that concerns this highly technological system of industry has come to vest in those persons who are highly skilled in the higgling of the market .

		And so great is the stability of that system of law and custom by grace of which these persons claim this power , that any disallowance of their control over the material fortunes of the community is now scarcely within reason .

		All the while the pro- gressive , shifting of ground in the direction of a more thoroughly mechanistic organization of indus - try goes on and works out into a more and more searching standardization of works and methods and a more exacting correlation of industries , in an ever increasingly large and increasingly sensitive indus - trial system .

		All the while the whole of it grows less and less manageable by business methods ; and with every successive move the control exercised by the business men in charge grows wider , more arbitrary , and more inconsistent with the common good .

		The businesslike manager 's attention is continu - ually more taken up with `` the financial end '' of the concern 's interests , so that by enforced neglect he is necessarily leaving more of the details of shop man - agement and supervision of the works to subordi - nates , largely to subordinates who have some knowl - edge of technological matters and no immediate interest in the run of the market .

		But the larger and final discretion , which affects the working of the industrial system as a whole , or the orderly management of any considerable group of industries within the general system all that is still under the immediate control of the businesslike managers , each of whom works for his own concern 's gain , without much afterthought .

		The final discretion still rests with the businesslike directorate of each concern the owner or the board even in all ques -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 545 tions of physical organization and technical man - agement , although this businesslike control of the details of production necessarily comes to little else than acceptance , rejection , or revision of measures proposed by the men immediately in charge of the works , together with a constant check on the rate and the volume of output with a view to the market .

		Hence in the large mechanical industries , which set the pace for the rest and which are organized on a standardized and more or less automatic plan , the current oversight of production by their business - like directorate does not effectually extend much be - yond the regulation of the output with a view to what the traffic will bear ; and in this connection there is very little that the business men in charge can do except to keep the output short of productive capacity by so much as the state of the market seems to require ; it does not lie within their competency to increase the output beyond that point , or to in - crease the productive capacity of their works , except by way of giving the technical men permission to go ahead and do it .

		The business man 's place in the economy of nature is to `` make money , '' not to produce goods .

		The production of goods is a mechanical process , incidental to the making of money , whereas the making of money is a pecuniary operation , carried on by bargain and sale , not by mechanical appliances and powers .

		The business men make use of the mechanical appliances and powers of the industrial system , but they make a pecuniary use of them .

		And in point of fact the less use a business man can make of the mechanical appliances and powers under his charge , and the smaller a product he can contrive to turn out for a given return in terms of price , the better it suits his purpose .

		The highest achievement in business is the nearest approach to getting something for nothing .

		What any given business concern gains must come out of the total output of productive industry , of course ; and to that extent any given business concern has an inter - est in the continued production of goods .

		But the less any given business concern can contrive to give for what it gets , the more profitable its own traffic will be .

		Business success means `` getting the best of the bargain . ''

		The common good , so far as it is a question of material welfare , is evidently best served by an unhampered working of the industrial system at its ' full capacity , without interruption or dislocation .

		But it is equally evident that the owner or manager of any given concern or section of this industrial system may be in a position to gain something for himself at the cost of the rest by obstructing , retard - ing , or dislocating this working system at some crit - ical point in such a way as will enable him to get the best of the bargain in his dealings with the rest .

		This appears constantly in the altogether usual , and altogether legitimate , practice of holding out for a better price .

		So also in the scarcely less usual , and ' no less `` legitimate , practice of withholding needed ground or right of way , or needed materials or in - formation , from a business rival .

		All these things are usual and a matter of course , because business management under the conditions created by the new order of industry is in great part made up of just these things .

		Indeed , sabotage of this kind is indispensable to any large success in industrial business .

		However , it is well to call to mind that the com - munity will still be able to get along , perhaps even to get along very tolerably , in spite of a very appre - ciable volume of sabotage of this kind even though it does reduce the net productive capacity to a frac - tion of what it would be in the absence of all this interference and retardation ; for the current state of the industrial arts is highly productive .

		So much so that in spite of all this deliberate waste and confusion that is set afoot in this way for private gain , there still is left over an absolutely large residue of net production over cost .

		The com - munity still has something to go on .

		The available margin of free income that is to say , the margin of production over cost is still wide , so th * at it allows a large latitude for playing fast and loose with the community 's livelihood .

		Now these businesslike maneuvers of deviation and delay are by no means to be denounced as being iniquitous or unfair , although they may have an unfortunate effect on the conditions of life for the common man .

		That is his misfortune , which law and custom count on his bearing with becoming fortitude .

		These are the ordinary and approved means of carrying on business according to the lib - eral principles of free bargain and self-help ; and they are in the main still looked on as a meritorious exercise of thrift and sagacity duly so looked on , it is to be presumed .

		At least such is the prevailing view among the substantial citizens , who are in a position to speak from first-hand knowledge .

		It is only that the exercise of these homely virtues on the large scale on which Business is now conducted , and when dealing with the wide-reaching articulations of the industrial system under the new order of technology under these uncalled-for circumstances the unguarded exercise of these virtues entails busi - ness disturbances which are necessarily large , and 546 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	which bring on mischievous consequences in industry which are disproportionately larger still .

		In case these maneuvers of businesslike deviation and defeat are successful and fall into an orderly system whose operation may be continued at will , or in so far as this management creates an assured strategic advan - tage for any given business concern , the result is a vested interest .

		This may then eventually be cap - italized in due form , as a body of intangible assets .

		As such it goes to augment the business community 's accumulated wealth .

		And the country is richer per capita .

		A vested interest is a marketable right to get something for nothing .

		This does not mean that the vested interests cost nothing .

		They may even come high .

		Particularly may their cost seem high if the cost to the community is taken into account , as well as the expenditure incurred by their owners for their production and upkeep .

		Vested interests are immaterial wealth , intangible assets .

		As regards their nature and origin , they are the outgrowth of three main lines of businesslike management : -LRB- a -RRB- limitation of supply , with a view to profitable sales ; -LRB- b -RRB- obstruction of traffic , with a view to profitable sales ; and -LRB- c -RRB- meretricious publicity , with a view to profitable sales .

		It will be remarked that these are matters of business , in the strict sense .

		They are devices of salesmanship , not of workman - ship ; they are ways and means of driving a bargain , not ways and means of producing goods or services .

		The residue which stands over as a product of these endeavors is in the nature of an intangible asset , an article of immaterial wealth , not an increase of the tangible equipment or the material resources in hand .

		The enterprising owners of the concern may be richer by that much , and so perhaps may the business community as a whole though that is a precariously dubious point but the community at large is certainly no better off in any material respect .

		This account of course assumes that all this busi - ness is conducted strictly within the lines of com - mercial honesty .

		It would only be tedious and misleading to follow up and take account of that scattering recourse to force or fraud , that will never wholly be got rid of in the pursuit of gain , whether by way of business traffic or by more direct methods .

		Commercial honesty , - of course , is the honesty of self-help , or caveat emptor , which is Latin for the same thing .

		Roughly , any business concern which so comes in for a habitual run of free income comes to have a vested right in this `` income stream , '' and this pre - ferred standing of the concern in this respect is recognized by calling such a concern a `` vested in - terest '' or a `` special interest . ''

		Free income of this kind , not otherwise accounted for , may be capital - ized if it promises to continue , and it can then be entered on the books as an item of immaterial wealth , a prospective source of gain .

		So long as it has not been embodied in a marketable legal instru - ment , any such item of intangible assets will be nothing more than a method of notation , a book - keepers ' expedient .

		But it can readily be covered with some form of corporation security , as , for instance , preferred stock or bonds , and it then be - comes an asset in due standing and a vested interest endowed with legal tenure .

		Ordinarily any reasonably uniform and perma - nent run of free income of this kind will be covered by an issue of corporate securities with a fixed rate of interest or dividends ; whereupon the free income in question becomes a fixed overhead charge on the concern 's business , to be carried as an item of ordi - nary and unavoidable outlay and included in the necessary cost of production of the concern 's output of goods or services .

		But whether it is covered by an issue of vendible securities or carried in a less formal manner as a source of income not otherwise accounted for , such a vested right to get something for nothing will rightly be valued and defended against infraction from outside as a proprietary right , an item of immaterial but very substantial wealth .

		There is nothing illegitimate or doubtful about this incorporation of unearned income into the ordi - nary costs of production on which `` reasonable profits '' are computed .

		`` The law allows it and the court awards it . ''

		To indicate how utterly con - gruous it all is with the new order of business enter - prise , it may be called to mind that not only do the captains of corporation finance habitually handle the matter in that way , but the same view is accepted by those public authorities who are called in to review and regulate the traffic of these business con - cerns .

		The later findings are apparently unequiv - ocal , to the effect that when once a run of free income has been capitalized and docketed as an asset it becomes a legitimate overhead charge , and it is then justly to be counted among necessary costs and covered by the price which consumers should reasonably pay for the concern 's offering of goods or services .

		Such a finding has come to be a fairly well settled matter-of-course both among officials and among the law-abi-ding investors , so far as regards those in - tangible assets that are covered by vendible securities carrying a fixed rate ; and the logic of this finding
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 547 is doubtless sound according to the principles of the modern point of view .

		There may still be a doubt or a question whether valuable perquisites of the same nature , which continue to be held loosely as an informal vested interest , as , for instance , mer - chantable good-will , ate similarly entitled to the benefit of the common law which secures any owner in the usufruct of his property .

		To such effect have commonly been the findings of courts and boards of inquiry , of
Public Utility Commissions	ORGANIZATION	, of such bodies as the
Interstate Commerce Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sion , the
Federal Trade Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and latterly of divers recently installed agencies for the control of prices and output in behalf of the public interest so , for instance , right lately , certain decisions and recommendations made by the
War Labor Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Any person with a taste for curiosities of human behavior might well pursue this question of capital - ized free income into its further convolutions , and might find reasonable entertainment in so doing .

		The topic also has merits as a subject for economic theory .

		But for the present argument it may suffice to note that this free income and the businesslike contrivances by which it is made secure and legiti - mate are of the essence of this new order of business enterprise ; that the abiding incentive to such enter - prise lies in this unearned income ; and that the in - tangible assets which are framed to cover this line of `` earnings , '' therefore , constitute the substantial core of corporate capital under the new order .

		In passing it may also be noted that there is room for a division of sentiment as regards this disposal of the community 's net production , and that peremp - tory questions of class interest and public policy touching these matters may presently be due to come to a hearing .

		To some , this manner of presenting the case may seem unfamiliar , and it may therefore be to the purpose to restate the upshot of this account in the briefest fashion : Capital at least under the new order of business enterprise is capitalized prospec - tive gain .

		From this arises one of the singularities of the current situation in business and its control of industry , namely , that the total face value , or even the total market value of the vendible securities which cover any given block of industrial equipment and material resources , and which give title to their ownership , always and greatly exceeds the total market value of the equipment and resources to which the securities give title of ownership , and to which alone in the last resort they do give title .

		The margin by which the capitalized value of the going concern exceeds the value of its material properties is commonly quite wide .

		Only in the case of small and feeble corporations , or such con - cerns as are balancing along the edge of bankruptcy , does this margin of intangible values narrow down and tend to disappear .

		Any industrial business con - cern which does not enjoy such a margin of capital - ized free earning-capacity has fallen short of ordi - nary business success and is possessed of no vested interest .

		This margin of free income which is capitalized in the value of the going concern comes out of the net product of industry over cost .

		It is secured by successful bargaining and an advantageous position in the market , which involves some derangement and retardation of the industrial system so much so as greatly to reduce the net margin of production over cost .

		Approximately the whole of this re - maining margin of free income goes to the business men in charge , or to the business concerns for whom this management is carried on .

		In case the free income which is gained in this way promises to con - tinue , it presently becomes a vested right .

		It may then be formally capitalized as an immaterial asset having a recognized earning-capacity equal to this prospective free income .

		That is to say , the outcome is a capitalized claim to get something for nothing which constitutes a vested interest .

		The total gains which hereby accrue to the owners of these vested rights amount to something less than the total loss suffered by the community at large through that delay of production and derangement of industry that is involved in the due exercise of these rights .

		In other words , and as seen from the other side , this free income which the community allows its kept classes in the way of returns on these vested rights and intangible assets is the price which the com - ' munity is paying to the owners of this imponderable wealth for material damage greatly exceeding that amount .

		But it should be kept in mind and should be duly credited to the good intentions of these businesslike managers , that the ulterior object sought by all this management is not the one hundred per cent of mischief to the community but only the ten per cent of private gain .

		So far as they bear immediately on the argument at this point the main facts are substantially as set forth .

		But to avoid any appearance of undue nov - elty , as well as to avoid the appearance of neglecting relevant facts , something more is to be said in the same connection .

		It is particularly to be noted that credit for certain material benefits should be given to .

		this same business enterprise , whose chief aim THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	and effect is the creation of these vested rights in unearned income .

		It will be apparent to anyone who is at all familiar with the situation that much of the intangible assets included in the corporate capital of this country , for instance , does not repre - sent derangement which is actually inflicted on the industrial system from day to day , but rather the price of delivery from derangement , which the busi - nesslike managers of industry have taken measures to discontinue and disallow .

		A concrete illustration will show what is in - tended .

		For some time past , and very noticeably during the
past quarter century	DATE	, the ownership of the country 's larger industrial concerns has con - stantly been drawing together into larger and larger aggregations , with a more centralized control .

		The case of the steel industry is typical .

		For a consider - able period , beginning in the early nineties , there went on a process of combination and recombination of corporations in this industry , resulting in larger and larger aggregations of corporate ownership .

		Commonly , though perhaps not invariably , some of the unprofitable duplication and work at cross - purposes that was necessarily involved in the earlier parcelment of ownership was got rid of in this way , gradually with each successive move in this concen - tration of ownership and control .

		Perhaps also , invariably , there was a substantial saving made in the aggregate volume of business dealings that would necessarily be involved in carrying on the industry by the methods of ownership in severally .

		Under the management of many concerns , each intent on its own pecuniary interest , the details of business transactions would be voluminous and in - tricate , in the way of contracts , orders , running accounts , working arrangements , as well as the necessary financial operations , properly so called .

		Much of this would be obviated by taking over the ownership of these concerns into the hands of a centralized control ; and there would be a conse - quent lessening of that delay and uncertainty that always is to be counted on wherever the industrial operations have to wait on the completion of various business arrangements .

		There is circumstantial evi - dence that very material gains in economy and expedition commonly resulted from these successive moves of consolidation in the steel business .

		And this discontinuance of businesslike delay and calcu - lated maladjustment was at each successive move brought to a secure footing and capitalized in an increased issue of the negotiable corporation securities .

		It will also be recalled that , as a matter of rou - tine , each successive consolidation of ownership in - volved a recapitalization of the concerns so brought together under a common head , and that commonly if not invariably the resulting recapitalization would be larger than the aggregate capital of the under - lying corporations .

		Even where , as sometimes has happened , there was no increase made in the nom - inal capitalization , there would still result an effectual increase , in that the market value of the securities outstanding would be larger after the operation than the value of the aggregate capital of the underlying corporations had been before .

		There has commonly been some gain in aggregate capitalization , and the resulting increased capital - ization has also commonly proved to be valid .

		The market value of the larger and more stable capital - ization has presently proved to be larger and more stable than the capitalization of the same properties under the earlier regime of divided ownership and control .

		What so has been added to the aggregate capitalization has in the main been the relative absence of work at cross-purposes , which has re - sulted from the consolidation of ownership ; and it is to be accounted a typical instance of intangible assets .

		The new and larger capitalization has com - monly made good ; and this is particularly true for those later , larger , and more conclusive recombina - tions of corporate ownership with which the so - called era of trust making in the steel business came to a provisional conclusion .

		The
United States Steel Corporation	ORGANIZATION	has vindicated the wisdom of an un - reserved advance on lines of consolidation and recapitalization in the financing of the large and technical industries .

		For reasons well understood by those who are acquainted with these things , no one can offer a confident estimate , or even a particularly intelligent opinion , as to the aggregate amount of overhead burden and intangible assets which has been written into the corporate capital of the steel business in the course of a few years of consolidation .

		For reasons of depreciation , disuse , replacement , exten - sion , renewal , changes in market conditions and in technical requirements the case is too intricate to admit anything like a clear-cut identification of the immaterial items included in the capitalization .

		But there is no chance to doubt that in the aggregate these immaterial items foot up to a very formidable proportion of the total capital .

		It is evident that the businesslike management of industry under these conditions need not involve derangement and cross-purposes at every turn .

		It should always be likely that the business men in charge will find it to their profit to combine forces , eliminate wasteful traffic , allow a reasonably free
1918	DATE	THE DIAL , 549 and economical working of the country 's productive powers within the limits of a profitable price , and so come in for a larger total of free income to be divided amicably among themselves on a concerted plan .

		This can be done by means of a combination of ownership , such as the corporations of the pres - ent time .

		But there is a difficulty of principle in - volved in this use of incorporation as a method of combining forces .

		Such a consolidation of owner - ship and control on a large scale appears to be , in effect , a combination of forces against the rest of the community or in contravention of the principles of free competition .

		In effect it foots up to the same thing as a combination in restraint of trade ; in form it is a concentration of ownership .

		Com - bination of owners in restraint of trade is obnoxious to the liberal principles of free bargaining and self - help ; consolidation of ownership by purchase or incorporation appears to be a reasonable exercise of the right of free bargaining and self-help .

		There is accordingly some chance of a difference of opinion at this point and some risk of playing fast and loose with these liberal principles that disallow conspiracy in restraint of trade .

		This difficulty of principle has been sought to be got over by believing that a com - bination of ownership in restraint of trade does not amount to a conspiracy in restraint of trade , within the purport of these liberal principles .

		There is a great and pressing need of such a construction of principles , which would greatly facilitate the work of corporation finance ; but it is to be admitted that some slight cloud still rests on this manner of dis - posing of ownership .

		It involves abdication or dele - gation of that discretionary exercise of property rights which has been held to be of the essence of ownership .

		The new state of things brought about by such a consolidation is capitalized as a permanent source of free income .

		And if it proves to be a sound busi - ness proposition the new capitalization will measure the increase of income which goes to its promoter or to the corporation in whose name the move has been made ; and if the work is well and neatly done no one else will get any gain from it or be in any way benefited by the arrangement .

		It is a business proposition , not a fanciful project of public utility .

		The capitalized value of such a coalition of owner - ship is not measured by any heightened production or any retrenchment of waste that may come in its train , nor need the new move bring any addition to the community 's net productive resources in any respect .

		Indeed , it happens not infrequently that such a waste-conserving coalition of ownership leads directly to a restriction of output , according to the familiar run of monopoly rule .

		So frequently will restriction , enhanced prices , unemployment , and hardship follow in such a case that it has come to be an article of popular knowledge and belief that this is the logical aim and outcome of any successful maneuver of the kind .

		So also , though its output of marketable goods or services may be got on easier terms , the new and larger business concern which results from the coali - tion need be no more open-handed or humane in its dealings with its workmen .

		There will , in fact , be some provocation to the contrary .

		A more powerful corporation is in a position to make its own terms with greater freedom , which it then is for the work - men to take or leave , but ordinarily to take , for the universal rule of businesslike management to charge what the traffic will bear continues to hold unbroken for any business concern , irrespective of its size or its facilities .

		As has already been noted in an earlier passage , charging what the traffic will bear is the same as charging what will yield the largest net profit .

		.

		There stand over two main questions touching the nature and uses of these vested interests : Why do not these powerful business Concerns exercise their autocratic powers to drive the industrial sys - tem at its full productive capacity , seeing that they are in a position to claim any increase of net pro- duction over cost ?

		and , What use is made of the free income which goes to them as the perquisite of their vested interest ?

		The answer to the former question is to be found in the fact that the great business concerns as well as the smaller ones are all bound by the limitations of the price system , which holds them to the pursuit of a profitable price , not to the pursuit of gain in terms of material goods .

		Their vested rights are for the most part carried as an overhead charge in terms of price and have to be met in those terms , which will not allow an in - crease of net production regardless of price .

		The latter question will find its answer in the well - known formula of the economists , that `` human wants are indefinitely extensible , '' particularly as regards the consumption of superfluities .

		The free income which is capitalized in the intangible assets of the vested interests goes to support the well-to-do investors , who are for this reason called the kept classes , and whose keep consists in an indefinitely extensible consumption of superfluities .

		55 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	An Apostle to the Civilized OELDOM HAS the sacrament of nature 's beauty been more fittingly celebrated than in the life and works of
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	.

		From his childhood in the Ar - gentine , when his mother , anxious at his staring fixedly in the air , stole after him only to find him rapt with absorption in birds overhead , to the time and long after when he wrote A Crystal Age and
Green Mansions	ORGANIZATION	more vivid creations than those of
Bernardin de St. Pierre	ORGANIZATION	and
Rousseau	PERSON	he has been responsive to those moments in life when `` nature draws near to it , and , taking up her ne - glected instrument , plays a fragment of some ancient melody , long unheard on the earth . ''

		Attuned as only savages are attuned to the soundless , wordless , unthought harmonies of desolate plain , flowers , and living creatures , this scientist , poet , artist has been able to resurrect from their grave in civilization moods and states of being which men find well-nigh incommunicable .

		To his bird-watching and his learned observation he brought the passionate atten - tion of a child , the selflessness of an instinctive man whose brain is `` a highly polished mirror , in which all visible nature every hill , tree , leaf is reflected with miraculous clearness , '' and the endowment of a creator .

		Akin as he is in spirit to other faithful observers of the wonder of the world -LRB- he refers to the
Argen	LOCATION	- tinian pampas as his `` parish of
Selborne	LOCATION	'' and he Hved , he tells us , in the house in which
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	died -RRB- he has yet brought something sig - nificant and new into science and literature .

		Readers of his works have felt its presence .

		They have fejt not only that here was a man penetrated with beauty , intoxicated with life , but that there was also present in him the child , alien to our civilization , wise and critical .

		Simple and patient in his observa - tions as
Fabre	PERSON	-LRB- there is a chapter on spiders in The Naturalist in
La Plata	LOCATION	which has few if any peers -RRB- he possesses an added quality of imagination .

		It is the mythology of the child mind and its animism , sublimated and fused with that delicacy of sense perceptions which distinguishes him .

		It is fortunate that this magnificent childhood , as Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	has displayed it in his writings , should have its autobiography in Far Away and Long Ago -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		For the child , the savage , and the artist are one , and to the civilization they ap - praise they impart a quality of strangeness .

		That civilization is calculated to crush out just such spirits as those of
Hudson	LOCATION	, to rob them of their sensitivity , to market their fancies , and to extinguish what for them is most significant and beautiful .

		In
Hudson	LOCATION	's autobiography , which he tells us ` is ended at the age of fifteen , there is concentrated the thing of which he ' has given many intimations in earlier works the child mind and the sense of beauty , two powers which will yet some day destroy industrial - ism .

		Another volume , A Little Boy Lost , which is published in this country just now -LRB-
Knopf	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is to be taken in the same sense .

		Although it is for children , it is less a book written at them or to them than a ransacking of the author 's treasure house for their delectation .

		Averse as
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	had been to writing an auto - biography for the reason that incidents of his boy - hood were related in chapters of The Naturalist in
La Plata	LOCATION	, Adventures Among Birds , Birds and Man , and other works ; for the reason also that he felt the difficulty in other autobiographies of childhood of the `` unconscious artistry '' which would `` sneak in to erase unseemly lines and blots , to retouch , and colour , and shade and falsify the picture '' yet he could not resist the illness which put him in a state where he could review the entire sunlit prospect of his youth .

		It is with
Serge Aksakoff	PERSON	, author of the History of His Childhood , that Hudson finds him - self comparable , because
Aksakoff	PERSON	's `` intense love of his mother , of nature , of all wildness and of sport ... kept him a boy in heart , able after long years to revive the past mentally and picture it in its true , fresh , original colours . ''

		And I can say of myself with regard to this primitive faculty and emotion this sense of the supernatural in natural things as I have called it that I am on safe ground for the same reason ; the feeling has never been wholly outlived .

		And I will add probably to the disgust of some rigidly orthodox reader that these are childish things which I have no desire to put away .

		Essentially Hudson is a nature-worshiper .

		His wild heresy began with the religion that his beloved mother taught him .

		He believed implicitly what she told him about the Supreme Being , but never - theless : these teachings did not touch my heart as it was touched and thrilled by something nearer , more intimate , in na - ture , not only in moonlit trees or in a flower or serpent , but in certain exquisite moments and moods and in cer - tain aspects of nature , in `` every grass '' and in all things animate and inanimate .

		He speaks of the feeling he had on moonlit nights that a tree seemed `` more intensely alive than others , more conscious of my presence and watchful of me . ''

		This faculty he acclaimed even then as more to him THE DIAL than all the religious teaching he received from his mother , and it always seemed to him essentially religious in character .

		For one so perfectly respon - sive to the moods of his environment and therefore to the slightest expressiveness of incident or person about him , life could not fail to be filled with para - bles , living parables instinct with the realities he perceived through his senses and felt about him .

		One such parable in his life was the incident of the serpent discovered lying in a path and almost trod - den upon : One of the men , the first to find a stick or perhaps the most courageous , rushed to the front and was about to deal a killing blow when his arm was seized by one of the ladies and the blow arrested .

		Then , stooping quickly , she took the creature up in her hands , and going away to some distance from the others , released it in the long green grass , green in color as its glittering skin and as cool to the touch .

		He saw her then `` coming back to us through the orchard trees , her face shining with joy because she had rescued the reptile from imminent death , '' and his young mind was troubled with the question why she was so innocently glad .

		Nevertheless , I think that this incident bore fruit later , and taught me to consider whether it might not be better to spare than to kill ; better not only for the animal spared , but for the soul .

		A corollary , or perhaps the essence itself , of
Hud	ORGANIZATION	- son 's deep feeling for the being of all life is rever - ence for all living things .

		He has given voice to it in his lament over the extinction of the wildest and most beautiful creatures of the earth , of incompar - ably greater value to mankind in his eyes than the finest of pictures or marbles .

		Hear him in Idle Days in
Patagonia	LOCATION	, telling of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's masterpieces which we should hold sacred : In ancient times the spirit of life shone brightest in these ; and when others that shared the earth with them were taken by death they were left , being more worthy of perpetuation .

		Like immortal flowers they have drifted down to us on the ocean of time , and their strangeness and beauty bring to our imaginations a dream and a picture of that unknown world , immeasurably far re - moved , where man was not : and when they perish , some - thing of gladness goes out of nature , and the sunshine loses something of its brightness .

		In A
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	's Life he displays the same feeling for the bare quietude of the downs .

		They too gave him a `` sense of man 's harmony and oneness with nature '' : This quiet spot in
Wiltshire	LOCATION	has been inhabited from of old , how far back the barrows raised by an ancient , barbarous people are there to tell us , and to show us how long it is possible for the race of men , in all stages of culture , to exist on the earth without spoil - ing it .

		That feeling , deep-rooted in his youth , is illumined by his confession of preference in literature for the works of
Vaughan	ORGANIZATION	,
Traherne	PERSON	, and other mystics ; for it is only in them `` that I find any adequate ex - pression of that perpetual rapturous delight in na - ture and my own existence which I experienced at that period . ''

		Tolstoy , we are told at another point , is his favorite author .

		Carrying within him this deep spiritual and emo - tional impress of what he had seen and experienced , it was impossible for Hudson to approach the simplest of observed facts perfunctorily .

		One is tempted to quote almost at random from his books , now nearly a score , to display the new-minted qual - ity which his words bear , fresh from the allocation he has given them in the context of his conscious - ness .

		There comes to mind that extraordinary chapter in Idle Days in
Patagonia Concerning Eyes	LOCATION	, which begins : White , crimson , emerald green , shining golden yellow , are amongst the colors seen in the eyes of birds .

		In owls , herons , cormorants , and many other tribes , the brightly - tinted eye is incomparably the finest feature and chief glory .

		One remembers his furious Magellanic eagle owl , wounded to the death , whose irides were of a bright orange color , but every time I attempted to approach the bird they kindled into great globes of glimmering yellow flame , the black pupils being surrounded by a scintillating crimson light which threw out minute yellow sparks into the air .

		And there crowd into the memory of a reader of Hudson old gauchos of the pampas , whose lives held more of the fierce and romantic than the finest picaresque hero of Spanish narrative ; scenes from the soul of wit , as where a `` Crowner 's inquest is held on the remains of a Saxon or
Dane	PERSON	or an ancient Briton , '' dug up by a rabbit ; pages of bird and animal lore , passages where in magical prose the very hush of outdoor silence seems captured and impregnated in the printed page .

		The stage is set in Far Away and
Long Ago	LOCATION	.

		The curtain is about to rise .

		The book is prelude and performance in one , the urgence of feeling .

		rewon fused with mellow reflection .

		Of that intensity in
Green Mansions	ORGANIZATION	of which
John Galsworthy	PERSON	said it immortalized `` as passionate a love of all beautiful things as ever was in the heart of man , '' as well as of the keen-sensed sharp observer , there is here rich expression .

		One partakes with the author the gusto of the boyhood lesson -LRB- learned after trying to capture doves by putting salt on their tails -RRB- that one could only distinguish between real lies and lies that were not lies by `` not being a fool . ''

		Quite outside and beyond its revelation anew , and in more sustained light , of the naturalist and the ere -
December 14	DATE	ator of prose music , Far Away and
Long Ago	LOCATION	is a picture of an elapsed age and of people in that age who passed with it .


Don Eusebio	PERSON	, fool of the Dicta - tor of
Argentina	LOCATION	, stalks through the streets of
Buenos Aires	ORGANIZATION	clad in scarlet , with scarlet plumes , and at - tended by a bodyguard of twelve soldiers with drawn swords .

		The War Minister 's major-domo on a neighboring estancia sends armfuls of peacock feathers to ' the
Hudson	PERSON	family to decorate their house .


Don Gregorio	PERSON	, to whom a piebald horse is dearer than precious stones , rides to the race meeting conscious that all eyes are upon him and his steed with its jeweled trappings .

		Barboza , singer of songs , who killed men for the fame it gave him among the gauchos as a fighter with the knife , sings on at a cattle-marking indifferent to the insulting jibes of
Marcos	PERSON	, called El
Rengo	ORGANIZATION	by reason of his lameness , because it could add nothing to one 's glory to kill a cripple .

		Then there is a vivid interlude of the -
fall	DATE	of the dictator
Rosas	PERSON	, when the dull roar of distant guns came to the ears of the
Hudson	PERSON	family and they were told a great battle was being fought between
Rosas	PERSON	, with his army of 25,000 men , and the traitor
Urquiza	PERSON	with his 40,000 .

		With the ut - most rapidity and clearness of image scene after scene is visualized : horsemen in flight , galloping up to the door demanding fresh mounts ; the cool smil - ing demeanor of his father , who went out to parley with the threatening fugitives ; a young officer 's at - tempt to escape and the swift death that overtook him .

		Here , as elsewhere in his autobiography ,
Hudson	PERSON	is master of a cadence of narrative comparable only perhaps to that of
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, who can as nearly as any writer living annihilate space and time , en - close past and present , swift incident and the slow revelation of personality , in the crystal of his mind , until the narrative glows and vibrates .

		Nowhere perhaps is the easy accumulation in
Hudson	LOCATION	's telling more striking than where he comments on the simi - larity of voice he and his elder brother had inherited from their father .

		On one of his visits to Buenos Aires he remembers that voice brought him recogni - tion by
Jack	PERSON	the Killer , desperado and hero , who lay ill in a stable .

		It is made the occasion of a famous story of
Jack	PERSON	the Killer 's righting history .

		And it is made the prelude to an exploration of his brother 's character , to a story of that brother 's in - sistence on fighting with real knives in order to culti - vate the heroic gesture and skill , and finally to an appraisal of its ultimate effect on the relationship of the two boys .

		In the scene of
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's youth `` a flatland , its horizon a perfect ring of misty blue color where the crystal-blue dome of the sky rests on the level green world '' may be found all the pageantry and the portraiture possible to narrative of the unfamiliar , history almost , but more eagerly lived than by any historian .

		There is indescribable feeling , close to tragedy , in some of the clear pictures of human be - ings .

		For instance , the Negroid daughter of a neighbor , Cipriana by name , `` an imposing woman , her eyes sparkling with .

		intense fire and passion , who , despite her coarse features and dark skin , had a kind of strange wild beauty which attracted men . ''

		Hud - son saw her once , in a white dress , galloping on a big bay horse , her gaucho lover leading the way .

		He speaks of the pain of seeing her again , sitting at evening with her eyes fixed on the dusty road , moving her lips as she spoke softly to herself in a sort of dream .

		Best perhaps are the passages where he has described humanity in unexpected places , humanity that he surprised into revealing itself .

		At one point he has been listening to the field finches of the pampas : `` It is as if hundreds of fairy minstrels were all playing on stringed and wind instruments of various forms , every one intent on his own per - formance without regard to the others . ''

		And then he turns to an old carpenter on the estate , known for his slowness and stolidity as the `` Cumberland boor . ''

		The man is standing with a look on his face like that `` on the face of a religious mystic in a moment of exaltation . ''

		Again ,
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's quality is clearly envisaged in the enlightenment on the tor - turing problem of life after death which he found in conversation with an old rough gaucho , primitive and vigorous .

		It is a problem which had first con - fronted Hudson as a little boy , when he had taken it to his mother and derived temporary comfort from her assurance that the soul survived even though the body was lowered into the earth and decayed .

		Protestant young boy and Catholic gaucho became for a moment one inquiring mind with opposed forces in itself .

		And then the gaucho told how he came to unbelief ; how at the age of four - teen he was deprived by death of his mother and cried for her every night to come back to him , until he became convinced when she vouchsafed no reply that there was no immortality .

		`` His story , '' says
Hudson	PERSON	, `` pierced me to the heart , and without an - other word I left him . ''

		That was only one incident in
Hudson	LOCATION	's spiritual history ; his struggle went on `` all on the old lines , '' he tells us , for he had no modern books .

		It is true enough , as he says , that thousands and millions of men have undergone similar experiences ; but his
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 553 own are of special significance for us because , with a minimum of indoctrination from any civilized en - vironment , they are so intensely lived at every mo - ment .

		That is one of the keys to
Hudson	LOCATION	's signifi - cance .

		Thought is never with him an escape from reality : it is the overtone of his life of the senses .

		He has lived daringly , and the poor assumptions with which civilization covers its poverty of life and imagination are assumptions to him and nothing more .

		Perhaps no less dogmatic naturalist and writer ever lived .

		The gaucho with blood on his hands , wild creatures , nature he has observed and lived with irrespective of their accordance with the false maxims or delicacies by which the vast ma - jority of civilized people have been bound .

		In the preface to the second edition of A Crystal Age he said explicitly how fully he had learned and how deeply he had come to know that strife was nature 's price upon life .

		It is not therefore in any senti - mental vein that
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	abhors bloodshed .

		He has been able to look on while cattle were being killed in the brutal way in which gauchos kill them on the pampas and in the killing-grounds outside
Buenos Aires	LOCATION	, where the earth is inches deep with clotted dust and blood .

		If he abhors bloodshed , cruelty , indifference , hatred , it is because he has seen them in purer form than anyone else , has felt their iron in his own soul .

		And it is in perfect natural - ness and in perfect accord with his instinctive life that he has formulated or written in unformulated fashion his criticism of the existence to which men are condemned who live in industrial centers .

		It is an existence in which the senses are starved , ip which the imagination is cramped and repressed , in which all impulses are subordinated to the re - wards of acquisitiveness , in which even thought moves behind high walls and beauty is almost as completely shut out as is sunlight .

		Distinctly , this apostle of beauty to an indifferent world is dangerous in the sense that
Bertrand Rus	PERSON	- sell had in mind when he said thought was danger - ous and subversive .

		He is dangerous because he possesses a power , which he can communicate , more potent than any doctrine which can be learned by rote and declaimed , more potent than program or organization .

		It is the sense of beauty and fitness in the individual soul , the sense of community with all nature and all living beings ; and it is inseparable from a feeling for their dignity and loveliness .

		Per - haps there will never be such a `` Savonarola bon - fire '' as that imagined in A Crystal Age , in which most of the things once valued have been consumed to ashes politics , religions , systems of philosophy , isms and ologies of all descriptions ; schools , churches , prisons , poorhouses ; stimulants and tobacco ; kings and parlia - ments ; cannon with its hostile roar , and pianos that thundered peacefully ; history , the press , vice , political economy , money , and a million things more .

		But such minds as
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's give these things their proper valuation .

		His sense of beauty , his childlike quality , are the ultimate foes to oppression , ugliness , - waste .

		One has the feeling in reading
W. H. Hud	PERSON	- son that here is a gorgeous and delicate plant whose slender growth may rend masonry and tear massive stone from stone .

		The Hire Learning in
America	LOCATION	X \ LTHOUGH no mortal of common clay and ordi - nary wit could do justice to Mr.
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	's The Higher Learning in
America	LOCATION	: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men -LRB-
Huebsch	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- within the compass of a brief book review , it is a comparatively simple mat - ter to state the thesis which it sustains : there is in every society a body of esoteric knowledge , guarded by specialists in the subject medicine men , shamans , priests , savants , scholars , scientists ; `` the higher learning '' is such a body of knowledge and universi - ties are the appointed keepers ; the direction of the universities in American society has fallen into the hands of business men of large material possessions , who by the stress of their intensive preoccupations are driven to measure all things by quantitative rather than qualitative standards size , number , extent , weight , vendibility , and so on ; as the parasite takes on , all unconsciously or perhaps protestingly , the color of the host , so the heads presidents , deans , provosts , supervisors , registrars , secretaries , official bellmen , and `` successful '' professors take on the modes of thought and the standards of judgment as to worthiness and worth which are cherished by the directing body from which the main source of eco - nomic sustentation is derived ; finally , the higher learning is of the spirit unseen , immeasurable , im - ponderable , and invendible ; hence the antithesis and the problem .

		From the preface it appears that this work was written , in the main at least , many years ago at a favorable point of vantage ,
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	under President
Harper	PERSON	, but remained unpublished for fear that the public might read into a purely detached and scientific study a personal strain , and thus vitiate the sedative and informing effect of a 554 THE DIAL contribution to educational analysis .

		The author was wise in his restraint , for in the intervening years what appeared to be an isolated pecuniary phenome - non in the world of learning has become universal except in some of the side pools along the main cur - rent where theological bias or pique has encompassed learning with a protective shelter against the purely pecunious .

		Everywhere that power of aspiration that once surged full and hot in , the cults of faith , fashion , sentiment , exploit , and honor ow at its best comes to such a head as it may in the con - certed adulation of matter-of-fact .

		So things stood , at least , on the eve of
America	LOCATION	's entrance into the war , and those who looked with distress upon the uniformity of American interest in measurable vendibility may take hope in the thought that concern with the glories , honors , and sacrifices of war may act as a salutary check upon the drift toward the `` mechanistically effectually matter-of - fact . ''

		The recent allocation of colleges to a very useful position in the scheme of military things may result in a somewhat rude treatment of the purely pecunious by gentlemen of military traditions and honor .

		To be plain , military standards may sup - plant those of the business college .

		It will be re - called by the well-versed student of American gov - ernment that the construction work supervised by engineers detailed from the
United States	LOCATION	army stands in marked contrast -LRB- owing to the absence of corruption -RRB- to similar construction enterprises , such as the first subways in
New York	LOCATION	^ managed by bankers and financiers .

		Our immediate choice ap - pears to be between the measurements of dollars and cents and those of military honor .

		To return .

		It must not be thought that Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	is making a plea for an entirely cultural and non-utilitarian learning .

		He does not object to measurements by standards of serviceability for human use in the long and larger sense , but to the business man 's conquest over the eternal interest of high minds in widening the domain of knowledge by free and independent inquiry , unbought and fear - less .

		He sees the paraphernalia of the business col - lege submerging the spirit of learning .

		He sees men who might have contributed to enlargement of t life drawn away from the essence of things by the allure - ments of pomp , circumstance , advertising , and high salaries which business men are accustomed to award to efficiency engineers , heads , managers , presidents , deans , and stimulators of production in general , to say nothing of accomplished shoo-flies .

		He finds that the records and filing systems of well conducted business concerns tend to become the central con - cerns of college management , and that the term , course , time-clock , and unit system , necessary enough in high schools and colleges , occupy also the citadel of the university the guardian of the higher learn - ing .

		Well-meaning educators struggle against it in vain as drowning men fight the foaming currents that overwhelm them at last .

		When men are caught in the perplexing net of expediency , the instant need of the things drives out all slowly maturing , far looking , and deeply spiritual considerations .

		No one is to be blamed for being conquered by his environ - ment .

		He always has the alternative however of changing his environment by migration .

		There are any number of side eddies in Mr.
Veb	PERSON	- len 's main stream .

		He has found by experience that some universities are in fact managed by a mere frac - tion of the board of trustees , who take an active interest in the enterprise , and that in the allocation of available funds they frequently apply those canons of pecuniary honor which are to be found in many historic business undertakings , such , for example , as the
Credit Mobilier	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps some
Henry VIII	PERSON	who has the historic mission of dissolving estab - lished corporations of learning may care to have the financial records of institutions enjoying exemp - tion from taxation made the subject of expert inquiry by accountants of the new order .

		It will be a mat - ter of no little edification to the loyal alumni who make financial sacrifices for their alma mater to learn that the cost of maintaining the `` establishment '' of their president -LRB- to say nothing of the retinue of deans and statistical shamans -RRB- has been quite as much as the unit cost of instructing the freshman and sophomore classes .

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's comments on aca - demic buildings and material equipment will be read with surprise by those who do not know that college structures are not infrequently erected by architects and engineers wholly ignorant of any of the purposes and intents of the higher learning , and quite prepared to sacrifice light , comfort , and the ease of the inhabi - tants to the considerations of fenestration and osten - tatious industrial arts .

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	is also perti - nent when he notes the willingness of the once devo - tionally religious institutions of learning to wink at the theological unconventionality of instructors , providing their political economy is of the immediate matter-of-fact .

		The subject of dismissal from seats of `` learning '' is touched by our author with much precision .

		Unfortunate newspaper notoriety , de - served or undeserved , unconventional religious or political views , unsound economic doctrines , an un - prosperous marriage , or domestic infelicity is usually found in every case of discharge from academic trust ; but Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	is generously correct toward col - lege authorities when he states that
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 555 where action has been taken by the directorate on provo - cation of such circumstances , it is commonly done with the -LRB- unofficial -RRB- admission that such action is not taken on the substantial merits of the case but on compulsipn of circum - stances and the exigencies of advertising .

		If to this is added the effect of directoral jealousy , pique , and personal dislike , the point is fairly made .

		An illustration of Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's theory is found in the case of a very distinguished scholar who was dismissed from a large institution of `` the higher learning '' ostensibly on the ground of an unfortunate amorous excursion , but as a matter of fact such excursions were widely advertised among his col - leagues and known to the directorate many years pre - vious to his expulsion , and it was only when they became a subject of animadversion by the sensational press that the directoral `` guardians of the morals of the youth committed to their care '' forcibly severed connections with the culprit .

		This is an illustration of the insoluble paradox of life for which our fath - ers could find only the solution of original sin , while those of coldly detached and scientific dispo - sition are forced to withhold scholarly judgment at this stage of mental development .

		Nevertheless when all is said and done Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	has generous hopes , for he says : Whatever expedients of decorative real estate , spectacu - lar pageantry , bureaucratic magnificence , elusive statis - tics , vocational training , genteel solemnities , and sweat - shop instruction may be imposed by the exigencies of a competitive business policy , the university is after all a seat of learning devoted to the cult of the idle curiosity otherwise called the scientific spirit .

		By way of obiter dicta he holds that the academic trust may be dissolved , the captain of erudition use - fully employed in other -LRB- truly gainful -RRB- occupations , boards of trustees abolished or reduced to a vacantly perfunctory status , self-government granted to the real guardians of higher learning , the teachers , and a return made to the ancient and honorable com - munion between teacher and student `` that once made the American college , with all its handicap of pov - erty , chauvinism , and denominational bias , one of the most effective agencies of scholarship in
Chris	LOCATION	- tendom . ''

		Unhappily the present reviewer can not share the cool optimism of the author or accept even the desirability of such a plan of affairs if universally adopted .

		Economic sustentation is essential to the modern shaman of learning , and a decent regard for the amenities of life requires that the standard should be at least reasonably worthy .

		Such support must come from one of two sources , from persons possessed of worldly goods business men , finan - ciers , bankers , successful merchants and manufac - turers or from public taxation laid by legislatures .

		It is not to be presumed that either the capitalists who endow or the people who tax themselves will be willing to grant money freely and at the same time surrender control .

		That would be an act of faith contrary to normal expectations in a capitalistic or democratic world .

		If the Espionage Act does not forbid , it may be ventured that `` the higher learning '' is too fragile a plant to be entrusted to the tender mercies of the board of aldermen .

		There is really more to be gained from a busy and heavily preoccu - pied benevolent despot .

		Moreover if the shamans of learning should be freely granted a pecuniary under - writing without any obligation expressed or tacit , the experience of mankind with cults would seem to indicate that it would shortly become necessary to pry open the independent , self-governing bodies in charge of the esoteric word and let in a little common sense of the earth earthy , springing without effort and without guile from the living wells of human experience , so deep that the straining eye of science can not fathom them nor the mind of man find the secret of the healing that comes out of them .

		Nevertheless in the pluralistic economy of provi - dence there may be many things , and one or more of them may be self-governing colleges devoted not to teaching but to learning , financed by a few will - ing to cast their bread upon the waters , and dedi - cated not to the dispensation of knowledge but the pursuit of wisdom .

		Why not ?

		The modern theory of evolution has a place for the `` sport '' and ascribes to it immense potentiality .

		But let us press the matter a bit further .

		Let us imagine that a few possessors of great wealth , of genial disposition , and unusual experimental interest should bestow upon the self-governing faculty a goodly block of
Baltimore	LOCATION	and
Ohio	LOCATION	Gold 4 's and step aside , renouncing all claim and all concern .

		Then suppose that a changing industrial democracy should be about to embark upon a policy that spelled confiscation or a scheme of taxation that would wipe out one-half , or more , of the income received by the autonomous body engaged in the pursuit of the higher learning , could that democracy expect a cold and passionless judgment from the professor of politi - cal economy ?

		And if his judgment should be in favor of the policy which spelled a curtailment of funds , would he find joyful countenances greeting him on entering the council chamber of the many headed directorate ?

		Ultimate solution : all things are relative and mat - ters of degree , and blessed are those who discover it early enough in life to prepare themselves for a sweet and dignified old age .

		556 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	Morals and Art from the West JHE AMERICAN NOVEL , in the hands of a faithful practitioner like Mr.
William Allen White	PERSON	, goes right on documenting with all the incident and em - phasis of which it is capable the eternal truth that sin is evil .

		On the 614th page Mr.
White	PERSON	no longer makes any bones of his purpose to show `` how sad a thing it is to sit in the seat of the scorn - ful and deny the reality of God 's purpose in the world . ''

		In hundreds of thousands of words , on a canvas that embraces the life of a mid-Western community from pioneer days to the industrial present , he draws in terms that would be under - standable by the veriest moral moron the corruption that may exist In the Heart of a Fool -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- .

		We live
today	DATE	in a world of great per - sonal variety ; the obscurities of people 's souls pro- vide an endless interest to the young novelist , who no longer ties life down to formulas or runs char - acter into conventional molds .

		Yet Mr.
White	PERSON	pursues with unquenched thirst and unabated vigor the old themes which have come to have for the American mind almost the same classic significance that Harlequin and Pierrot had for the marionette stage .

		Harlequin is the gay young professional man , with a weakness for women and a carelessness about their happiness .

		Hard , unscrupulous , daring , he climbs to a judgeship and becomes the center of a wide web of personal and social corruption .

		His friend has taken the swifter and more pathetic road of alcohol .

		For hundreds of pages the moral sense of a wide society is concentrated on these deplorable reprobates Tom , as he slips up so incorrigibly to the judge 's bench , and
Henry	PERSON	, as he slips down - wards to the gutter .

		Henry is slowly rehabilitated by one of Tom 's cast-off stenographer-mistresses , and Tom 's deserted wife inevitably becomes an angel of mercy to the poor , offering to humanity the love she has been denied at home .

		The age-long moral types of sin and redemption walk once more the fictional stage .

		But Mr.
White	PERSON	is not content with the theme of personal morality .

		He wants also `` to show the victory of the American spirit the Puritan con - science in our generation . ''

		For this purpose he brings us
Grant Adams	PERSON	, who is not only a rugged antithesis of the `` fool , '' but develops into a fanatical leader of labor , organizing a great revolt in which he is lynched , a glorious martyr .

		Grant 's development is worked up in the full glare of that sociological evangelism which Mr.
White	PERSON	represents as the last stage of the Puritan conscience .

		There is much complex interweaving of persons : Grant 's life is more or less an atonement for the boyish sin of having begotten a beautiful son upon the heartless but alluring girl who becomes in turn the wife of the two stock reprobates .

		The threads are all pulled together in the great scene where Grant , as danger - ous rebel , confronts in the courtroom Tom , as Federal judge .

		The lecherous and venal judge , in a Pilatelike gesture , washes his hands of Grant .

		The labor Messiah is seized by the maddened crowd and lynched horribly on the golf-links of the neighboring country club .

		And so are both the personal and sociological gospels fulfilled .

		The book closes with one of the abruptest turns of beatitude in all literature .

		After painting a long picture of community superstition and ferocity that would disgrace a Central African village riot and hatred and atrocious murder Mr.
White	PERSON	takes the Great War , rubs it like an eraser over the smutched and hideous page , and lo !

		all is fair and clean again .

		`` To have lived in the generation now passing , to have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord in the hearts of the people , to have watched the steady triumph in our American Iif6 of the spirit of justice , of fellowship , over the spirit of greed , to have seen the Holy Ghost rise in the spirit of a whole nation , was a blessed privilege . ''

		It is certainly a blessed privilege to be able to see the Holy Ghost in a war which embraced the Espionage Act and all the attendant furies and intolerances of the past year .

		It is a blessed privilege to be able to write the appalling story of American industry and politics as Mr.
White	PERSON	's last chapters present it , and then pass with sweet complacency to the com - ing of the Lord , ostensibly now glorious in our hearts .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	has become a sort of symbol of every - thing intelligent , progressive , `` folksy , '' character - istic , in
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		The more I see of a mind like his the less I understand it .

		His novel is certainly not art ; it is too purposeful to be good realism .

		The crowd of characters are drawn with vigor , but the city does not live .

		It is stagy .

		The book is allegory , and allegory that its author himself does not quite believe .

		This social evangelism of
Grant Adams	ORGANIZATION	seems to be something that Mr.
White	PERSON	thinks is a good thing for our country to have rather than something which he himself intensely feels .

		He is self-conscious about his message , and too much in - terested in working out the effects of personal sin
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 557 and the victory of the Puritan conscience , to ask himself whether he shows us the veracity of life .

		The heroism of a labor Messiah is evidently what Mr.
White	PERSON	thinks fairest and of best repute .

		I suspect him of following a spiritual fashion in labor evangelism , just as in his showing the results of sinful pride he is strictly in the spiritual fashion of a bygone day .

		However mature , however various and intimate his outlook , Mr.
White	PERSON	's imaginative vision of American life seems to be still set in the terms of Sunday-schoolism and melodrama .

		Some Freudian will one day explain why the most moral society in the world I refer to the
Middle West	LOCATION	requires its literature to reassure it so constantly and so hectically that sin is a sad and an abominable thing .

		Let us turn aside to a novel so different that it seems impossible that it could have been written in the same year and by an American from the same part of the country as
William Allen White	ORGANIZATION	.


Willa Gather	PERSON	has already shown herself an artist in that beautiful story of
Nebraska	LOCATION	immigrant life , O Pioneers !

		Her digression into The Song of the Lark took her into a field that neither her style nor her enthusiasm really fitted her for .

		Now in My Antonia -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- she has re - turned to the
Nebraska	LOCATION	countryside with an en - riched feeling and an even more golden charm of style .

		Here at last is an American novel , redolent of the Western prairie , that our most irritated and exacting preconceptions can be content with .

		It is foolish to be captious about American fiction when the same year gives us two so utterly unlike , and yet equally artistic , novels as Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's On the Stairs and Miss Gather 's My Antonia .

		She is also of the brevity school , and beside
William Allen White	PERSON	's swollen bulk she makes you realize anew how much art is suggestion and not transcription .

		Qne sentence from Miss Gather 's pages is more vivid than paragraphs of Mr.
White	PERSON	's stale bright - ness of conversation .

		The reflections she does not make upon her characters are more convincing than all his moralizing .

		Her purpose is neither to illus - trate eternal truths nor to set before us the crowded gallery of a whole society .

		Yet in these simple pictures of the struggling pioneer life , of - the com - fortable middle classes of the bleak little towns , there is an understanding of what these people have to contend with and grope for that goes to the very heart of their lives .

		Miss Gather convinces because she knows her story and carries it along with the surest touch .

		It has all the artistic simplicity of material that has been patiently shaped until everything irrelevant has been scraped away .

		The story has a flawless tone of candor , a naive charm , that seems quite art - less until we realize that no spontaneous narrative could possibly have the clean pertinence and grace which this story has .

		It would be cluttered , as Mr.
White	PERSON	's novel is cluttered ; it would have uneven streaks of self-consciousness , as most of the younger novelists ' work , done impromptu with a mistaken ideal of `` saturation , '' is both cluttered and self - conscious .

		But Miss Gather 's even novel has that serenity of the story that is telling itself , of people who are living through their own spontaneous charm .

		The story purports to be the memories of a suc - cessful man as he looks back over his boyhood on the
Nebraska	LOCATION	farm and in the little town .

		Of that boyhood
Antonia	PERSON	was the imaginative center , the little Bohemian immigrant , his playmate and wistful sweetheart .

		His vision is romantic , but no more romantic than anyone would be towards so free and warm and glorious a girl .

		He goes , to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and it is only twenty years later that he hears the story of her pathetic love and desertion , and her marriage to a simple Bohemian farmer , strong and good like herself .

		She was a battered woman now , not a lovely girl ; but she still had that something which fires the imagination , could still stop one 's breath for a moment by a look or gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in common things .

		She had only to stand in the orchard , to put her hand on a little crab tree and look up at the apples , to make you feel the goodness of planting and tending and harvesting at last .

		All the strong things of her heart came out in her body , that had been so tireless in serving generous emotions .

		It was no wonder that her sons stood tall and straight .

		She was a rich mine of life , like the founders of early races .

		My
Antonia	PERSON	has the indestructible fragrance of youth : the prairie girls and the dances ; the softly alluring
Lena	PERSON	, who so unaccountably fails to go wrong ; the rich flowered prairie , with its drowsy heats and stinging colds .

		The book , in its different way , is as fine as the
Irishman Corkery	PERSON	's The Threshold of Quiet , that other recent masterpiece of ` wistful youth .

		But this story lives with the hopeful - ness of the
West	LOCATION	.

		It is poignant and beautiful , but it is not sad .

		Miss Gather , I think , in this book has taken herself out of the rank of provincial writers and given us something we can fairly class with the modern literary art the world over that is earnestly and richly interpreting the spirit of youth .

		In her work the stiff moral molds are fortunately broken , and she writes what we can wholly under - stand -

		558 THE DIAL
December 14 Dublin , November 16	DATE	r \ T A VITAL moment of the autumn publishing offensive in
Dublin	LOCATION	a printers ' strike withheld sup - plies for nearly three months , with the result that we have not yet seen more than a very few of the books announced for this season .

		The
Talbot Press	ORGANIZATION	, a comparatively new and very enterprising firm , whose publication of the works of
Thomas Mac	ORGANIZATION	- Donagh and
Joseph Plunkett	PERSON	drew them from the relative obscurity of purely educational publishing , have increasingly compelled the attention of the public which is interested in the Irish literary move - ment .

		In a previous letter I had no occasion to refer to the publications of this firm , the books mentioned being almost exclusively those with the more familiar
Maunsel	ORGANIZATION	imprint , and now I find myself in the same predicament , since Messrs.
Maunsel	PERSON	alone have been able to fulfil planmassig !

		their autumn an - nouncements .

		However , as
The Macmillan Com	ORGANIZATION	- pany have arranged to publish Essays : Irish and American , by
John Butler Yeats	PERSON	.

		R.H.A. , it is not yet too late to refer to this most attractive of recent
Talbot Press	ORGANIZATION	publications , which will shortly be available in the country which Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	seems to have permanently adopted .

		Contrary to what might have been anticipated , this artist turned author is very slightly concerned with his own art .

		The only chapter in the book which one would have expected to find there is a lecture delivered at the
Royal Hibernian Academy	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, a couple of years before his casual migration to your
United States	LOCATION	.

		Watts and the Method of Art provides the author with an oppor - tunity for many pleasantries at the expense of our Philistines and for an ingenious defense of surely the greatest bore in modern painting , the allegorical sentimentalist , whose ponderous fancies enliven the parlors of aspiring artisans .

		He succeeds in this esthetic gymnastic by an appreciation of Watts the portrait painter , of whom he says all the good prompted by his own professional insight and by the undoubted qualities of the portrait painter himself , so unfortunately doubled by the elucubrator of such canvases as Hope .

		It is because Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is so un - like his brother artist that he is so happily dissimilar in the choice of his subjects as essayist .

		In a preface his friend `` A. E. '' recalls `` that enchanting flow of conversation which lightened the burden '' of those who sat for Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	.

		`` Nature , '' he writes , `` was wise in uniting the gift of portrait painting with the gift of conversation . ''

		That is precisely what the reader of these essays must feel , particularly any who have enjoyed the talk of this `` youngest of old men , '' to quote another phrase of `` A. E. 's . ''

		To judge by his pictures ,
Watts	PERSON	would have discoursed to his sitters of Life and Death and Hope and Eter - nal Damnation .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	' themes are more joy - ful , and the best of them are elaborated in Essays : Irish and American .

		His urbane wit , which is not moved to fierceness , even in the numerous and pene - trating passages wherein the Englishman is re - vealed , is as delightfully articulate in this volume as is the Irishman 's irrepressible love of country .

		In the writings of this artist , as Mr.
Erza	PERSON	Pound once wrote , `` the thought drifts up as easily as a cloud in the heavens , and as clear-cut as clouds on bright days . ''

		Although Miss
Susan Mitchell	PERSON	's Aids to the Im - mortality of Certain Persons in
Ireland	LOCATION	must have proved to closer students of the Irish literary move - ment that there is humor in the world of Anglo-Irish literature , there is no doubt that the modern Irish writer has the reputation of being serious .

		The re - cent appearance of a curious anthology ,
Secret Springs of Dublin Song	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- The
Talbot Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should help to dispel that notion .

		It is a collection of paro - dies and satires to which many of the best known writers have contributed .

		If the names of Lord Dunsany , `` A. E. , ''
Seumas O'Sullivan	PERSON	, and others do not appear in its pages , I can vouch for the pres - ence of their efforts in a direction hitherto unsus - pected by the majority of their readers .

		The poets are anonymous , and only the introduction by Miss
Mitchell	PERSON	bears the writer 's signature .

		Perhaps the reasons for this coyness will be understood if I quote the lines in which a distinguished mystic under - takes to fix the mannerism of his greatest contem - porary : -LRB-
Michael Robartes	PERSON	to His Beloved , telling her ho < w the greatness of His Verse shall open to her the door / heaven -RRB- This pearl-pale poem that I have pondered o'er , Made of a mouthful of the twilight air , And of one dream the falling of your hair , Shall open for you the eternal door .

		II -LRB-
Michael Robartes	PERSON	in the place of the distraught strug - gles against the spell ` which binds him -RRB- Outworn heart , come out from her hair , That brought upon you this lonely doom , And bound you down in the padded room , Away , come away , to - less shadowy hair !

		There are hairs that blossom on foreheads more fair : Curls ever shining with tendrils gay , That twine and untwine as the shadows are at play .

		Away , come away , to unshadowy hair .

		1918 THE DIAL 559 Life in a small literary community imposes discre - tion upon the authors of such pleasantries , but if the `` inexpressive nuptial song , '' entitled To
George Moore	PERSON	on the Occasion of His Wedding , consists of an elaborate ballade entirely in asterisks , readers of A Story-Teller 's Holiday will respect the meticu - lous display of Celtic modesty !

		Of the autumn books so far published by
Maun	LOCATION	- sel the most remarkable feature is the absence of all fiction , and the predominance of political works .

		The Censor 's blue pencil is the sword of Damocles hanging over the head of anyone who attempts to spread outside this realm the political ideas which most insistently preoccupy the mind of
Ireland	LOCATION	; and as the political and historical literature in ques - tion most accurately reflects these preoccupations , the safe and sane course is to avoid detailed refer - ence .

		A weighty tome is The Economic History of
Ireland	LOCATION	in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, by a new worker in the field , prepared by Mrs.
Stopford Green	PERSON	and
Miss A. E. Murray	PERSON	.

		Mr.
George O'Brien	PERSON	has at - tempted to do for the eighteenth century what Mrs.
Green	PERSON	's Making of
Ireland	LOCATION	and Its Undoing did for the history of Irish economic conditions up to the
end of the sixteenth century	DATE	.

		It is an invalu - able extension to the investigations of
Miss Murray	LOCATION	, whose History of the Commercial and
Financial Relations Between England	ORGANIZATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	is familiar to all students of the subject .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's schol - arly volume is an interesting refutation of the theory , which Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has recently reiterated in public lectures in
Dublin	LOCATION	, that the young nationalist intellectuals are romantic dreamers unacquainted with the economics of history .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's ignor - ance of any
Ireland	LOCATION	later than that which he aban - doned thirty years ago is notorious amongst Irish - men ; so it is not surprising that he should fall into an error which a knowledge of the education and ideas of the younger generation would easily dissi - pate .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's researches simply represent the presentation by a specialist of facts which are ever present in the minds of all educated Irish nation - alists today .

		His book is a profound chapter in a history which makes it difficult to accept the com - fortable pretense that there has been no deliberate policy of destruction on the .

		part of the English in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The recorded and actual economic re - lations between the two countries dispose of the theory of well-meaning , if stupid , misgovernment .

		Mr.
Eamonn de Valera	PERSON	, the uncrowned monarch of
Sinn Fein Ireland	LOCATION	, is far from possessing the talent for harsh political analysis which has made his jail - companion , Mr.
Arthur Griffith	PERSON	, one of the most effective journalists in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		By profession a mathematician and by choice a soldier , Mr.
de Valera	PERSON	usually blunders when he proceeds to test the alleged superiority of the pen over the sword .

		His first appearance on a publisher 's list is as the author of
Ireland	LOCATION	's Case Against Conscription , a brochure embodying the statement prepared by him for the Address presented by the
National Confer	ORGANIZATION	- ence to President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		That body , representing the various sections of nationalist opinion , united to oppose the application of the
Military Service	ORGANIZATION	Acts to
Ireland	LOCATION	by any but an Irish legislature , drew up a more diluted statement than this .

		essentially
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	manifesto .

		The pamphlet is a more readable document than the author 's friends and enemies alike expected .

		While it has been read by the faith - ful as a patriotic matter of course , it has not attracted the attention accorded to a provocative work en - titled The Sacred Egoism of
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	.

		Published over the pseudonym `` Gnathai gan larraidh , '' which being interpreted from the Irish means roughly `` unwanted wares , '' this little book has been ascribed to various '' hands , including my own !

		It is a
Nietz	PERSON	- schean indictment of pseudo-democracy , full of pun - gent comment at the expense of all belligerent nations , not excepting
Ireland	LOCATION	, whose right to satisfy the egoismo sacro of nationhood is proclaimed with sardonic .

		and cynical humor .

		The mystery of the authorship , in spite of rumors from those `` who know , '' remains ; and the
Manchester Guardian	ORGANIZATION	is moved to surprise at the discovery that `` there is in
Dublin	LOCATION	an unknown author capable of a piece of writing like The Sacred - Egoism of Sinn Fein . ''

		That journal declares `` if Swift at his best were to come to life again and turn out a pseudonymous pamphlet on the war , he could write nothing more acidly epigrammatic , nothing more full of intense , individuality . ''

		The booklet bears the imprimatur of the Press Censor , and is presumably exportable .

		It may be recommended to all exasperated individ - ualists .

		Four slender books of verse are so far the sea - son 's sole offerings of pure literature , a fact which speaks for the state of the national mind I have described .

		In a sense , this lack of balance may be said to correspond to the .

		preeminence of war books over others in the larger belligerent countries .

		Even this poetry reflects the preoccupied mind of the people , for , Miss
Eva Gore-Booth	PERSON	's
Broken Glory	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Seumas O'Sullivan	PERSON	's The Rosses and Other Poems are unlike the work which has heretofore established them , with a certain public .

		Both poets have always shown an aloofness from the thoughts and cares of the market place and have preferred to dwell apart , where imagination is free to follow its own fancies , now wistful , now heroic , now mystic .

		Mr.
O'Sullivan	PERSON	, it is true , has occasionally 5 6
December 14	DATE	tarried in the grimy , swarming streets of decayed Georgian
Dublin	LOCATION	, and has noted the poetic reality hidden beneath so much squalor .

		But it is something new in him to find the fierce social and political anger which he has concentrated into the majority of these new poems .

		The ' title-poem is character - istic enough of his older manner : My sorrow that I am not by the little dun By the lake of the starlings at Rosses under the hill , And the larks there , singing over the fields of dew , Or evening there , and the sedges still .

		For plain I see HOW the length of the yellow sand , And
Lissadell	PERSON	far off and its leafy ways , And the holy mountain whose mighty heart Gathers into it all the coloured days .

		My sorrow that I am not by the little dun By the lake of the starlings at evening when all is still , And still in whispering sedges the herons stand , 'T is there I would nestle at rest till the quivering moon Uprose in the golden quiet over the hill .

		And there are verses in the familiar , beautiful style of Autumnal and An Old Man .

		Yet it is evident that events have modified the
Seumas O'Sullivan	PERSON	of one 's old affection .

		He addresses MacDonagh : You who had garnered all that old song could give you , And rarer music in places where the bittern cries , What new strange symphonies , what new music thrills you , Flashing in light-loud magic beneath wildering skies ?

		Singer of dawn songs , you who drink now at the foun - tains , Cry out as your own poet of the bittern cried , Flood that new song , deep-drunken , rapturous , about us , So shall these parched sad hearts drink deep , be satisfied .

		Much of the specifically
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	poetry which has circulated publicly and privately since the
Easter Week Rising	ORGANIZATION	has all the defects of that rhetorical tradition of '48 against which
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	` revolted , to the advancement of Irish literature .

		But he him - self could not keep the Rebellion of
1916	DATE	out of his verse , no more than `` A. E. '' and others inno - cent of
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	doctrine .

		Mr.
O'Sullivan	PERSON	and Miss
Gore-Booth	PERSON	have been as fortunate as they in being able to respond to the impulse of national events without forgetting the demands of their exigent craftsmanship .

		Of the two remaining volumes it may be said that they have `` put
Belfast	LOCATION	on the map , '' `` so far as we appraisers of Anglo-Irish literature are concerned !

		We do not think of
Belfast	LOCATION	as precisely `` a nest of singing birds '' to quote the phrase that launched a hundred poets and thereby we respect the preju - dices of Garsonia itself .

		Belfast poets do not boast of their dalliance with the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	, and come almost surreptitiously to
Dublin	LOCATION	to flaunt their lyrical amours .

		Mr.
Anthony Allen	PERSON	, whose First Songs introduce us to a new poet from the northern city , was astonished to discover that a friend of his had preceded him pseudonymously on the path to
Maun	LOCATION	- sel 's and Parnassus .

		This was Mr.
Richard Rowley	PERSON	, who has added City Songs to his first venture of a year ago ,
The City of Refuge	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter contained more substantial promise than Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's
First Songs	ORGANIZATION	, which in spite of `` A. E. 's '' sponsorship remains a very commonplace contribution to minor poetry .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	can turn a pretty lyric , and he has a plaintive , ingenuous charm : but one is not conscious of a temperament from which deep poetry springs , as was the case in The Vengeance of
Fionn	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Austin Clarke	PERSON	, the newcomer of last year , of whom I have written in these notes .

		City Songs is not a work of Mr.
Austin Clarke	PERSON	's caliber .

		Verbalism and conventional phrases are common to both the
Belfast	LOCATION	poets , but Mr.
Rowley	PERSON	has really succeeded in giving us the poetry of Bel - fast , a thing we had almost come to believe non - existent , unless one accepted the tribal fanaticism of Orange battle hymns .

		But here comes a man who writes of the shipyard workers : Only strong hands Can give strength visible form ; Only proud hearts can fashion shape of pride ; Iron and steel are dead Till man 's creative will Shall weld them to the image he desires , Shall make a living symbol Of the strength and pride of his soul .

		Splendid the ships they build , More splendid far The hearts that dare conceive Such vastness and such power .

		Mr.
Rowley	PERSON	frankly accepts his role as the poet of industrial
Ireland	LOCATION	: My songs shall be songs of the city , of hoarse-voiced streets , Of streets where men have never time to dream , Of streets where women are seldom beautiful , And never happy .

		I shall sing to these men and women , Telling them that they starve , and their children starve , Because they are robbed of their birthright !

		I shall teach them how strong is the soul of determined men , And that only cowards go hungry and content ; That only slaves will see their children die And never strike a blow at them that slay !

		For a day shall come when the people shall not be afraid Of riches and of strength , nor of authority .

		Then they shall know that kings and senators Are ghosts and phantoms and imaginings Dreamed in the mind of man ... Lest it be supposed that Mr.
Rowley	PERSON	is the poet of
Belfast Bolshevism	LOCATION	, I may add that he has sung of the streets in a gentler mood , that his dialect pieces are excellent .

		When he does not mistake rhetorical exuberance for mysticism , as he occasionally does , his verse is informed by a quiet emotion which con - veys the beauty of humbler things , except when it flares up in a cry of passionate revolt .


ERNEST A. BOYD	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL
CLARENCE BRITTEN JOHN DEWEY GEORGE DONLIN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MAROT	PERSON	iHE HIGH HOPES WHICH THE WORLD HAS ENTER - tained for a peace settlement that will make future wars impossible do not seem likely to be realized .

		Whatever President
Wilson	PERSON	has in his mind about the prospects for a better world order he did not condescend to disclose to the American people in his last message to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which certainly in tone and very largely in substance was a valedictory to American problems .

		Concerning the railroads the President was frankly uncertain ; the problems of re - construction were left to the beneficent business man .

		And of peace not a word , except that the President was going to
Paris	LOCATION	to explain and interpret the famous fourteen points which Bonar Law once succinctly described in a phrase : `` All that we have asked for can be procured under the sanction of these fourteen points . ''

		The President practically washed his hands of American problems .

		The program for a larger navy was recommended , since it `` would be clearly unwise for us to attempt to adjust our pro- gram to a future world policy as yet undetermined . ''

		In other words , although the President frankly turned to his international problems with more eagerness and expectancy than he had shown .

		con - cerning our domestic problems , even here he was uncertain about the future .

		Now we do not need to dwell upon the bitter disappointment which this speech brought to American liberals , for the truth is that they have lost confidence in his ability to carry his formulated position .

		They have been disillusioned , until now his speeches seem too often like empty rhetoric .

		They have seen in the President 's intellectual development a hardening of ideological , eighteenth century concepts about the
State	ORGANIZATION	instead of any awakening consciousness of the fertility of the functional theory and the economic sanctions of plural sovereignty .

		They have watched in vain for any sign of his appreciation of even the commonplaces of present-day
Continental	ORGANIZATION	liberalism .

		They will watch with considerable irony and amuse - ment the same process of disillusion going on in
Europe	LOCATION	among those radical and Socialist groups which for over a year have been pinning their hopes to this verbal myth of a great statesman .

		We have no wish to be harsh or unfair , and no one more than THE DIAL can hope for the President the happiest of issues in his peace mission .

		We sincerely wish him well ; we sincerely hope that the
League of Free Nations	ORGANIZATION	, which he has described with such eloquence , may come into existence through the force of his personality and the wisdom of his leadership .

		Yet we can not disguise the bald facts with the same com - placency with which we may confidently expect the Creel mission to send the American public saccharine messages that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds .

		And the bald facts are frankly disquieting .

		An accredited correspondent to the
New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	, in a message from
Geneva	LOCATION	, frankly states that `` the action of one of the powers of the
Entente	ORGANIZATION	is threatening the possible peace of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' and goes on to state that
Italy	LOCATION	already is violating the terms of the armistice with
Austria	LOCATION	and engaging in frank imperialism .

		The liberated nationalities of
Central Europe	LOCATION	are quarreling among themselves .

		Lloyd George indulges in elec - tion speeches worthy of any jingo prima donna .

		No Allied government , moreover , has yet an - nounced any definite policy with respect to
Russia	LOCATION	and the intervention troops are still there .


Japan	LOCATION	has not yet stated that she intends to return Kiao - chow to
China	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	has observed that
England	LOCATION	can not give up the German colonies ; and Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	states with considerable emphasis that under no condition will the supremacy of Brit - ish sea power be compromised at the peace table .

		All this is hardly a pretty spectacle .

		Neither is it a pretty spectacle to observe the high-handed way in which the peace conditions are being drawn up by premiers and others who have no direct or clear mandate from the people they are supposed to repre - sent .

		Yet it is not only possible , it is probable , that we shall get a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		At all events it will be called that .

		And the clearest statement of what this
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will be like is contained in an interview with
Arthur J. Balfour	PERSON	.

		He said : `` It is folly to suppose that the world can be quickly turned into a series of free States with free institu - tions like the
United States	LOCATION	... I think that the league ought to act as trustee of these countries that have not yet reached the state at which true democ - racy can be applied .

		Democracy is not a suit of clothes that can be put on at any stage of develop - ment . ''

		There we have it in a nutshell .

		There is to be a hierarchy of States , with
England	LOCATION	, ourselves ,
France	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	in control .

		If that is what we mean by a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, let us call it by its right name , a league of the strong nations to exploit the weak .

		562 THE DIAL
December 14 1	DATE	HE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRAGEDY AND MELO - drama , if we are to believe our blandly cheerful pro- fessors , is merely that in tragedy the action proceeds from character , whereas in melodrama puppets are fitted into an action .

		But have they sufficiently re - garded the sort of melodrama that has inherited the vogue of the American crook play ?

		Such pieces as
Friendly Enemies and Three Faces East	ORGANIZATION	to con - fine ourselves to survivors fill one with a profound sense of moral discouragement , Almost with a sort of terror ; and the professors ' easy and harmless dis - tinction is quite inadequate to account , for the im - pression of vague discomfort and subtle danger that such plays leave behind them .

		No , the permanence , and the permanent menace , of melodrama is due .

		to the fact that it is a projection of the moral absolutism of the tribal mind .

		Here that mind finds its pas - sions and its prejudices symbolized and embodied .

		Here it enjoys the fierce delight of seeing its own image of itself triumph over all who blur that image .

		Here , then , from its own point of view justice is done thevsort of justice most abhorrent to the free intel - ligence .

		For it is not a justice based upon the inner need of souls engaged in the conflict of life , but a brutal enforcement of the limited and remorseless passions of the tribe and the hour .

		Does this not suggest a truer difference between tragedy and melo - `` drama ?

		In tragedy everybody is both right and wrong : in melodrama everybody is either right or wrong ; there are no perplexities , and moral violence takes the place of moral judgment .

		If anyone doubt this let him produce on Broadway a melodrama in which a heroic part is assigned to a foreigner , an irreconcilable unhappy married person , an idle rich man , a lord , a sensible parent or an unheroic atti - tude and fate to patriotic youths , patient wives , gal - lant crooks , young sweethearts , the romantically con - tented poor .

		If these examples seem trivial , consider the reckless moral bullying , the unashamed ferocity , with which the contemporary melodramatist cele - brates his utter oneness with the tribal instincts to which he leads his trivial sacrifices .

		All these con - siderations are strengthened rather than weakened by the success of the one serious play that has thus far distinguished the theatrical season Redemption , an English version of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's The Living Corpse .

		For when every allowance has been made for the attractiveness of the exquisite stage pictures , of the faithful costumes , and of the beautifully ren - dered folk-songs of Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	' production for
John Barrymore	PERSON	, the changed name of this version still points very clearly how genuine tragedy must be popularized into melodrama for American con - sumption .

		Tolstoy 's Fedya is not a `` good '' man who becomes `` bad '' and is then redeemed .

		Prob - ably the terms of Mr.
Barrymore	PERSON	's thinking were not so crude ; but certainly he did not quite grasp the intellectual despair that is
Fedya	ORGANIZATION	's doom .

		Like half of all great literature the play is the cry of pain we utter over the discrepancy between our desires and aspirations and the smallness of our power to stamp their image upon life .

		From his essential pain and despair the drink and the den are but accidents
Fedya	ORGANIZATION	is not redeemed .

		Nor do any misdeeds of his demand his death , but the brutal stupidity of social interference with private rights .

		Even in this popularized version however and in spite of many bald and mechanical passages in the acting , passages for which the sensitiveness , the poetry , and the dis - tinction of Mr.
Barrymore	PERSON	's art scarcely atone there is in
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's play the bread and wine of great art .

		There is no intrigue and no theatrical struc - ture at all , and no vain gestures or conventional lies or pitiful subterfuges .

		The broken scenes have tech - nically no perceptible rise and
fall	DATE	.

		We are con - scious of reality .

		And the theater is greatest when it transcends and so eliminates itself , when we ex - claim not `` What a good show this is ! ''

		but `` How deep life is ! ''

		, AFTER ALL , THE STAPLE OF OUR STAGE is NEITHER melodrama nor tragedy , but comedy .

		It is not artificial comedy and it is not critical comedy : it follows the tradition of neither
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	nor
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		The former does not grow out of our society ; the latter would be considered immoral .

		The reason why most people laugh a little vacantly when
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	is mentioned is that they sus - pect , quite rightly , that he is a hard and ruthless thinker ; and hard thinking strikes them as an im - propriety .

		They will forgive a man 's peccadillos if he believes in marriage , his thefts if he proclaims his love for honesty , his private atheism if he attends public worship .

		Hence high comedy , which is sharp and cool and revealing , seems immodest to them .

		At a genuinely modern version of Tartuffe they would almost feel robbed of some necessary garment and hasten to avoid the winds of a moral weather so bracing but so new .

		Accordingly the typical -LRB- not the best -RRB- comedies of the early season are
Penrod	ORGANIZATION	and Daddies for
America	LOCATION	, Humpty-Dumpty and the Saving Grace for
England	LOCATION	.

		The common char - acteristic of these comedies is that they depict life not as it is but as it seems to a casual and uncritical observer in short , as it seems to itself .

		The au - thors of such pieces merely hold up to human na - ture mirrors that reflect back what human nature likes to think of itself .

		Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	not only knows the
Middle West	LOCATION	: his implication is that it is a perfect and happy place where appearance and reality are one , where virtue and prosperity have lain down together .

		The boy
Penrod	PERSON	is set forth not only as true but as admirable ; the unlovely and spiritless vegetation of his parents the woman 's futile domestic bustle , the man 's pathetic money - grubbing is exhibited as a slice of sound American life .

		Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	has reached a level from which he observes the surface of life ; the colder heights of thinking about it are not for him .

		Nor are they for Mr.
H. A. Vachel	PERSON	.

		His Humpty -
Dumpty	ORGANIZATION	is a barber who is suddenly supposed to be an earl , but who is not happy as an earl and returns
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 563 with pathetic delight to his tonsorial art , and whose story satisfies with astonishing nicety the crowd 's alternating love and hatred , envy and terror , of wealth and rank .

		Mr.
Haddon Chambers	PERSON	' The ' Saving Grace is even more flagrant , for it takes at his face value the `` stupid soldier man '' in
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's Getting Married and uses an historical accident to glorify that shiftless , brainless militarist .

		In these plays triteness turns paradox and
Longfellow	PERSON	's poor old saying that `` things are not what they seem '' would cause a riot .

		A TYPICAL INSTANCE OF NEWS DISTORTION ABOUT
Russia	LOCATION	was the recent advance notice in our daily papers of a
St. Bartholomew	LOCATION	's massacre of the entire middle class to take place on
November 10	DATE	.

		This report was based on a certain modicum of fact , according to reliable information recently received from
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		It is true that placards inviting the soldiers and workers and poorer peasants to exercise `` mass terror '' were posted on the walls of buildings in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, and that in the notice as it actually appeared the words ``
St. Bartholomew	LOCATION	'' did occur .

		What had happened was that
Zinovieff	PERSON	,
Commis	PERSON	- sioner for the Suppression of the Counter-Revolu - tion , who had been working under high pressure for months , had been so attacked and plotted against that in a moment of temporary weakness his nerve snapped .

		Angry and bitter , he gave orders that the notice should be published .

		It was a human and understandable phenomenon anyone who works un - der constant threat of assassination and against the handicap of constant intrigue and misrepresentation is likely sooner or later to lose his temper .

		Zinovieff did .

		But what was the reception accorded this ill - advised notice ?

		Was it eagerly seized upon by the disgruntled populace as an excuse for a general mas - sacre and for general looting ?

		So our newspapers hastened to inform us .

		But the facts were exactly the opposite .

		The local
Council of Workmen	ORGANIZATION	and Soldiers met in extraordinary session and promptly proceeded to depose Zinovieff .

		Not content with that , they had the offending placards torn from the walls and the buildings .

		A resolution was offered and carried that on
November 10	DATE	, instead of a reign of `` mass murder '' being inaugurated , a general political amnesty should be proclaimed , meaning that even the enemies of the Soviet Government should be released .

		- Proclamations announcing this lenient action of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	were at once printed and distributed throughout the city yet only one of the
New York	LOCATION	metropolitan dailies saw fit even to print the news dispatch announcing the true facts and even in that case , with no explanation of the attendant circumstances .

		We give this account less because of its intrinsic importance than because it illustrates an aspect of the Russian Revolution with which Americans are wholly unfamiliar .

		This inci - dent is a typical example of what Russians call `` revolutionary self-discipline , '' the restraint imposed on themselves by the revolutionists when they may have been led into some intemperate course of action by the hasty order of some leader or faction .

		It has happened , in varying degrees , not once but many times during the course of the Soviet regime .

		The suppression , for instance , of the anarchists by the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	will be startling information to those naive newspaper readers who imagine that anarchism and Bolshevism are synonymous .

		Yet the fact is that never during
Kerensky	PERSON	's regime did the Gov - ernment feel strong enough to deal firmly with the supporters of the black flag .

		It required the revolu - tionary self-discipline methods of the Soviet Govern - ment to do that .

		i AMERICAN ADVOCATES OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY training have had the wind taken out of their sails by the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	's new attitude on the subject .

		Hardly had the armistice been signed when British statesmen began to express their hope for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	that would make conscrip - tion unnecessary .

		This is going to the very heart of the significance of the approaching peace .

		The prin - ciple of conscription which its admirers like to call euphemistically universal military training or , bet - ter , service is the very core and foundation of mili - tarism .

		Without it militaristic nationalism would be impossible .

		If a government can no longer count on turning its maximum man-power into a military machine , it will be compelled to find other techniques than force to secure its political ends in the world society .

		A war to end militarism must have been primarily a war to end conscription .

		In bringing this point so speedily and so dramatically to the fore - front , British policy has stolen a march not only on the Allied premiers but even on President
Wilson	PERSON	himself .

		There are .

		signs that this utterance was no mere impulse of separate ministers , but that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	has considered the question and decided against compulsory military training as a perma - nent policy .

		Some months ago
H. A. L. Fisher	PERSON	,
Minister of Education	ORGANIZATION	, told a delegation from the Miners ' Federation that the Government had de - cided that the innovation had neither educational nor military value and would not be adopted .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's fourth `` Point '' asks for `` adequate guaran - tees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domes - tic safety . ''

		This is a somewhat academic way per - haps of saying what
Fisher	PERSON	and
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	have said with commendable bluntness .

		The American Exec - utive has not been explicit enough to prevent the dis - cussion here of compulsory training as a feasible if not an imminent measure .

		It is to be hoped that some word will be uttered in
America	LOCATION	also that will destroy the vitality of any such discussion dur - ing the coming reconstruction of peace time .

		5 6 4 THE DIAL
December 14	DATE	Communications TRUE - INFORMATION FROM
RUSSIA	LOCATION	is NEEDED SIR : What is happening now in
Russia	LOCATION	?

		Are the reported horrors of
Russia	LOCATION	's everyday life under the Soviet 's rule reality or lies lies deliberately fabri - cated in order to discredit the Soviets now in power or are they the unconscious exaggeration dictated by panic and hatred ?

		If there is the basis of truth in the reports we receive from
Russia	LOCATION	, to what extent are the horrors occurring there due to the Government of the Soviets and to what extent are they the mere result of ; the conditions created by the old regime and the war conditions inherited by the new regime ?

		The questions above put are of peculiar interest for Americans , who by the will of history are designated to play the most important role in the reconstruction of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Of all belligerent coun - tries
America	LOCATION	alone possesses the food supplies which can keep
Europe	LOCATION	alive until the next harvest .

		In relation to
Russia	LOCATION	the
Associated Governments	ORGANIZATION	are facing the dilemma whether to continue their military occupation of that country ; or to substitute for military intervention economic assistance .

		At first it was insisted that military intervention was prompted by the necessity of fighting the Ger - mans occupying Russian soil , and creating an East - ern , front .

		No matter whether any such motive had from the beginning a real foundation , now it has lost every meaning .

		The war over , military intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	can be considered only as an interference in the internal affairs of the
Russian Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	and a violation of the principle of self-determination of nations .

		It is true that mankind has never been ruled by abstract principles .

		If all that is being reported of the Soviets ' rule is true if an organized brutality has secured the support of the bulk of
Russia	LOCATION	then neither the Soviets ' Government nor the Russian nation itself has the right to endanger the world longer .

		At present , without discrimination , every detri - mental rumor about the Soviets ' rule in
Russia	LOCATION	is being spread over the world , multiplied in editorials and special articles , and accepted at face value with - out investigation .

		One day we are told that the Soviets are planning a Bartholomew-tide in
Petro	LOCATION	- grad ; a few days later the report is canceled and we are told that not only are the Soviets not plan - ning slaughter but are releasing political prisoners .

		Not very long ago we had the opportunity of read - ing in a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper a detailed description pf the execution of Breshko-Breshkovjkaya in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, .

		and forty-eight hours later the same paper announced that she was on her way to
America	LOCATION	.

		Nolens-volens .

		One remembers
Figaro	PERSON	's famous saying : `` Calomniez ,
Calomniez	LOCATION	; il en reste toujours quelque chose . ''

		Very vitally it is necessary that the fine line of distinction be drawn between fact and falsehood or rumor as to what is happening in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is necessary , too , to discriminate between two cate - gories of lies .

		There are lies that are being deliber - ately fabricated purporting to '' discredit the new regime in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Such lies were fabricated even under
Kerensky	ORGANIZATION	's regime .

		To the Monarchists and Counter-Revolutionists the Kerensky government was hated as much as the Soviets ' .

		Almost more patent are unconscious lies , exaggera - tions dictated by panic and hatred .

		In
October 1917	DATE	I spent several weeks in
Japan	LOCATION	on my way to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		I met there a company of Russian Monarchists who had `` escaped '' from Rus - sia .

		Passionately and with all the semblance of sincerity , they related `` eyewitness '' accounts of the terrors of
Kerensky	ORGANIZATION	's rule which made decent men 's blood boil .

		But I had lived through
Kerensky	ORGANIZATION	's rule , and I knew from absolute fact that all they said was false .

		So I was not surprised when the day after
Kerensky	ORGANIZATION	's fall the same group began to praise Kerensky as the `` real defender of
Russia	LOCATION	's liberties . ''

		Nevertheless , behind the black spreading of rumor there was and is a basis of fact .

		Revolutions are not pleasant .

		They are cruel and desperate .

		Revo - lutions themselves do not grow out of pleasant con - ditions .

		They are bred by cruelty and desperation .

		It must be emphasized that to the Revolution in
Russia	LOCATION	has been attributed phenomena which were but indirectly connected with it , phenomena which not the Revolution but the economic de - bacle of
Russia	LOCATION	brought about , phenomena which were not the result of the Revolution but its very cause .

		Hunger in the cities was brought about not by the Revolution but by the shortage of products and the disorganization of railroad traffic through the war .

		Revolution or no revolution , both shortage and traffic disorganization were bound to continue and to become more , not less , acute .

		It is true that the Revolution emphasized these events with especial effect on privileged classes .

		For a well-to-do family in
Russia	LOCATION	, accustomed to many servants , the mere fact of doing without any servants at all was already a tragedy .

		For a Russian who had always traveled cleanly and comfortably in first-class coaches in the days of the Czar , it was a bitter and calamitous misfortune to come down to the smells and un - washed companionship of a third-class car full of smoke .

		Elementary comforts easily become a part of us .

		While we have them we are not aware of them ; losing them we even remember Czars with affection .

		In countries of material culture , ele - mentary comforts are common property .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	,
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 565 where the masses were always hungry and during the war half starving , elementary comforts were the exclusive privilege of the more or less well-to-do and educated .

		Yet the greatest part of these comforts would shortly have been torn from the privileged Russian also , even though the Revolution had not occurred , through the rapid disintegration of the entire Rus - sian economic organism .

		The former privileged Russian is frightened , and fear has big eyes .

		How fear exaggerates dangers may be seen from the fol - lowing incident .

		On
October 10 , 1917	DATE	, nearly a month before the Bolshevist revolution , I left
Petro	PERSON	- grad in an excellent Siberian express .

		We were twenty in a first-class sleeping car .

		At the
Vologda	LOCATION	station a number of soldiers demanded admittance to our car .

		They were on a ten days ' furlough .

		One of them had lost a leg in a battle .

		Facing our resistance , the soldiers agreed to withdraw provided we permitted their comrade who had lost a leg to ride with us .

		There was opposition even to this .

		Especially enraged against what he called the `` im - pudence '' of the soldiers , was a merchant of middle age who was traveling with his wife .

		`` Just think of it ! ''

		he said to the soldiers , `` I paid one thousand rubles for two tickets ! ''

		The soldiers replied : `` Our comrade lost a leg . ''

		We took in the wounded soldier .

		The merchant , incidentally a good-natured fellow , could not rest however .

		Constantly he repeated : `` Just think of it !

		I paid one thousand rubles ! ''

		At the station at
Omsk	LOCATION	there was a train full of soldiers .

		They demanded that their train leave first .

		After some dispute and delay we started first .

		Nothing else occurred on the journey and we reached
Vladivostok	LOCATION	a day late .

		Instead of ten days the trip had taken eleven .

		But you should have heard the horrors some of our passengers re - lated of our journey .

		One became so excited that he quite sincerely said we escaped narrowly with our lives .

		To me , a constant dweller in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, who spent there all the time from the beginning of the Revolution till
October 10 , 1917	DATE	, it was highly interesting to hear in
Vladivostok	LOCATION	, and after in
Japan	LOCATION	, how men who spent in
Petrograd	LOCATION	only two or three weeks under
Kerensky	ORGANIZATION	's regime saw `` with their own eyes '' all the horrors of
Petrograd	LOCATION	life of which they spoke .

		They said one with a white collar could not walk without taking chances ; one could not go out in decent shoes and a decent suit of clothes without taking chances of being attacked and robbed .

		Such things never happened in
Petro	LOCATION	- grad .

		My friends and I myself through the Revo - lution still wore white collars , decent shoes and clothes , mingled with the people on the street con - tinuously ; nothing dire or even unpleasant ever happened to us .

		There can be no doubt that under the succeeding Soviet regime life became much harder in
Russia	LOCATION	, especially for the bourgeoisie .

		Great
Russia	LOCATION	, cut off from
Ukraine	LOCATION	and
Siberia	LOCATION	, was deprived of food supplies .

		The disintegration of the economic organism of the land , begun in the Czar 's day , is going on from bad to worse .

		With or with - out a Bolshevist revolution the conditions of life would inevitably become harder .

		The demobiliza - tion of an army of ten millions could not take place smoothly under any regime .

		Even before the Revolution one dwelt with a spirit of anxiety and fear on what awaited
Russia	LOCATION	at the demobilization of ten million soldiers ten million exhausted , smarting men who had looked Death in the face .

		Without doubt under the Soviets the social leveling tendencies were accelerated and intensified , which with the lack of food made life for the former privileged classes almost unbearable .

		Without doubt there were and are being committed cruelties by the Soviets .

		But these cruelties are matched in no less degree by those of their enemies .

		There is no more horrible war than civil war .

		Every revolution calls out a more or less lasting civil war between the adherents of the new regime and the real or some - times imaginary defenders of the old order , and also between the extreme and the moderate ele - ments of the revolution .

		The profounder the char - acter of a revolution , the profounder the social problems it calls forth and the more terrible the sacrifices which are demanded .

		A revolution is the more cruel , the more is the state of despair to which the people have been brought before the revolution .

		Every revolution ought to be considered as a na - tional calamity .

		It is not the guilt of the people , hampered on the path of progress by the old order and brought by it to the brink of an abyss , which has effected the calamity .

		Let us remember
Burke	PERSON	's famous saying : `` I do not know how to draw up an indictment against a whole people . ''

		The most important condition to understand Rus - sia of today is to get true information and true

		By
Peter Clark Macfarlane	PERSON	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	.

		Politics is not adjourned in this novel at least not the brand which is muddy and municipal .

		Corrup - tion is piled upon corruption , until it takes a deal of blasting to bring the reform motif to the surface .

		And sometimes this blasting process does n't entirely carry conviction ; the story has been so weighted down with major and minor rottenness that one has difficulty in swallowing the phenomenal reform flourish which brings it to a close .

		That of course is the chief danger in this field of fiction the diffi - culty of maintaining an even keel .

		The author has not been content to keep his canvas in modest proportions ; he has gone in for sweeping effects beyond the scope of a somewhat journalistic and su - perficial mode of attack .

		It takes a fictioneer of rather more poise than Mr.
Macfarlane	PERSON	to pilot his way with artistic precision in the midst of such a story .

		But Mr.
Macfarlane	PERSON	is desperately in ear - nest , and his zeal has lent a certain forcefulness to the narrative .

		On the other hand , he has not always been able to drop the reform motif out of scenes in which it is sadly misapplied .

		When the young reformer is struck down by an assassin 's knife , and .

		is hovering between life and death , it is rather bathetic to find his fiancee kneeling at his side to exclaim : `` Jerry !

		Are you alive ?

		You must be !

		You must live ,
Jerry	PERSON	.

		Forme !

		For
Philadelphia	LOCATION	! ''

		Surely this was no time for mock municipalities .

		Similarly , on the day when
Jerry	PERSON	awakens to the cor - ruption of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, he approaches an old Jewish peddler whose husband has just been mistreated by the police .

		`` My good woman , '' he says , `` you appear to be in distress . ''

		Some of the best scenes in the novel suffer from this recurring stiffness .

		To put the defect in a word , Mr.
Macfarlane	PERSON	's dialogue lacks an infusion of imagination .

		The garnering of stray bits from the indefatigable
Hearn	PERSON	still continues , the latest sheaves appearing in two volumes of an attractive new issue of books known as the Penguin Series .

		The Karma volume contains four diverse pieces of writing , and the Japanese Fairy Tales contains four
Hearn	PERSON	versions , along with nearly a score of others from such authors as Grace James and
Basil Hall Chamber	ORGANIZATION	- lain .

		The Penquin Series most pleasingly printed and bound is to be devoted to books never before issued in
America	LOCATION	, and includes
Henry James	PERSON	' Ga - brielle de Bergerac and
Sudennann	ORGANIZATION	's lolanthe 's Wedding among its first numbers .

		The pieces in - Karma have little in common save authorship .

		Karma itself is typically
Hearn	PERSON	a sensitive , flowing , idealistic bit , with a sustained analytic note .

		There is , however , disappointment at the end , where
Hearn	PERSON	has sagged into sentimental - ism .


China	LOCATION	and the
Western World	ORGANIZATION	is a venture at interpretation and prophecy , to be read with interest in the light of ' what has transpired since it was written , while A Ghost and Bilal reveal other phases of the restless , delving
Hearn	PERSON	mind .

		In the Japanese Fairy Tales , it will be seen that the children of the Orient have treasures to match
Grimm	PERSON	in naivete and wonder .

		These stories are quite as irrational as they are ingratiating .

		MOTIVES IN ENGLISH FICTION .

		By
Robert Naylor Whiteford	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		It is not feasible to write a `` history of English fiction '' at the expense of the English language .

		The critic need not be a stylist , but he deserves to be thrust into outer 4 ar ^ ness if he can not set his thoughts on paper with some degree of lucidity .

		In putting up Professor
Whiteford	PERSON	as a candidate for outer darkness , therefore , it will hardly be necessary to submit more than two specimens from his text .

		Joseph comes next who is invulnerable to any attacks made upon his catechism which he has thoroughly mastered .

		The only redeeming feature in the analysis of the dis - agreeable in
Swift	LOCATION	's fiction is that this coarseness of sardonic , diabolical humor in portraying the pathos of human life is the strength of the shaft of Fielding 's or
Smollett	PERSON	's satirical spear , when it pricks the side of the reader to provoke hilarious , unhallowed laughter that dies away in tears , which flow because of the realization of the meanness , badness and madness of the rogue called man ; and this strange mingling of humor and pathos in satirical caricature , characterization , and dialogue , Swift largely inherited as a legacy from
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	.

		When Prof.
Whiteford	PERSON	starts a sentence , he grows panicky with the fear that if he comes to a full stop he may never have the courage to go on .

		Hence , a style which is superbly incoherent and quite beyond mental gulping .

		As for the content of the volume , it is on a par with the execution .

		Bowing to the author 's prefatory admission that `` this book shows the motives that color the threads in the warp and woof of all our fiction , '' we still can not stifle the conviction that the garment is cut on a most peculiar pattern .

		The author seems to have a mania for `` connecting links , '' `` leading motives , '' and `` varia - tions . ''

		Thus
Jane Austen	PERSON	is harnessed between Fielding and
Meredith	PERSON	, while
Marryat	ORGANIZATION	is chained between
Smollett	PERSON	and
Kingsley	PERSON	.

		Professor White - ford lets Conrad off with two lines so that
Letitia Landon	PERSON	-LRB- circa 1830 -RRB- may have four pages ; he brackets
Hall Caine	PERSON	and
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	as of even merit ; he lingers over Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	and dismisses
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	with a gesture ; he has two references to the author of The Way of All Flesh and thirty-four to Mrs.
Ann Radcliffe	PERSON	.

George Meredith	PERSON	, you can scarcely find him

		SOCIAL PROCESS .

		By
Charles H. Cooley	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		This is a rather colorless and vigorless book , tepid in its argument and timid in its antipathies .

		Nearly all present-day aspects of the social problem na - tional and international are passed in calm review , and there is never a page that burns the fingers , nor a paragraph so keenly pointed as to scratch any political skin .

		The chapters on nationality in rela - tion to a league of nations are instructive : the national state , it is argued , must remain the back - bone of our social structure , and yet may fit into an international order in the same sense and measure in which matured individuality fits into the national state .

		Indeed the problem may turn out to be as much one of preserving national freedom as of limiting national sovereignty .

		A league that be - comes a conspiracy for the maintenance of vested interests and established social stratifications , by armed intervention if necessary , would be as great an evil , surely , as unlimited national sovereignty it would be a strait-jacket put upon a growing world , and war would merely change its name into revolu - tion .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, says Professor
Cooley	PERSON	, `` must also provide a process of orderly change by which the world may assimilate new conditions and avoid fresh disaster . ''

		`` Our discipline will fail un - less we can get good will to support it . ''

		Precisely ; and it is a point on which one could wish that Pro- fessor
Cooley	PERSON	had spared a little more energy of con - viction and utterance .

		By
T. Dempsey	PERSON	.

		Long - mans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The Irish have always had a penchant for the lore of the ancients , and Mr.
Dempsey	PERSON	has captured much the same spirit of geniality , lucidity , and sympathy as his compatriot Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	.

		He is so immersed in his topic that he can speak of the works of German savants with urbanity and can mention the forays of the Gauls without alluding to the Hun .

		In a quiet conversational style , he shows how the statesmen of a day when there was no
Colonel House	ORGANIZATION	used the seeress of Apollo to frame policies .

		The general reader will glean an interesting insight into Greek psychology ; the scholarly will perhaps find that Mr.
Dempsey	PERSON	con - fines his research rather too closely to the orbis terrarum of strictly classical antiquity .

		His account of the forerunners of Apollo is very thorough , but has no allusion to the modern studies of Pelasgic origins .

		He has some acquaintance with the Minoan theories of the Cretan excavator , but is as silent as the
Oracle	ORGANIZATION	about the Hittites and other peoples of nearer
Asia	LOCATION	, whose influence on the Hellenic world is being uncovered by the recent archeologists .

		Nor has he pushed his lines far enough into modern times to develop the analogies
Ferrero	PERSON	would have developed with
Madame Thebes	ORGANIZATION	or Eusapia Pal - ladino .

		Mr.
Dempsey	PERSON	does not try very hard to rend the veil of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, but he hazards the suggestion that `` telepathy '' and other `` phenomena '' studied by contemporary `` research '' may explain the Sacred Mysteries .

		One trusts that time will reveal whether this is not another explaining of superstition by recourse to later superstition .

		THE FABRIC OF DREAMS .

		By
Katherine Tay	PERSON	- lor
Craig	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Miss
Craig	PERSON	's book may be heartily recommended both to those who believe in dreams and to those who do n't .

		The history of the belief in dreams through the ages is a fascinating record of human curiosity .

		Even if we do not share the belief , there still is nothing like the curiosity of others to stim - ulate our own .

		Nor are there many problems which have equally stimulated human ingenuity , from Arte - midorus to
Freud	LOCATION	.

		Has not Professor
Woodworth	PERSON	wrathfully asserted that a theory as ingenious as
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's could not possibly be true , as if scientists are in duty bound to make only dull discoveries ?

		But
Freud	PERSON	has done more than irritate Professor
Woodworth	PERSON	.

		His publications have certainly created a boom in dream theories , with the popular , the pseudo-scientific , and the contra-scientific in close competition with each other .

		There is a touch of irony in the thought that Freud himself should to some extent be responsible for the revival of popular dream theories .

		He has often remarked that it was partly the persistent popular belief in dreams which helped him to doubt the dogmatic assertion of psychologists that all dreams are nonsense ; he sub - sequently came to the conclusion that the intuition of the masses as to the psychic value and importance of the dream was justified even though the popular method of interpretation was utterly fantastic .

		The soothsayers and the almanacs were far too chronic in misinterpretation to hesitate before these re - marks of
Freud	LOCATION	; they hastened to make the most of the advertisement which had been thrown their way .

		Miss
Craig	PERSON	can not altogether be classed among these .

		Her book is the result of a great deal of patience and research and a valiant attempt to pre - sent the material impartially for others to judge .

		But she nevertheless represents the naive attitude

		That is why her book is sure to fill many wants .

		It contains among other things a fairly competent discussion of the latest scientific theories concerning the dream , a dip into the ancient art of geomancy , .

		a discussion of dreams that have come true but not of those which have not come true , and a synopsis of the dream almanacs .

		Its emphasis upon fixed symbols in the interpretation of dreams ought especially to recom - mend it to those prolific disciples of Jung under whose leadership the difficult psychoanalytic tech - nique of Freud has been abandoned in favor of the so-called objective method of dream interpretation , which does not call upon the dreamer to sweat out his associations to the dream but interprets it ` for him by expounding the meaning of the fixed symbols which his dream may contain .

		This method is a little hard on those who have real afflictions but very absorbing for those who have no serious need of psychoanalysis .

		It is mystical and fascinating to know that there is something to your dream without knowing just what it is .

		THE COURSE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY .

		By
W. J. McGlothlin	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The author of this significant volume , by recog - nizing the trend in the moderri study of history away from its emphasis on politics and wars to its social and moral bases , points out that to the general student of history Christianity will necessarily be - come more and more a subject of sympathetic study / To this end he sketches in cursory outline the course of Christian history from its inception to its present diffusions and tendencies in various corners of the world .

		Within the extreme limitations of his allot - ment of pages he does a good piece of work .

		It is refreshing to note that `` Ancient , Medieval , and Modern '' disappear as divisional units , and that in their place nine periods are marked off as embracing the whole scope of Christian history .

		One regrets however that the author did not see fit to discuss some of the social and psychological interactions that had peculiar religious developments in given situa - tions , as for instance his failure even to mentiqn the mystics .

		THE RESPONSIBLE STATE .

		By
Franklin H. Giddings	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		`` These lectures , '' says the author 's preface , `` make in print a small book ; nevertheless it is a product of long reflection checked up by a varied experience . ''

		Beginning with a brief sketch of the origins of the state a sketch in which there is considerable mini - mizing and rationalizing of the martial phases of these origins the book plunges in medias Kaiser , and passes into international polemic .

		There is a severe arraignment of German `` efficiency , '' collec - tivism , and military regimentation , followed by a severe arraignment of American inefficiency , indi - vidualism , and lack of military regimentation .

		The necessity and beneficence of universal service are stressed , and the danger of its being used for the intimidation of minorities -LRB- or majorities -RRB- and the making of menial minds is confidently denied .

		There is no consideration of the expressed purpose of President
Wilson	PERSON	to establish such an international concert as may bring partial disarmament and the end of large military establishments .

		The Presi - dent 's delay in entering the war is sarcastically criticised , and the credit for his final decision is assigned to a small group of intellectuals , at whose mention the author swells with a sense of quorum pars magna fui .

		The book , in short , is thoroughly Theodorian , and carries with it very little of the liberalism that was once associated with Professor
Giddings	PERSON	' name .

		It may be that we are a bit too prone to drop the mantle of immortality about the shoulders of the poet whose pen is stayed in the midst of war .

		The critical eye tends to be distracted by the shadow of tragedy falling across the page of those `` collected works '' which sometimes follow so precipitately particularly if the poet has met death in the service of his country .

		There is a quite understandable ardor about the first evaluations , which may need to be qualified later on just as certain estimates of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	have been altered since the initial burst of praise .

		Circumstances have lent something of a martyr touch , likewise , to the death of
Dora Sigerson	PERSON	a touch which is emphatically insisted upon in the two prefaces to The Sad Years .

		Mrs.
Shorter	PERSON	was absorbed in the cause of
Ireland	LOCATION	, and her labors in behalf of the rebellion of Easter week `` consumed her like a flame into which she flung all her gifts . ''

		Now , whether this literally may be read into the record or not , it doubtless gives a certain poignancy to the present collection of verse all written since the beginning of the war .

		The book takes its title from the first poem , a war - weary exhortation of compact power and feeling .

		There are several other war poems of similar trend .

		Viewing the volume as a whole , however , one can - not dodge the conviction that much of its contents is not poetry .

		Mrs.
Shorter	PERSON	has notsalways sought the springs of lyric utterance , even where lyric utterance is indispensable .

		This is the defect of such poems as The Hours of Illness , The Palace Gate , and I Saw Children Playing .

		ELIZABETH 'S CAMPAIGN .

		By Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Under the stress of imminent danger the non - essential elements of life drop away and those in - dividuals who would preserve them at the expense of the larger safety are regarded by the rest of the world as outside the pale of reasonable consideration .

		Several well-known English writers have recently put forth novels dealing with the social , political , and artistic life of
London	LOCATION	before the war , showing how since the outbreak of war many tendencies which were superficial or morbid have disappeared while those which were robust and fundamental have survived and developed .

		In
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's Cam - paign Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	shows a similar change taking place in another section of English society the land - owning class .

		That class is no longer exempt from governmental control ; local committees have been formed to examine the resources of each estate with power to enforce their development ; bad farming or unused land is no longer tolerated , and every foot of ground is now made to contribute its utmost to the support of the country .

		This has been brought about by
Dora	PERSON	, who is the true heroine of this story , although the ostensible heroine is the patriotic and incredibly perfect
Elizabeth	PERSON	, who by tact and moral suasion induces
Squire Mannering	ORGANIZATION	, whose selfish conservatism approaches pacifism , to comply with the government regulations .

		Among the characters in the tale are several that are often considered typi - cally British : there is the heavy , overbearing father , the timid daughter , the somewhat supercilious young officer .

		Do such types still exist in actual life ?

		If so we hope that they will not survive the war , either in actuality or in serious fiction 1 .

		As it is , they give this book its slightly archaic flavor .

		Food conserva - tion and land utilization , though vitally important as means of national defense , are perhaps somewhat uninspiring subjects for a novel , and that may be the reason why this story makes so little appeal , and compares so unfavorably in plot and handling with much of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's previous work .

		What we are given however is a very vivid impression of the terrible tension in
England	LOCATION
last April	DATE	while the nation was awaiting the German offensive an im - pression that would be almost unbearable if we were not so sensible at the present moment of the negative results of that same offensive .

		How MOTION PICTURES ARE MADE .

		By
Homer Croy	PERSON	.

$ 4	MONEY	.

		If Mr.
Croy	PERSON	is a prophet , the teaching profession is walking wide-eyed into oblivion .

		Its sole salva - tion , if we interpret Mr.
Croy	PERSON	's crystal correctly , is to learn the operation of a projection machine , retire within the fireproof fastnesses of an asbestos booth , and reel off the necessary instruction from that quiet retreat .

		The prospect is appalling .

		We are to have fewer textbooks , fewer teachers , less apparatus , shorter courses .

		The whole of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	will be in seven reels and will be presented in a way much more vivid than in its present unrelated generalities .

		The movements of centuries will be brought out in an hour and will be more vivid and permanent in their last - ing effects on the student 's mind than the same material covered from textbooks in a semester 's course .

		A student who is forced by economic stress to seek employment early will be able by means of motion pictures to get a fairly comprehensive idea of American history and scientific subjects , with some familiarity with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and then devote himself or herself to short - hand or any of the immediately capitalized branches of study .

		We imagine that the author wrote his prophecy in haste , and is now repenting at leisure .

		Still he would have turned out a better book if he had kept his feet on the ground .

		The only `` familiarity with Shakespeare '' which is ever likely to come to us through the films will be `` undue familiarity , '' and as for putting `` the whole of the American Revolu - tion '' in seven reels , even a camera would wink at that assignment .

		Mr.
Croy	PERSON	traces the evolution of motion pictures in an entertaining manner , recalls some of the amus - ing makeshifts of its early days , and gives a good account of the workings of the modern studio .

		igi8 THE DIAL 577 Mother USED to be a little bit ashamed of the way I felt about Mother .

		I loved her , of course loved her with all the love that could be crowded into a boy 's heart but I hated to show it .

		Only girls and babies , I thought , showed affection .

		It was n't `` manly '' for a boy to be petted especially if there was some one around to see .

		I used to go to Mother when I had cut my finger or had some childish grief or woe and she would bind up the wound in my finger and my heart and drive away all the pain and sor - row in some strange , mys - terious way that only mothers know about .

		Then she 'd put her arm around me and smooth my hair but I 'd pull away and swagger out , whistling loudly , and play with my dog .

		But at nights when I 'd gone tired to bed I 'd think about Mother .

		And always she appeared in a sort of soft light with a smile of understanding .

		To myself , I called her `` The Greatest Mother in the World . ''

		The other day I saw a Red Cross Poster a white clad nurse with a wounded , soldier in her arms ; they called it `` The Greatest Mother in the World . ''

		It brought a jealous little tug to my heart when I saw it .

		I resented the use of that title for a Red Cross Poster .

		It was my name for Mother .

		I closed my eyes for a moment and a vision of Mother came to me .

		The same soft light and tender smile .

		And when I looked up at the poster again I understood .

		I felt that the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	had the right to use that title , `` The Greatest Mother in the World . ''

		For I realized that the spirit of my Mother and yours was behind that big organization binding up cut fingers for little boys who have grown up and are n't really little boys any longer .

		And that 's the reason I 'm going to answer `` Present ! ''

THE MACMILLAN COMPANY Publishers	ORGANIZATION
NEW YORK	LOCATION	When writing to advertisers please mention THE DIAL .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Responsibility , Punishment , Reparation IN VERY MANY of his statements and addresses President
Wilson	PERSON	has insisted upon distinguishing between the responsibility of the German Govern - ment and the German people .

		He has said , for instance : We have no quarrel with the German people ... It was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war .

		It was not with their previous knowl - edge or approval ... The American people have suf - fered intolerable wrongs at the hands of the Imperial German Government , but they desire no reprisal upon the German people , who have themselves suffered all things in this war , which they did not choose .

		And in the negotiations which led to the armistice it will be remembered with what emphasis he in - sisted upon knowing whether it was with the old Government or with duly responsible spokesmen of the German people that he was dealing .

		One of his chief journalistic supporters the
New York World	LOCATION	said at the time : `` With the German people there can be a just and honorable peace .

		With German autocracy there can be no peace whatever . ''

		A day or two previously Mr.
Lansing	PERSON	had urged upon the American people the need of discriminating between the `` responsible and the irresponsible , be - tween the master and the serf . ''

		This distinction was an integral and very em - phasized part of the President 's policy .

		Yet we are all aware that so far as public opinion is concerned it has completely disappeared .

		The feeling against
Germany	LOCATION	has simply not been influenced either here or in
Europe	LOCATION	by the fact that she has converted herself into a republic .

		The conditions we are imposing upon her are not less severe than those forecast by the President in , say ,
January	DATE	last ; they are more severe , and they seem to be ` growing stiffer every day .

		What was the original justification of the Presi - dent 's distinction ?

		Why has it been repudiated by the whole Allied world ?

		What will be the effect of its repudiation ?

		As to why the distinction was made at all , we naturally , ask : Were not
Germany	LOCATION	's crimes com - mitted by individuals from among the German people ?

		Did not the German people tolerate and approve the evil policy of their Government ?

		If indeed the
Kaiser	PERSON	was the spokesman of the German people and on the whole represented them and there is every evidence to show that on the whole he did why should the `` just and honorable peace '' of the World 's phrase be more possible with them than with their agent and representative ?

		Even the fact that the people have turned against the
Hohenzollerns	PERSON	does not dispose of the considera - tion .

		For as one of the President 's critics suggests , probably quite correctly , the real reason why the German people turned against their masters was not from indignation at crimes committed but because those masters lost the war .

		Had the war lords brought victory they would today be as popular and as powerful as ever .

		It is the long and ever recurrent stories of atroci - ties which have swept this distinction away .

		And to the moral effect of the stories of German atrocity must be added another consideration .

		If indeed the German people are not responsible for the war , how can we throw upon them the burden of the immense indemnities which certain of the Allies are asking ?

		Yet do we seriously suggest that ravaged
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	shall not recover from
Germany	LOCATION	the means of restoring even the material destruction wrought by Germans ?

		It ; is the American sentiment of justice which has prompted the country to go against the President in this matter .

		But can we assume that these considerations had not occurred to the President when he first empha - sized this distinction between people and Govern - ment ?

		Can we suppose that he and those who stand with him had overlooked the fact that many of the horrors portrayed on the Liberty Loan posters have actually been committed by men of the German people and sanctioned by most of the others ?

		Or that he takes these things lightly ?

		Obviously that can not be so .

		It is likely , to say the least , that the President is not less sensitive to these things than the politicians , newspaper editors , and clergymen , who so clamorously demand se - verely punitive justice .

		Perhaps we shall never do justice to the President 's motive unless we face squarely a truth with reference to human conduct which we are very ill-disposed to face ; namely , that THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	some of the worst crimes against justice have been due to the very fierceness of our passion for right - eousness a passion so fierce that it becomes undis - criminating and unseeing .

		It was the passion for what men believed to be religious truth which gave us the Inquisition , the religious wars , five hundred years of tyranny ; it was the passion of patriotism which made
France	LOCATION	for so many years , to the aston - ishment of the world , refuse justice to
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	; it is a righteous loathing for Negro crime which has made lynching possible for half a century in the
United States	LOCATION	, and which prevents the development of an opinion that will really insist upon its suppres - sion .

		It is the `` just anger that makes men unjust . ''

		The righteous passion which insists that a criminal shall die for some foul crime is the very thing which prevents our seeing that the crime was not committed by him at all .

		It is something akin to the passion of the religious wars that possesses the world today .

		Just as a genuine religious conviction begged the whole ques - tion of the treatment of heretics in the centuries when hundreds of thousands of the very salt of the earth were racked , burned , tortured , and broken by good and disinterested men for the greater glory of God , so now is the question of justice and responsi - bility begged at the outset in the matter of the treatment of the German people , by the passion of patriotism .

		For five hundred years , more or less , it was simply impossible to get at the mind of the Inquisitor , or of those the great mass of the popu - lation who supported him .

		It was closed as in - stinctively as an eye closes when someone would remove a torturing cinder from it with his handker - chief .

		The action is not intentional ; it is instinctive and irresistible .

		`` Not punish a heretic !

		Wouldst thou intercede for those who would lead thy children to hell ?

		Wouldst thou send thy children to everlasting fire to save a foul atheist from a few hours of it ? ''

		asked the Churchmen of old .

		So now the question of responsibility in the treatment of the German people .

		`` Only a yellow dog would want to save the Hun from his richly merited deserts .

		Not until he is made to suffer will he ever learn not to attempt such crimes again ... Are the people who murdered little children , drowned help - less women , tortured prisoners worthy of any con - sideration whatsoever ?

		What sickly sentimentality would stand in the way of the stern justice which ... '' And in this passion , flaming and righteous , is burning up all the foundations of a better world order , all those great things for which our youth were sent to perish .

		There is perhaps no task more ungrateful , none which exposes a writer to such easily excited preju - dice , to such cheap jibe and mean innuendo , as to challenge in any degree the sort of passion I have described .

		But we saw this country turn gradually from
Wilson	PERSON	's policy because for months liberalism was silenced and the only voices heard were clamant cries of instinctive retaliation , violent-minded and undiscerning resentment .

		If the consequent drift of policy which marked the period of war is also , for the same reason , to mark the period of settlement , then the case of liberalism will go by default be - cause no one will dare challenge the lynching spirit sufficiently to state that case .

		The facts , if we would face them , are these : puni - tive settlement which insists upon treating the whole German people as criminals and upon excluding them from the
Society of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will not secure justice ; it will enable those most guilty to escape punishment , and will punish those who are not guilty ; it will not secure indemnification for the French and Belgian peoples ; it will not lift the burdens of the war from their shoulders but rivet those burdens more firmly than ever ; it will not heal the wounds of the innocent victims in
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	, but cause fresh wounds to be made ; and to the millions of innocent women and children who have suffered in those countries will be added other millions who will be made to suffer in like fashion .

		Let us take , just for a moment , at face value some of our professions .

		Millions of the best - of our youth have died in agony to uphold the eternal principles of justice .

		Let us note some of the least of its demands .

		We may with justice punish individuals who have committed crime ; and if it were feasible to take the officers who have ordered the murders of civilians , the men who have obeyed the order , the U-boat commanders who have ordered life-boats fired upon or passenger ships torpedoed , the very sailors who carried out such orders , give them fair trial in duly appointed courts , and when convicted hang them , the world would be better for the ex - perience .

		-LRB- As a matter of fact this is not proposed , an armistice clause virtually exonerating those who have acted under orders . -RRB-

		It may well be advisable , as the least of several evils , to compel a whole nation to make reparation and restitution for damage done by its armies .

		But deliberately to `` punish '' it , with the idea that in some way that will secure repent - ance or fear 6f consequences of like offenses in the future , is to ignore the plainest facts of national psychology as well as the accepted ethics of patri - otism by which our own political conduct is guided .

		To stand by our country `` right or wrong , '' to sub - mit our individual conscience to the national de -
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 585 cfsion , is the code of nationalism the world over .

		The English Bishops who protested against what they declared to be the immorality of reprisal air raids on German towns , did not renounce their government or their country when their protest was disregarded .

		The initial confusion in this matter arises from the fact that we take words and symbols for things .

		``
Germany	LOCATION	'' is guilty and must be punished .

		`` Ger - many '' includes millions of children babies , boys , girls , decrepit old men and old women .

		They had no responsibility .

		Are we , as part of our retributive justice , to decree that these babies shall die , that these girls and boys of five and six shall suffer cold , hunger , privation , restricted opportunity , as their part of the penalty of the `` stern '' justice upon which we pride ourselves ?

		Yet the punishment of `` Ger - many '' means nothing less .

		The Western world has always looked upon the Chinese practice of punishing a man for his brother 's or cousin 's offense as morally barbarous .

		But that is fairness itself compared with the punishment of the children for the father 's crime .

		A man may have some responsibility for the conduct of his descendants or his contemporaneous family .

		But how can the children be responsible for the father ?

		Yet it is for punishment so arranged that the moral rhetoricians now appeal .

		We ' calmly talk of in - demnities that we intend to spread over a hundred years of payment one
New York	LOCATION	daily asks for punishments that shall endure for two hundred years .

		What should we say of the justice which demanded that we be held responsible for the offenses o.f our great-grandparents ?

		-LRB- What should we say if
France	LOCATION	were now asked to pay for the damage done by
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's armies ? -RRB-

		But that is only one of many such facts that we refuse to face .

		What real share of responsibility for
Germany	LOCATION	's policy have the workmen and peasants who were the instruments of war , and who daily risked death and suffered agonies as well as inflicting them ?

		For years we have been pointing out that
Germany	LOCATION	was an autocracy ; it is part of the indict - ment against her .

		Again and again we have de - clared that the people were the mere tools of the Government ; that they were not free agents .

		More than that .

		Since the
Government	ORGANIZATION	had control of information , they saw to it that the people should , however mistakenly , believe themselves to be fight - ing for their menaced Fatherland .

		That this was the amazing , but none the less sincere , conviction of vast numbers is testified by all sorts of witnesses whom we can not accuse of pro-Germanism .

		Lord Northcliffe to take one of many says of the Ger - mans even as late as
October 1917	DATE	: `` The German people have been deluded into the belief that they are defending themselves against foes who are set upon crushing them out of existence . ''

		For what , then , after decreeing the punishment of the babies and the decrepit , should we be punish - ing the great mass of ignorant peasants , of half-in - structed workmen , fed upon lies and lashed into honest fury by those lies ?

		We should be punishing them for doing what they , however mistakenly , be - lieved to be their duty .

		Such conviction is generally a necessary part of prolonged war .

		Men do not as a rule die from selfish motives unless they are very sure of their mansions in the sky .

		The truth is that the whole idea of collective re - sponsibility , based upon the misleading personifica - tion of a whole nation , is itself the essence of injustice .

		Every large group has criminals .

		What percentage makes the whole group criminal ?

		Ten per cent ?

		One per cent ?

		A hundred thousand degenerate brutes among the officials , officers , and soldiers would more than suffice for the crimes that have condemned
Germany	LOCATION	.

		That is little more than one in a thousand .

		But if the proportion were fifty per cent we could not with justice punish one half for the crimes of the other .

		A German aviator who dropped bombs on Lon - don excused himself with the plea that `` the Eng - lish '' had killed his brother .

		`` The English '' may have done so .

		But the children he blew to pieces had not .

		And his evil plea is not made a righteous one when an innocent German from
Baden	LOCATION	is slain because a guilty one from
Hamburg	LOCATION	has killed and tortured .

		The
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	prints an inter - view - with an Allied aviator returned from a re - prisal bombing raid : `` How did you feel when dropping bombs on the Rhine cities ? ''

		asked the interviewer .

		The aviator replied `` with a quiet grimness '' : `` They killed my sister . ''

		Who are `` they '' ?

		The babies of the Rhine cities ?

		Suppose we assume that seventy million people men , women , and children are `` inherent crimi - nals . ''

		Two questions arise : What made people of the Germanic stock , living within certain geographi - cal areas , criminal , while the same stock in other countries in
Britain	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and Bel - gium represent great moral forces ?

		Second , does experience within our frontiers tend to show that `` punishment '' suffices in dealing with criminals ?

		Or does experience point the conclusion that we must also insure them a means of honest livelihood within our social system , give them equality of eco - nomic opportunity under the law so long as they obey the law ?

		Neither question is academic or idle ; 5 86 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	a wise answer to both is indispensable to the destruc - tion of Prussianism .

		Any sincere examination of the first of these two questions reveals a truth which is almost self-evi - dent ; namely , that the evils with which the Ger - mans have shocked the world are not the result of some biological difference from all other races , some differences of gray matter and muscular tissue which distinguish a man born between such and such lines of longitude and latitude from all other men , white , black , brown , or yellow .

		The evils are the result of certain false ideas born of a special political system and tradition , themselves the re - sult of certain conditions which we can do some - thing to change .

		The German horrors are evils analogous to those born in the past not only of political , but of religious , systems , as when nearly all races , in the name of God and righteousness , massacred and tortured not only men but women and little children pulled them limb from limb by ingenious machinery especially constructed for that purpose , or burned slowly their living bodies ; when learned and religious and well-intentioned men taught that falsehood on behalf of God was a duty ; that `` to keep faith with a heretic was to break faith with heaven . ''

		And , be it noted , to explain the crimes of the Inquisition , the massacres of
St. Bartholomew	LOCATION	, of the French Revolution , of the Commune or the
Congo	LOCATION	crimes of which peoples of all races have been guilty is not to condone or extenuate them .

		We need to understand them in order that they may not be renewed amongst us .

		And we need , as a guide in dealing with German crime , to ask how , far it is historically true that the mutual atrocities of Protestant and Catholic , Revolutionist and counter - revolutionist , white and Negro , were ended by vast indiscriminate , collective `` punishments '' or by an - other process .

		Let us examine a little further the incidence of punishment .

		Most of the punitive plans now cur - rent include large annexations of what is at present German territory the left bank of the Rhine ,
Schleswig-Holstein	LOCATION	, the whole of
Posen	PERSON	and
East Prussia	LOCATION	, and of course all the German colonies .

		A plan recently published in
Paris	LOCATION	demands the `` com - pensation '' of
Belgium	LOCATION	by a considerable increase of her territory .

		The idea seems about equivalent to saying to a householder whose house has been broken into by burglars : `` No matter .

		You shall be com - pensated .

		The burglar 's family shall come and live with you . ''

		Germany will lose the great bulk of her iron , some of her coal , all such raw materials as she got from her colonies , all her ships .

		She is to be the victim of a world-wide boycott and she is to be cast in unprecedented indemnities for the full restoration of all of the territories she has devas - tated .

		Note first who will and who will not be punished in this scheme .

		A large number of Germans , by virtue of these annexations , will cease to be Ger - mans and become French ,
Danes	LOCATION	, Poles , Russians , or '' Belgians .

		As such , they will be liberated both from the oppressions of German rule and from the punishments to be meted out to Germans .

		They will profit by the advantageous commercial arrange - ments which are to be accorded Allied populations , and will enjoy the privileges of the French , Belgian , Danish , Polish , or Russian systems .

		These Germans at least will largely escape `` punishment . ''

		In the Allied view they will have benefited .

		But Allied populations will have received an admixture of German elements .


Poland	LOCATION	, for instance , will be largely German ; its commerce and industry largely in German hands .

		We may boycott things `` Made in
Germany	LOCATION	'' ` but what we buy may still be made by Germans .

		And the greater the extent of the annexations the more will this be true .

		But the relation of `` punishment '' to restitution and compensation has still stranger results .

		The figure of total indemnity is now fixed at over
one hundred billions of dollars	MONEY	, the interest alone of which would amount to nearly five billions yearly about as much as the total export trade of
Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	combined .

		The total gold possessed by
Germany	LOCATION	could not pay the first six months ' interest .

		To pay even the interest , she must do so in materials , by an export trade immensely greater than that possessed by any country in the world , even by countries with nearly twice her pop - ulation and many times her resources .

		But we do n't intend that she should do any foreign trade at all !

		We intend to boycott her .

		Powerful American organizations are taking steps to see that not so much as a German penknife or a toy shall reach the hands of Americans .

		An Eng - lish seaman 's union declares that they will not work a .

		ship that has a pound of German goods of any kind aboard .

		And even if there were not the boy - cott , she will by the Allied annexations have lost most of her iron , some of her coal , and all of her ships ; she will be excluded from overseas raw material .


Russia	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	indeed half the world will be faced by semi-starvation , and will need these German indemnities which , when translated into realities , will mean the material things neces - sary to restoration , which
Germany	LOCATION	can make .

		We can not have it both ways .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	is to be
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 587 punished by the penalization of her industry , then it is the population of
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Serbia	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	that will share that punishment by the retardation of their reestablishment .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	is to help feed and rebuild those countries , if we are to profit by the labor of the German people to the full during the period of reconstruction and it will be direly needed then German industry must become once more active , and by that fact will become powerful and occupy a large place in the world ten or twenty or thirty years hence .

		And during this period , of course ,
Germany	LOCATION	is to be disarmed thus , incidentally , being able to de - vote all her energies to industry .

		But the neighbor - ing
Russia	LOCATION	, the Slav states of old
Austria	LOCATION	, the
Balkans	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	will presumably all be armed .

		We shall either be faced with a great Slavic Federation of some two hundred millions , or numerous inde - pendent Slavic states .

		Is it seriously urged looking back on the quite recent past and `` taking human nature as it is '' that neither of these contingen - cies holds possibility of conflict or armed collision about economic rights of ways , harbors , tariffs , pigs , minority cultures , religions , and languages ?

		Is any - one so extremely pacifist as to believe that for a single moment ?

		And in the midst of that possible welter will live this solid bloc of highly industrial - ized , highly disciplined Germanic folk unarmed , defenseless , discriminated against , their country hav - ing suffered in past centuries more miseries from the invasions of their neighbors French and Slavic than any country in
Europe	LOCATION	: A people whose country was for so many years a theatre of devastating wars that fear is bred into the very marrow of their souls , making them ready to submit their lives and fortunes to an autocracy which , for centuries , has ground their faces but which has promised them ... security , says Mr.
James W. Gerard	PERSON	, in My Four Years in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		And
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, in
Why America	LOCATION	Should Join the Allies , says : Fear of
National	ORGANIZATION	destruction will prompt men to do almost anything , and the proper remedy for outsiders to work for is the removal of the fear .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	were absolutely free from the danger of the least aggression on her eastern and western frontiers I believe that Ger - man public sentiment would refuse to sanction such acts as those against
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Does anyone really believe that they could be pre - vented from somehow arming , finding allies , and repeating once more the history of the years that followed Jena ?

		We refuse to admit her into the Society of Na - tions , refuse to accord her any protection ; she will find her own protection .

		And the process means the rehabilitation of her military order .

		Arms will once more become honorable .

		Their practice will be associated with the only defense of
Germany	LOCATION	that the world allows
Germany	LOCATION	's own strength or in - trigue .

		Far from punishing the military order , and discrediting its traditions , we shall revive them .

		The fact that we may indeed have to choose be - tween the luxury of fictitious `` punishment '' and the achievement of the higher things for which we went to war , has been pointed out by a writer who will certainly not be accused of pro-Germanism .

		Mr.
Frank Simonds	PERSON	recalls the fact that after a quarter of a century of devastating warfare over all
Europe	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, after the Napoleonic wars , was im - mediately admitted to the family of nations without `` punishment . ''

		That made it possible for
Europe	LOCATION	to reorganize itself according to the ideas of the day with
France	LOCATION	's cooperation instead of her op - position .

		Now it would be conceivable -LSB- adds Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	-RSB- that should the victors of the present war follow the example of those of a century before , remit to
Germany	LOCATION	their just claims for indemnities , content themselves with taking for
France Alsace-Lorraine	ORGANIZATION	and distributing German col - onies as they chose , they might successfully establish some orderly regime in
Germany	LOCATION	and , in negotiating with it , formulate a constitution for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	... If the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is the chief concern of the
Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	this would offer a way , and I think the only conceivable way , of bringing
Germany	LOCATION	into it .

		And unless
Germany	LOCATION	is brought into it , says Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	, there can be no
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	:
Unless Germany	LOCATION	is a willing and sincere partner in this enterprise the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will be a failure , for its success must rest upon its universality .

		With
Germany	LOCATION	out , it is no more than a perpetuation of the existing alli - ance against
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Moreover ,
Germany	LOCATION	may easily , if the Reds gain control , join hands with the Russian Reds , and then we shall have the old situation of rival alliances once more .

		But Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	will not hear of purchasing the League at that price .

		It would be `` inequitable and intolerable . ''

		If the condition , and the only condition , of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	be to make a peace with
Germany	LOCATION	which will make the victims of German aggression and violence in the past four years bear the eventual burdens of that aggression then it seems to me that the price is too high ... Even Utopia would be intolerable if in it only the red-handed murderer were to have immunity from the consequences of his recent crimes merely because he had changed his name or his employer .

		More than this , we hear much
today	DATE	of a `` healing peace , '' and cer - tainly every one hopes that we shall have this blessing .

		But even a healing peace must be designed first to heal the wounds of the innocent victims before it strives to cure the wounds of those who were injured seeking to murder their neighbors .

		And if any one is to bleed to death , to follow the figure of speech , it certainly should not be the women and children of
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		\ But Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	- confuses the alternatives as pre - sented by himself .

		He admits by implication that failure to establish the
League	ORGANIZATION	means future war : 588 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	the old system will give the old results .

		In those future wars , who will bleed and suffer ?

		The men and women and children of
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		No matter .

		Better that than that the criminal should escape .

		The wounds of the innocent vic - tims will not be healed .

		His proposal , not the pro- posal of the `` Utopians , '' will prevent that .

		In the terms of the dilemma he himself has stated ,
Belgium	LOCATION	will go on bleeding to death .

		She must refrain from binding up her wounds because the only means by which she can do it would enable the guilty to heal theirs .

		He admits that the price of punitive in - demnities will mean the exclusion of
Germany	LOCATION	from the
Society of Nations	ORGANIZATION	; that such exclusion will mean the failure of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, by which alone we can hope for reduction of armaments and the elimination or the lessening of the risks of war .

		But if we have to go on increasing our armaments we may well spend thereon all the indemnities that we can wring from
Germany	LOCATION	.

		She will pay them , but we shall not get them .

		What we get from our prisoner , or slave , we shall have to spend on guard - ing him .

		Nor is that all .

		The policing and holding down of
Germany	LOCATION	and German
Austria	LOCATION	for the purpose of securing the indemnities , a similar task perhaps with reference to
Russia	LOCATION	for preventing the penetration ` of German Socialist influence , will mean during twenty , thirty -LRB- or is it a hundred ? -RRB-

		years the imperialistic exploitation of German soil and peo - ples by foreign masters .

		It is seriously proposed to retain all the German prisoners now held by the Allies for the purpose of working them as slaves in the devastated districts .

		Presumably others will be deported from
Germany	LOCATION	for the purpose poetic retribution for what happened to Belgians .

		The slaves and their children may well deserve that slavery ; but it will none the less corrupt the masters .

		None the less shall we have gone back to medieval practice .

		The evil virus of imperialism will not be sterilized because the imperialism is also a just `` punishment . ''

		That is only likely to make it worse .

		And such a task will mean of course the militari - zation of
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	armaments , conscription , centralized and bureaucratic states , and finally , war .

		`` Servile revolts '' of the Russo-Ger - man world aided , it may be , by the Japanese , Chinese , and Indians perhaps we shall call them .

		But none the less war , as Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	pretty plainly implies , in which
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	will bleed once more .

		Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	will not promise them even the respite that the old men at
Vienna	LOCATION	gave to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The poilus will return to their homes and womenkind , rebuild their world ; children will be born to them and brought to manhood ; and then it will once more all go smash in wars that will be still more full of hate , of obscene and filthy cruelty .

		For these things are progressive , and in the next war neither side will leave to the other the advantage of surprise in sudden invasion , poison gas , or disease germs .

		And we shall rear our children for that foul destiny , not because it is inevitable but because we shall have chosen that course for fear that the enemy should escape sufficient punish - ment .

		If ever it were true that the opportunity of salva - tion for mankind is in the Christian ethic , as op - posed to the older one , that time is now .

		But the moratorium of the Sermon on the Mount is not yet expired ; and to invoke that code is the surest means of all of calling upon one 's head the maledictions of a Christian world and particularly the maledic - tions of the Christian churches , to say nothing of the Espionage Act penalties of a Christian state .

		We have made the discovery that we do not really believe these emasculate doctrines .

		We formally subscribe to them , as we do to things like `` liberty '' and `` free speech . ''

		But freedom of speech means freedom to speak the thing that pleases us : to refrain from punishment must only be asked when we do n't feel strongly about the crime .

		Lord
Grey	PERSON	, professional diplomat though he be , who saw more of the inner processes which led to this war than any other Anglo-Saxon living , points out in his wonderful pamphlet on the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	that from time to time an attempt is made to embody in material form the project of a better international order .

		It is then discovered that what appeared as an ideal to the wholly desirable and amiable can not be of practical use unless we are ready to subject ourselves to some limitations or discipline that may be inconvenient , and unless we are prepared to overcome some difficulties that were not at first sight apparent .

		The ideal is found to have in fact a stern and disagreeable as well as an easy and amiable side to it !

		Thereupon a storm beats against it ; those who never thought it desirable for there are intellects to which most ideals seem dangerous , an4 temperaments to which they are offensive and who had previously treated it only with contempt in the abstract , offer the fiercest op - position to it as a practical proposal : many of its sup - porters are paralysed by the difficult aspects of it , which they had not previously considered , and the project re - cedes again into the region of shadows or abstract resolu - tions .

		He goes on : There is more at stake in this war than the existence of individual States or Empires , or the fate of a Continent ; the whole of modern civilization is at stake , and whether
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 589 it will perish and be submerged , as has happened to previous civilizations of older types , or whether it will live and progress , depends upon whether the nations engaged in this war , and even those that are onlookers , learn the lessons that the experience of the war may teach them .

		It must be with nations as with individuals ; in the great trials of life they must become better or worse they can not stand still .

		They must learn and profit by experience and rise to greater heights , or else sink lower and drop eventually into the abyss .

		And this war is the greatest trial of which there is any record in history .

		If the war does not teach mankind new lessons that will so dominate the thought and feeling of those who survive it , and those who succeed the survivors , as to make new things possible , then the war will be the greatest catas - trophe as well as the most grievous trial and suffering of which mankind has any record .

		And only a profound change in the temper that now seems to dominate us can save the world from that catastrophe .


NORMAN ANGELL	PERSON	.

		A War - Song of the Far West LIGH IN THE Rocky Mountains the prism of the war , the focal point of our generation , has glinted from many a strange angle : with shafts of local color it has sent its searching rays into the obscure lives of those whom limitless miles of desert , canyon , and volcanic rock have separated from the rest of mankind .

		Men whose fathers left the East after the Civil War , and drifting westward through
Arkansas	LOCATION	and Indian Territory `` settled '' down to a roving life of horses , cattle , and intermittent min - ing in
New Mexico	LOCATION	and
Arizona	LOCATION	, were startled out of their vast solitude to find the youth of the country called overseas to join in the `` big fuss . ''

		The Spanish-speaking natives of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- they prefer to be known as `` the natives , '' for they say that `` Mexicans '' belong in
Old Mexico	LOCATION	, whereas these are the `` Children of the Conquerors '' -RRB- were still more dazed by the thunderbolt that had fallen from their , rainless sky .

		These people , whose venturesome ancestors , marching north from
Mexico	LOCATION	in the
sixteenth century	DATE	, braved deserts and Indians and planted the first white settlements in what is now the
United States	LOCATION	, these American-Mexicans of ours have been walled in by their gaunt cliffs and mountains for over three hundred years .

		Sud - denly the slow drone of their monotonous , sunlit lives was broken by a terrible and mysterious neces - sity that took every able-bodied man from the tiny villages and left the patient , sad-eyed , and already overburdened women to all the work of ranch and home .

		The whole
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	found itself abruptly seized by the collar and jerked out of its isolation ; what railroads and the telegraph had been trying for years to accomplish the war has achieved in a twelve-month it has linked the wilderness with the great world .

		At first the gatherings of Spanish wives and mothers at the troop-trains were full of somber tragedy .

		Silently the women wept behind the en - shrouding black tapalas , the deep-fringed shawls that cover them from head to foot like a symbol of that submission which is their lot ; and silently the drooping figures trailed home to their lonely little flat-roofed adobe houses , like drifting shadows in a cloud of yellow desert dust .

		It seemed as though the tapalas hung from the bowed heads with melan - choly heaviness , and here and there an old mother fell flat in the sand , overcome with the exhaustion of weeping and the sleepless nights of foreboding anguish .

		They understood so little , these poor women of the lonely mountain ranges ; they only knew that their men were `` taken '' taken to be killed by a terrible people of whom they had never heard before , a people whom all the world must punish , else they would come here and punish us and seize our little ranches .

		And the hot sun beat down on this doleful day as on all others ; and the mountains towered into the cloudless sky , aloof and unheeding ; and all the colorful
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	was still , and as vastly peaceful , as utterly remote from noise or stir of warfare , as though
New Mexico	LOCATION	were on some other planet a primeval world in an earlier geologic age .

		Yet into each primitive little home Fate had entered , sternly calling every family to a part in the greatest concerted human struggle that mankind has ever known .

		Of course an emotional Latin people must reflect this great new experience in song .

		And perhaps it is not altogether strange that the tune which is sung , hummed , or whistled in these war times by every man , woman , and child in
New Mexico	LOCATION	should have come originally from troublous
Old Mexico	LOCATION	to the south .

		It was when our own Span - ish troops returned home from the border after the recent difficulties that they brought with them the song of the
Carranzistas	LOCATION	,
Adelita	LOCATION	, which has spread through every village in the Spanish South - west .

		When at the
Bailes	PERSON	-LRB- the crude native dance - gatherings -RRB- the blind fiddler and the heavy-handed guitarist mount the rickety platform at the end of the hard-stamped dirt floor in the adobe Sala de 59 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	Baile , it is Adelita that is squeaked and thrummed for the enlivement of the thudding and scraping feet .

		When the boys went out , pitchfork on shoulder , to pile high the cut alfalfa and leave all the little ranch in readiness before the draft should take them , Adelita sounded from their sturdy throats or piped on their lips .

		And when on the eve of a Saint 's Day the slouch-hatted musicians in the sha - dow of some hollyhocked wall make their clumsy and discordant serenades to those who bear the name of the saint , it is again Adelita whose strains torture the moonlight to the delight of whispering groups for whom this is the best of all music .

		Whether or not the song was ever published in
Old Mexico	LOCATION	I do not know .

		Possibly my recording may be the only written version of the music in the
States	LOCATION	.

		But the verses have been variously tran - scribed in
New Mexico	LOCATION	, usually by some dark-eyed girl in the village to whose heart the love-sick words of the soldier 's farewell strike deep .

		For
Adelita	ORGANIZATION	is a typically Spanish popular song , impassioned , senti - mental , dramatic .

		It was brought north orally , and from mouth to mouth and hand to hand it has passed , a verse dropped here , another added there , each singer changing the words to suit himself , and now the whole made poignant to the hour by the allusion to the Kaiser .

		Adelita is the War-Song of Spanish
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The tune is what children call a `` sticker '' : once heard it sticks in the head and can not be extracted .

		Yet it is not the fatal tune alone that causes
Adelita	ORGANIZATION	's popularity ; the words have a deep appeal at this time , and though the melody is little more than a rhythmic dance-jingle , I have seen it be - cause of its association with the soldiers bring tears to many an eye .

		For these people , whose hemmed-in lives seem to an outsider both barren and joyless , have been giving their all in this war .

		They are poor , their only possessions being their strips of irrigated land , their tiny orchards , their sheep , goats , and burros , and perhaps the semi-arid pastures for their animals .

		The toil of the patient women is unceasing , and coin is scarce indeed .

		Yet in many a little window hangs a Food Administra - tion pledge and the sign of the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		Loyally , uncomplainingly the Spanish-Americans shouldered their share of the burden of the world war .

		Further - more , the boys marry before they are twenty ; and often it is a grandmother , mother , and young wife who weep at the sound of Adelita and the memory of the handkerchief that waved from the window of the troop-train .

		Since the verses of the song trail on endlessly , I shall translate only enough of them to give the Latin spirit , thoroughly Mexican in its flowery sentiment : `` Adelita '' is called the young maiden Whom I love and remember each hour ; In the great world I still hold a rosebud , And with time I shall gather the flower .

		When sounds the bugle of battle , The soldiers go forth without fear , And th '' arroyos will flow with the spilt blood ; For the Kaiser shall never rule here !

		And if I should die in the battle , And my body be buried afar ,
Adelita	LOCATION	, by God I implore you , Weep for me who am killed in the war .

		When as soldier my country now calls me , And I go off to fight and to die ,
Adelita	LOCATION	, O do not forget me , But pray for my soul with a sigh .

		I must leave you , my dearest Adela , grant me my parting request : That nothing may e'er come between us , Let your image be graved in my breast .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	calls me ,
Adela	LOCATION	, 1 must go , but though bitter the pain , I never shall part with the sweet hope Of returning to greet you again .

		This autumn the Spanish settlements seem astir with new life and courage .

		Adelita 's soldier is not killed : the first drafted boys have been gone long and they are not dead yet .

		Perhaps , after all , they will come back !

		Anyway they are well off in the `` campos . ''

		For Dios , what letters they send home , all so cheerful and full of the new things they are learning .

		Why , some of them can even send poems to the local Spanish papers .

		And how well the
Government	ORGANIZATION	feeds them , too .

		And as for the wives at home , what with the soldiers ' pay they now have more `` dineros '' than they ever had in all their lives before .

		No one spends it all on
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	in the nearest town , or drinks it all up in a day .

		How proudly the women now drive in their big carts to the bank on the Plaza , to deposit their money !

		Towards the end , the last good-byes of the drafted boys were preceded by a whole week of festivities .

		Bailes were held nearly every night , and the boys dashed from one settlement to another on horseback , the heroes of the hour , yelling like Indians .

		Adelita took on a gay sound as those who were driven down the mountains in the
Government	ORGANIZATION	automobiles sang it at the top of their lungs till cliff and canyon echoed to the `` sticky '' tune .

		Surely this coming in touch with the big world has been a great awaken - ing .

		The draft is one of the most powerful educa - tional forces that ever entered Spanish
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		NATALIE
CURTIS BURLIN	PERSON	.

		1918 THE DIAL 59 1 Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	and the American Revolution DRAWING of historic analogies is a perilous undertaking .

		On the score of specific incident and detail it would be difficult to establish the case for a comparison between the Russian and the American Revolutions ; the two manifestations apparently run in quite independent channels ; and it may seem strange that anyone should attempt to draw a paral - lel between
Russia	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in this regard when the French Revolution superficially offers the better analogy .

		But it is only superficially ; after all the specific objections have been freely admitted , after all detailed criticism has been allowed to triumph by default of the argument , there remains a certain divine sense in which the Russian Revolu - tion parallels the revolt of the thirteen
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	more nearly than the other , and in which the proletariat of
Russia	LOCATION	is striving to accomplish for his world much the same ideals which our fore - fathers laid down for theirs .

		There was more of the spirit of the people , more of faith and dependence in the proletariat , in American Revolutionary doctrine than we seem disposed to admit
today	DATE	; and by the same token , it is because we have lost our sense of fundamental democracy that we do not care to admit it .

		But we should think too highly of the outright American ideals to permit them without protest to be swallowed whole by the pseudo-democratic claims of a crass plutocracy .

		Totally different in form and substance , in method and event , in time , place , cir - cumstance , and era , these two revolutionary mani - festations nevertheless have shown the same spirit and have sprung from the same set of universal human impulses .

		To their respective centuries they have meant the same thing .

		In fact , has not the thought arrested liberals everywhere that in the Soviet system we see a fore - shadowing of the next step forward in the machinery of democratic government , bringing our present machinery , a heritage from a past era , abreast of the new industrialized world ?

		The writers of the American Constitution certainly strove to construct an instrument by virtue of which the actual majority of the electorate should control the government .

		They certainly strove to render impossible the domi - nation of a ruling class , to do away with the artificial complexities of politics , and to bring every function of government within the grasp and comprehension of the whole electorate .

		Indeed , they went much farther than this in theory , and by opening the high - est office to the lowest citizen they faced and acknowledged the truth that an experience in human mutuality may be a better equipment for the art of governing than education or a cosmopolitan training .

		In a day of simple industrial , social , and commercial elements , class lines and feelings as they now exist were not included in the category .

		But these have grown , up rapidly under the impetus of industrial - ism ; and along with them have grown , in new guise but in the same unmistakable form , many of the very political and governmental evils which the writers of the American Constitution strove so hard to avoid .

		Governments have become complex once more , legislatures have passed into the control of lawyers , the body of the electorate does not see and feels that it can not grasp what is going on , and a ruling class selected along financial attributes definitely dominates the political machinery of West - ern democracy .

		In a word , our system of repre - sentative government has demonstrated , to the class , at least , which feels the grievance , that under changed economic conditions it does not fairly repre - sent the popular will .

		Allowing for the great natural difference between the two periods , it is not stretching the point to say that the Soviet system in
Russia	LOCATION	proposes to do for the new era something very similar in its political objectives to that which the writers of the American Constitution proposed - to do for the old ; and that the true purpose of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	, irrespective of its transitory class dogma , is to simplify government again and to bring it under the control of the actual majority .

		And the great danger which besets us is that , in the confusion of issues and events , the true demo - cratic fundamentals of
Russia	LOCATION	may not be recognized in time by American and Allied statesmanship , and that the natural development of the Russian de - mocracy may be hopelessly compromised by inter - ference from abroad .

		This , in turn , would quickly undermine what democracy is left to us in the West , and might too easily bring about the cataclysm .

		The future of / civilization seems to hang between the devil of - selfish privilege and the deep sea of an inadequate statesmanship .

		From the beginning of the
Revolution Russia	LOCATION	has relentlessly precipitated for the democratic world the issue which could not be put aside .

		It is certain that
Russia	LOCATION	can not continue per - manently to be governed on a class basis .

		The logic of life and history precludes such an outcome .

		All the tendencies of human relationships stand un - alterably opposed to it .

		The outright class program of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	, which already shows distinct signs of becoming modified under the pressure of events and responsibilities , is bound to be still farther modi -
59 2	DATE	THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	fied , until it loses its strictly class character .

		The existing bourgeoisie may easily be disposed of , but there is no provision in the class program for the new bourgeoisie which inevitably will be developed out of the body of the proletariat .

		The various political parties of
Russia	LOCATION	, at present representing highly antagonistic class groups , must ultimately come together in some workable form of constitu - tional and parliamentary coalition .

		The furthering of this process should be the great task confronting American and Allied statesmanship today .

		Briefly , the political issue in
Russia	LOCATION	lies between two systems of governmental authority based on different principles of election and representation : the Soviet system , based on class units ; and the system of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, based on the old geographical units .

		The Soviet system breaks up the old geographical election district into class units , each one of which elects its own delegate to the local Soviet ; and the local Soviet , in turn , elects its dele - gates to the next higher body .

		This , roughly , is the central principle of an extensive governmental sys - tem the details of which do not properly come within the range of the present article .

		The basis of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, on the other hand , is the old geographical election district established under the Czar 's regime at the time of the first Duma .

		This also is the Zemstvo election district .

		The Soviet system made its appearance in
Russia	LOCATION	coincident with the first Revolution of the
spring of 1917	DATE	.

		It was the authority of the Soviet system , through its first manifestation in the
Council of Soldiers	ORGANIZATION	' and Workers ' Delegates in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, which brought about the downfall of the Pro- visional Government a few weeks after the Revolu - tion .

		Throughout the
summer of 1917	DATE	, under the
Coalition Government	ORGANIZATION	and during the Kerensky regime , the Soviet system was the real power in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		From the very beginning the forces repre - senting the Constituent Assembly have not been able to stand against the Soviet authority , although many counter-revolutions in the name of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	have been supported from abroad .

		All the events of the Revolution prove the case .

		The author - ity of the Soviet system has maintained itself in the face of the combined hostility of the world , and is stronger today than it was six months ago .

		The fact is that the Soviet system is a new ma - chinery of representative government , derived from the principle of class representation , and in the case of
Russia	LOCATION	taking its roots in the local machinery , of the ancient village Mir .

		It is a system simple and direct enough to be understood by the peasants and workingmen , and through it they are able without handicap to exercise their traditional training in local self-government and to apply it to the broader field of national politics .

		There is nothing un - democratic about the Soviet system ; its ideal seems to be to produce a government actually representa - tive of the proportional groupings of modern society .

		With the addition of the class feature , it is nothing but an extension of our own town-meeting principle .

		Let us have class caucuses in town-meeting , and we have the local Soviet .

		At any rate , this system is a natural product of social and political fundamentals in
Russia	LOCATION	, and as such plainly is indispensable to the development of the true Russian democracy .

		So the real issue , throughout the Revolution , has been between two antagonistic systems of representa - tive government rather than between various politi - cal parties .

		On the one hand were the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	and certain groups of the Mensheviki and Social Revolutionaries , who steadfastly supported the So - viet system .

		On the other hand were the Cadets and the reactionary fringe of the center parties , who supported the system of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		These latter have refused to cooperate in the Soviet system , and have insisted that democracy for
Russia	LOCATION	lies only in a return to the authority of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not difficult to see the reason for this : under the Soviet sys - tem they would be an insignificant minority , while under the system of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	they would stand a better chance of controlling the political situation .

		They accuse the Soviet authority of overthrowing the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, which of course was done ; but the Soviets could not have done it and maintained the position without the backing of a majority opinion .

		Two different principles of government could not establish their separate ma - chinery throughout the same area .

		In the clash of Revolutionary forces the Soviet principle won the day , and became established as the will of the Rus - sian people .

		The statement that the peasants are being held in political bondage by the Soviets does not seem to be borne out by the facts of the case .

		The Soviet system is founded on peasant funda - mentals , and satisfies peasant training and psychol - ogy .

		It can not be overlooked that the peasants have not yet attempted to overthrow the Soviet system , but that on the contrary they have everywhere sup - ported it ; and that nowhere in
Russia	LOCATION	since the first Revolution has there appeared a peasant movement for the reestablishment of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		The task for constructive statesmanship , therefore , obviously is to effect a reconciliation of all the Revo - lutionary parties of
Russia	LOCATION	based on the Soviet prin - ciple .

		It is now fairly demonstrable that to attempt a reconciliation based on the opposite principle is to invite ultimate failure .

		It is to attempt to sustain
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 593 the small minority against the vast majority , to set up in
Russia	LOCATION	a fictitious authority not supported by the Russian people .

		This has been tried in lending support to the various Counter-Revolutionary move - ments , and now it is being tried directly by the force of Allied and American arms .

		Such a fictitious government would needs be supported continuously by military power from abroad .

		Who will promise that such a policy will not destroy the very authority which institutes it , through the revolt of the pro- letariat everywhere ?

		Who will deny that such a policy makes utter mockery of the principle of self - determination , for which the democratic world os - tensibly has been fighting ?

		The second necessary office of American and Allied statesmanship should be to assist in bringing about cohesion within the Soviet system itself .

		This system has sprung up like a mushroom growth throughout the length and breadth of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is natural and substantial on the legislative side , but it unavoidably lacks administrative leadership and fed - eral cohesion .

		The executive branch suffers from sheer inadequacy of personnel .

		A legislative system based on sound fundamentals creates itself auto - matically out of the body and initiative of a self - governing people ; but a corresponding executive sys - tem , with its enormous problems of personnel and authority , has to be built up more slowly out of training , education , and experience .

		The very train - ing in local self-government throughout
Russia	LOCATION	which gives strength to the legislative function of the Soviet system militates at the start against its administrative cohesion ; the provincial Soviets in some cases refuse to abide by the decisions of the
All-Russian Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and in general the local So - viets , born of independence and intoxicated by a year of youthful authority , tend to go their own ways .

		The vastness of the country , the educational back - wardness of the people , the lack of transportation and communication , and the inevitable provincialism of the whole regime , all aggravate this failure in administrative cohesion .

		In addition , a great deal of the trained administrative talent of
Russia	LOCATION	, with vision blurred by the injustices of the Revolutionary manifestation , has chosen actively to conspire against the success of the true democratic principle .

		As a result of all this we see a movement ^ in
Russia	LOCATION	which superficially may look like a disagreement among the Soviets and a gradual breaking up of the system itself , but which in reality is only a natural stage in the very unequal and desperately difficult develop - ment of a Russian federation based on true demo - cratic fundamentals .

		Here again we discover that vague but neverthe - less sound analogy between the Russian and the American Revolutions .

		In both cases the general problem is one of federation .


Russia	LOCATION	, like
America	LOCATION	, has found her true legislative fundamentals but lacks administrative cohesion .


Russia	LOCATION	, like
America	LOCATION	, has her small body of Tories , whose property is be - ing confiscated , whose political principles are being outraged , and who are betraying her at every turn .

		In so far as it is possible to compare two widely separated social , political , and economic eras , the analogy holds .

		In
America	LOCATION	however the sole aim was political democracy ; for in that day the founda - tions of democracy had not yet shifted from legis - latures to banks and bourses , and there was no in - dustrial autocracy to fight .

		Today in
Russia	LOCATION	, in a world many generations removed from that of our forefathers on the score of economic progress , the aim is social and industrial democracy through po - litical democracy .

		The legislative fundamentals were of course more firmly established among the Thirteen Colonies than they are in
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	; the electorate may have been better trained in self - government , and the necessary administrative ma - chinery and personnel were unquestionably far more extensive ; but on the other hand , these very facts entailed a set of firmly grounded local antagonisms among the Colonies which is largely absent in the case of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	.

		What might be called the potential cohesion of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	is probably sounder and more substantial than was that of the
Thirteen Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, or in other words the danger of disruption is less .

		The potentialities in
America	LOCATION	in
1788	DATE	were exceedingly treacherous ; and Amer - ica 's federal cohesion was not finally established until the close of the Civil War in
1865	DATE	.

		And for a last item of the analogy , the case of
Russia	LOCATION	, like that of the Thirteen Colonies , demands the utmost wisdom of reconciliation and vision of brave and constructive leadership , and this not only in
Russia	LOCATION	, but quite as much on the part of the world abroad .

		When we turn from the political to the economic phase of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	, we see that they are the obverse and reverse of the same shield .

		However seriously
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	may have avowed the prin - ciples of Marxian Socialism , it is evident that the application of the program has not worked out along dogmatic lines , and that the final result will be far different from the original theory .

		As a matter of fact there seems to be much misunderstanding re - garding the Socialistic nature of the Bolshevik mani - festation , and room for grave doubt of its orthodoxy ; reports are infinitely confusing , and passion or prejudice almost unavoidably color the account .

		The impression generally accepted through the West is that the Soviets are instituting Marxian Socialism .

		But it has not yet been explained why formal Social - 594 - THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	ists everywhere , in
Russia	LOCATION	as well as in the Allied countries and
America	LOCATION	, are the bitterest enemies of Bolshevism .

		It has not been explained precisely what Bolshevism is .

		The fact seems to be that Bolshevism is something entirely new , something which partakes of the nature of both communism and democracy , of both Socialism and capitalism something which has split Socialism everywhere and caused the majority of Socialists to shift their ground , leaving only the dogmatic minority within the walls of the academic Marxian doctrine .

		The Bolsheviki in control of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	have awakened the thought of the world .

		All this is a healthy and hopeful sign .

		It means * that the social program of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	is as new and untried as its political machinery ; that both are ^ in a process of rapid development , seeking im - petuously to find their true bearings ; and that both inevitably are destined to grow out of themselves into more stable and adaptable forms .

		The thing which has appeared in
Russia	LOCATION	is a thing without theory or precedent .

		In a strictly literal sense it is a natural development .

		It is not to be estimated by physical events , or even by the acts or announced policies of the Soviet authority , but only by a free analysis of the tendencies and potentialities made manifest .

		What it is heading towards , what it must become , is of far more importance than what it is today .

		After a year of chaos , in which ideas of Socialism , communism , and anarchy have run riot along with sublime visions and great hopes in the minds of a people untutored , elemental , natively philosophic , and suffering from tragic wrongs a people nobly disposed at heart , and suddenly en - dowed with the tremendous burden of its own -LRB- and perhaps the world 's -RRB- destiny it is possible to dis - cern the vague but nevertheless certain outlines of a cosmic plan , standing solidly in the background of the Revolutionary picture .

		This plan is neither Socialistic nor communistic .

		It is neither a bourgeois plan nor a proletarian plan .

		It is the plan of a free and outright representative democracy , of the rule of the actual majority , of natural resources and all forms of national wealth and productive power in the hands of the people , of work for production rather than for profit , and of government for service rather than for privilege .

		This is the objective towards which
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	is heading .

		These are the real tendencies and po - tentialities of Bolshevism .

		In a modern economic sense
Russia	LOCATION	is a clean slate to write on .

		It is stated that less than three per cent of her population is made up of industrial workers .


Russia	LOCATION	is still almost wholly an agri - cultural state .

		Her vast natural resources lie prac - tically untouched ; the well of her stupendous productive power remains unopened .

		Only an insignificant proportion of her wealth is invested in the mechanical industries .

		But it is inevitable that in the course of the next fifty years
Russia	LOCATION	will be - come to a large degree industrialized .

		Millions and tens of millions of agricultural workers will become factory workers ; enormous new wealth will be created , and the most of it will be invested in the mechanical industries ; the color and texture of the whole social fabric of
Russia	LOCATION	will change .

		The prospect is overwhelming ; nowhere in history has such a field disclosed itself to an era so ready to seize and act upon it .

		The sweep of possibilities in
Russia	LOCATION	staggers the imagination .

		It stills the heart , as well , to realize that we of the Western democra - cies are permitted to assist at the birth of this new giant , and that all that we do , either right or wrong , for or against , shall surely affect the history of a great people , and shall as surely react upon the his - tory of our children 's children .

		What shall be written on the clean economic slate of
Russia	LOCATION	?

		What shall be the fortune of that portentous economic history which is even now be - ginning to unfold itself ?

		Shall it be permitted to develop naturally under the control of the Russian people , along with the development of
Russia	LOCATION	's free political institutions ?

		Shall we in
America	LOCATION	and in the Allied countries seek with all of our wisdom and experience to assist
Russia	LOCATION	to avoid the errors into which Western democracy has fallen in the course .

		of its industrial development ?

		Shall we rejoice in the opportunity to put into effect in Rus - sia , as stones in the foundation , those reforms for which Western democracy has had to pay such a heavy price in the demolition of the structure ?

		Or shall we , actuated only by selfish motives , inspired only by greed and materialism , aware only of the temporary profit and reckless of the eternal conse - quence , break up the natural development of
Russia	LOCATION	's economic and political destiny -LRB- the while we hypocritically explain that we are doing it for
Russia	LOCATION	's benefit -RRB- and insist on grafting all of our own errors and vices on the free Russian stem ?

		To be specific , shall
Russia	LOCATION	be left to develop her own natural resources and productive power , under the control of her own popular government , or shall she be forced to undergo for a time the familiar proc - ess of exploitation at the hands of foreign capital backed by foreign arms ?

		Shall her enormous po - tential wealth accrue to herself , to her people , to the benefit of
Russia	LOCATION	, or shall it accrue to banking circles in foreign capitals and to the close corporation of vested financial control ?

		The latter course would seem to be monstrous ;
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 595 and yet it is the course which so far frankly has been followed by Allied and American policy .

		It is the course which has prompted the bourgeoisie in
Russia	LOCATION	to revolt frantically against the Soviets ; it is the course which has led the Allies -LRB- in unconscious agreement with Imperial
Germany	LOCATION	-RRB- to support counter-revolution after counter-revolution in
Russia	LOCATION	; it is the course which has inspired a propaganda from
Russia	LOCATION	utterly misrepresenting events and issues ; it is the course which has called for military intervention , for recognition of a
Siberian Government	ORGANIZATION	, for any possible action cal - culated to break down the authority of the Soviet system .

		The motive in all these acts has been the spirit of exploitation , which , when driven into the corner , takes refuge in the claim that only through the machinery of the old economic order can
Russia	LOCATION	properly be saved .

		The West perhaps may have the power to break the new Russian democracy , although the breaker will be broken in the end .

		But the responsibility goes farther than the immediate issue .

		To break the new Russian democracy means , in no uncertain language , to lose the fight for the new world .

		It means that the great war which has just now ended will have to be fought over again quite soon and very terribly on a different field .

		For the fact can not be evaded that , stripped of misrepresentation and de - lusion ,
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	's objective is essentially the same as the avowed objective of
America	LOCATION	and the Allies ; or that the tendencies and potentialities of Bolshevism differ only in degree , but not in kind , from those inherent in all Western democracy .

		They represent the same broad fundamentals which find expression in the war aims of President
Wilson	PERSON	, in the reconstruction program of the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, in the program of the new
Independent Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, and in the language of thoughtful men everywhere when they discuss the growing inadequacies and palpable failures of our present governmental machinery .

		When we visual - ize industrial democracy for
America	LOCATION	, we visualize a state not so far different from the state fore - shadowed by the tendencies and potentialities of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	.

		Thus by the inexorable logic of human progress the truth in
Russia	LOCATION	is bound up with the truth throughout the West ; and if the West deny the truth in
Russia	LOCATION	, it will have denied the truth at home .

		And truth denied will launch the cataclysm .

		It rests with the statesmanship of
America	LOCATION	and the Allies whether our ostensible objective shall be - come our real objective , and shall be attained , or whether the compromise must be carried forward to disaster ; whether
Russia	LOCATION	's contribution to democracy shall be recognized and accepted , or whether it shall be spurned and scattered , to appear anon behind the lines of the entrenched and self-righteous authori - ties ; whether the West can learn its lesson in time , or whether civilization must go down in ruins be - fore the new world appears .

		LINCOLN COLCORD .

		Democracy , Watch Your Step !

		1 ERHAPS THE MOST striking feature of President
Wilson	PERSON	's psychology , as revealed by his proclama - tions , is an unerring sense of the popular will which he reflects in words of precise and clear-cut mean - ings .

		It is that which has made him the idol of the millions in
Europe	LOCATION	who in sweat , blood , and sorrow fought and won the war .

		In his speech of
January 22 , 1917	DATE	to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, the President declared for a free , united , and autonomous
Poland	LOCATION	and by that speech stirred the hearts and fired the imaginations and stimulated the lives of upward of twenty-six millions of Poles who for centuries have carried the yoke of foreign autocracy and repression .

		The armistice automatically created a free
Poland	LOCATION	and on
November 15	DATE	, at a meeting in
Poland	LOCATION	at which all of the many political parties were rep - resented , General
Joseph Pilsudski	PERSON	, released by the armistice from a German prison , was selected , tr > choose their Government and act as its first Presi - dent .

		That was self-determination , prompt , pure and simple ; it was Wilsonian democracy tri - umphant .

		But the most interesting feature of the situation to Americans was the contrast between the Polish policy of President
Wilson	PERSON	as he stated it to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and the manner in which it was antagonized within the knowledge of the highest
Administration	ORGANIZATION	political circles .

		I refer to the moral , if not defi - nitely official , support given by the
State	ORGANIZATION	and War Departments to a group of exiled Poles living in
Paris	LOCATION	, who had arrogated to themselves the func - tions of the Government of the new State of
Poland	LOCATION	which President
Wilson	PERSON	said the war must make free , united , and autonomous .

		The attitude of the Poles in
Poland	LOCATION	towards that
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	of exiles is shown by the official act of the convention 59 6 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	which chose
General Pilsudski	ORGANIZATION	and which at the same time unanimously denounced the
Paris	LOCATION	Com - mittee as having had no authority at any time to speak or act for the Polish people .

		The justice of that denunciation was recognized by every person who was familiar with the activities of the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and who be - lieves in democracy as opposed to autocracy .

		Briefly , the history of that
Committee	ORGANIZATION	is one of flagrant self - seeking carried out with all the cupidity of skilled unscrupulous politicians who exploited for their own ends the people , the distress of
Poland	LOCATION	, the frailties of stupid
American Administration	ORGANIZATION	officials , even President
Wilson	PERSON	's unmistakable , clearly stated principles for the self-determination of peoples .

		Who constituted and what were the records of that
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	?

		They were ten men whose activities prior to the war were chiefly in furthering the interests of the three monarchies who held
Poland	LOCATION	in their autocratic and persecuting power .

		These men had by intrigue with the reactionaries in
Europe	LOCATION	obtained a semi-official recognition by the French and British Governments ; and it was that recognition which gave them a standing in the
American State	ORGANIZATION	and War Departments which no amount of information offered by disinterested per - sons could dislodge .

		It was that quasi-official recog - nition which makes a dark chapter in the record of
America	LOCATION	's war activities .

		The State and War De - partments shied at this question put to them with all the backing of documentary evidence : `` In view of a war waged in behalf of democracy and the freedom of oppressed nationalities , why should a group which is monarchial , representative of con - servative economic interests , and largely anti- Semitic , occupy such an important semi-official political status ? ''

		The member of the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	officially delegated to
America	LOCATION	was Mr.
Paderewski	PERSON	, the great pianist .

		His social prominence and his rep - resentation of the idealistic spirit of the Poles in
America	LOCATION	made him an admirable leader for the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	's purposes ; it , enabled him to charm ignorant `` society people '' into endorsing his activ - ities and to deceive the immigrants concerning the real purposes of his schemes .

		As a politician his ability commanded respect by reason of the organiza - tion , ostensibly for Polish relief and for a free
Poland	LOCATION	, which he rapidly effected .

		His first alli - ance was with the
Polish Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	and especially with that branch of the Polish clergy which openly opposes Americanization among the immigrants .

		Another stone in the foundation of the organization was Mr.
Smulski	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, a politician of the machine type , a man who had been
State Treasurer of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, and a banker of con - siderable prominence .

		This combination of great human and social forces idealism ,
Church	ORGANIZATION	, machine politics reenforced by a central business organiza - tion , publicity bureau , lobbyists , press agents , and the gullibility of high
Administration	ORGANIZATION	officials , made of the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	a potent influence among the four millions of Poles in
America	LOCATION	.

		Indeed so powerful was the combination that the
Paris	LOCATION	Com - mittee with no authority except that of their own egotistic ambitions were able to do several very un - democratic , yea blatantly autocratic , things : First , they extracted from the four millions of Poles and many trusting Americans vast sums of money , sup - posedly for Polish relief .

		One donation of a thou - sand dollars for the relief of war victims in
Poland	LOCATION	was transferred to the fund for the
Polish Army	ORGANIZATION	, the organization and maintenance of which was part of their shrewd political program .

		Their in - fluence at
Washington	LOCATION	was such that , by an official order of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	, all money donated in
America	LOCATION	for the relief of war victims in
Poland	LOCATION	could be sent to
Poland	LOCATION	only through Mr.
Pade	PERSON	- rewski .

		Of course that order prevented those peo - ple to whom the nature of the activities of the
Paderewski	ORGANIZATION	faction were known from sending money to the starving and naked people in devastated
Poland	LOCATION	.

		For instance , the official representative in
America	LOCATION	of the
Women 's League	ORGANIZATION	in
Poland	LOCATION	had
$ 17,000	MONEY	in cash ready to send to the war victims , but was told by the War Department that only Mr.
Paderewski	PERSON	could handle the money ; the money was not sent until Mr.
Paderewski	PERSON	was shorn of power by the repudiation of the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	by the free Poles in
Poland	LOCATION	.

		There were no tricks of the political trade that this faction did not practice with skill and ingenuity `` in attempts to gain their ends .

		For example , the newspapers of
July 18	DATE	announced a bill to be intro - duced into the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	by Senator
Hitchcock	PERSON	which proposed to bind the
United States	LOCATION	to recognize the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	as the only official representatives of the new State of
Poland	LOCATION	, and to give it the power to determine what Poles in
America	LOCATION	were to be classed as `` enemy aliens '' which was rather a nice , coercive measure for the liberal Poles in
America	LOCATION	, who recognized the true status of the
Paderewski	PERSON	faction and stated their opinions in the independent Polish press .

		Senator
Hitchcock	PERSON	ignored a letter written to him at that time calling attention to the fact that a scientific study of Polish conditions in
America	LOCATION	was being made and that the organization and its data were at his disposal .

		The same Senator also refrained
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 597 from answering the following telegram sent on
November 25	DATE	by the author of the above mentioned letter : The first act of the free Poles in
Poland	LOCATION	was to choose their own ruler in the person of
General Pilsudski	ORGANIZATION	.

		That act is a sad commentary upon your proposed
Senate	ORGANIZATION	bill to bind
America	LOCATION	to recognize the autocratic Polish fac - tion that consistently maligned and persecuted
Pilsudski	PERSON	here and in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The lesson to you as chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee	ORGANIZATION	should be to conduct a scientific study of the problems involved in the subject nations , and thus avoid again embarrassing President
Wilson	PERSON	's policy for the self-determination of all peoples .

		See Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's report to the
Government	ORGANIZATION	for information as to methods of procedure .

		This is an open telegram and a challenge to debate the democratic and educational principles embodied .

		.

		Perhaps the finest bit of political trickery which this
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	executed was that which Pro- fessor Dewey exposed in The New Republic of
August 24 , 1918	DATE	under the title Autocracy Under Cover .

		Briefly , it was the announcement of a con - vention , to be held in
Detroit	LOCATION	beginning
August 26	DATE	, that would represent , speak and act for , the four billions of Poles in
America	LOCATION	.

		In fact the Conven - tion represented the Paderewski faction exclusively -LRB- an extremely small minority -RRB- , was `` packed '' by prime machine methods ; not a delegate had the right of free speech , and no liberals could possibly gain access to it .

		The packing of the Convention was done chiefly through the obliging offices of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The real objects of the Convention it would be libelous to state publicly , but the Govern - ment was informed of one .

		of them in time to check a resolution that would have been a serious affront to the
Government	ORGANIZATION	's policies .

		At the convention two native American liberals were denounced as `` pro-German '' because of their known association with a sociological investigation which had been the means of placing in the hands of the War and
State Departments	ORGANIZATION	much data concerning the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	and its activities in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	of which they challenged refutation .

		That denun - ciation was expected because the `` pro-German '' atti - tude was the single red herring in their intellectual basket , and they applied it indiscriminately and as a matter of routine to every person who thought in terms other than theirs .

		And , as usual too , the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	promptly investigated the charges , but no arrests or warnings followed ; the investigations and the expenses to the public were the Governmental evils sufficient unto the days thereof .

		A minor irony of the situation was the fact that one of these Americans investigated by the Depart - ment of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	had furnished the total financial support to the private laboratory in which was originated the gas mask worn at that time by the American soldiers at the French front .

		The
War Department	ORGANIZATION	had written him a letter of apprecia - tion , but they and the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	were evidently not on speaking terms in reference to the war .

		The
Paderewski	PERSON	faction was apparently persona grata in the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	until the acts of the great Polish patriot ,
General Pilsudski	ORGANIZATION	, and the great , free Polish people in reference to their own
Government	ORGANIZATION	gave the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	food for serious thought .

		It settled the Polish ques - tion and all such minor futilities as the
Detroit	LOCATION	Convention ,
Senator Hitchcock	PERSON	, Mr.
Paderewski	PERSON	, the political machine , and so forth , in that particular connection .

		The stars in their courses will not be balked .

		The
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	was asphyxiated and in - terred by the inexorable logic of the irrepressible spirit 1 of man who will , and must , be free .

		But the Polish situation was merely a replica in minia - ture of the world problem that President
Wilson	PERSON	will face at the peace table .

		The disembodied spirit of the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	will be there in its protean , multi-national forms .

		The countless millions of the exploited hope , with the pent-up repressions of the ages , symbolized by the Poles , that the President meant what he said and that he has the courage and the greatness of character to tell the exploiters that their sun has set .

		These millions will forget his apparent defections regarding the Russian in - tervention , open diplomacy , the labor delegation , as the expedients of losing the small stakes to get an opportunity at the big one the freedom for all man - kind that will be lost or won for them by him .

		It is to be hoped that he will have the greatness of soul to carry out the intimation made in his speech at the opening of the Fourth Liberty Loan cam - paign , that if he does not win the reactionaries will lose , and lose violently , by his appeal over the heads of the rulers to the peoples themselves .

		If Democ - racy 's step be sure and firm , the victory will be speedy and complete and probably with the smooth - ness and precision that made
Poland	LOCATION	a free people with no resulting harm except to the autocrats .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	would return with the power and probably the determination to begin democracy at home .

		The Lodges and the Roosevelts would dis - appear by means of the same mechanism that smoth - ered the
Paris Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and the Hitchcocks would be compelled to get the preliminary education that would avoid the ignominy of having official
America	LOCATION	preach democracy at the head and practice autocracy at the extremities .

ALBERT C. BARNES	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	Letters to Unknown Women : Heliodora To HELIODORA : Heliodora !

		Heliodora !

		Though the poet who sang you is counted neither among the great poets nor among the great lovers , your beautiful name echoes insistently in our ears ; and though you are but a legend to us , tenuous as some faint perfume , we can not forget you , Heliodora !

		Heliodora !

		Gift of the sun god , we liken you in our fancy to a golden flower , to a stem of wheat , to a cluster of grapes .

		We can not know whether you lived at
Gadara	LOCATION	, at Cos , or at
Alexandria	LOCATION	; but this we know that you were beloved by a poet whose words still move us in these later years .

		And since when we think of
Meleager	ORGANIZATION	's mistress it is always your name we speak , perhaps you will forgive him for having loved Timarion and Senophile and Demo and
Tryphera	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is too much to ask you to forgive them .

		Be consoled ; while Meleager is remembered ,
Heliodora	ORGANIZATION	will not be forgotten .

		Perhaps you have forgotten what love is , wander - ing in those cold fields of
Persephone	LOCATION	, where there are none of the blossoms of
Enna	LOCATION	.

		Listen then to the voice of your lover singing at the feast with the rose-wreath in his hair : `` Pour the wine and say ` Heliodora ' '' he speaks your name `` again and yet again say ` Heliodora ' ; mingle with the wine that most sweet sound .

		`` Give me the flower-crown of yesterday , wet with perfume , in memory of her .

		`` Look !

		The amorous rose weeps to see her other - where and not upon my breast . ''

		Were you cruel , were you faithless , Heliodora ?

		The world will not easily forgive you for stabbing the poet 's heart .

		If you were not faithless why does he cry out : `` O Night , oh my sleepless yearning for
Helio	PERSON	- dora , oh the tearful chafings of tortured dawns does any trace of my love remain , any remembered kiss warm her cold image ? ''

		Were you cold to our poet ,
Heliodora	LOCATION	?

		For a moment he plays with the thought that though you were far away you `` clasped to your breast and kissed a heart-deluding image . ''

		But if you were not faithless ,
Heliodora	LOCATION	, why does he cry out : `` Has she a new love , a new plaything ? ''

		Heliodora , you were as unfaithful to our poet as he was to you .

		The gods are just .

		But we can forgive you much , for although you were a hetaira or perhaps because of that you loved flowers and you sang gracefully , and you were beloved by Meleager so that he cried out that love was as a fire burning him , that love had molded your image in his heart , that love was sweet yet hard to bear , yet bitter to the heart .

		You were a flower among women , so that when the rose-crown withered on your brow in the hot air of the banquet room , Meleager could exclaim that you still shone the flower of flowers .

		He sends you white violet and narcissus with myrtle , lilies and soft crocus and dark blue hyacinths and the lover 's rose `` so that the garland about the temples of myrrh - tressed Heliodora may strew flowers on her bright loose hair . ''

		Your loves were graceful and simple ,
Heliodora	LOCATION	, altogether too graceful and too simple for the taste of today .

		You do not illustrate some great problem ; you are not reformed and you are not punished .

		You will not please our moralists .

		You and your lover are so frank , so pleasant in your sensuousness , so innocent of a sense of sin , that you will not please our sensualists .

		And because you are long dead and not talked about in public gatherings you will not please the folk who are midway between sensu - alist and moralist but partake a little of each .

		But yours is a more glorious fate ; you are the beloved of poets .

		If you were gay and not troubled overmuch about the things of life and the things that might come after death , I hold you to have been happy .

		Per - haps , in spite of the sweet singing which so stirred the passionate heart of Meleager , you were more nearly interested in your perfumes and spices , in your garments of frail linen , in your polished mirrors and chased boxes and little painted bottles , in your gold chains and jewels and the garland for your hair .

		At the very same time that you lived , a great philosopher , who was born not far from your lover 's birthplace , refused to condemn a hetaira accused be - fore him , and his example is so illustrious that we dare not go against it .

		And then , too , you died young : `` Tears to thee under the earth , bitter tears I shed for thee ,
Heliodora	LOCATION	, in
Orcus	LOCATION	; I weep above your grave , that buries my desires , my gaiety .

		`` Bitterly , bitterly yet does Meleager mourn his beloved among the dead , in empty Acheron .

		`` Alas , alas , where is my beloved young olive - branch ?

		Death has taken her dust stains the lovely flower .

		`` O Earth , O mother of all , my mother , softly , softly clasp her to your breast . ''

		RICHARD
ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		1918 THE DIAL 599 On the Seashore of Endless Worlds HREE THOUSAND five hundred of the
Business Leaders of America	ORGANIZATION	came to
Atlantic City	LOCATION	on De - cember 3 to reconstruct
American Business	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each , of course , was the Typical Big Modern American Business Man .

		That is , he was `` forceful and aggressive , '' `` broad-gage and public-spirited , '' `` for - ward-looking and virile , '' and so on .

		Together they constituted the War Emergency and Recon - struction Conference of the
United States Cham	LOCATION	- ber of
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was , frankly , a serious occasion .

		They had endured the humiliation of traveling on Govern - ment-operated railroads , and the fatigue of parlor - car journeys from all parts of the country , with no light purpose .

		They stood , frankly , at the threshold of a New Era .

		The time had come for American ' Business to make its position unequivocally clear .

		No mere equivocal clearness would do .


American Labor	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Farmer	ORGANIZATION	had long spoken with voices of authority .

		Beside them the conflict - ing tongues of miscellaneous groups of
American Business	ORGANIZATION	had made timid and unimpressive appeal .

		Now it was necessary for every forward-looking American Business Man to put shoulder to the wheel and see to it that American Business got not only a fair deal , but that the public learned what you know and we know that instead of being its enemy , Business is its friend ... Unfortunate that the public attention just then happened to be distracted by the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		Unfortunate that the President could not have postponed it long enough to hear the
Voice of American Business	ORGANIZATION	on the questions which , as a mere statesman , he would so inadequately handle , or failing that that
American Business	ORGANIZATION	could not have gone along with him .

		He had declined how - ever , and it was said that he had taken a mass of carefully compiled statistics with him instead .

		As if the counsel of statistics could adequately rep - resent American Business !

		Under these circumstances however ,
American Business	ORGANIZATION	had only one thing to do and that was to show precisely where it stood , to make its position frankly and unequivocally clear .

		It had a right to , too .

		A year before
American Business	ORGANIZATION	had `` gathered its forces in this city by the sea to pledge its every resource to bring the war to a successful conclusion , '' and by heck , it had done so .

		Today the same forces `` met to study the prob - lems involved in Reconstruction , and to offer to the
Government	ORGANIZATION	their best counsel in accomplishing the necessary readjustments . ''

		And so , cigar-cases well filled , they paced the board walk with the well-known forceful , aggressive stride and the broad-gage , virile jaw of the public - spirited , forward-looking American Business Man .

		That board walk suited their mood so exactly .

		Smooth , inviting , endless , the even tenor of its way was so reminiscent of the quiet wheel-chair days of
American Business	ORGANIZATION	before
1914	DATE	, when we could go on and on as long as we were pushed , in - vigorated by the free winds of Business Initiative .

		The sea ?

		Yes , was n't it beautiful ?

		The victorious You-Be-Damned of their present mood was lost on the unproletarian board walk , but the rest of us waited for the dawn of
December 4	DATE	to come up like thunder and the
Voice of American Business	ORGANIZATION	to unequivocally drown out the sea .

		Once their thirty-five hundred cigars were lit on
Young 's Million-Dollar Pier	ORGANIZATION	and the windows closed and the Lord 's Prayer said , the reconstruction thoughts for which the world was waiting would drop smoothly from the virile , efficient machinery of American Business like shiny safety pins ready for the swaddling clothes of Public Opinion .

		Before that , however , the machinery was to be well oiled and tried out in the preliminary meetings of the 350 or so War Service Committees .

		These committees , representing every industry from baby - carriage manufacturers to casket makers , had given their all-plus to put American Business in high speed for the war .

		Now , of course , they would help shift gears to the peace pace .

		Did we therefore wish to know whether the War Industries Board should be abolished , whether price-fixing should continue , whether coal administration should be maintained , and what should be done with the rail - roads , the tariff , labor , and a few things like that ?

		These things would be settled by those who were conversant with the ways of business , not by theorists or official meddlers .

		Each committee would bring in its resolutions on these questions , and these multi - tudinous vibrations of virile
American Industry	ORGANIZATION	would be sifted down and transmitted to an im - perishable record whence would issue unequivocally and as clearly as possible , considering the cigar smoke , the
Voice of American Business	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the first day American Business was so for - ward-looking that it did not notice the Sea .

		The Sea was there , of course , but after all it was just water .

		American Business said with virile emphasis it desired `` to be left alone to work out its salva - tion . ''

		Auto makers came out for a `` Free Rein 6oo THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	for Industry in After-War .

		Affairs . ''

		The Auto Industry was `` in a position to take care of itself , if left alone by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		All the others , too .

		Furthermore , the
Clayton	PERSON	Act was an `` abortion '' ; `` the Webb Bill should be extended to include not only foreign selling but foreign buying , '' and inci - dentally domestic business of all kinds as well .

		Wages were `` everywhere showing a Bolsheviki spirit '' ; but let it be understood unequivocally that there was `` to be no Labor domination of
American Industry	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		On the second day several attempts were made to lead them from the board walk to a slightly higher place and direct their attention for a few moments to the Sea .


Harry A. Wheeler	PERSON	, `` Charlie ''
Schwab	PERSON	, and Secretary
Redfield	PERSON	, and others who had been `` endeavoring to guide the industrial inter - est of the country toward its true , high level '' endeavored some more .

		In the best of taste Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	spoke of `` swords and plowshares '' and `` pruning-hooks and spears '' and the `` hum of peaceful husbandry '' and the `` curse of war . ''

		Peace stood `` on the threshold of a new day , bidding us lift the curtain upon a world from which the menace of
Military Autocracy	ORGANIZATION	has been forever removed . ''

		`` Should we enter in to possess this new world with the boastful arrogance of the foolish victor drunk with power , or with the patient humility of a chastened people intent upon building a new civilization ? ''

		It was a grave question , but he went further .

		He said the dangers of the state upon which the world was entering were scarcely less than those we had just escaped .

		`` The overthrow of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean Governments , inviting experiments with un - sound principles of government and all kinds of emo - tional legislation , is likely to set us apart as the most conservative power on earth , '' and `` we must hold the lamp of our experience to guide the feet of those who are groping through new and untried paths . ''

		Here was a glimpse of the Sea , and uncertain applause .

		In view of this perilous wetness , was it not the more necessary that American Business be consulted in framing the peace conditions ?

		The opportunity was open to the
United States	LOCATION	in that way to suggest a new and enlightened diplomacy free from the devious intrigues of mere statesmen .

		Likewise , perhaps , after all , should not the
United States	LOCATION	lead in proposing `` an International plan for rationing basic materials , with the aid and counsel of those expert in handling these commodities '' ?

		Failure to do so would `` seriously impede the indus - trial restoration of nations '' with large indemnities to pay ; and `` any economic boycott , advanced as a punishment of those nations , '' would only tend `` to drive the nations further apart and increase the un - rest in the industrial world . ''

		Might not the
United States	LOCATION	lead here in `` a declaration of principles providing for such adjust - ments as will ultimately assure a Live and Let Live policy for the whole world '' ?

		American Business might `` hold these suggestions as more idealistic than practical , but we are facing many vital changes in the controlling power of the political and economic machinery of the world , power which if unrestrained will bring much grief before it settles down to a sober and intelligent recognition of its ability to impose harm as well as good . ''

		The Sea , gentlemen , is sometimes wet and cold .

		Would it not be best to hang our clothes on a hickory limb , while there are any hickory limbs left ?

		This was dismal , but then `` Charlie '' came like the sun from behind a cloud and they returned to the
Beautiful Board Walk	ORGANIZATION	and cheered up .

		, He saw before him `` the energetic countenance of the Amer - ican Business Man that made this nation of ours what it is , '' and `` whose efforts and accomplishments , my boys , were unparalleled in the history of any nation . ''

		We were finished with this great and vic - torious war .

		We were to be congratulated , we American Business Men , upon the part we had played in this war and for the position in which we had placed this great and glorious country of ours .

		There were problems before us , to be sure , but he was an optimist , and had never lost confidence in the American Business Man , and in the American Workman who was the backbone of this great nation of ours .

		Matters would adjust themselves indus - trially sooner or later by the natural course of events , but what we want to prevent is that sudden slip of the cog which will give us a social jolt that may be dangerous to our industries for years to come .

		We must be patient .

		We must go along with small or no profits if necessary .

		We must bend every effort to keep our employees busy , employed , and satisfied .

		This was a day of democracy in which we were standing shoulder to shoulder for the protection and glorification of this great and glorious country of ours .

		We might expect troubles and difficulties , but we must plunge ahead with the confidence that the business interests of the
United States	LOCATION	were going onward and upward in spite of any condition that might arise in this great country of ours .

		-LSB- Applause -RSB- `` The American workman can stand with his head in the air as you and I and say ' I am an American citizen . '

		What prouder thing is there for any man to say ?

		What greater nation on the face
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 601 of the earth , what nation that God has endowed with more natural resources than this great nation of ours ?

		Above all he has endowed it with a people so filled with energy and patriotic enthusi - asms as to place it for all time to come at the head of all the nations of the world . ''

		-LSB- Applause -RSB- And he would add just one word more .

		`` We Americans might be great manufacturers and all that , but we must pay the same tribute of respect to our wives that this great nation of ours has paid to the women of the
United States	LOCATION	in this great crisis .

		Why should we not expect this of American mothers and American wives , the true women of a true nation , the true wife of a true American and the true mother of a true American son ? ''

		-LSB- Ap - plause -RSB- Thus , expansively , good-naturedly ,
Charlie	PERSON	patted them all on the back and waved his hands once or twice toward the Sea , but it was such a calm Sea , sparkling so cheerfully in the sunshine .

		Secretary
Redfield	PERSON	, however , boldly herded them off the Sweet Old Board Walk altogether and in - vited them to try the water with their large toes to convince themselves that it was wet .

		If it were per - mitted him to urge a few words of practical advice to
American Industry	ORGANIZATION	he would say : `` Beware of the temptation hastily to lay rash hands upon wages .

		Concentrate thought and effort on output .

		We need , of course , a large and expanding export trade , but the mere entering of foreign markets by cut prices or off-quality goods or by dumping or un - truthful advertising or by force of Government aid or political power is in no true sense commerce , nor can it last . ''

		And splashing them vigorously and rudely , he said : `` Do we think of our sister nations as twenty years ago a trust magnate thought of the concerns whose business he would like to grasp ?

		... Will our thought be to aid , with a spirit of service running through all , serving those who served us first ?

		... Shall it be the Amer - ican Eagle that flies high or the American Hog that roots low ? ''

		And so by the second day they began to admit the Sea was there , cold and wet , and troubled by strange tides , and on the third day they stood with Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	on the shore and eagerly watched him demonstrate how the pacifying petroleum of Representation in Industry would calm the waves and abolish the tides and usher in a New Era of Brotherhood .

		And when
American Business	ORGANIZATION	went back to its committee resolutions that evening the sea air was in its nostrils and sea sounds in its ears and its head was strangely giddy .

		I heard one group of forceful aggressive American Business Men offer a resolution `` favoring legislation to permit combina - tion to standardize products , eliminate waste , and for any other purposes that might be considered necessary '' and loudly laugh it down .

		Another quite simply turned a resolution against the contin - uation of price-fixing on iron an 'd steel into one for the continuation of price-fixing on iron and steel .

		And a group of coal men decided first for the abandonment of the fuel administration control , and then begged it to stay .

		The next morning , after a short , desperate , and virile promenade on the board walk of beautiful old
' 14	DATE	,
American Business	ORGANIZATION	got out its little shovels and pails and played in the sand .

		And when it went home it took some large sea shells with it .

		6O2 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	Primitive Reconstruction IT is A PITY that
Arnold Wright	PERSON	's Early English Adventurers in the
East	LOCATION	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 4	MONEY	-RRB- is not illus - trated illustrated with original woodcuts , clumsily scratched into the blocks while the guiding thumb of the old sea-rover indicated where they stood when they threatened to set fire to the English ship , and where he stood when he fired the gun that sent the canoe and its occupants into the Kingdom of the
Heavenly Papua	ORGANIZATION	.

		These old pictures , besides their charm , have a grert advantage .

		They show the al - most ludicrous risks the earliest adventurers ran in the tortuous narrows of those ill-charted Indian seas .

		A cheerful task awaited the first men to round the
Cape of Good Hope	LOCATION	.

		Not only were they to find riches unlimited spices and gold and flowery silks they also served their country and their Queen when they drowned another Portuguese crew or forced another Spanish governor to work in the bagnio .

		It is a fact , oft forgotten but nevertheless true , that the pioneer work in the Indies was not done by the present occupants of the British and Dutch colonies .

		When the adventurers from Lon - don and
Amsterdam	LOCATION	appeared upon the scene , the Portuguese and Spaniards had sailed the Malayan Seas for almost a century .

		Vasco da
Gama	PERSON	had doubled the
Cape	LOCATION	in
1498	DATE	.

		But not until the begin - ning of the seventeenth century , when the Spanish Armada had been definitely annihilated and the road to the Indies was free , did the English and the Dutch navigators venture past the deadline drawn between
Lisbon	LOCATION	and the
Azores	LOCATION	.

		Even then the voyage was dangerous and - uncertain .

		The Spanish colonial of - ficials had guarded their charts and their nautical secrets with great care often with disastrous results to themselves .

		The existence of Torres Street be - tween
New Guinea	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	was known to the Spaniards , who kept that useful information hidden in their archives for almost two hundred years , when the discoverers of Tasman made their knowl - edge useless .

		In the same way no Spanish or Portu - guese pilot was allowed ` to serve a foreign master .

		Such rumors as circulated in the pothouses of
Bristol	LOCATION	and the small towns along the Zuyder Zee had been gathered at serious personal risk .

		Not until Lin - schoten returned home from his twenty years of cheerful wandering amidst the Portuguese colonies was the riddle solved with any accuracy .

		Then both
Holland	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	gave up their search for a North-Eastern passage and made straight for the promised land of the
Great Mogul	LOCATION	and the dodo - bird .

		An English and a
Dutch East India Company	ORGANIZATION	were formed -LRB- terribly overcapitalized and incred - ibly successful -RRB- and the combined task of dividend - hunting and Portuguese-baiting was undertaken on a large and most profitable scale .

		The result of this enterprise is well known .


Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	were driven out of the Indies , and the English and Dutch took possession .

		The adventures of the earliest English navigators are well depicted in the present volume by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	.

		It is a happy book .

		It is fair .

		The mys - terious drama of
Ambonia	LOCATION	, where Dutch and English imperial ambitions clashed and caused a disgusting legal massacre , is given in detail but without preju - dice .

		It was a miserable affair , and unfortunately it was in keeping with much else .

		The Old Testament and Doctor
Calvin	PERSON	were responsible for many hor - rors .

		Was not man the master and owner of the land and the water and the fishes and the little brown men who plowed and harvested in this paradise of the heathen and the idol ?

		Did not the captain of the ship which destroyed a few spice-islands to keep the price of nutmeg at the prevailing rate serve both his stockholders and his God ?

		The work of the Hak - luyt Society and the
Linschoten Vereeniging	LOCATION	has given us sufficient data upon which to judge the psyche of the men who did the rough work of estab - lishing their respective colonial domains .

		They de - stroyed and burned and reconstructed with a pro- found belief in a personal divinity and a firm assur - ance of ultimate salvation .

		Nowadays a few minor atrocities amidst the naked savages of the
Congo	LOCATION	fill the world with disgust .

		Our ancestors of three hundred years ago took such occurrences for granted , and golden medals arid bejeweled swords awaited the brave sailors who came home to report upon events which would hardly be covered in the least scrupu - lous of our newspapers .

		While the commercial agent of that day the good old factor would not find employment with the most hardened of our bucket - shop magnates .

		That is one of the reasons why Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's book may be recommended to the reader .

		It answers the question whether the world of men is stationary or progressive .

		Not only does the human race pro- ceed ; it rushes ahead at a terrible pace .

		What the German
Junker	PERSON	, from the darkest part of interior
Europe	LOCATION	, did in
Belgium	LOCATION	and
Northern France	LOCATION	was a common occurrence with our own ancestors only eight generations ago .

		They accepted such methods of warfare and greed as common events acts of THE DIAL 603 nature and acts of God .

		Their grandchildren have seen a great light and millions of them have given their lives that such things as these may never happen again .

		Nature works with rough broad strokes .

		But the picture is improving .

		The history of early colonial development and the subsequent growth of colonial responsibility shows what only a few centuries of applied intelligence will do for us .

		And we are still so young .

		HENDRIK
WILLEM VAN LOON	PERSON	.

		An Examination of Eminences -RSB- C OR MAKING a younger generation of rebels and malcontents the Victorian Age gets and deserves a good deal of reproach .

		Its descendants have not desired to find it so unsatisfactory .

		They would much prefer to have sprung from a society which they could really reverence .

		It is easier and alto - gether pleasanter to love your parents than to dis - like them ; and one 's days would have been all the fairer in the land if the commandment could have been obeyed by their children with a joyous heart and a clear conscience .

		But it was not so to be .

		A budding young middle class in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	found itself too tightly encased in tastes and values that did not at all accord with the push - ings within or the faint but tantalizing interests without .

		In a world where everything was becom - ing public , where everyone was being enjoined to take his place in the world 's work , the young person feeling the oats of his intelligence found that he was still being kept by family , school , and church in a state of tutelage .

		Parents to whose timid souls the confines of conventionality had been extremely grateful found themselves giving birth to amazing prodigies of reluctance and self-will .

		The turbu - lence of old submerged ancestors seemed to break out rather generally in this younger generation ; and contempt , disdain , irreverence , flightiness , bump - tiousness , and rebellion raised their horrid heads .

		The vigorous and the wicked got easily free , but on the more sensitive youth the divine right of parents and of the small-town sanctities often bore so heavily that a large part of their golden youth was spent in mere disentanglement .

		The mournful inadequacies of religion , the urgency of socialism , sex-expression , and worthy work all served as rationalizations for the wild impulsive need of escape .

		But the fashion became gradually for us to roll our resentments into a blanket indictment of the Victorian Age .

		This happy way of taking the offensive-defensive has almost driven the Victorians from the field .

		It Has been almost too successful .

		Not content with turning the dear Queen into a sort of perpetual wet - nurse to a civilization , it has made of all the notables political , literary , religious a cluster of priggish children about her skirts .

		Even Wells still pursues her relentlessly in his last novel as `` that little old German woman . ''

		The anti-Victorian rebellion long since got into the play and the novel , but ` biography has been left untouched .

		No one has dared to touch the sacred personalities themselves .

		One could flash sharp little nips at them ; but to take a life and turn it inside out , letting all the modern irony and youthful disdain play upon it , was an enterprise which has surpassed the genius of this younger generation .

		Until now .

		Mr.
Lytton Strachey	PERSON	, in Eminent Victorians -LRB-
Putnam	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	-RRB- , has done that very thing just at the time when the fun of hitting the Victorian Age over the head , the delight of referring all our spiritual disorders , bonds , and tensions back to the innocent maleficence of what was after all a varied and vivid time , is becoming a little stale .

		With a cruelly masterful hand he has gone below the surface and turned up its paradoxes .

		We gloat over that `` eminent . ''

		Not
Gladstone	PERSON	or Tennyson or
Browning	PERSON	or Disraeli are his samples ; but Car - dinal
Manning	PERSON	,
Florence Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	, and General
Gordon	PERSON	people of no perma - nent influence , but revealing because their contem - poraries became excited about them .

		They had the luck to set vibrating the peculiar reverences and interests which that society took with the most un - questioning sobriety and satisfaction .

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	is the young man looking his elders and betters for the first time full in the face , sizing them up in the complete poise of a modern self-assurance .

		From them he squeezes the last drop of the glorious juice which they so unexpectedly have to give forth .

		They live under his hand as no mere solitary targets for his depreciations .

		They trail along with themselves other figures
Newman	PERSON	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Clough	PERSON	, Sir
Evelyn Baring	PERSON	, and typical Englishmen like Lord
Harrington	PERSON	in etched portraits that bring a sur - prisingly large part of the political and religious tendencies of the time before us .

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	's preface is disarming and en - trancing : 604 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	The history of the Victorian Age will never be written ; we know too much about it .

		For ignorance is the first requisite of the historian ignorance which simplifies and clarifies , which selects and omits , with a placid perfection unattainable by the highest art .

		Concerning the age which has just passed , our fathers and our grandfathers have poured forth and accumulated so vast a quantity of information that the industry of a
Ranke	ORGANIZATION	would be sub - merged by it , and the perspicacity of a
Gibbon	PERSON	would quail before it .

		It is not by the direct method of a scrupu - lous narration that the explorer of the past can hope to depict that singular epoch .

		If he is wise , he will adopt a subtler strategy .

		He will attack his subject in unex - pected places ; he will fall upon the flank or the rear ; he will shoot a sudden , revealing searchlight into obscure recesses , hitherto undivined .

		He will row out over that great ocean of material , and lower down into it , here and there , a little bucket , which will bring up to the light of day some characteristic specimen from these far depths , to be examined with a careful curiosity .

		That subtler strategy Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	has adopted , with a mind so keenly tempered , a skill so deadly , that it is no wonder that the tough Victorian rem - nant is reported to be in consternation over this book which has created a stir in
England	LOCATION	even in wartime .

		This man has them at his mercy because he does not rant , he does not wring his hands or rail at Victorian obtuseness and middle-class stodgi - ness .

		Up till now our anti-Victorianism has been evangelistic .

		He improves on the evangelists by pre - senting not an argument , or a gospel , but the clear , cool , and always joyous truth .

		He tells the reveal - ing facts , and he lets his heroes perform all their own malice for him in their own words : Gladstone congratulating
Manning	PERSON	gleefully on his promotion to an Archdeaconship , only to catch himself up with a reminder of `` the great principle of communion in the body of Christ '' ; Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	saying that the `` one thing needful for a Christian and an English - man to study is Christian and moral and political philosophy '' ; and the Royal approbation falling with exquisite timeliness on the exploits of
Miss Night	ORGANIZATION	- ingale and revealing in the inimitable style of the Queen 's own letters the origin of the immortal
Hermione	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	is formidable .

		He escapes smart - ness , even when he says that `` when
Newman	PERSON	was a child he ` wished he could believe the Arabian nights were true . '

		When he came to be a man , his wish seems to have been granted '' ; or that `` one has the impression that
Miss Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	has got the Almighty too into her clutches , and that , if He is not careful , she will kill Him with overwork . ''

		All his cleverness is substantiated .

		He treats his sub - jects , no matter how playful he sounds and the book is dotted with delicious anecdotes with a fine seriousness .

		But his tact has the vigor of a genera - tion that has at last come into its intellectual own and has its ancient hinderers on the run .

		Bump - tious youth can usually be discounted on the ground of its hopeless ignorance , its smattering scholarship , its lack of experience , and its eloquence that is mere raw egoism .

		But what can be done with a mind of this terrifying competency , who builds up an un - assailable structure of facts , and writes a racy narra - tive in the clearest and most rhythmical of styles ?

		His irreverences are not mere insubordination but a genuine transvaluation of values .

		Froude and
Clough	PERSON	`` went through an experience which was more distressing in those days than it has since be - come ; they lost their faith . ''

		He has only to outline the great hubbub about the Gorham Judgment `` the questions at issue were taken very seriously by a large number of persons '' or the questions of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	that Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	and others ground the edges of their minds upon , to relegate the Age almost to the medievality of the angelic doctors .

		Manning ^ scruples deepened with his desires , and he could satisfy his most exorbitant ambitions in a profundity of self-abasement .

		He traces lightly the intricate thread of personal ambition that played through a society which had almost completely succeeded in translating every human purpose into terms of exalted altruism , or Christian casuistry .

		We see the surprising tenacity of Christian metaphysics in lives of the most worldy adventure .

		He is able to present very human figures without ever losing the sense of their social role in some great conflict of ideas or parties .

		The in - domitable will and strident personality of Miss Nightingale , that early wrecker of a parental home , is as living as her decisive effect on the English War Office .

		Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	's majesty slips into a biting paragraph -LRB- as from the pen of one who has suf - fered but restrains himself -RRB- about the influence of Rugby on English education : The earnest enthusiast who strove to make his pupils Christian gentlemen and who governed his school ac - cording to the principles of the Old Testament has proved to be the founder of the worship of athletics and the worship of good form .

		In the end of General
Gordon	PERSON	we read the weird story of a British Imperialism that did not know its own interests and had to break through , by a sort of animal push , the wavering passions of statesmen to attain its ends .

		At any rate it all ended ` very happily in a glorious slaughter of twenty thousand Arabs , a vast addition to the British Enipire , and a step in the peerage for Sir

		1918 THE DIAL 605 The Modern Point of View and the New Order VI .

		THE DIVINE RIGHT OF NATIONS IHIS SINISTER FACT is patent , that the great war has arisen out of a fateful complication of national ambitions .

		And it is a fact scarcely less patent that this fateful status quo arose out of the ordinary run of that system of law and custom which has gov - erned human intercourse among civilized nations in our time .

		The underlying principles of this system of law and custom have continued t0 govern human intercourse under a new order of material circumstances which has come into effect since these principles were first installed .

		These enlightened principles that go to make up the modern point of view as regards law and morals are of the eighteenth century , whereas the new order in industry is of the twentieth , and between these two dates lies an interval of unexampled change in the material conditions of life .

		The great war which is now com - ing to a provisional close is the largest and most atro - cious epoch of warfare known to history , and it has , in point of fact , arisen out of the status quo created by these enlightened principles of the modern point of view in working out their consequences on the ground of the new order of industry .

		The great war arose within that group of nations which have the full use of the industrial arts , which conduct their business and control their industries on the lines of these enlightened principles of the eighteenth century , and whose national ambitions and policies are guided by the preconceptions of na - tional self-determination and self-assertion which these modern civilized peoples have habitually found to be good and valid .

		The group of belligerents has included primarily the great industrial nations , and the outcome of the war is being decided by the industrial superiority of the advanced industrial peoples .

		A host of slightly backward peoples backward in the industrial respect have been drawn into this contest of the great powers , but these have taken part only as interested outliers .

		and as auxiliaries to be drawn on at the discretion of the chief belligerents .

		It has been a contest of technological superiority and industrial resources , and in the end the decision of it rests with the greater aggregation of industrial forces .

		Fright - fulness and warlike abandon and all the beastly devices of the heathen have proved to be unavailing against the great industrial powers .

		The center of the warlike disturbance has been the same as the center of growth and diffusion of the new order of industry .

		And in both respects , both as regards participation in the war and as regards their share in the new order of industry , it is not a question of geographical nearness to a geographical center , but of industrial affiliation and technological maturity .

		The center of disturbance and participa - tion is a center in the technological respect , and in the end the battle goes to those few great industrial peoples who are nearest , technologically speaking , to the apex of growth of the new order .

		These need be superior in no other respect ; the contest is decided on the merits of the industrial arts .

		And in this connection it may be in place to call to mind again that the state of the industrial arts is always a joint stock of knowledge and proficiency held , exercised , and carried forward by the industrial community at large as a going concern .

		What the war has vindicated , hithefto , is the great efficiency of the mechanical industry .

		But the ambitions and animosities whiqh pre - cipitated this contest , and which now stand ready to bring on a relapse , are not of the industrial order , and eminently not of the new order of technology .

		They have been more nearly bound up with those principles of self-help that have stood over from the recent past , from the time before the new order of industry came into bearing .

		And there is a curious parallel between the consequences worked out by these principles in the economic system within each of these nations , on the one hand , and in the concert of nations , on the other hand .

		Within the nation the enlightened principles of self-help and free contract have given rise to vested interests , which control the industrial system for their own use and thereby come in for a legal right to the community 's net output of product over cost .

		Each of these vested interests habitually aims to take over as much as it can of the lucrative traffic that goes on , and to get as much as it can out of the traffic , at the cost of the rest of the community .

		After the same analogy , and by sanction of the same liberal principles , the civilized nations , each and several , are vested with an inalienable right of `` self - determination '' ; which being interpreted means the self-aggrandizement of each and several at the cost of the rest , by a reasonable use of force and fraud .

		And there has been , on the whole , no sense of shame or of moral obliquity attaching to the use of so much 6o6 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	force and fraud as the traffic would bear , in this national enterprise of self-aggrandizement .

		Such has been use and wont among the civilized nations .

		Meantime the new order of industry has come into bearing , with the result that any disturbance which is set afoot by any one of these self-deter - mining nations in pursuing its own ends is sure to derange the conditions of life for all the others , just so far as these others are bound up in the same comprehensive organization of trade and industry .

		Full and free self-determination runs counter to the rule of Live and Let Live .

		After the same fashion the businesslike maneuvers of the vested interests within the nations , each managing its own affairs with an eye single to its own advantage , derange the ordinary conditions of life for the common man , and violate the rule of Live and Let Live by that much .

		Self-determination , full and free , neces - sarily encroaches on the life of all the others .

		So just now there is talk of disallowing or abridg - ing the inalienable right of free nations by so much as is imperatively demanded for reasonably secure conditions of life among these civilized peoples , and especially so far as is required for the orderly pur - suit of profitable business by the many vested in - terests domiciled in these civilized countries .

		The project has much in common with the measures which have been entertained for the restraint of any insufferably extortionate vested interests within the national frontiers .

		In both cases alike , both in the proposed regula - tion of businesslike excesses at home and in the pro- posed league of pacific nations , the projected meas - ures of sobriety and tolerance appear to be an in - fraction of that inalienable right of self-direction that makes up the substantial core of law and custom according to the modern point of view .

		And in both cases alike the projected measures are designed to go no farther than is unequivocally demanded by the imperative needs of continued life on earth , leav - ing the benefit of the doubt always on the side of the insufferable vested interests or the mischievous national ambitions , as the case may be , and leaving the impression that it all is a concessive surrender of principles under compulsion of circumstances that will not wait .

		There is also in both cases alike a well-assured likelihood that the tentative revision of vested interests and of national pretensions is to be no more than an incompetent remedial precaution , a makeshift shelter from the wrath to come .

		It is evident that in both cases alike we have to do with an incursion of ideas and considerations that are alien to the established liberal principles of human intercourse ; but it is also evident that these ideas and considerations have the sanction of that new order of things that runs in terms of tangible performance and enforces its requisitions with cruel and unusual punishments .

		It is these punishments that are to be evaded or suspended , and immunity is sought by measures of formality rather than by tangible performance .

		In such a case the keepers of the established order will always look to evasion , and entertain a hope of avoiding casualties and holding the line by cleverly designed masquerade .

		It is the express purpose of the projected league of pacific nations to keep the sovereign rights of national self-determination intact for all comers ; it is to be a league of nations , not a league of peoples .

		But it should be sufficiently obvious , whether it is avowed or not , that these sovereign rights can be maintained by these means only in a truncated form .

		Within the framework of any such league or com - mon understanding the nations , each and several , can continue to exercise these rights only on the basis of a mutual agreement to give up so much of their national pretensions as are incompatible with the common good .

		It involves a concessive sur - render of the sovereign right of self-aggrandizement , and perhaps also an extension of the rule of Live and Let Live to cover minor nationalities within the national frontiers a mutual agreement to play fair under the new rules that are to govern the conduct of national enterprise .

		But hitherto no liberal statesman has been so audacious as to `` imagine the king 's death '' and lay profane hands on the divine right of nations to seek their own advantage at the cost of the rest by such means as the rule of reason shall decide to be permissible .

		It is only that license is to be hedged about , and all insufferable superfluity of naughtiness is provisionally to be disallowed .

		There is this evident resemblance and kinship between the vested interests of business and the sovereign rights of nations , but it does not amount to identity .

		There is always something more to the national sovereignty and the national preten - sions , although these precautionary measures that are now under advisement as touches the legitimate bounds of both do run on singularly similar lines and are of a similarly tentative and equivocal nature .

		In the prudent measures by which statesmen have set themselves to curb the excesses of the greater vested interests their aim has quite consistently been to guard the free income of the lesser vested interests against the unseasonable rapacity of the greater ones , all the while that the underlying community has come into the case only as a fair field of business enterprise at large , within which there is to be maintained a reasonable degree of equal opportunity
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 607 among these interests , big and little , in whom , one with another , vests the effectual usufruct of the underlying community .

		So , on the other hand , the great war has brought into a strong light the obvious fact that , given the existing state of the industrial arts , any unseasonable rapacity on the part of the Great Powers in exer - cising their inalienable right of national self-deter - mination will effectually suppress the similarly in - alienable right of self-determination in any minor nationality that gets in the way .

		All of which is obnoxious to the liberal principle of self-help or to that of equal opportunity .

		Unhappily , these two guiding principles of the modern point of view have proved to be incompatible with one another under the circumstances of the new order of things .

		So there has come into view this project of a league by which it is proposed to play fast and loose with the inalienable right of national self-help by setting up some sort of a collusive arrangement between
the Powers	ORGANIZATION	, looking to a reasonable disallowance of force and fraud in the pursuit of national ambitions .

		Under the material circumstances of the new order those correctives that were once counted on to keep the run of things within the margin of tolerance have ceased to be a sufficient safeguard .

		By use and wont , in the liberal scheme of statecraft as well as in the scheme of freely competitive busi - ness , implicit faith has hitherto been given to the remedial effect of punitive competition and the puni - tive correction of excesses by law and custom .

		It has been a system of adjustment by punitive after - ' thought .

		All of which may once have been well enough in its time , so long as the rate and scale of the movement of things were slow enough and small enough to be effectually overtaken and set to rights by afterthought .

		The modern point of view pre - sumes an order of things which is amenable to remedial adjustment after the event .

		But the new order of industry , and that sweeping equilibrium of material forces that embodies the new order , is not amenable to afterthought .

		However , ripe statesmen and overripe captains of finance have so secure a grasp of first principles that they are still able to be - lieve quite sincerely in the good old plan of remedial afterthought , and it still commands the affectionate service of the jurists and the diplomatic corps .

		Meantime the far-reaching , swift-moving , wide - sweeping machine technology has been drawn into the service of national pretensions , as well as of the vested interests that find shelter under the national pretensions , and both the remedial diplomats and the self-determination of nations are on the way to become a tale that was told .

		The divine right of nations appears to be a blurred after-image of the divine right of kings .

		It rests on ground more archaic and less open to scrutiny than the natural right of self-direction as it applies in the case of individual persons .

		It is a highly prized national asset , in the nature of an imponderable ; and , very much as is true of the divine right of kings , any spoken doubt of its par - amount validity comes near being a sin against the Holy Ghost .

		As is true of the divine right of kings , so also as regards the divine right of nations , it is extremely difficult to show that it serves the com - mon good in any material way , in any way that can be formulated or verified in terms of tangible per - formance .

		Evidently it does not come in under that mechanistic conception that rules the scheme of knowledge and belief wherever and so far as ma - terial science and the machine technology have reshaped men 's habits of thought .

		Indeed it is not a technological conception , late or early .

		It is not statable in terms of mechanical efficiency , or even in terms of price .

		Hence it is spoken of , often and eloquently , as being `` beyond price . ''

		It is more nearly akin to magic and religion .

		It should per - haps best be conceived as an end in itself , or a thing-in-itself again in close analogy with the di - vine right of kings .

		But there is no question of its substantial reality and its paramount efficacy for good and ill .

		The divine that is to say inscrutable and ir - responsible right of kings reached its best estate and put on divinity in the stirring times of the era of state-making ; when the princes and prelates `` tore each other in the slime . ''

		It was of a proprietary nature , a vested interest , something in the nature of intangible assets , which embodied the usufruct of the realm , including its population and resources , and which could be turned to account in the pursuit of princely or dynastic advantage at home and abroad .

		This divine right of princes was disallowed among the more civilized peoples on the transition to modern ways of thinking , and the sovereign rights of the prince were then taken over at least in form and principle by the people at large , and they have continued to be held by them as some sort of im - ponderable `` community property '' at least in point of form and profession .

		The vested interest of the prince or the dynasty in the usufruct of the under - lying community is thereby presumed to have become a collective interest vested in people of the nation and giving them a `` right of user '' in their own per - sons , knowledge , skill , and resources .

		The mantle of princely sovereignty has fallen on the common man formally and according to the 6o8 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	letter of the legal instruments .

		In practical effect it has been converted into a cloak to cover the nakedness of a government which does business for the kept classes .

		In practical effect the shift from the dynastic politics of the era of state-making to the liberal policies based on the enlightened prin - ciples of the eighteenth century has been a shift from the pursuit of princely dominion to an imperialistic enterprise for the protection and furtherance of those vested interests that are domiciled within the national frontiers .

		That such has been the practical outcome is due to the fact that these enlightened principles of the eighteenth century comprise as their chief article the `` natural '' right of ownership .

		The later course of events has decided that the ownership of property in sufficiently large blocks will control the country 's industrial system and thereby take over the disposal of the community 's net output of prod - uct over cost on which the vested interests live , and on which , therefore , the kept classes feed .

		Hence the chief concern of those gentlemanly na - tional governments that have displaced the dynastic states is always and consistently the maintenance of the rights of ownership and investment .

		However , these pecuniary interests of investment and free income are not all that is covered by the mantle of democratic sovereignty .

		Nor will it hold true that the common man has no share in the legacy of sovereignty and national enterprise which the en - lightened democratic commonwealth has taken over from the departed dynastic regime .

		The divine right of the prince included certain imponderables , as well as the usufruct of the material resources of the realm .

		There were the princely dignity and honor , which were no less substantial an object of value and ambition and were no less tenaciously held by the princes of the dynastic regime than the revenues and material `` sinews of war '' on which the prestige and honor rested .

		And the common man of the democratic commonwealth has at least come in for a ratable share in these imponderables of prestige and honor that so are comprised under the divine right of the nation .

		He has an undivided interest in the glamour of national achievement , and he can swell with just pride in contemplating the triumphs of his gentlemanly government over the vested in - terests domiciled in any foreign land , or with just indignation at any diplomatic setback suffered by the vested interests domiciled in his own .

		There is also a more tangible , though more petty , advantage gained for the common man in having formally taken over the sovereignty from the dead hand of the dynastic prince .

		The common man be - ing now vested with the divine right of national sovereignty held in undivided community ownership , it is ceremonially necessary for the gentlemanly stewards of the kept classes to consult the wishes of this their sovereign on any matters of policy that can not wholly be carried through in a diplomatic corner and under cover of
night	TIME	and cloud .

		He , collectively , holds an eventual power of veto .

		And this power of veto has in practice been found to be something of a safeguard against any universal and enduring increase of hardship at the hands of the gentlemen-investors to whom the conduct of the nation 's affairs has been `` entrusted '' a very modest safeguard , it is true , but always of some eventual consequence .

		There is the difference that in the democratic commonwealth the common man has to be managed rather than driven except for minor groups of common men who live on the lower - common levels , and except for occasional periods of legislative hysteria and judiciary blind-staggers .

		And it is pleasanter to be managed than to be driven .

		Chicane is a more humane art than corporal punish - ment .

		Imperial England is , after ' all , a milder - mannered stepmother than
Imperial Germany	LOCATION	.

		And always the common man comes in for his ratable share in the glamour of national achievement , in war and peace ; and this imponderable gain of the spirit is also something .

		The value of these col - lective imponderables of national prestige and col - lective honor is not to be made light of .

		These count for very much in the drift and set of national sentiment , and moral issues of national moment are wont to arise out of them .

		Indeed , they constitute the chief incentive which holds the common man to an unrepining constancy in the service of the `` national interests . ''

		So that , while the tangible shell of material gain appears to have fallen to the democratic community 's kept classes , yet the `` psychic income '' that springs from national enter - prise , the spiritual kernel of national elation , they share with the common man on an equitable footing of community interest .

		Yet , while the national policies of the democratic commonwealths are managed by liberal statesmen in behalf of the vested interests , they still run on the ancient lines of dynastic statecraft as worked out by the statesmen of the ancient regime ; and the common man is still passably content to see the traffic run along on those lines .

		The things which are considered desirable to be done and the sufficient reasons for doing them still have much of the medieval color .

		National pretensions , enterprise , rivalry , intrigue , and dissensions among the demo - cratic commonwealths are still such as would have been intelligible to
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Frederick	PERSON	the
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 609 Great ,
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	,
Bismarck	LOCATION	, or the Elder States - men of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Diplomatic intercourse still runs in the same terms of systematized prevarication , and still turns about the same schedule of national pre - tensions that contented the medieval spirit of these masters of dynastic intrigue .

		As a matter of course and of common sense the nations still conceive them - selves to be rivals , whose national interests are in - compatible , and whose divine right it is to gain something at one another 's cost , after the fashion of rival bandits or business concerns .

		They still seek dominion and still conceive themselves to have extra - territorial interests of a proprietary sort .

		They still hold and still seek vested rights in colonial posses - sions and in extra-territorial priorities and conces - sions of divers and dubious kinds .

		There still are conferences , stipulations , and guarantees between the Powers , touching the `` Open Door '' in
China	LOCATION	, or the equitable partition of
Africa	LOCATION	, which read like a chapter on Honor Among Thieves .

		All this run of national pretensions , wrangles , dominion , aggrandizement , chicane , and ill-will is nothing more than the old familiar trading-stock of the diplomatic brokers who do business in dynastic force and fraud also called Realpolitik .

		The democratic nations have taken over in bulk the whole job-lot of vested interests and divine rights that have made the monarch of the old order an unfailing source of outrage and desolation .

		In the hands of those Elder Statesmen who once did busi - ness under the signature of the dynasty , the traffic in statecraft yielded nothing better than a mess of superfluous affliction ; and there is no reason to apprehend that a continuation of the same traffic under the management of the younger statesmen who now do business in the name of the democratic commonwealth is likely to bring anything more com - fortable , even though the legal instruments in the case may carry the rubber-stamp OK of the com - mon man .

		The same items will foot up to the same sum ; and in either case the net gain is always some - thing appreciably less than nothing .

		These national interests are part of the medieval system of ends , ways and means , as it stood , com - plete and useless , at that juncture when the demo - cratic commonwealth took over the divine rights of the crown .

		It is a case of aimless survival , on the whole , due partly to the inertia of habit and tradi - tion , partly to the solicitous advocacy of these na - tional interests by those classes the trading and office-holding classes who stand to gain something by the pursuit of them at the cost of the rest .

		By tenacious tradition out of the barbarian past these peoples have continued to be rival nations living in a state of habitual enmity and distrust , for no better reason than that they have not taken thought and changed their mind .

		After some slackening of national animosities and some disposition to neglect national pretensions dur - ing the earlier decades of the great era of liberalism the democratic nations have been gradually shifting back to a more truculent attitude and a more crafty and more rapacious management in all international relations .

		This aggressive chauvinistic policy has been called Imperialism .

		The movement has visibly kept pace , more or less closely , with the increasing range and volume of commerce and foreign invest - ments during the same period .

		And to further this business enterprise there has been an ever increasing resort to military power .

		It is reasonably believed that traders and investors in foreign parts are able to derive a larger profit from their business when they have the backing of a powerful and aggressive national government ; particularly in their dealings with helpless and backward peoples , and more par - ticularly if their own national government is suf - ficiently unscrupulous and overbearing which may confidently be counted on so long as these govern - ments are administered by the gentlemanly delegates of the vested interests and the kept classes .

		As regards the intrinsic value which is popularly attached to the imponderable national possessions , in the way of honor and prestige , there is little to be said beyond the stale reflection that there is no disputing about tastes .

		It all is at least a profitable illusion , for the use of those who are in a position to profit by it , such as the crown and the office - holders .

		But the people of the civilized nations believe themselves to have also a material interest of some sort in enlarging the national dominions and in extending the foreign trade of their business men and safeguarding the foreign claims of their vested interests .

		And the Americans , like many others , harbor the singular delusion that they can derive a collective benefit from obstructing the country 's trade at the national frontiers by means of a tariff barrier , and so defeating their own industry by that much .

		It is a survival out of the barbarian past , out of the time when the dynastic politicians were occupied with isolating the nation and making it self-sufficient , as an `` engine of warlike enterprise for the pursuit of dynastic ambitions and the greater discomfort of their neighbors .

		In an increasing de - gree , as the new order of industry has come into bearing , any such policy of industrial isolation and self-sufficiency has become more difficult and more injurious ; for a free range and unhindered special - ization is of the essence of the new industrial order .

		6io THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	The experience of the war has shown conclusively that no one country can hereafter supply its own needs either in raw materials or in finished goods .

		Both the winning and the losing side have shown that .

		The new industrial order necessarily over - laps the national frontiers , even in the case of a nation possessed of so extensive and varied natural resources as
America	LOCATION	.

		So that in spite of all the singularly ingenious obstruction of the American tariff the Americans still continue to draw on foreign sources for most or all of their tea , coffee , sugar , tropical and semi-tropical fruits , vegetable oils , vegetable gums and pigments , cordage fibers , silks , rubber , and a bewildering multitude of minor articles of daily use .

		Even so peculiarly American an industry as chewing-gum is wholly dependent on foreign raw material , and quite unavoidably so .

		The most that can be accomplished by any tariff under these circumstances is more or less obstruc - tion .

		Isolation and self-sufficiency are already far out of the question .

		But there are certain vested interests which find their profit in maintaining a tariff barrier as a means of keeping the price up and keeping the supply down ; and the common man still faithfully believes that the profits which these vested interests derive in this way from increasing the cost of his livelihood and decreasing the net productivity of his industry will benefit him in some mysterious way .

		.

		He is persuaded that high prices and a scant supply of goods at a high labor-cost is a desirable state of things .

		This is incredible , but there is no denying the fact .

		He knows , of course , that the profits of business go to the business men , the vested interests , and to no one else ; but he is still beset with the picturesque hallucination that any unearned income which goes to those vested interests whose central office is in
New Jersey	LOCATION	is paid to himself in some underhand way , while the gains of those vested interests that are domiciled in
Canada	LOCATION	are obviously a grievous net loss to him .

		The tariff moves in a mysterious way its wonders to perform .

		To all adult persons of sound mind , and not un - duly clouded with the superstitions of the price system , it is an obvious matter of fact that any pro- tective tariff is an obstruction to industry and a means of impoverishment , just so far as it is effect - ive .

		The arguments to the contrary invariably turn out to be pettifoggers ' special pleading for some vested interest or for a warlike national policy , and these arguments convince only those persons who are able to believe that a part is greater than the whole .

		It also lies in the nature of protective tariffs that they always cost the nation disproportionately much more than they are worth to those vested in - terests which profit by them .

		In this respect they are like any other method of businesslike sabotage .

		Their aim , and presumably their effect , is to keep the price up by keeping the supply down , to hinder competitors , and retard production .

		As in other instances of businesslike sabotage the net margin of advantage to those who profit by it is greatly less than what it costs the community .

		Yet it is to be noted that the Americans have prospered , on the whole , under protective tariffs which have been as ingeniously and comprehensively foolish as could well be contrived .

		There is even some color of reason in the contentions of the pro- tectionists that the more reasonable tariffs have commonly been more depressing to industry than the most imbecile of them .

		All of which should be dis - quieting to the advocates of free trade .

		The defect of the free-trade argument , and the disappointment of free-trade policies , lies in overlooking the fact that in the absence of an obstructive tariff sub - stantially the same amount of obstruction has to be accomplished by other means if business is to pros - per .

		And business prosperity is the only manner of prosperity known or provided for among the civil - ized nations .

		It is the only manner of prosperity on which the divine right of the nation gives it a claim .

		A protective tariff is only an alternative method of businesslike sabotage .

		If and so far as this method of keeping the supply of goods within salutary bounds is not resorted to , other means of accomplishing the same result must be employed .

		For so long as investment continues to control in - dustry the welfare of the community is bound up with the prosperity of its business ; and business can - not be carried on without reasonably profitable prices ; and reasonably profitable prices can not be maintained without a salutary limitation of the supply which means slowing down production to such a rate and volume as the traffic will bear .

		A protective tariff is only one means of crippling the country 's industrial forces for the good of busi - ness .

		In its absence all that matter will be taken care of by other means .

		The tariff may perhaps be a little the most flagrant method of sabotage by which the vested interests are enabled to do a reason - ably profitable business ; but there is nothing more than a difference of degree and not a large differ - ence at that .

		So long as industry is managed with a view to a profitable price it is quite indispensable to guard against an excessive rate and volume of output .

		In the absence of all businesslike sabotage the productive capacity of the industrial system would very shortly pass all reasonable bounds ,
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 6n prices would decline disastrously , and overhead charges would not be covered , fixed charges on cor - poration securities and other credit instruments could not be met , and the whole structure of busi - ness enterprise would collapse , as it occasionally has done in times of `` overproduction . ''

		There is no doing business without a fair price , since the net price over cost is the motive of business .

		A pro- tective tariff is , in effect , an auxiliary safeguard against overproduction .

		But the , divine right of national self-direction also covers much else of the same description , be - sides the privilege of setting up a tariff in restraint of trade .

		There are many channels of such dis - crimination , of divers kinds , but always it will be found that these channels are channels of sabotage and that they serve the advantage of some group of vested interests which do business under the shelter of the national pretensions .

		There are foreign invest - ments and concessions to be procured and safe - guarded for the nation 's business men by moral sua - sion backed with warlike force , and the common man pays the cost ; there is discrimination to be exercised and perhaps subsidies and credits to be accorded those of the nation 's business men who derive a profit from shipping , for the discomfiture of alien com - petitors , and the common man pays the cost ; there are colonies to be procured and administered at the public expense for the private gain of certain traders , concessionaires , and administrative office-holders , and the common man pays the cost .

		Back of it all is the nation 's , divine right to carry arms , to support a competitive military and naval establishment , which has ceased , under the new order , to have any other material use than to enforce or defend the businesslike right of particular vested interests to get something for nothing in some particular place and in some particular way , and the common man pays the cost and swells with pride .

M. Whitman	PERSON	,

		And so it was not strange for
Max Eastman	ORGANIZATION	to champion formal poetry at a time when this ancient mode was being lorded over and trampled upon in so Prussian a manner by the vers librists ; it was a natural if somewhat overanxious taking up of arms for the oppressed that , a year or two ago , prompted his counterblasts in Lazy Verse .

		Something of these righteous protests or -LRB- since Mr.

		His partisan angle of vision leads him to a supple , sensitive prose and a distorted set of con - clusions ; it causes him to write a foreword which is the most important part of his book a preface that is , beneath the orderly contours of its style , a curiously passionate and provocative one .

		Whit - man has been accepted as the great democratic bard of
America	LOCATION	;
Poe	PERSON	as the anti-realistic , anti-social poet .

		Mr.

		He attempts to show that
Poe	PERSON	was actually the more democratic , .

		for while
Whitman	PERSON	was writing about people ,
Poe	PERSON	was writing for them : Walt Whitman composed wonderful passages about universal love , but he could not be the universal poet exactly because he was not social enough .

		He was not humble enough to be social .

		The rebel egoism of de - mocracy was in him the lordly and compelling thing and though his love for the world was prodigious , it was not the kind of love that gives attention instinctively to the egoism of others ... There may be no grand passion for the idea , but there is a natural companionship with the fact of `` democracy , '' in
Poe	PERSON	's statement that he `` kept steadily in view the de - sign of rendering the work universally appreciable , '' and that statement more characteristically distinguishes his attitude from

America	LOCATION	or upon human nature , that

Eastman	PERSON	's explanation of this incon - gruity that betrays his dogmatism as a philosopher and his limitations as a poet .

		Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	de - clares that this is `` something which only an ade - quate science of verse can explain '' and suggests that
Whitman	PERSON	's `` realizations of life would be acceptable , and be honored by the ` divine average , ' 6l 2 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	if they had been conveyed , as
Poe	PERSON	's were , in vessels of light , which would make them objective , and from which they might brim over with excess of subjective meaning and emotion . ''

		The explana - tion is far simpler than this and has very little to do with the matter of form , which is Mr.
East	PERSON	- man 's chief concern .

		Whitman , had he been clothed in all the conventional appurtenances of rhyme , regular rhythms , and strict verse structures , would have remained fully as unpopular with the vast majority , who steadfastly prefer prettiness to splen - dor , exotic fantasies to hard self-analysis , tinsel to truth .

		Whitman , even though Leaves of Grass had been a sonnet sequence , was saying things that most people did not want to hear ; it was his frank - ness not his form that kept them away .


Poe	PERSON	did not trouble them with harsh realities ; he soothed them with a narcotic romanticism .

		But that escape alone would not have endeared
Poe	PERSON	to the heart of the literary bourgeoisie .

		The
Raven	ORGANIZATION	and
Annabel Lee	PERSON	might , as Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	points out , `` be found in illuminated covers on the most ` average ' of American parlor tables . ''

		It is however not the beauty of its form that has put The Raven there : it is its cheapness .

		Such an uplifting and magnificent pattern of regularity as
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's A Fallen Yew , or Robert Bridges ' A Passer-by , or
George Meredith	PERSON	's Love in the
Valley	LOCATION	, or any of
A. E. Housman	PERSON	's lyrics from The Shropshire Lad or , for that matter ,
Poe	PERSON	's
The City	LOCATION	in the Sea none of these are to be found `` on the most ` average ' of parlor tables . ''

		The
Raven	ORGANIZATION	and
Annabel Lee	PERSON	owe their popu - larity to the fact that they are unusually jingly settings of bathetically sentimental themes .

		The
Raven	ORGANIZATION	is liked precisely as a `` popular '' tune is liked , commonplace enough to be easily learned by heart and bearing the same relation to great poetry that
Nevin	PERSON	's equally popular Narcissus bears to great music ;
Annabel Lee	PERSON	has even been made into a `` popular '' movie .

		Had Whitman been endowed with all the metrical dexterity of
A. C. Swinburne	PERSON	, it is hard to imagine the
Song of Myself	ORGANIZATION	adapted for the patrons of
The Rivoli Motion Picture Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		Popularity is scarcely a sure test for either poetry or democracy .

		The greater
Poe	PERSON	is as un - known to the lovers of his
Lenore	PERSON	as the forbidding -LRB- and even forbidden -RRB- author of Children of
Adam	PERSON	.

		If popularity were to mean anything except an almost universal appetite for what is cheap , un - troublesome , and second-rate , it might be significant to observe that Captain , My Captain !

		-LRB- perhaps the poorest thing that Whitman ever wrote -RRB- lies on the same table with Little Boy Blue and
Annabel Lee	PERSON	.

		When Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	proceeds to leave
Poe	PERSON	for the poetasters he is on solider ground .

		He strikes out and scores heavily in the second half of his essay ; especially when , with a prodigal excess of vigor , he punctures so many of the vers librists ' bubbles .

		Here is an especially keen passage : To incorporate in a passage of printed symbols an inde - terminate element so marked and so frequent as that , is to say to the reader `` Take the passage and organize it into whatever rhythmical pattern may please yourself . ''

		And that is what the reader of free verse usually does , knowing that if he comes into any great difficulty , he can make a full stop at the end of some line , and shift the gears of his rhythm altogether .

		And , since it is possible for one who is rhythmically gifted to organize any inde - terminate series of impressions whatsoever into an accept - able rhythm , he frequently produces a very enjoyable piece of music , which he attributes to the author , and having made it himself , is not unable to admire .

		Thus a good many poets who could hardly beat a going march on a bass drum , are enabled by the gullibility and talent of their readers to come forward in this kind of writing as musicians of special and elaborate skill .

		The `` free - dom '' that it gives them is not a freedom to build rhythms that are impossible in prose , but a freedom from the necessity to build actual and continuous rhythms .

		Free verse avails itself of the rhythmic appearance of poetry , and it avoids the extreme rhythmic difficulties of prose , and so it will certainly live as a supremely convenient way to write , among those not too strongly appealed to by the greater convenience of not writing .

		This sharpness and distinction of speech is not always with Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	when he endeavors , in his verse , to live up to the demands of his prologue .

		In his prose
Max Eastman	PERSON	is always the poet ; in his poetry he is an artist anxious to capture beauty rather than a captor driven by it .

		His sonnets -LRB- with the exception of the caustic rejoinder to
E. S. Martin	PERSON	and the ironically moving The Net -RRB- are a bit dessicated ; his lyrics , for all their insistence on flame and desire , strangely cool .

		Coming to Port and To an Actress attain a passion that the others only approximate .

		But the freshest of his poems are the early ones ; and the best of these is still At the Aquarium : Serene the silver fishes glide ; Stern-lipped , and pale , and wonder-eyed ; As through the aged depths of ocean , They glide with wan and wavy motion .

		They have no pathway where they go , They flow like water to and fro .

		They watch with never winking eyes , They watch with staring , cold surprise , The level people in the air , The people peering , peering there , Who wander also to and fro , And know not why or where they go , Yet have a wonder in their eyes , Sometimes a pale and cold surprise .

		The greater part of the volume contains much that no one but an intransigent lover of earth could have felt .

		But its outstanding virtue is this : it is an excellent introduction to the preface .

		1918 THE DIAL 613 The Talent of the Brush
Norbert Heermann	PERSON	's history or a distin - guished and yet little known American painter ,
Frank Duveneck	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , has a sentence of
John Singer Sargent	ORGANIZATION	's on its jacket and as the very first words of its text , we may feel justified in taking as our theme the quality which is thus proposed to us .

		For it was not in the lay - man 's sense of the words , that would make `` talent of the brush '' mean much the same as `` artist , '' that
Sargent	PERSON	spoke .

		When he expressed his opinion that `` after all is said ,
Frank Duveneck	PERSON	is the greatest talent of the brush of this generation , '' he had in mind that mastery over the instrument of painting , that technique in the special use of the word , which means handling so brilliantly exemplified in the work of Sargent himself .

		To the admirers of
Frank Duveneck	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Heer	PERSON	- mann 's little volume will come as a welcome tribute to a sympathetic personality , to an able painter , to a teacher who has exercised a wide influence ; to future writers the value of the book must lie in its statement of fact .

		For the most casual survey of the illustrations must convince us that the author only impeaches himself as a critic when he says of Duve - neck : `` There is in his work a certain finality of grasp , with a dignity , a calm , which to the con - noisseur is akin to the serenity of the Greek . ''

		Sargent , with all his emphasis , does not get himself into such deep water as this ; the use of such weighty expressions as `` finality '' and `` serenity '' surely was due to too great an absorption in his subject .

		Or indeed , if some admirer of
Duveneck	PERSON	's should feel disposed to criticize the present critic and say the Greeks and Rembrandt and Rubens , whom Mr.
Heerman	PERSON	invokes , are themselves the reason for such praise of the painter , how does it come about that all but three of the numerous paintings reproduced date from
Duveneck	PERSON	's thirtieth year or earlier , and the remainder from not later than his fortieth , whereas the artist is seventy years of age today ?

		Men great enough to justify the use of such words as this book uses so prodigally do not peter out .

		There is no example of a master 's going backward as the latter work of
Duveneck	PERSON	shows him to have done the three paintings of
1887	DATE	being unquestionably a dis - appointment after the artist 's production of the seventies .

		We are left to infer , from the omission of any painting done in the last thirty years , that the pictures of that period are even less worthy to bear out the promise of the young man whom
William Morris Hunt	PERSON	hailed so cordially in
1875	DATE	.

		Indeed such later works by
Duveneck	PERSON	as have been shown only confirm the idea that the talent of the brush is not sufficient for an art which shall remain fruitful so long , even , as the artist lives .

		It is as a man of his generation that
Duveneck	PERSON	must be considered , or more exactly , as one of that group in it who went to
Germany	LOCATION	for their training .

		The best of them saw into the poverty of the older generation of the German painters they found , and formed their art on that of
Leibl	LOCATION	, himself a devoted follower of Courbet .

		Despite their later turning directly to French masters , they all retained something of the
Munchener	ORGANIZATION	in their painting .

		The classic sense of form , which underlies all good French art , quite eluded the German students ` of
Courbet	LOCATION	, and the Americans who came to them for guidance felt the need of the vital quality even less .

		It was the robustness of Courbet which delighted them : `` That is no kid-glove painting '' was
Leibl	PERSON	's word for the great Frenchman .

		And so the effort of that
Munich	LOCATION	of the seventies which we see so clearly in
Duveneck	PERSON	's best pictures was for mastery of han - dling , the `` talent of the brush . ''

		It went easily with their attitude toward nature .

		Mr.
Heermann	PERSON	re - minds us that the art of
Courbet	PERSON	and his group was `` la nature vue a travers un temperament , '' and we may perhaps let the famous and faulty definition go for the present , since a paraphrase of it will describe the work of the group we are discussing .

		With them it is `` la nature vue a travers un musee . ''

		To be sure , every artist must go to the museum to learn his trade ; but the men with something to say get to the inner meaning of the great works , and the form in which they clothe their own ideas differs from that of the past .

		The reason why the
Munich	LOCATION	group , and others , had so much time to lavish on their brushwork was that they were content to accept merely the externals of the pictures in the museums .

		But we must not underrate the importance of these men .

		The return of
Duveneck	PERSON	, Chase , and the others of the generation was an event in our art - history .

		If they did not get to the deepest principles of the old masters or orient us in the great current of living art which centered in
Paris	LOCATION	, they did mean a big advance over what was generally seen here before their time .

		They were potent influences in directing the younger men toward the art-wealth of
Europe	LOCATION	, which must still be our source of strength .

		And the vigor , the enthusiasm that suffused the generation in the delight of its advance has not been equaled by many of their better equipped successors .

		WALTER PACK .

		614 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	O
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	: A Postscript ' NLY A FEW short years ago , one had to go about armed with a loaded theory concerning
Laf	ORGANIZATION	- cadio
Hearn	PERSON	, as a protection against prowling liter - ary buttonholers .

		Hearn was an issue .

		You were not permitted merely to accept him ; you were ex - pected either to defend him or to reject him .

		Mean - time
Hearn	PERSON	books came hurtling from the press in a sizzling stream , jostling and splintering one an - other as do logs in a jam .

		All that was necessary to qualify as a commentator was at some time to have evolved a theory about
Hearn	PERSON	or to have received a letter from him .

		The fact that the two seldom went together implied no real handicap .

		If one had the letter , it was always possible to evolve a theory to match ; and if the theory , to discover a letter which would substantiate it .

		So thick became the dust of discussion and dis - sension that one fairly despaired of ever reading anything about this strange interpreter of the
Japan	LOCATION	- ese which did not carry a chip on its shoulder .

		Partly owing to
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's erratic personality , partly to his outspokenness , but most of all to his revealing and voluminous correspondence , he stepped from life into legend with no twilight zone between .

		After his death , his own preoccupation with the spirit of beauty the `` Eternal Haunter '' became almost unanimously subordinated to a seething scramble to explain him .

		Around his early life , his weaknesses , his eccentricities , and his friendships the controversy raged , fanned by a dozen pens .

		It became to use words which
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	once applied to something quite different `` one continuous shrill - ing , keen as the ' steel speech of a saw . ''

		It neglected nothing , not even such momentous issues as whether
Hearn	PERSON	used his pocket telescope much or little .

		In the wake of all this turmoil and truculence it is with a sense of relief that one turns to the slender little outpouring from the heart of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's Japanese widow ,
Setsuko Koizumi	PERSON	, who has some - thing to say but nothing to prove in her Reminis - cences of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- .

		And what makes her naive recital all the more ingratiating is its apparent unconcern with the stuff of the wrangle .

		For what
Nina Kennard	PERSON	, in her contribution -LRB-
Lafcadio Hearn Appleton	PERSON	;
1912	DATE	-RRB- , spoke of as `` a certain amount of friction '' with another biographer was by no means native to any one phase of the controversy .

		There appears to have been more than enough to go round .

		Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	-LRB- in Concerning
Lafcadio Hearn Jacobs	PERSON	;
1908	DATE	-RRB- did not hesitate to admit being instrumental in `` getting
Hearn	PERSON	a soul , '' thus drawing the fire of
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	, who edited the bulk of the
Hearn	PERSON	correspondence -LRB- Life and
Letters of Laf	ORGANIZATION	- cadio
Hearn	PERSON	,
1908	DATE	, and Japanese Letters of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	,
1910	DATE
Houghton Mifflin	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		One recalls
Yone Noguchi	PERSON	, the Japanese poet , berating the doc - tor -LRB- in
Lafcadio Hearn	LOCATION	in
Japan Kennerley	LOCATION	;
1911	DATE	-RRB- for making `` such an awful exposure of him - self through
Hearn	PERSON	, '' and taking an incidental dig at
Miss Bisland	LOCATION	.

		And one recalls the clash of opin - ions over whether or not
Hearn	PERSON	intended his letters for publication .

		Here Miss Bisland and
Noguchi	PERSON	were bracketed in the negative , with the opposite opinion voiced by
Gould	PERSON	and
Milton Bronner	PERSON	.

		Ac - cording to
Bronner	PERSON	-LRB- in Letters from the
Raven Brentano	ORGANIZATION	;
1907	DATE	-RRB-
Hearn	PERSON	gave one batch of his returned love letters to his friend
Henry Watkin	PERSON	`` to do with the faded missives what he deemed best . ''

		Miss Bisland countered with : Nothing could have been further from his intention .

		Pub - licity was abhorrent to him in all matters relating to his own personality .

		And had he dreamed that his letters might become famous , they would never have been written .

		You will not find the key to the controversy in Mrs.
Hearn	PERSON	's reminiscences .

		Instead you will find her relating little household incidents with touching simplicity , telling of short excursions together , of what happened at this inn or that temple , of how
Hearn	PERSON	worked and how in a somewhat puzzled , groping way she mothered him and humored him .

		She does not attempt to challenge the
Hearn	PERSON	myth ; she is content to cherish the
Hearn	PERSON	memory .

		Where Dr.
Gould	PERSON	is laboriously intent upon demonstrating that
Hearn	PERSON	really is but an `` echo '' in the world of letters , Mrs.
Hearn	PERSON	is more concerned with other sounds the household noises which might disturb his thoughts .

		She writes : When I wished to enter his study , I chose the time when he was singing or hitting the bowl of his pipe against the hibachi -LRB- bronze bowl of lighted charcoal -RRB- to empty it .

		After we moved to
Okubo	PERSON	, the house was much more spacious and the study was far from the front door and the children 's room , so we made it a world of tranquil - lity without a single noise .

		Even then he complained that I broke his train of thought by opening the bureau drawers , so I made every effort to open the drawers more quietly .

		Where Miss Bisland seeks to explain the `` shy , wild , beautiful spirit '' of
Hearn	PERSON	and to interpret his `` rest - less , passionate , unhappy life , '' Mrs.
Hearn	PERSON	is puz - zled at his interest in cemeteries , patient with his carelessness , and properly firm in those little wifely THE DIAL 615 prerogatives which appear to be quite as inescapable in the Orient as they are in the Occident .

		He cared very little about having his kimono well creased .

		He was not very fastidious .

		He cared for neither a swallow-tailed nor a Prince
Albert	PERSON	coat ... He had one made at last , but he wore it only four or five times .

		Whenever he had to wear it he always made a fuss .

		He would put it on unwillingly , saying , `` I sim - ply wear this to please you .

		Whenever I go out , you always wish me to put on a new suit or a Prince
Albert	PERSON	, all of which I hate .

		This is no joke ; I mean it . ''

		I knew that he did not like it , but I regretfully made him do so .

		He thought that it was my fault that he had to wear them .

		As will be gleaned from this extract , the transla - tion of these reminiscences retains a certain un-Eng - lish flavor , which is not , however , out of harmony with the text .

		It represents the joint efforts of
Paul Kiyoshi Hisada	PERSON	and
Frederick Johnson	PERSON	.

		One of the most delightful passages of the little volume is that in which Mrs.
Hearn	PERSON	sets down a quaint summary of her husband 's tastes and dis - tastes .

		`` Even my own little wife is somewhat mysterious still to me , ''
Hearn	PERSON	confessed in one of his letters .

		One wonders whether he could have succeeded any better than she , had he attempted to list her likes and dislikes in similar fashion : I may name again some things that
Hearn	PERSON	liked ex - tremely : the west , sunsets ,
summer	DATE	, the sea , swimming , banana trees , cryptomerias -LRB- the Japanese cedar -RRB- , lonely cemeteries , insects , `` Kwaidan '' -LRB- ghostly tales -RRB- ,
Urashima	LOCATION	, and
Horai	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- songs -RRB- .

		The places he liked were :
Martinique	LOCATION	,
Matsue	LOCATION	, Miho-no-seki ,
Higosaki	PERSON	, and
Yakizu	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was fond of beefsteak and plum-pudding , and enjoyed smoking .

		He disliked liars , abuse of the weak , Prince
Albert	PERSON	coats , white shirts , the City of
New York	LOCATION	, and many other things .

		One of his pleasures was to wear the yukada in his study and listen quietly to the voice of the locust .

		Perhaps I shall not succeed in concealing an ulterior motive in withdrawing unobtrusively at this point , resisting a temptation to linger upon that last note .

		As a sedative for the jumping nerves of con - troversy , one is grateful for Mrs.
Hearn	PERSON	's reminis - cences .

		The commentators might not altogether without profit to themselves have `` listened quietly to the voice of the locust . ''

		T , ,
LISLE	LOCATION	BELL .


Norman Duncan	PERSON	I ORMAN
DUNCAN	PERSON	is perhaps not better described than in the words of his own
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	, who claimed for himself the title of `` skilful teller of tales , '' though not of such tales as he thought were wanted by the `` gentlefolk to the s ` uth ` ard , '' who `` must have love and be charmed with great deeds in its satisfaction '' ; he prided himself on his ability to entertain `` the lowly of our coast , with the fore - castle bogie warm of a windy night or us all settled afore a kitchen
fif %	PERCENT	in a cottage ashore . ''

		Perhaps it is only a quarrel in words , but
Norman Duncan	PERSON	seems hardly a story-teller as we should understand the term now ; possibly he might even convince us that we have ceased to understand the term .

		We are accustomed to speak a good deal of
Dumas	PERSON	, of
Stevenson	PERSON	, of
Maupassant	LOCATION	, in this connection ; to
Dumas	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	, especially , we append the title of `` born '' story-teller ; and the host of Maupas - sant 's followers seems to fix as his the province of the short-story .

		But
Norman Duncan	PERSON	can hardly be said to have had the narrative perenniality of
Dumas	LOCATION	; and if he was as alert , he was not so agile and so -LRB- often -RRB- unnecessarily accomplished as
Stevenson	PERSON	; moreover his stories , though they are not long , are quite un - like the short crafty bursts of Maupassant .

		The distinctive trait of
Harbor Tales Down North	ORGANIZATION	and of Battles Royal Down North -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	each -RRB- seems rather to be a sort of intimate oral quality , which is both robust and refined , and which carries us almost back to
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		The volume of Harbor Tales is ended by four stories told in the person of
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	, clerk of the Quick as Wink tales in which this quality , word-of-mouth intimacy , lives at its utmost .

		For instance : ``
Tim Mull	PERSON	was fair dogged by the children of
Tinkle Tickle	ORGANIZATION	in his bachelor days .

		There was that about ` un , somehow , in eyes or voice , t ` win the love of kids , dogs and grandmothers . '

		I likes t * have un t ` come fme .

		Why , damme , they uplift the soul of a bachelor man like me !

		I loves un . ' ''

		` You 'll be havin ' a crew o ' your own some day , ' says
Tom Blot	PERSON	, ` and you 'll not be so fond o ' the company . ' ''

		Til ship all the Lord sends . ' ''

		` Oh-ha b ` y , ' chuckles Tom , ` He 've a wonderful store of little souls up aloft . ' ''

		` Then , ' says
Tim	PERSON	, Til thank un t ' be lavish . ' ''

		And throughout indeed
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	's narrative has an excellent plain chimney-corner relish .

		In fact all of
Norman Duncan	PERSON	's stories in the first person succeed especially in leaving the impression that they have been heard and not read .

		The history of
The Little Nipper	ORGANIZATION	o ' .

		Hide an ' Seek Harbor ,
Sammy Scull	PERSON	, whose father was hanged when
Sammy	PERSON	was three years old , is in several respects one of
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	's best efforts .

		And at the same time , though this may be by accident , it is of all the tales in the two volumes the most oral and simply heart to heart .

		The idea of little
Sammy Scull	PERSON	's moral isolation is obviously open to meditative and psychological development , and as a matter of fact there is in the tale not only a fine 6i6 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	unexploited pathos but a suggestion here and there of something meditative .

		It is only a suggestion however , and taken in the large the tale is clearly fireside and anecdotal in its point of view .

		The following from A
Madonna of Tinkle Tickle	ORGANIZATION	is an example of
Duncan	ORGANIZATION	's psychology : `` When
Tim Mull	PERSON	came aboard , I was fair aghast .

		Never before had he looked so woe-begone .

		Red eyes peerin ' out from two black caves , face all screwed with anxious thought .

		He made me think of a fish thief , some - how , with a constable comin ' down the wind .

		He 'd lost his ease and was full of sighs and starts .

		And there was no health in his voice .

		` Sin on his soul , ' thinks I , ` he dwells in black weather . ' ''

		This is fairly representative ; but if it is psychology it is of a relatively simple and scriptural sort .

		And if he sank no very profound shafts into men - tal complexities , neither did he aim to impart a great fund of philosophy or of social induction , or to paint any very elaborate portraits of manners .

		And he did not attempt a great deal with natural panorama , especially if we consider the necessary prominence of such a matter in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		The sea is there in
Harbor Tales	LOCATION	and Battles Royal ; it is not poorly there .

		So is the ice ; so is the tim - ber ; so is the vast wilderness which , since the days of
Jack London	PERSON	, has furnished so long a loaf for the public appetite .

		But in these fields -LRB- in which , by the way , any qualities of intimacy which narrative might have are easily lost -RRB- one feels there is too competent competition .

		After all , we find Nor - man
Duncan	PERSON	somewhat matter-of-fact on such points , evidently caring more particularly for the `` warm and human little glimmers in the dark the cottage lights ashore . ''

		It is really in a corner of the cottage kitchen , or on the fo ` castle of a `` banker , '' as with
Synge	PERSON	it was over the tap room of an Irish hostelry , that we find our author at the key of his deserving .

		`` Small
Sam Small	PERSON	that 's me an ' I stands by !

		I 'm a damned mean man , an ' I is n't unaware ; but they is n't a man on the St.
John	PERSON	's waterside can say to me , ` Do this this , ye bay-noddie ! '

		or , ` Sign this , ye coast 's whelp ! '

		Still an ' all ,
Tumm	PERSON	, I do n't like myself very much , an ' I is n't fond o ' the company o ' the soul my soul 's become . ''

		Rough cloth , but pretty stout and genuine .

		The Harbor Tales , in especial , lead one to believe that
Norman Duncan	PERSON	had a sound intimacy with plain souls and a strong home feeling for essential human meanings .

		There is something satisfying , both spiced and substantial , like gingerbread , about Hard
Harry Hull	PERSON	and Tommy Lark and
Tim Mull	PERSON	and
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	and
Toot Toot Toby	ORGANIZATION	.

		For one thing , they are universally alive lusty , open as daylight , somewhat quaint at the outset and growing quainter as they progress toward `` ol' codgerdom . ''

		Perhaps it is with such quaint old fellows they are not really old , though that the word-of-mouth , chimney-corner kind of narrative most comes into its own .

		Quaintness is not universally appreciated ; its charm is not always readily conveyed .

		The quaint are often unregarded , because they are often confused with the dowdy .

		They are held to be old - fashioned , as indeed they usually are .

		But although they are not especially distinguished , they are re - warding ; for under no circumstances can they be neutral , and under no circumstances are they vulgar .

		Distinctness is of their quality .

		And really in this warm and heart-to-heart way of setting them out , these stout fellows of the ice floes and sealing fleets are nothing if not distinct .

		Yet in our emphasis upon
Norman Duncan	PERSON	's simplicity and intimacy there should not be forgotten the sensitiveness and tact which inform and give temper to such qualities and underline his volumes as something rather more than books of `` stories . ''

		It is his excellence of touch , I think , which has led to the claim for him that he was a writer of great emotional range .

		As a matter of fact the impression finally gained from these volumes is less that he possessed great emotional range than that he had great soundness within his range .

		His range was masculine , though it would be clearly absurd to hold that his appreciation of women was not delicate or just .

		The fact is obvious however that his women are a good deal absent from the scene and some - thing of the secondary order of consideration when present .

		It is really only in two stories of the pres - ent two volumes that women may be said to be there .


Peggy Lacey	PERSON	, it is true , is the primary and only consideration of The Siren of Scalawag Run ; she is also a young woman the executed truth of whose character carries conviction .

		Yet , after all , one 's net impression in this tale is that the whole thing is a rather chivalrous and masculine compli - ment to the sex .

		Again , in A
Madonna of Tinkle Tickle	ORGANIZATION	, the reader is troubled somewhat to decide whether the story is most about
Mary Mull	PERSON	and her Old Testament self-respect or about
Tim Mull	PERSON	; there is no trouble however in deciding which of these two is the most done by .

		To cite
Norman Duncan	PERSON	's women as examples of a power of imaginative projection is really , I think , unjust praise ; they are rather to be held as good in virtue of their author 's excellent perception .

		And of this and of his sensitive temperament there is continuous evidence .

		Read or rather hear
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	: `` Afore we had time or cause for complaint o ' the botheration o ' childish company , we was involved in a brisk passage o ' talk , which was no trouble at all , but sped on an ' engaged us without pause .

		There was that about the wee lad , too , as a man sometimes encounters , t ' command our interest an ' to compel our ears an ' our tongues t ' their labor . ''

		1918 THE DIAL 617 This is to recognize some several strands of fineness in the `` ol' codger 's '' warm and woolen colloquiality .

		Yet this tale spinning is really so well done that we are unsuspicious of any other presence in the chimney corner ; only old
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	seems to hold the skein , and it is apparently only plain Newf ` un ` land yarn after all .

		But we grow curious presently if we are alive to our author 's qualities and turning to the stories told in the third person we find a closer weave and less of the russet warmth of
Tobias Tumm	PERSON	's method ; but we find still a fine word-of - mouth prose which becomes less colloquial only to become more literary , and always remains oral in its straightness .

		It is rather more succinct and syntac - tically terse than graceful ; yet it is never angular , and it is continually refreshing the parched reader with a various good taste in idiom .

		Like good prose it does not exhibit its writer 's total power of phrase ; and the restraint that so trained its spirits down should do something to recommend it per - manence .

		I do not mean that I dread it or look forward to it with apprehension .

		I do mean that I and others are possessed by uncertainty that it usurps the place of other and more definite thoughts , and that the business of life is hindered , or even sus - pended , until we know the event .

		I suppose most of my compatriots are in the same condition ; but I will not pretend to the power of reading their thoughts .

		Perhaps a man who closely observed the crowds in the
London	LOCATION	streets when war was threatened and again now , and who was able to understand what he saw , would be able also to interpret in a brief page the soul of the English race .

		But this too is past my powers of impudence to pretend to .

		I can only set down what I have seen and leave the interpretation to others .

		We are conscious now of the issues that have been at stake as , I am sure , we were not conscious four years ago .

		But though then we did not clearly understand what was happening neither what we were fighting for nor the effort it would cost us we were vaguely aware of something tremendous beyond the power of expression .

		But , then as now , we showed no signs of overmastering excitement .

		There was in the streets , in trains and busses and theatres one could feel it a faint nervous tension , a slight constant uneasiness which was so universal that it formed a sort of connecting thread between the most dissimilar and unlikely people ; and along this thread there ran from time to time vague , weak shocks of active excitement as a rumor spread or , perhaps , as someone in the gathering saw with more than usual concreteness what this meant to him .

		I feel again today that slight tension and no more .

		A few days ago a false but convincing rumor that the armistice had been signed went round and was gen - erally believed .

		I was in the streets at the time and can testify that no one shouted , no one sang , no one waved a flag .

		The public houses were all closed and we were balked of our customary method of expressing pleasure .

		Mr.
Kingsway	PERSON	, a news - paper seller , had chalked on the pavement : `` Armis - tice Signed Official , '' and a crowd had gathered round the announcement , staring at it silently .

		An old gentleman , behind whom I was walking , craned over the shoulders of the crowd , read the announce - ment , which apparently was news to him , and re - marking to no one in particular , `` Armistice signed .

		Humph ! ''

		walked on at the same gait as before .

		Of course it is always unsafe to argue from one par - ticular to the general , and this remark , in this old gentleman , may have betokened to those who know him a high degree of excitement .

		His behavior seemed to me however to be typical .

		Whatever we may individually be feeling , we have ourselves in hand .

		I do not know why , but just as we did not burst into ferocious war-spirit when war was de - clared , so now we show no tendency to burst into jubilation at its close though of course we may actually do so when the event is beyond question .

		And , as I read over again what I have written , I too seem to myself to be typical .

		I protest that I have written with calm and with all the precision of which I am normally capable , that in treating this immense subject I have used all my customery care in the placing of my adverbs but I have writ - ten because a slight unease keeps the matter in my mind and forbids me to write on anything else until it is satisfied .

		Meanwhile we are chiefly , I think , to occupy our thoughts concerning ourselves with vast fantastic plans for private and public reconstruction .

		These plans , so far as literature is concerned , are confined to the two words more paper !

		Give us more 6i8 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	paper , say authors and editors and publishers alike , and we will take care of literature .

		Give us more paper and our share in the millennium will be car - ried out with our usual dispatch and adequacy .

		There is hardly any other trade or profession which is not crying out for some kind of assistance or protection or bounty .

		Literature alone modestly asks the liberty to propagate itself indefinitely .

		This seems to show that literature is in a strong position , secure in the appetites of the public , a thing in - dispensable , however empires may rise or fall or be changed .

		And perhaps it is so .

		Literature is one and indivisible .

		The author of the penny blood is my equal and my brother ; and we are both , if we remember and can afford to pay our subscriptions , members of the
Union of Ink-Slingers	ORGANIZATION	, a body well instructed on contracts and royalties .

		We are at all events at one in one thing , in repudiating the assistance of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		We see too clearly what
State	ORGANIZATION	interference has done in the matter of painting , how a Royal Charter forever set the seal of futility on the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	and how endowment and control work in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	and the
Tate Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		When recently the pictures of Degas were sold in
Paris	LOCATION	our author - ities raised the magnificent sum of
3000	DATE	for the purchase of some specimens for
London	LOCATION	; and , it has been rumored , an envoy was dispatched with the instruction that he was to purchase no nudes and no ballet scenes .

		We wonder sometimes what would happen to literature if
the State	ORGANIZATION	were to take a hand beyond its N present distribution of knighthoods which fall alike on the just and the unjust , but which are commonly refused by the former and its distribution of Civil List pensions , which also fall on both but which are , on the contrary , ac - cepted by both with the same avidity .

		It does oc - casionally happen that someone calls for an academy or something of the kind which will organize us and declare with authority how we are to name a man who drives an aeroplane ; but he is instantly , I am glad to say , howled down .

		We are not authori - tarians , the right of private judgment is in our blood ; and , for myself , I own that though some time ago a strong committee of professors and such like solemnly consecrated the word `` Suffragette '' it still grates on my nerves like a nail on glass .

		We have , it is true , an `` Academic Committee , '' oddly enough composed , but it preserves itself from obloquy by meeting in secret and not announcing its decisions .

		The French Academy is not a body which commands enormous reverence in its own country , but it does command some and the best authors do still care to be elected to it and do still announce the fact on the covers of their books .

		It does still provide a sort of central steadying point for French literature and , if it does no more , it at least sym - bolizes that order and maintenance of a standard which is the peculiar glory of French criticism .

		But much as I should like to see a reformation of our criticism on those lines , I admit willingly that no Academy will ever take root in
England	LOCATION	.

		Our blood is against it .

		We have not the Latin taste for organization ; and this is a fact which has been discovered not only by the advocates of Academies but also by the young persons who have striven to be Bohemian and disorderly and live the life of the Quartier Latin on strictly regulated lines .

		Why , if we were capable of such organization , we should in our new enthusiasm for poetry have elected a Prince des Poetes , an unofficial chief to whom we should all pay reverence ; and indeed it would be very amusing if such an institution were introduced .

		The French method , I think , is to allow every poet a vote ; and they have election campaigns and pro- paganda and canvassing , and the literary papers echo with the noise .

		The first holder of the post was
Stephane Mallarme	PERSON	; the second ,
Leon Dierx	PERSON	-LRB- you will ask , and you may well ask , who the devil was he ? -RRB-

		; and now it is
Paul Fort	LOCATION	.

		I can imagine the whole business being immensely entertaining in
England	LOCATION	.

		My mind 's eye discerns the rival poets on the stump , and I can hear engaging fragments of their speeches .

		But my mind 's eye does not reveal to me the person who would be elected .

		My own vote , of course , would be cast for .

		But what am I writing ?

		I am seeking to distract my mind from the thoughts that perplex us all , from thoughts of
Senlis	LOCATION	-LRB- if the conference is really being held there or perhaps it is Pontarme -RRB- and of
Spa	ORGANIZATION	, of revolutions in
Berlin	LOCATION	and republics in
Bavaria	LOCATION	.

		All I have written is a feverish making of conversa - tion ; but between the lines perhaps you can find a faithful picture of the English mind today .

		We are all thinking of after the war ; and that will per - haps be tomorrow .

		But that tomorrow is so dim and formless that we can not speak of it intelligently ; we can only abandon ourselves to vague dreams .

		A distinguished leader of the
Alliance	ORGANIZATION	said recently to a friend of mine : `` La vie sera bien plate , quand il n ' y a plus de guerre . ''

		But how splendid it will be to lead a dull life !

		How dull and heavy and solemn we shall all be and how we shall all enjoy it !

		My next letter will perhaps deal with the progress of English metaphysics in the twentieth century , or the economic aspects of Parliamentary Reform , or the novels of
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		Time will then be standing still and there will be time enough for everything .

		THE DIAL
CLARENCE BRITTEN JOHN DEWEY GEORGE DONLIN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MAROT	PERSON	WHAT is THE BEST CRITERION OF DEMOCRATIC government ?

		In a political sense , surely it is the measure of control exercised by the people of a na - tion over that nation 's foreign policy .

		Ultimately it comes down to that .

		Yet until the
United States	LOCATION	entered the present war we illustrated the truth of this thesis less sharply and less persuasively than any other country .

		The reason for that was compara - tively simple : our
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, our isolation tradition , and our lack of large colonial possessions and dependencies all combined to make our foreign policy of less immediate practical concern to the average citizen than was the case in crowded
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean countries , where a quarrel in a
Vienna	LOCATION	cafe might mean the plunging of several nations into military adventure .

		The possibilities for any large-scale war seemed remote from us , and it was difficult to arouse any interest in interna - tional affairs .

		Today , of course , the historical position of the
United States	LOCATION	is completely reversed .

		We do not need to ring the changes on the platitudes of interdependence in the modern world .

		We do not need to be told any longer that the decision of a few business men in
Siberja	LOCATION	may mean that the
Kansas	LOCATION	farmer boy will find a soldier 's grave in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		We know that today we are living in that kind of a world .

		Consciousness of the actual situa - tion is , on the whole , alert .

		But with our inveterate American optimism and habit of worshiping our governmental institutions blindly , we have almost completely ignored the fact that in this new world we are employing the same old technique of foreign policy which characterized us when we were a pro- vincial , detached , and non-militaristic nation .

		We have no right to demand `` open diplomacy '' of other nations until we ourselves have shown that we have at least a kindergarten notion of what it implies .

		Public opinion needs to be aroused upon this more than upon almost any other point .

		Suppose that throughout the length and breadth of the land arose a spontaneous demand for a certain policy .

		If it were a domestic policy there would be some chance of its sooner or later being adopted .

		If it were a foreign policy how could that demand possibly be translated into action ?

		And further , how is the generation of any clear-cut and spontaneous demand for a certain line of policy in foreign affairs ever possible when all the sources of information are kept secret ?

		From official sources we know little of the situation in
Russia	LOCATION	; we know less of the situa - tion in
China	LOCATION	and
Manchuria	LOCATION	; we know even less about
Mexico	LOCATION	and
South America	LOCATION	.

		And where are we to find out ?

		The Secretary of State can not be questioned in open session of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	: he is re - sponsible only to the President .

		Nominally only
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has the legal right to declare war .

		Yet it is virtually a nominal right alone .

		The President can always jockey affairs so that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is prac - tically forced to ratify whatever policy he proposes .

		At this moment our men are fighting in
Russia	LOCATION	with no declaration of war by either side .

		Tomorrow , it is urged , hundreds of thousands more ought to be by their side , although it occurs to nobody that a resolution to that effect needs to be placed before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Treaties have to be ratified by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet here again it is virtually a nominal right alone .

		Gentlemen 's agreements between foreign diplomats and our Secretary of State do not , seem - ingly , even have to be shown to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Trading corporations can be formed and given assurances by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	without a single Congressman 's knowing anything about it ^ unless he happens ' to be a member of one of the favored firms or a lobbyist for it .

		From what clear mandate of the people , for instance , does the
War Trade Board	ORGANIZATION	derive its authority to say -LRB- in a news dispatch from Wash - ington -RRB- that `` as rapidly as the
Army of Occupation	ORGANIZATION	advances and the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	are driven back , an intensified campaign will be carried on to develop the railroad facilities and help the people to get on their feet '' ?

		From what legal expression of the will of the majority of our people do our Generals in German cities derive their right to recognize only certain authorities and to refuse to recognize others ?

		Who of us will ever have a chance to vote on a single one of the peace conditions now being drawn up ?

		What means have we for assuring ourselves that we shall even know what all those conditions are ?

		In a word , our conduct of our foreign policy is in working fact , if not in form , as irresponsible as that o ' f any autocracy or monarchy .

		In fact , if not in form , it is still being determined for us behind our backs , and without our knowledge or consent , by a small clique of persons .

		Measured , then , by the severe criterion of the conduct of foreign policy , the
United States	LOCATION	has still to go to school to learn democracy .

		62O THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	AN IMPORTANT BY-PRODUCT OF THE VICTORIOUS solution of the war will be the restoration of the Holy Land to the Jews .

		The spiritual reaction to that restoration may not be immediate , so far as Yiddish and Hebraic literature are concerned , but few can doubt that it will take place .

		Spiritual reactions of this nature are not quick to reveal them - selves in enduring artistic forms .

		It is usual , of course , for a certain type of journalist to see in every war an immediate generator of great works of art .

		Similarly there is no little talk about a renaissance of Yiddish literature during this important period .

		That renaissance however is one of interest rather than of actual production .

		The past dozen years have witnessed the appearance of truly representa - tive , and in some cases universal , work by Yiddish authors .

		Much of this work , and especially the best of it , has either languished in neglect or else has found favor with no more than a cultivated few whenever the few could shake themselves free of the factionalism that is so rife on
East Broadway	LOCATION	, the Yiddish newspaper row .

		Sooner than the produc - tion of new masterpieces , one looks to an awakening of interest in those already at hand .

		Readers will find new meanings in poets like Raisin ,
Rosenfeld	PERSON	, and
Bloomgarden	PERSON	-LRB- `` Yehoash '' -RRB- ; they will discover new beauties in dramatists like
Pinski	PERSON	,
Hirschbein	LOCATION	, Ash , and
Kobrin	PERSON	; they will perhaps sift the wheat from the chaff in their crop of new writers .

		These new writers , , by the way , deserve consideration apart .

		They are as interesting a `` new '' group as any country can show today .

		They have all the egotism and idiosyncrasy that youth so easily mistakes for originality , but they have not a little of the sub - stance too .

		Writers of tales like Opatovsky ,
Ignatov	LOCATION	, and
Raboi	PERSON	, for example , show that the Yiddish tra - dition still lives if that may be called a tradition which really originated little more than a half - century ago as far as the artistic use of language is concerned .

		Similarly the new poets young men and women of broad outlook and high ideals , though they display a certain scorn for their predecessors which is by no means necessary and doubtless un - deserved are surely looking forward .

		Some would say that they had overleaped the boundaries of nationality : the same criticism was long ago brought against
Pinski	PERSON	and Ash by a noted
Russo	PERSON	- Yiddish critic .

		Is this however so strange in Jewish writers , who come from a nation upon which inter - nationality has been forced ?

		Others , indeed , would see in this very quality a virtue rather than a defect .

		Still others would find it easy to reconcile the apparent contradiction , saying that this war has taught that a certain type of nationalism is by no means inconsistent with internationalism .

		Even among the Jews there are readers who imagine that to be national a writer must always be talking about Palestine , the Holy Scroll , and other easy tokens of a combined feeling for religion and for political in - dependence .

		After all , nationality in literature is quite as subtle in its manifestations as in music , and in both these arts many of us are much deceived in detecting its presence .

		The future of Yiddish liter - ature is bound up with more than one problem that other nations do not have to face .

		The very language is in the balance .

		In its short literary life it has had to struggle for very existence against Jews that despised it as a menial jargon .

		Not even the beauty of which masters like Ash ,
Hirschbein	PERSON	,
Kobrin	PERSON	, and
Pinski	PERSON	have shown it capable has reconciled them .

		The battle between the Hebrew - ists and the Yiddishists goes merrily on , and ink flows as freely in the columns as blood but lately did on the battlefields of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Prophets of the death of Yiddish have been busy for many years .

		Their arguments are philologically sound , yet Yid - dish does not die .

		Prophecies are futile , but it is hard to see a literary future for Yiddish .

		The new generations rush to universal culture , adopting the greater tongues .

		They are as little familiar , on the whole , with the great Yiddish writers as their elders are able to appreciate those writers .

		These are not precisely the conditions for a renaissance in national letters , yet so contradictory has been the entire de - velopment of Yiddish literature that the unexpected may happen .

		At any rate a deepened interest in the treasures already at hand will in itself be a renaissance of no little value .

		AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT FROM TOKIO STATES that the Japanese Cabinet has decided upon the return of Kiaochow to
China	LOCATION	and that
Japan	LOCATION	's delegates to the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	have been in - structed to support President
Wilson	PERSON	's plan for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, especially as regards reduction of armaments , and to couple this support with a plea for the abolition of racial discrimination .

		Whatever the facts , certainly there is nothing in - herently unplausible in the report .

		Thoughtful Japanese have been much impressed by the showing of the
United States	LOCATION	in the war : many are now convinced that general initiative and industrial vigor are the most important things in military prepared - ness , and that preparedness of the old type is out of date .

		Industrial and commercial strength have been shown to be more important than drilled battalions .

		But the direction such a friendly alliance between ourselves and
Japan	LOCATION	would most likely take is not precisely the democratic direction .

		Political or mili - tary control is irrelevant where commercial su - premacy obtains .

		Already , according to reports from
Vladivostok	LOCATION	, our military commanders in
Siberia	LOCATION	are cooperating with the Japanese military commanders in perfect understanding , and this co - operation has also resulted in a unity of American and Japanese commercial policy respecting
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		It would be folly not to recognize what this com - mercial unity implies .

		It implies that we are perfectly willing to keep the East weak , if by so doing we can strike good bargains in concessions or
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 62 1 in guaranteed exchanges of valuable raw materials for our manufactured goods .

		It is the kind of game
Japan	LOCATION	has been playing in
China	LOCATION	for some years ; seemingly it is the kind of game we are now going to cooperate with her in playing in
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		Surely we might have learned some other lesson from this war .

		Fundamentally the world war itself was the penalty Western nations inevitably paid for keeping the East weak .

		Instead of trying to abandon that policy we seem to be about to extend it .

		Formerly
Africa	LOCATION	, the Near East ,
China	LOCATION	, and
India	LOCATION	constituted the arenas of friction , the stakes for which diplomacy played .

		Are we going now to extend the arenas of friction to include large sections of what used to be the great Russian Empire ?

		If we do , then we are only preparing the way for another and greater war .

		Unless the exploitative motive is completely excised from this commercial policy towards the East we shall sooner or later fall to quarreling over the spoils .

		When greed is the dominant motive , alliances have a curious habit of becoming easily strained .

		The truth is we stand at the parting of the ways , and our present implied policy towards the East is only one part of a larger problem which is involved in the whole
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	idea .

		Is there enough good will in the world to change the attitude of strong nations to - wards the weak ?

		We can , if we like , follow the traditional method of exploiting peoples weaker than ourselves .

		Or we can , if we have learned the lesson of this war , attempt to bring to weaker peoples a fuller measure of democratic life , attempt to help them to self-control and self-direction .

		If we follow the latter method , the war will have been really won .

		If we follow the first , and organize a league of rentier nations to control the exploitable and weak nations , sooner or later a new international war will develop .

		Sooner or later the West will again pay its bloody price for keeping the East weak .

		\ VHEN THIS COPY OF THE DIAL REACHES ITS subscribers the results of the British election will be known .

		For that reason this quotation from a pri - vate letter of a marine stoker , a member of the
Seaman 's International Union of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	, has special pertinence .

		It reflects the increasing skepti - cism of all form of parliamentarianism , particularly among the English workers : It would n't be so unpleasant if the election had been handicapped for capable men , but it seems that our most able representatives either were neglected deliberately by an official caucus or they had no desire to become Parliamentarians .


Henderson	PERSON	has improved but still I doubt him , and I wish he 'd cut out the dramatic stuff at conferences ... The great and unforgivable fault with all our leaders is the statesman `` bug . ''

		They are far more apt to do and say things which are `` statesmanlike '' than to .

		undertake or utter things which are just common sense .

		They are all af - flicted in this way , from
Snowden	PERSON	and
McDonald	ORGANIZATION	down to
Thomas	PERSON	and
Adamson	PERSON	.

		It is
Parliament	LOCATION	apparently which has this peculiar psychological effect upon its members , and there is little to wonder at .

		The atmos - phere of St.
Stephens	PERSON	is redolent of unreality and one can float away in fancy to the sixteenth century without an effort .

		If I were a member of a Labor majority my first motion would be to transfer the meetings of Parlia - ment to the nearest saloon .

		That would be a most beneficial revolution .

		To return to the chances of a Labor government in the near future , there is consider - able optimism in some quarters but I do n't share it .

		In a way , I hope Labor does n't secure the reins of power .

		Such a happening , I know , would be hailed with glee by
Lloyd George	PERSON	and his cronies , who could unburden them - selves of the extremely delicate tasks which will follow the cessation of hostilities and the demobilization of the army , and with the aid of
Northcliffe and Co.	ORGANIZATION	could manufacture endless trouble and so compromise the
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	as to make its continuance in office impos - sible .

		For my part , I am content to proceed with in - dustrial organization .

		Strikes large and small are daily occurrences here but there is seldom a big principle involved .

		Bread and butter upheavals leave one cold .

		1HE TECHNIQUE OF THE HUMOROUS MOVING picture is sadly underdeveloped .

		We have watched with growing concern the standardization of the main humorous event in the so-called comedy films that is , the hitting of a man over the head .

		The technique of the wallop is susceptible of great varia - tion : in the early days of moving pictures any soft and expansive substance , like a pumpkin pie or dis - sipated egg , was considered the proper implement of assault .

		Crockery , too , tickled our suppressed destructive impulses ; to see a plaster of
Paris	LOCATION	statue of the
Venus de Milo	PERSON	shatter into bits over some trained and disciplined head was a highly entertain - ing and gratifying spectacle .

		But the era of thrown bric-a-brac and of resounding whacks quickly passed .

		We have entered upon a new period , where the mallet and the hammer have usurped the place of the ancient weapons .

		Practically no comedy film today is complete without one or two cases of some - body 's being hit over the head with a gigantic mallet , the victim thereupon fainting in a direct perpendicular line .

		This of course is a highly pleas - ing spectacle , and we should be the last to ask for its withdrawal on the ground that it injures the morals of youth .

		But we complain bitterly of the conventionalization of assault which has made our comedy films so rigid in structure and so impervious to the influence of new styles of humor .

		We ask of ` moving-picture producers that they devise some new styles of assault and battery , some new ways of injur - ing the human body .

		We realize that people can not be drawn and quartered or burned at the stake in our films , for it is a condition of all comedy assault that the battered person be able at a moment 's notice to resume complete possession of his limbs and his faculties .

		But it is a pity that the makers of our comedy films are not gifted with more flexible imaginations .

		Vicarious assault , which has delighted the human race since the stone age , will and must be upheld in its full dignity in our moving pictures , and it is indeed lamentable when the technique of its presentation gets into a rut .

		622 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	Foreign Comment LIBERAL
BRITAIN	LOCATION	AGAINST RUSSIAN INTERVENTION
Great Britain	LOCATION	, who is more deeply involved than are we in military intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	, is not of a single mind on the subject .

		Liberal opinion unani - mously opposes it .

		The Daily Chronicle in an article published
December 18	DATE	says : `` The situation in
Russia	LOCATION	is causing great anxiety in official circles . ''

		The article then goes on to point out that no reliable information is being obtained about
Russia	LOCATION	, that the censorship and irregularity of the cables and wireless service make it impossible to accept any news as authentic unless it is two months old .

		The most reliable information puts the number -LSB- of the
Bolshevik Red Army	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- at about 180,000 scattered all over the former
Russian Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is , however , a prob - ability that an attempt will be made to increase this force with a view to the invasion of other parts of
Europe	LOCATION	in order to spread the principles of Bolshevism .

		It should be remembered that
Poland	LOCATION	is now in a very disturbed state and almost defenseless .

		There would , therefore , be little difficulty in the way of force of the Bolsheviki marching into
Germany	LOCATION	, in which country a large amount of propaganda work has been carried on during - the past year ... Nor is it easy to say offhand what should be done to counteract this menace .

		The late elections have revealed in some parts of the coufrlry a considerable amount of sympathy with the
Bolshevist Government	ORGANIZATION	in
Russia	LOCATION	, and it is certain that intervention by the Allies on a large scale would be hotly debated and criticized .

		It is fortunate that President
Wilson	PERSON	is now in
Europe	LOCATION	so that this important matter can be discussed by all the Allies .

		It would be advantageous if some line of policy could be decided upon by other nations in common so that the problem could be jointly tackled .

		In its issue of
December 17	DATE	the Manchester Guardian takes an even firmer position .

		It states that Admiral
Kolchak	PERSON	, who seized control of the
Omsk Government	ORGANIZATION	, and
Semenoff	PERSON	, the Cossack leader , were fighting `` not for
Russia	LOCATION	and still less for the Allies , but for their own hands . ''

		It adds a warning : Even now drafts of British troops , men who volunteered to fight the Germans and defend liberty , are being or - dered out to
Siberia	LOCATION	to fight the battles of Koltchaks and Semenoffs .

		If the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	does not stop this disgraceful adventure of its own accord it will find it will soon be stopped for it .

		Even the
Westminster Gazette	ORGANIZATION	, hitherto a sup - porter of intervention , is now anxious .

		about Eng - land 's commitments in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is afraid
England	LOCATION	may drift into a `` series of costly , chronic and indecisive expeditions in various parts of
Russia	LOCATION	, or at best to permanent occupation , with large bodies of troops , of the various Russian provinces . ''

		It goes on to state that the Allies have hitherto banked on the probability that the Bol - shevist regime would be short-lived and another admin - istration would come on the scene with which they could deal rationally and settle up the whole entanglement ; but after fourteen months they must at least reckon with the possibility that Bolshevism will in some form be perma - nent in
Russia	LOCATION	and make up their minds what they are going to do if that proves to be the case .

		KERENSKY DISILLUSIONED Late last
summer	DATE	Kerensky applied to the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	for a passport back to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It was refused .

		The following extract from a personal letter written by him furnishes further explanation of this extraordinary refusal : Having done all in my power to carry out my task here , and being further convinced by some rather sig - nificant symptoms that my further stay in the Allied countries would be useless , I therefore determined to return immediately to my own country , and at the end of
August	DATE	I applied to the British authorities to grant me facilities to do so , as without such help it was at present impossible to reach that part of
Russia	LOCATION	which is freed from the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	and the Germans .

		However , after having exchanged a few letters with the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, on
September 10	DATE	I received a communication stating , among other things , that the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	is unable to comply with my request , as it does not see its way to do for me anything it is not prepared to do for the representatives of other groups and parties , for the reason that the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	does not consider it possible to deviate from their `` declared determination not to interfere in the internal politics of
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		It is rather a peculiar and exceedingly liberal way of inter - preting the principle of non-interference in internal af - fairs which renders impossible the return to
Russia	LOCATION	of a man who only came to an Allied country with a special
National Mission	ORGANIZATION	and is bound , as a member of the Con - stituent Assembly , to return to
Ufa	LOCATION	in order to participate in the work of the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	created by the very coalition whose interests he came to defend .

		This peculiar interpretation of the principle of non-interference has since been so vividly illustrated that Kerensky in a recent interview speaks with considerable bitterness of Allied policy towards
Russia	LOCATION	.

		He states :
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	are seeking to impose another Brest-Litovsk upon
Russia	LOCATION	.

		I ask
America	LOCATION	, as paralyzed
Russia	LOCATION	's true friend , to protect her from exploitation by her former allies .


Russia	LOCATION	fought three years for the Allies .

		It was due to her that
America	LOCATION	had time to pre - pare and administer the knockout blow .

		Now the Allies ought to deal honestly with
Russia	LOCATION	.

		When the Russian people , despite the Brest-Litovsk treaty , were continuing their fight , they called upon the Allies for military aid .

		This help rapidly developed into an organized attempt to exploit
Russia	LOCATION	's wealth , and cut off
Russia	LOCATION	from
Europe	LOCATION	by a barrier of tiny quasi-independent states .

		Thus , they are completing the treaty of Brest-Litovsk , which Ger - many began .

		The peace conference ought to guarantee the integrity of Russian territory , as it was before Brest-Litovsk , affording the opportunity for a real solution of her prob - lems .

		This could be brought about by the formation of a confederation like
America	LOCATION	, of all the Russian states .

		The balance is com - posed of independent states , which have thrown off the Bolsheviks ' authority .

		I believe it is possible to call a general election for a constituent assembly , to include delegates from every part of

		England and

		Communications POLITICAL PRISONERS IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	SIR : Your editorial on amnesty to political pris - oners in the
November 30	DATE	issue of THE DIAL gives me hope that perhaps you will print a letter telling of the present status of conscientious objectors in the prisons of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		As a minister of the Gospel , believing in the hope of social progress through enlightenment by individual conscience , I have followed the history of conscientious objection with some care .

		I beg to submit the following facts which I think can be proved : When the armistice was signed , conscientious ob - jectors roughly fell into the following groups : 1 .

		Those who had accepted non-combatant service in the army , perhaps 4,000 men in all .

		2 .

		Those who had accepted farm furlough or fur - loughs for work in the
Friends ' Reconstruction Unit	ORGANIZATION	, after their cases had been passed upon favorably by the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		These men numbered roughly some 1,000 or 1,200 .

		They were under military control , but were furloughed from the army and did not wear uniform .

		3 .

		Men still held in camp pending hearing before the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few of these men were in guardhouse awaiting ultimate trial by court - martial .

		4 .

		Men sentenced to military prisons .

		Secretary
Baker	PERSON	's demobilization order apparently provided for all but this last group , and so the numerous unsolved problems connected with the third group more or less disappear .

		The fourth group , comprising conscientious ob - jectors in prison , is at present mainly located at the
Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks	LOCATION	, where there are about 280 of these men .

		A few are at the
Fort Jay Disciplinary Barracks	ORGANIZATION	on
Governors Island	LOCATION	, and there may be some others at
Alcatraz Island	LOCATION	, in
San Francisco Bay	LOCATION	.

		According to the last report from
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	which has reached me , twenty-five of the conscientious ob - jectors were in solitary confinement in dark cells in the cellar , sleeping on the cement floor between foul blankets , forbidden to read , write , or talk , fed on bread and water , manacled nine hours a day to the bars of the cell , and in some cases beaten or otherwise tortured by the guards .

		This is the form of punishment for all recalcitrant prisoners , whether they are conscientious objectors or not .

		Originally three Russian sectarians and one orthodox Jew refused to work under military dis - cipline , because it violated their religious convictions .

		The torture inflicted upon them provoked a sym - pathetic refusal to work on the part of other con - scientious objectors who believed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that this system of prison punishment should be changed , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the consciences of their comrades should not be coerced .

		Contrary to general belief , the men in
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	are not morally different from the other conscientious objectors who are now to go free .

		If anything , as many competent observers have testi - fied , they are of higher quality .

		They include Rus - sian sectarians , Mennonites , Socialist workmen , col - lege students and graduates , social workers , a pro- fessor in philosophy , and a winner of a
Carnegie Hero Medal	ORGANIZATION	.

		The majority of them are in prison because hasty court-martials tried and sentenced them to ten , fifteen , twenty , and twenty-five years before they even saw the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of these sentences are still under review by the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	, but the men have been in prison for months .

		Other men are in pnson because , although they were adjudged sincere by the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	, no farm furloughs were forthcoming and after nearly three months ' segregation at
Fort Riley	LOCATION	, where efforts were made to compel them to take some form of non-combatant service , they still refused .

		Upon this refusal they were court-martialed , al - though luckier comrades who held exactly the same point of view had been sent to work on various farms .

		A very few men are extreme absolutists who felt that even to accept the farm furlough offered them by the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	was to acknowledge the right of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to conscript them for military service .

		Another small group is composed of men adjudged insincere by the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	and ordered to accept either combatant or non-combatant service .

		This last group is particularly interesting , because in spite of brutal treatment in guardhouse at
Fort Riley	LOCATION	and
Camp Funston	LOCATION	, and the threat of court - martial , they have steadfastly refused to accept non - combatant service .

		This simple fact would seem to refute the charge that these men ` are insincere .

		The immediate need of the situation is that people should urge the Government : 1 .

		At once to reform the brutalities of its treat - ment to all prisoners , irrespective of whether they are conscientious objectors or not ; 2 .

		To recognize that there is a distinction between acts committed in selfish crime , and those which were urged by conscience .

		In many European countries political prisoners are not treated as criminals .

		They ought not to be so treated here .

		In the end , there can be no righteous solution of this thing short of pardon .

		The inequalities of 624 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	the treatment of conscientious objectors for what is at bottom the same offense is in itself a scandal .

		For instance , two men whose course of action was identically the same received the one five years , the other twenty-five .

		A third man was first con - demned to death and then the sentence was set aside , and ultimately he was granted a farm furlough .

		These arbitrary acts are the natural effects of the attempt to penalize men for loyalty to conscience .

		I believe that every one of the men now in prison would be useful in civil life .

		Every one has proved his courage and steadfastness by facing imprison - ment , if not torture .

		Is it not now time for the
Government	ORGANIZATION	to grant a just , generous , and general pardon ?

		JOHN
NEVIN SAYRE	PERSON	.

		Stiffen ,
N. Y.	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- EDITOR 'S NOTE : Evidently the order authorized by Secretary
Baker	PERSON	in a public statement of De - cember 6 in no way changes the status of the men described in Mr.
Sayre	PERSON	's letter .

		It merely abolishes the former practice of handcuffing recalcitrant pris - oners to the bars of their cells .

		This of course is a gain , but it is an inadequate step which can not possibly satisfy liberals in their demand that men in jail for what Secretary
Baker	PERSON	in his own state - ment describes as `` political '' offenses be at once re - leased .

		Merely to abolish medieval brutality is not to perform justice .

		What liberals must insist upon demanding is immediate release of all political prisoners . -RSB-

		BORROWING TROUBLE FOR THE LEAGUE SIRS : The first duty of internationalists at the present time is to maintain a united front toward the opposition .

		The principle of the single front has been fully justified in the war , not alone in the conduct of the campaign but also in the maintenance of civilian morale .

		We have need of all the support which can be mustered behind the slogan , `` Above all nations is humanity . ''

		But if we are honest men and - earnest in our convictions we should have no fear of , rather we should welcome , the freest dis - cussion of our proposals .

		There is no part of the program of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	which is more than a tentative suggestion at this stage .

		That must be admitted .

		And if we have a genuine faith in the principle which underlies the whole movement , an open debate over particular phases of the scheme ought to fortify , not weaken , our position .

		Mr.
Ordway Tead	PERSON	, in treating of The Economic , Guarantees of Peace in THE DIAL of
November 2	DATE	, has with his usual lucidity stated some of the most important functions which an .

		international govern - ment may be constituted to discharge .

		But he has not stopped with the statement of what those func - tions are .

		He has proceeded to declare in quite didactic language how they must be performed .

		Granted that it is expedient that the five subjects which he mentions should be committed to the charge of an international government , it by no means follows that in discharging its responsibilities it is necessary or even wise that that government should act along the lines announced by Mr.
Tead	PERSON	.

		I would therefore , not disputing that these several functions should be entrusted to the new interna - tional government , call attention to the entirely unnecessary burdens which Mr.
Tead	PERSON	loads upon our backs in advocating the adoption of certain policies for the exercise of those functions .

		This is borrowing trouble from the future .

		We have enough difficulties to overcome right now in securing the erection of an international authority adequate to deal with these all-important economic problems .

		But it is not alone the danger from the multipli - cation of fronts which I fear .

		The policy advocated is the wrong policy .

		The writer assumes that there are but two alternative methods of dealing with the economic and financial relations among men on the world scale : the devil 's policy of laissez faire which has hitherto ruled , or rather failed to rule , in these matters , and his policy of rigid `` control , '' which means ' an arbitrary fixation of terms .

		But that these polar extremes do not exhaust all the possible policies should be manifest by reference to our domestic experience of recent years .

		Between the policy of leaving every man to his own devices and the policy of absolute control by superior authority there is the policy of the regula - tion of the conditions of competition .

		In
1912	DATE	no one was so bold as to stand for the first policy ; Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	sponsored the second policy ; while Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	advocated the third .

		The second policy is tantamount to government partnership in business .

		It fosters privilege and monopoly .

		It condones and even connives at the concentration of the financial power , the directing power of industry , in a few hands .

		Such is bound to be the practical import of this policy , not only because it is a fundamental postulate of the program that close manipulation is economical , but also because the concentration of power greatly facilitates the execution of its own powers .

		Happily the American people flatly repudiated Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and his policy in the election .

		In choosing the leadership of
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	they endorsed the policy of the regulation of competi - tion .

		The implications of that choice have not al - ways been clearly envisaged .

		While this is not the place for an exhaustive discussion of the merits and demerits of the policy , attention may well be called to one or two of its distinctive features .

		In the first place it means that , outside of the limited range of public service industries , the government will not undertake in the normal course of affairs to deter - mine trade policies , dictate the conditions of employ - ment , or fix prices , except in so far as the establish - ment of minimum limits and fair standards in these matters may be necessary to the preservation of free THE DIAL 625 competition .

		On the other hand the government assumes the tasks of a vigilant policeman in pre - venting the growth and fructification of private privileges and in extirpating all kinds of predatory practices .

		In short , primarily it does not regulate business ; it regulates competition , it polices the field of business .

		In the second place , the government does not take upon itself the direct responsibility for the proper functioning of the whole mechanism of industry and market distribution .

		No doubt the admission of this fact will be hailed with glee by the type of thinkers represented by Mr.
Tead	PERSON	.

		But is it after all de - sirable that we should link up government with industry ?

		Will not the consolidation of political power and business power under the forms of law and custom now prevailing constitute a menace to the improvement of the economic position of the industrial disfranchised ?

		Have we any assurance that the welfare of the people rather than the pro- tection of property shall be the chief concern of those entrusted with power ?

		What types of mind pre - dominate in the political councils of even the repub - lics of the world ?

		Are the prospects for the peaceful development of industrial democracy enhanced by the participation of government in the determination of the details of the daily give and take of the economic life of a nation ?

		Are the prospects for the growth of international good-will enhanced by the participation of the international government in the determination of national shares and allotments in their economic intercourse ?

		If governments par - ticipate in these affairs or control them they can not avoid being partisan , or at least and this is more important they can not avoid the appearance of being partisan ; that is , of showing favoritism .

		In the one case this must tend toward bitterness and despair toward violent revolution .

		In the other it must tend toward national grievances , food for imperialism , and war .


MYRON W. WATKINS	PERSON	.


Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		AN OPEN LETTER
November 1 , 1918	DATE	.

		Mr.
H. A. Miller	PERSON	, Director Democratic Mid-European Union Hotel Plaza ,
New York City	LOCATION	MY DEAR
MR. MILLER	PERSON	: Replying to your re - quest to give my view of the fundamental princi - ples on which the successful state of the future must be founded , I beg first that you would look around and see why the military strength of the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	is so rapidly crumbling on all sides .

		It does not take much insight to realize that this sudden and widespread collapse is due primarily to the lack of economic strength , or , in other words , the lack of ability on the part of the industrial and business system to supply the armies with the means to fight with .

		This is further emphasized by the fact that the army of
Germany	LOCATION	, which has the best economic support , is admitted by officers returning from
France	LOCATION	to be still unbeaten .

		Military strength therefore is based absolutely on the economic strength .

		The collapse of
Russia	LOCATION	after the Revolution was an illustration of the fact that political power un - supported by economic power is also futile .

		From the above illustrations it is clear that in the organization of a state we must first organize in such a manner as to produce the greatest possible eco - nomic power .

		If there has been in recent years doubt as to the relative economic effectiveness of competi - tion and cooperation in the production of economic power , the war should by this time have removed all possible doubts on that subject .

		This is illustrated by the following facts :
Germany	LOCATION	before the war developed the greatest economic system in the world , because an autocratic military power forced business to be in some slight degree cooperative , and to recognize in some slight degree its social responsibility .

		In
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	it was found on the breaking out of the war that a purely competitive business system was absolutely incapable of giving us the economic strength needed to fight , and we attempted to establish the cooperative prin - ciple in our production and business systems as rap - idly as possible .

		The fact that we did it in a crude way and with many blunders does not indicate that we have not yet found the proper basis for an effi - cient cooperative industrialism .

		Without any shadow of doubt , then , we can accept the fact that the successful economic state of the future must be based on cooperation .

		If then we determine the principles on which cooperation can be firmly established , we shall have determined the principles on which the economic state must be based .

		Cooperation is only possible when there is mutual confidence , which means that we can have no cooper - ation in business as long as secret agreements exist .

		The fundamental principle of cooperation , then , is no secret agreements of any kind .

		We have recognized 1 this as a political principle no secret political treaties , the publication of all cam - paign expenses , and so on .

		As a business principle we have recognized it in the abolition of rebates in railroad freight charges , and in the governmental fixing of prices .

		If this principle is firmly established and univer - sally acknowledged , almost all of the other principles of cooperation become secondary the two most im - portant of which are abolition of special privilege , and of reward out of proportion to service rendered .

		My message , then , may be summed up in few words .

		Your economic system must eliminate not only secret diplomatic agreements but , what is more important , secret business agreements .

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		There is a type of literature chiefly in the do - main of travel and biography , including the never - ceasing deluge of Reminiscences and Memoirs whose sole purpose and function seems to be the delectation of the leisure-class mind .

		A kind of doling out of curious knowledge , anecdotes , literary fragments of all sorts , in a silver spoon .

		The pres - ent volume belongs to that species .


John Presland	PERSON	, with the help of a sympathetic illustrator , intro - duces us , with a naive urbanity , to a section of Eng - land
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		He sketches for us the antique history of this province , mentions the inevitable classic authorities for this fact and that assumption , dilates on the various natural beauties of the scenery , touches now - on old history and famous men , and again on economic and social facts ... One may be charmed at such historico-geographical dex - terity : in certain moods one may even find such a book as this absolutely necessary as a relief from the tension of more important and significant things .

		Nevertheless , even .

		in such moods , those of us who feel the driving force of contemporary events com - pelling our individual attention every moment must feel a very perceptible exasperation in the doubtless quite unintentional impudence of an author who tries to take the place of a moving-picture travelogue or a lecture illustrated by stereopticon slides .

		.

		Not to seem unjustifiably harsh in this instance ,
Lynton	PERSON	and
Lynmouth	PERSON	can be recommended in all good faith as an excellent account barring all real liter - ary merit of a portion of merrie
England	LOCATION	which will never fail to excite the interest of travelers and the curiosity of antiquarians .

		And possibly that is all the author intended : in which event it is the reader 's own fault if he falls foul of this book .

		THE CALL OF THE OFFSHORE WIND .

		By
Ralph D. Paine	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		There is a very brisk and engaging quality about Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's modern story of the sea .

		The romance of the sailing ship has by no means disappeared ; and he gets the full flavor out of even a gigantic schooner like the
Elizabeth Wetherell	PERSON	in its career that is no less prosaic than that of carrying vast hordes of coal from
Norfolk	LOCATION	to
Portland	LOCATION	.

		But that voyage , the first upon which the young
Dudley Fenwick	PERSON	ships as mate , provides a rattling storm and a rattling adventure , in which the sorely struggling vessel is abandoned and recaptured by
Fenwick	PERSON	and his men .

		Then follows the inevitable intrigue by which the smart
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	owner tries to deprive the young mate of his salvage money .

		Fenwick holds his own however and after a long career in the doughty
Elizabeth	PERSON	returns home to find his father 's ruined shipyard `` building them again '' in the dazzling prosperity of the war demand .

		Ships are paying for themselves on the first voyage ; and
Dudley	PERSON	, as skipper , can have a thousand dollars a month who started in the
Elizabeth	LOCATION	under a captain who got forty .

		But he prefers to marry the girl of his choice and settle down in the revived Spring Haven to direct the noble old trade of his father , the build - ing of splendid sailing ships .

		There are other ad - ventures particularly a capitally told story of a mutiny , and the marooning of the culprits off the Cuban coast .

		But there is quite as much of the story devoted to the business intrigue behind the ships as there is to the tang of the sea and the ex - citement of the ships themselves .

		Mr.
Paine	PERSON	im - plies , quite correctly perhaps , that to the modern reader the complicated conflict of strong men over business advantage is as much a matter of romantic adventure as the contact with wind and weather itself .

		i TALES FROM A DUGOUT .

		By
Arthur Guy Empey	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The law of diminishing returns psychological as well as economic already has begun to undermine interest in war books dealing with life on the fight - ing front , particularly those which are no more than an external setting forth of incident .

		It is uphill business this attempt to inject the fever of the trenches into the rapidly cooling veins of a public whose energies have been turned from problems of devastation to problems of rehabilitation .

		Doubtless that is why one is unable to react very emphatically to these hastily thrown together sketches .

		Nor is one 's interest edged one whit by
Empey	PERSON	's dedication of his new book to `` the overaged , the women , the physically unfit and the children .

		These are the ones to be pitied , the ones who suffer most , because their hearts are on the battlefields of
France	LOCATION	, although their bodies must stay at home . ''

		Such hyperbole of war hysteria fails to carry conviction .

		The sketches which comprise the volume are the narrations of the various members of a gun crew , who while away the tedious hours by recounting adventures .

		They form a series of `` close-ups '' of trench warfare , told in the vernacular .

		Uncouth and ephemeral though these pages are , they nevertheless reveal a certain rough vigor in lieu of literary quality .

		They will be read with pleasure by those who enjoy war-fiction movies .

		WALKING SHADOWS .

Alfred Noyes	PERSON	.

		Stokes ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
4 Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, having apparently reached the place he wished to achieve in verse , now starts to compete in a surprisingly new field .

		He aims , in these `` sea tales , '' at nothing less than the role of a refined
Oliver Optic	PERSON	or
Horatio Alger	PERSON	of the Great War .

		His first prattling steps in the short story show conclusively his determination to make a name
1918	DATE	THE DIAL 627 for himself in that style of literature known as the small-boy thriller .

		And it is the submarine today that provides the horrid clue .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has dished up , in these eleven stories , almost all the familiar figures the commander who lands at lighthouses and murders the keeper ; the man who has married a pure girl on a
California	LOCATION	ranch , and turns out to be a Hun who has escaped from a German sub - marine with all the treasure and left his comrades to drown ; the German agent in
South America	LOCATION	who gets tangled in his own code as he tries to get back to
Germany	LOCATION	; the submarine base on a
Maine	LOCATION	island , with a professor yes , even a professor sitting for - lornly on the rocks .

		Most of the favorite spies and plots and deviltries are here , and the Hunnish plot - ters , appropriately , usually meet some such terrible end as they have been plotting for their enemies .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	even believes , among other things , that any English writer who criticized English civiliza - tion before the war was put up to it in some insidious way by a Hun agent .

		In such a belief , of course , the faithful satisfaction of Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	during those truculent days of Hun-paid Shaws and Wellses would shine all the brighter .

		The average writer of the small-boy thriller does not , perhaps , believe all he describes .

		In this case however , both author and publisher take the work with the utmost seriousness , not realizing how much better it can be done by the serialists of
McClure	ORGANIZATION	's Magazine with their so much richer and racier command of the `` movie '' technique .

		Walking Shadows is not even redeemed by its style , which is as childish as its matter .

		In this new chosen field of his Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	enjoys the distinction of having written one of the silliest of all the books produced by the war .

		HAWTHORNE : How to Know Him .

		By
George Edward Woodberry	PERSON	.

		Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's method of making us know
Hawthorne	PERSON	is to comment on the copious quotations which he presents quotations which are happily selected to reveal both the weaknesses and the strength of that .

		somewhat mysterious genius .

		The frontispiece shows us a very stiff
Hawthorne	PERSON	, dressed in his best , almost fashionable clothes , with his high hat on a table by his side .

		And this stiff - ness rather sets the mood of his latest critic 's work .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	plays somewhat gingerly around his subject
Hawthorne	PERSON	is not entirely congenial to his own temperament , and gets his praise in the end for qualities that set him dubiously outside the list of great writers .

		He was , in fact , a contemporary of all his books , and wrote them , so to speak , from his own generation .

		He did not transcend his own time by any gift of education , sympathy or travel ... It follows from this that he was substantially a man of his parish , one might say an antiquary of his parish ...
Hawthorne	PERSON	's genius , how - ever idiosyncratic it may appear , will never be dissoci - ated from his community ; the two are revealed together .

		... Only by the light of that genius could the Puritan community have been visibly set forth , and again only that community could have been the proper medium to display his genius .

		Hawthorne is gently set back in his place as one of our best provincial writers .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	hints at the structural weakness of his work , and finds his `` artistic method v of philosophizing ... sel - dom , if ever , quite equal to the task .

		The result is a continual failure of the art to express the thought ; the art falls silent ; the thought ceases to appear . ''

		But he admires the `` wonderful purity of tone '' in his style , and saves for him that `` poetic illusion '' which `` gives him his charm , as his moral quality gives him his substance . ''

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's faint admirations combine with the old-fashioned quality of the extracts he makes from
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's works to mark the slow fading of a literary reputation that was once as high as the greatest .

		THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THEATRE .

		By
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Last year
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	was writing a series of critical essays on contemporary English poets for
The Bookman	ORGANIZATION	.

		This year he has as - sembled these papers , and wfth much addition and revision has published them in a volume with a title more ambitious than anything the book contains .

		Professor
Phelps	PERSON	writes as though he were lecturing to a group of freshmen to whom he was more anxious to prove his humanity and humor than the creative power of criticism .

		He seems always more fearful of tiring his audience than of failing to edify it .

		Aside from a few good jokes , his best passages are the quoted ones .

		If anything , the author 's taste is too catholic .

		He devotes almost equal attention to poets of such vary - ing accomplishment as
Amy Lowell	PERSON	,
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, and
Robert Frost	ORGANIZATION	.

		He gives less space to any of these than to
William Watson	PERSON	and
Wilfred Wilson Gibson	PERSON	.

		His high praise of
Yeats	PERSON	and
Masefield	PERSON	loses by such declarations as these : `` Mr.
Service	PERSON	is undoubtedly a real poet . ''

		``
William Watson	PERSON	really has the divine gift and is one of the most deservedly eminent among living poets . ''

		There is a curious lack of discrimination in a man who devotes two praiseful paragraphs to
Ella Wheeler Wilcox	PERSON	and does not name
Ezra Pound	PERSON	, even to damn him .

		Sometimes , too , the professor distorts the facts as when he mentions
Stephens	PERSON	' paraphrase of
O'Rahilly	PERSON	's Righteous Anger in terms that would lead one to believe the poem original with its trans - lator .

		Is there nothing in this fat professorial volume save sins of commission and omission ?

		Well , there is a good estimate of
John Masefield	PERSON	, a solid appreci - ation of Vachel Lindsay .

		There are certainly 628 THE DIAL
December 28	DATE	enough debatable axioms laid down to furnish argu - ments for several interesting evenings .

		There are some excellent poems quoted , and the book will al - ways be a handy reference for biographical facts and preferred pronunciations .

		The
Twentieth Century Theatre	ORGANIZATION	is a more hy - brid and less engaging bit of work .

		Here he approaches his subject with the lantern of Diogenes in one hand and a pair of rose-colored glasses in the other .

		To the last page , Professor
Phelps	PERSON	seems undecided as to whether he is writing for an audi - ence of scholars , for a group of indifferent pupils , or for the worthy members of the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	.

		He makes discoveries which would alarm one group and be stale for another , following them up with quota - tions that would bore the first and be full of meat for the second .

		Toward both poetry and drama the author 's critical faculty has the quality of candle - light in a gusty gallery .

		Sometimes it flares upon a picture of real beauty , but seldom does it , throw a full light , and it is likely to go out at the breath of a sentimental wind .

		THE SUBMARINE IN WAR AND PEACE .

		By
Simon Lake	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		Important inventions of
Simon Lake	PERSON	, and adapta - tions of them , are embodied in the submarine vessels of modern warfare .

		His
Argonaut	ORGANIZATION	, built more than twenty years ago , was the first submarine success - fully operated in the open sea .

		So he speaks with the voice of authority of the mechanical principles of submarines , of operation problems that have been met and partly overcome , and of the history of sub - marine development .

		In the rehabilitation of the world , its industry and commerce , Mr.
Lake	PERSON	prophesies that the submarine will play a construct - ive part .

		He points to the feasibility of employing submarines in recovering cargoes from sunken ships , in navigating under ice fields in the interests of science and commerce , in performing important hydrographic work , in investigating the flora and fauna of the sea , in harvesting tons of shell-fish from the ocean 's floor .

		Yet the submarine 's greatest service to mankind , as Mr.
Lake	PERSON	sees it , will come through the eventual elimination of naval warfare : Sooner or later a reliable engine will be developed which will meet the needs of military submarines and which will deliver power sufficient to give the submarine battleship speed .

		This is at present the only limitation upon submarine development , and it is not an insuperable obstacle ... It is my firm conviction that it is the destiny of the submarine to put an end forever to the possibility of warfare upon the high seas , and to eliminate warfare between nations which have no access to each other except by sea .

		These words are as in echo to
John P. Holland	PERSON	's assertion of submarine invincibility : `` There is noth - ing you can send against it , not even itself . ''

		And yet the war has shown that submarines are not at present able to cope with the more heavily armed and speedier torpedo boat destroyers , which must have battleship protection .

		Mr.
Lake	PERSON	's volume re - flects and here , perhaps , is where the imagination and the enthusiasm of the inventor creeps in a faith in the future war-time supremacy of the sub - marine which must appear at once excessive to naval architects and ironical to supporters of disarmament .

United States Army	ORGANIZATION	has been the creation of a
Department of Neuropsy	ORGANIZATION	- chiatry .

		Special problems for the neurologist and the psychiatrist arise in such profusion in modern war - fare that they speedily tend to overtax the limited number of men who specialize / in these branches , even if they have been mobilized in advance .

		They have to deal not only with the specific cases of shell shock of which we have perhaps heard too much , but with all those abnormal strains of war which seek out the weak spots in the central nervous sys - tem or create a favorable environment for the hereditary insanities .

		Our Sanitary Corps is seek - ing to avoid the conditions in most of the con - tinental armies , where doctors were continually over - whelmed with these baffling cases , while at the same time it is bending every effort towards preventing men with unfavorable predispositions from coming under active fighting conditions in the first place .

		The elaborate intelligence test now being adminis - tered to everyone entering the army and the question - naire of the
Personnel Office	ORGANIZATION	are steps in the right direction .

		There could hardly be a better illustration of the growing importance of the
Department of Neu	ORGANIZATION	- ropsychiatry than a volume such as this , which comes as a free gift from the
National Committee for Mental Hygiene	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here we have an attempt to supply the psychiatrists and neurologists in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	with the latest information about the very special problems in their respective fields .

		Miss
Brown	PERSON	and Dr.
F. E. Williams	PERSON	have done the work in a very thorough manner , making abstracts of no less than three hundred articles from the medical literature of the leading belligerent countries , including the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The book as it stands is the first inclusive compilation of material upon shell shock , which alone makes it of great value .

		The consensus of opinion about shell shock should be of interest to the general reader .

		It is essentially a temporary condition , with its intensity largely de - pendent upon the predisposition of the patient .

		Ac - cordingly the psychological treatment is most successful where the patient has previously been inclined to functional nervous disturbances , while in other cases a regime of rest and sedatives may bring about the same result .

		The problem of shell shock has been exploited to such a degree in popular discussions that it tends to act as a suggestion upon THE DIAL 629 f -RRB- you prefer a Real League of Do you actually stand for justice to all nations , whatever their size or their past alignments ?

		How should

		Over such questions , which might make or break a

		The product of their discussions is the Statement of Principles * that was published in THE DIAL of

		It is also of interest to note that the prevalence of malingering tended to be greatly exaggerated in
the first two years	DATE	of the war .

		It is now pretty well agreed that any serious attempt to malinger is in itself the sign of a psychopathic condition .

		The normal adult is too critical of in - tellectual processes to try to go back to the tricks of his school days .

		Neuropsychiatry and the War is bound to be welcomed in army medical circles if only on account of its convenient condensation ; the average army doctor is kept far too busy to have much time left for any extensive reading .

		THE KINGDOM OF THE CHILD .

		By
Alice M. H. Heniger	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mrs.
Heniger	PERSON	has done more than anyone to develop the `` Children 's Theater '' and persuade teachers and parents of the importance of giving young children an opportunity to express themselves in drama .

		In this fresh and persuasive little book she works out at some length the educational theory that is behind her enterprise .

		Child life , she shows , is intensely and universally dramatic .

		Make-believe is the world children live in .

		But this pretense can not be confined to the imagination .

		It needs definite expression , definite dramatization .

		Children can use almost any symbols , but there must be sym - bols .

		That is why the acting out of stories appeals to practically all children , dull and bright .

		Mrs.
Heniger	PERSON	shows suggestively that much juvenile crime is nothing more than inappropriate dramatiza - tion acting , in other words done in places or with symbolic tools that adults find inconvenient .

		If dirt is merely matter in the wrong place , then juvenile offenses are usually merely drama in the wrong place .

		The problem of home and school becomes , then , how to use this dramatic instinct of the child so as to turn it towards interests and activities that will be important and useful for later life .

		The kindergarten , built up on a theory of metaphysics rather than of dramatics , has failed on the whole to supply the educational need it pretended .

		The schools are learning that much more vivid imper - sonation is required really to awaken the children 's imaginations .

		Few are the schools nowadays that do not approach the rudiments through the pathway of play : stories are acted before they are read , and even arithmetic proves susceptible to the dramatic instinct .

		In this book Mrs.
Heniger	PERSON	says little that is new , but what she says is too important not to bear repetition .

		THE LAUGHING GIRL .

		By
Robert W. Cham	PERSON	- bers .

		Appleton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In his newest novel newest at least for the moment Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	gives a clever imitation of the novelization of a musical comedy plot written by a college senior whose specialties are
Anthony Hope	PERSON	and
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	.

		This may not be intentional .

		There is always the theory that Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is widely and determinedly cultural in his presentation of people whose beauty is sur - passed only by the number of gifts and graces they have developed , in the hope that the great American public may profit by the examples of these supermen .

		But whether the prolific creator of glorious beings means to be absurd or helpful , or both in a tangled sort of way , his latest volume is such a mixture of melodramatic burlesque and silly intrigue as to be a disappointment to his most devoted worshipers .

		An incredible nightmare of a story this is , with a rendezvous of some of the crowned heads of south - ern
Europe	LOCATION	in a Swiss chalet , where duchesses serve as maids and fall in love with cultured Americans .

		It is evidently satiric in intention , and it becomes cloyingly sentimental and heavily parodic by turns in result .

		But the American public continues to indulge itself in these stirabouts of grotesque shad - ows of things the direct descendants of the
Bertha M. Clay	PERSON	style of literature .

		FREE AND OTHER STORIES .

		By
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	.


Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	may always be depended upon to show his readers what an essentially com - monplace and fatuous thing life is .

		His novels from the really exceptional Sister Carrie to that ponderous commentary on
Weininger	PERSON	's Sex and Character , The `` Genius '' abound in situation and auctorial asides on the extreme , irremediable banality of man in conflict with himself , his fellows , and with the universe .

		This attitude , which is the logical conclusion of the realist -LRB- or perhaps one should say the naturalist -RRB- philosophy in literature , sits upon Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's bowed shoulders like the mantle of a prophet ; and this prophet delights to utter his mournful , harpy-like lamentations at the impoverished banquet of existence in a tone whose skepticism is a little too like self-impotence always to convince .

		In the present volume he deserts the novel for the short story , but he still wears the mantle and executes the familiar gestures of realism .

		These eleven tales are not only so many Zolaesque slices of life of the most drab content , but in struc - ture and style they are deplorably inadequate .

		Quite aside from the author 's frequent perversions of good English especially his irritating habit of splitting infinitives the development of practically every story in this book obeys the prescriptions not of art but of journalism .

		A police-court reporter with a modicum of culture and literary aspirations could do no worse .

		And even Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, whose claims to literary ability have received the confirma - tion of more than one genuine achievement , could scarcely do worse .

		The fact is that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, in this book , has committed the ultimate blunder : in his worship of THE DIAL 631 Three Important Doran Books To Clearly Understand the Conditions of Peace YOU SHOULD READ THE EDGE OF THE QUICKSANDS By
D. Thomas Curtin	PERSON	With merciless clearness , Mr.

December 28	DATE	the trivial he has taken up .

		the position of supposing that the mere `` presentation '' of the insignificant is enough to render a story `` vital . ''

		Accordingly he insists upon eliminating from his situations and characters every hint of those incalculable factors which lend dramatic power to the lives of even the sorriest peasant and charwoman .

		It is not , be it understood , that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	lacks feeling for real character and psychology
Jennie Gerhardt	PERSON	proves the contrary it is just that in these rather colorless tales he has failed in responsibility to himself and to his artistic ideals .

		With the exception of The Lost
Phoebe	PERSON	, a really charming study in the pathos -LRB- and pathology -RRB- of old age , and in the sketch of a village Bovary , The
Second Choice	ORGANIZATION	, the sensitive reader would find it difficult to distinguish between these awkwardly written footnotes to a thesis and , say , the `` sobstuff '' of some exceptionally clever journalist .

		As an example of what real genius might have done with such material as this book contains read the Dubliners of
James Joyce	PERSON	.

		Any reference to Tchekhov or Garshin or
Galsworthy	PERSON	would perhaps be spreading it on too thick .

		Free and Other Stories is a book Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	will have to live down .

		It mars his reputation as an exact , patient student of the prosaic , offends by its un - pardonable uncouthness of style , and seems con - clusive evidence that its author will never master the difficult , heart-breaking technique of the short story .

		By
Henri Barbusse	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		E. P .

		The danger in following up a writer who sud - denly publishes a popular masterpiece lies in finding that he has not always been writing masterpieces .

		The present run on Barbusse is drawing out ma - terial that makes the fact of Under Fire all the more bewildering .

		How did a writer of such doubt - ful talent produce so amazing a book ?

		It must indeed have been the war , and
Barbusse	PERSON	one of the few writers whom the Great War did directly in - spire and endow with his own best powers .

		The doubtfulness of his previous talent is well docu - mented in this collection of short `` stories of fate , love , and pity , '' as they are described .

		These stories are the merest feuilletons , such as the Parisian reads of a morning in his cheaper newspaper on the tram or suburban train .

		Many of them deal with the more improbable forms of murder and sudden death , and they all have a decisively hollow and unnatural ring .

		The ingenuity of Barbusse in imagining the ghoulish explains perhaps why he could make a masterpiece out of war .

		For here was a wide and thoroughly congenial frame which would absorb horror to the limit of one 's inventive capacity .

		And through the horror he seems to have attained a humanity and truth which his earlier work certainly does not show .

		His unconvincingness in these stories is helped by his use of that strained and bizarre style which the second-rate French writer of today so loves to affect .
