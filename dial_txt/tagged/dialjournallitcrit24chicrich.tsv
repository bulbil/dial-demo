ALPHONSE DA UDET	ORGANIZATION	.

		French literature could ill afford to spare the graceful pen of
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	.

		Within five years it has lost in Renan its greatest prosateur in the domain of scholarship , in
Taine	LOCATION	its great - est philosophical historian , in
Leconte de Lisle	LOCATION	its greatest poet , and now in
Alphonse Daudet	ORGANIZATION	its greatest novelist .

		This does not mean that
Daudet	PERSON	was a great novelist in the sense of Hugo or Balzac , or even of Stendhal or Flaubert , but simply that among the writers of fiction left living during the past fifteen years he was clearly the most important , and that we may scan the horizon of dawning reputations in vain for indications of any other likely to occupy as large a place in the literature of the
Republic	LOCATION	.

		His success was hardly and honorably won , and his career was that of a typical man of letters .

		The story of his obscure origin , of his early struggles for a livelihood , of his eventual recog - nition , of his constantly growing reputation and the golden sunset of his assured fame , is of the old sort so familiar to the student of literary history , although one not often to be read in books so charming as those in which
Daudet	ORGANIZATION	has himself told it in '' Le Petit Chose , '' to begin with , and later in '' Trente Ans de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' and the '' Souvenirs d'un Horn me de Lettres . ''

		Daudet was a Provencal by birth , and saw the light at
Nimes	ORGANIZATION	in
1840	DATE	.

		His boyhood was spent in his native city and in
Lyons	PERSON	.

		He then obtained a position as usher in a country school , but a year of this drudgery was all that he could bear , and at the age of seventeen he started to seek his fortune in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		From this time until the War of
1870	DATE	, he struggled to gain a foot - hold in the world of letters , receiving support for a time from a clerical position in the civil service , and finding happiness in marriage with the talented woman who has ever since remained his devoted companion and counsellor .

		His first book was '' Les Amoureuses , '' a volume of love poems .

		Other collections of verse followed , and quickly won for the young writer a reputation .

		He also essayed the drama , producing nine plays in all , besides the later dramatizations of his novels .

		His plays had no great success , and their titles convey little to the average theatre - goer or reader of dramatic literature .

		These tentative efforts in the lyric and dra - THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, matic provinces of literature were supplemented by journalistic work done for '' Le Figaro '' and other papers , and in this work we find the sketches and short stories in which
Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's true artistic self was first revealed . ''

		Le Petit Chose , '' that exquisite fragment of autobiog - raphy , dates from
1868	DATE	, and before the annee terrible he had also produced the charming '' Lettres de Mon Moulin . ''

		When the war was over , his position as the greatest master of the short story was still further strengthened by the '' Contes du Lundi , '' the '' Contes et Recits , '' and other collections .

		The best of these pieces are the purest gems of their sort in modern French literature .

		Equal in perfec - tion of form to the stories of Maupassant they have a substance which the stories of the later master rarely exhibit , and the pathos of such studies as `` La Derniere Classe '' and `` Le Siege de
Berlin	LOCATION	'' is wellnigh flawless .

		He is indeed to be pitied who can read with dry eyes these masterpieces in miniature .

		The short stories gave to their author just the sort of training in the niceties of literary art that was needed to develop his powers as a full-grown novelist , and enable him to produce , during the follow - ing quarter-century , the series of fiction that gave him an unrivaled position among the French novelists of his time .

		Other works were written in this later period , but they are of minor importance rechauffes or chips from a literary workshop and reveal no development of power beyond what was displayed when Daudet the novelist was yet artistically unborn .

		The first of Daudet 's books written de longue haleine was the famous ''
Tartarin deTarascon	PERSON	, '' dated
1872	DATE	.

		In this book and its two succes - sors , '' Tartarin sur les Alpes '' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- , and '' Port-Tarascon '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , he achieved his greatest title to literary fame , for these three works projected into literature one of its few immortal types of character .

		The creation of Tartarin stands only just below such figures as Falstaff and
Sancho Panza	PERSON	.

		The intensely human figure of Daudet 's lion-hunter , mountain - climber , and colonial adventurer is a fascinat - ing study in all three phases of his self-glorious career ; all the color of the midi glows from the pages in which his exploits are set forth , and all the humorous or lovable foibles of the Provengal are delineated with a touch that is incisive without being painful , with a geniality that robs satire of its sting , and finds in happy and wholesome laughter a universal solvent for the most varied sentiments and emotions .

		What - ever else may be forgotten , the story of Tartarin will be remembered , and will remain among the classics of nineteenth century literature .

		The greater part of
Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's career as a novelist was , however , devoted to the production of studies of modern life which have made him the chief interpreter of the second imperial and third republican periods of French society .

		They do not , it is true , present us a delineation comparable for minute observation and com - prehensiveness with the record of the restora - tion period that is made in the forty volumes of the ''
Comedie Humaine	PERSON	, '' for not every age can produce a Balzac , but they do provide us with a series of careful studies wherein much of recent French life is pictured , and which have a charm of style that was beyond the reach of
Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's great predecessor .

		Two or three of these books are comparatively insig - nificant , but at least eight of them are master - pieces in a very genuine sense .

		They are , in the order of their publication , '' Froment Jeune et Risler Aine '' -LRB- 1874 -RRB- , `` Jack '' -LRB- 1876 -RRB- , `` Le Nabab '' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- , `` Rois en Exil '' -LRB- 1879 -RRB- , `` Numa Roumestan '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , '' L'Evangeliste '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- , '' Sapho '' -LRB- 1884 -RRB- , and `` L'Immortel '' -LRB- 1888 -RRB- .

		These books are , on the whole , the most remarkable collection of novels produced by any Frenchman under the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	.

		Space fails us in which to characterize in any detail this series of drames parisiens .

		They are all well-known to English readers , for they have been promptly translated as they have appeared .

		The first of them -LRB- called '' Sidonie '' in the English version -RRB- was , we remember , made the subject of considerable cheap moral - izing when it appeared in our language , with the natural consequence that it became widely known .

		Much water has flowed under the bridges since then , and so many writers using the English language have bettered whatever instruction in immorality was to be derived from the literature of
France	LOCATION	that '' Sidonie '' would now be considered very mildly offensive even by the self-constituted professional guar - dians of our literary virtue .

		Daudet has some - times been called the French Dickens , an ascription which is merely absurd if based upon any comparison between the humor , say , of the `` Tartarin '' books and of `` Pickwick , '' but which has some slight justification if referred to the pathos of ''
Jack	PERSON	, '' that poignant narra - tive whose chief fault is its excessive length .

		Daudet 's third novel , '' Le Nabab , '' is probably his masterpiece , although this claim may per - haps be contested by the partisans of '' Numa Roumestan '' or of '' Sapho . ''

		The book is a
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL brilliant picture of Parisian life under the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ond Empire , and it portrays the corruption of that period with an unsparing brush , although the figure of
Mora	PERSON	is delineated with a more kindly hand than actual history warrants a fact easily explained when we remember that he is no other than the
Due de Morny	ORGANIZATION	, whom the novelist served as a secretary for a number of years .

		This figure and that of
Numa Roumestan	PERSON	-LRB- who is Gambetta somewhat more disguised -RRB- are .

		the most conspicuous illustra - tions of the novelist 's habit of introducing prominent public characters into his fictions .

		The ''
Rois	PERSON	en Exil '' is a gallery of such figures , and if the '' Astier-Rehu '' of '' L'Immortel '' is not any particular academician , there are not a few who might have found themselves more or less caricatured in him .

		Something ought to be said about '' Sapho , '' yet a few words would be less adequate than none at all .

		The inscrip - tion '' pour mes fils quand ils auront vingt ans '' indicates that the work is not milk for babes or food for bread-and-butter misses , and shows also how large a question any discussion of such a book must raise .

		From the technical stand - point of literary art '' Sapho '' is as nearly per - fect as anything that the author ever wrote .

		The literary characteristics of Daudet are admirably outlined by Professor
B. W. Wells	PERSON	, upon whose '' Modern French Literature '' we have relied for many of the dates and other matters of fact given in the present sketch .

		We are told that '' to the naturalistic temper he brought the mind of an idyllic poet , '' that rather than '' architectural power '' he had '' the style of an impressionist painter . ''

		The resulting product '' attains the highest effects of art with - out artificiality , and is at once classical and modern . ''

		These formulae serve fairly well to express the essence of
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	's work and to record the residual impression left by many years of acquaintance with his varied books of fiction .

		ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
Dec. 20 , 1897	DATE	.

		We have been much exercised during the past week with long discussions on the Report issued by the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		Your readers may not appreciate what this means .

		I will therefore , with your permission , explain the matter as clearly as I am able .

		In this country , most books are retailed to the public , by the booksellers , at a discount of
three pence	MONEY	in the shilling , or about
six cents	MONEY	to the quarter dollar .

		For some years past the book - sellers have been complaining to the publishers that the giving of this discount leaves a margin of profit insuffi - cient to pay their working expenses .

		Their agitation resulted in the formation of a
Booksellers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, and the establishment of a similar organization of Pub - lishers .

		After many proposals , it was decided by these two bodies that the discount to the public should be lowered to
two pence	MONEY	; and the publishers , before they finally took steps to see that the booksellers did not under - sell each other , sought the cooperation of a society which has Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	for its President , and which calls itself the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		This body took some time to consider the matter , and in the end issued a very pom - pous and ambitious pronouncement against the scheme .

		One of the most important statements made in this re - port runs thus : '' The independence of the author would be seriously compromised by the existence of a close ring of publishers and booksellers , who might as easily dictate to him a royalty of five per cent , as to the bookseller a 2d .

		discount . ''

		What the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	has done in the past has been excellently well told in the chapter devoted to its workings which Mr. 6 .


H. Putnam	PERSON	has included in his last edition of '' Authors and Publishers . ''

		But this much it is necessary to say , to arrive at a proper understand - ing of the situation : that the Society can in no sense be said to represent the large body of English authors .

		The signatories to the Report itself include but three writers who might be affected by the scheme ; the other five are gentlemen of hardly any note in the literary world , eminent as they may be in their particular pro- fessions .

		The Society and its organ , `` The Author '' -LRB- conducted by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	-RRB- , have always gone on the assumption that the author is the novelist , and from this it has drawn some of the most ridiculous conclusions .

		As a matter of fact ,
the Society	ORGANIZATION	has nothing whatever to do with the '' booksellers ' grievance , `` and ought never to have been consulted .

		The publishers have found out this error of theirs , and many of them are regretting the step they took .

		The trouble , so far as the booksellers are concerned , is accentuated by the fact that drapers have taken to selling books at cutting prices .

		If publishers would but resist the temptation to '' jobbing '' large quantities , this might not happen .

		But then , how can we give the booksellers all our sympathy , when we find so many of them who have never appreciated what it means to sell books ?

		The books they sell are so much goods , or '' stuff , '' and it is a rare chance that one comes across a really intelligent and well-educated bookseller .

		Next to this '' booksellers ' grievance '' we have been interested in the selling of rare books the library of the
Earl of Ashbnrnham	ORGANIZATION	.

		The past six days have fur - nished columns of reports in the daily press of the enor - mous prices these books have realized .

		The first portion of this library was disposed of
last July	DATE	, and realized the sum of almost 32,000 , or 8160,000 .

		The second and smaller portion , just dispersed , has brought in nearly 19,000 , or 95,000 .

		Without a doubt the high prices are due to the reputation of the library , and to the handsome commissions your countrymen have sent over .

		Let me give a few instances :
George Gascoigne	PERSON	's `` Whole Workes '' -LRB- 1587 -RRB- , a book which rarely fetches more than 20 , found a purchaser for 40 ; Glanvelk 's '' De Proprietatibns Rerum , '' printed by
Wyukyn de Worde	PERSON	, is undoubtedly a very uncommon work , but 195 is also an uncommon price .

		An imperfect copy of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's edition of Gower 's '' Confessio Amantis '' -LRB- 1483 -RRB- was knocked down for 188 , and the second edition , from the press of
Berthelot	LOCATION	, for 20 .

		A fine copy of Graf - THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ton 's Chronicles of Englande '' -LRB- 1570 -RRB- went for 70 , while the edition of Hakluyt 's Voyages , with the rare map and the original suppressed leaves , was bought for
$ 1,375	MONEY	.

		An unusual price for John Hey wood 's `` The Spider and the Flie '' is
$ 182	MONEY	, but this is what Mr.
Quaritch	PERSON	gave for it .

		In printed '' Books of Hours '' the library was especially rich , and copies brought such prices as
$ 300	MONEY	,
$ 705	MONEY	,
$ 895	MONEY	,
$ 525	MONEY	,
$ 825	MONEY	,
$ 595	MONEY	.

		For a magnificent copy of '' Heures , '' printed in
1525	DATE	by `` Maistre Geofry Tory , '' Mr.
Quaritch	PERSON	gave
$ 4,300	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Richard Heber	PERSON	's copy of the first edition -LRB-
Rouen	LOCATION	,
1488	DATE	-RRB- of the famous romance , `` Lancelot du Lac , '' fetched
$ 670	MONEY	; the
1494	DATE	edition , printed upon vellum , realized
$ 375	MONEY	.

		An early and very rare work on
Florida	LOCATION	, Laudonniere 's '' Notable Historic , containing Foure Voyages ... unto
Florida	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1587 -RRB- , was purchased by Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	for
$ 1,950	MONEY	.

		Caxtou 's translation of Le Fevre 's '' Recueill of the Historyes of Troye , '' and printed by him about 1472 or 1474 , was sold for
$ 4,750	MONEY	; the copy wanted 49 leaves , and was purchased by its late owner at Mr.
E. V. Utterson	PERSON	's sale .

		The same author 's '' Boke of the
Hoole Lyf	PERSON	of
Jason	PERSON	, '' and printed by the same printer , circa
1477	DATE	, reached the substantial amount of
$ 10,500	MONEY	.

		It is quite perfect , and is remark - able in that it has rough edges .

		I might take up the whole of your space with items of similar interest and rarity ; but I have given sufficient to indicate that book - collecting has not lost its fascination , and that there must be many ardent book-lovers who consider money no equivalent for the joy obtained in the possession of a rare specimen of printing or a rare edition of a classic .

		So far as the literary world is concerned , I can not report much .

		The reviews on Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's per - petration of a version of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	have afforded much amusement to that gentleman 's enemies , and prob - ably no little chagrin to his friends .

		He is unfortunate lately ; but I am afraid he must blame himself for giving others an impression that is certainly not nice , and that probably may not be true .

		I hear that he is to pay the
United States	LOCATION	a visit shortly , for the purpose of an extended lecturing tour .

		If you like him you will be in love with him ; if you dislike him , you 'll feel it '' strong . ''

		We are about to have two new translations of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	one from Mr.
E. Heron	PERSON	-
Allen	PERSON	, a gentleman fairly well-known here for his interest in violins ; the other from Mr.
John Payne	PERSON	, the translator of the
Villon Society	ORGANIZATION	's edition of the '' Arabian Nights . ''

		The latter will probably find many purchasers ; and as the edition is to be limited , and published under the auspices of the society for which Mr.
Payne	PERSON	has done such yeomen ser - vice , it may be taken for granted that there will not be many copies going a-begging .

		I may also announce that there is to be issued in the coming
spring	DATE	a volume dealing with the bibliography of the translations of Omar 's Rubaiyat .

		In this connection , I think , all praise should be accorded to Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, whose variorum edition of the quatrains of the poet tent-maker of Naishapur is one of the most excellent specimens of works of its kind .

		A few copies have managed to find their way here , despite the vigilant eyes of the post - office and custom authorities , and , I need hardly say , they are much prized .

		I have noticed one or two copies on sale here of Mr.
Irving Browne	PERSON	's '' In the Track of the Book - Worm , '' a volume which has been issued by the Roycrof t Printing Shop of
East Aurora	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
U. S.	PERSON	A .

		The book is ap - preciated for its unusual printing and general '' get-up . ''

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	is also to be congratulated on his interest - ing causeries .

		Talking of the Roycroft Printing Shop reminded me of '' The Philistine , '' which in its turn reminded me of '' The Bibelot , '' and this again of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	of
Port	LOCATION	- land ,
Maine	LOCATION	.

		You can have hardly any idea of how sore many people here feel against Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	started the crusade against him for pirat - ing '' Ballads and Lyrics of Old
France	LOCATION	'' and ''
Helen	PERSON	of Troy . ''

		But since the reprint of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's '' Essays from the Guardian , '' indignation has risen very high indeed .

		A correspondent in '' Literature '' can with difficulty restrain himself .

		Of course , it is unfortunate , but one can hardly blame Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	for doing what he does .

		He finds a certain condition of things and takes advantage of them that is all .

		Somehow , I feel that the authors whom Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	annexes owe him a vote of thanks for the engaging dress in which he clothes them .

		Were I the author of ''
Helen	PERSON	of Troy , '' it would charm me not a little to see the poem so prettily dis - played on hand-made paper and soft parchment .

		If one is stopped on the highway , one would rather hand one 's purse over to a courteous knight than to the rough - and-ready bludgeoner .

		I do not mean by this that Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	stops anyone on the highway it is the fault of my comparison but that Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	has had the good taste to handle his gentlemen with care and attention .

		Let them thank their good stars that they have fallen into hands so solicitous for their well-being .

		In the matter of good printing , good paper , and pretty binding , I art of opinion that the gentleman from
Port	LOCATION	- land ,
Maine	LOCATION	, can teach a lesson or two even to
London	LOCATION	publishers .

		I have but one more item of information , and it is somewhat important .

		It relates to an Englishman who has just been writing about you and your country , and to a young and rising English publisher .

		They are collaborating on a novel or a romance , which is to deal with the adventures of a nineteenth-century gentleman in the days of the Roman empire .

		The writer is Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	, author of '' The Land of the Almighty Dollar '' ; the publisher is Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Richards	PERSON	's name calls to my mind that he will publish next year a long novel by ''
George Egerton	PERSON	, '' the lady of '' Key - notes '' fame .

		The novel will deal with the '' question '' which Mine .


Sarah Grand	PERSON	has had all to herself .

		TWO DIALS .

		One dial , I think of , on a tower 's face : Surrounded by the ivy 's mild caress , It seems uplifted from the care and stress Of hurried men who fill the market-place ; Unminding self , or them , it does but trace The sky 's far message , bring it more or less Of comfort to the waiting heart 's distress ; '' Thy joys , '' it says , '' and sorrows flit apace . ''

		Another Dial : it speaks among us here With diverse message from life 's vibrant Thought That moves as if with banners bright unfurled , That comes to lonely workers with its cheer And song of widening courage fair inwrought , And throbs with every heart-beat of the world .

		THE DIAL DR.
JTJSTIX WINSOR	PERSON	'S LAST BOOK .

		* The eighth and last volume of Dr.
Justin Winsor	PERSON	's '' Narrative and Critical History of
America	LOCATION	'' appeared in
1889	DATE	.

		That monu - mental work finished , the indefatigable scholar who had written much of it , as well as planned and edited the whole , immediately sought out new fields of conquest .

		In the eight years that succeeded , Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	contributed to literature four independent historical works . ''

		Christo - pher
Columbus	LOCATION	and how he Revived and Im - parted the
Spirit of Discovery	ORGANIZATION	, '' 674 pages , appeared in
1891	DATE	.

		Next came '' Cartier to Frontenac , '' 379 pages ,
1894	DATE	.

		The next year `` The
Mississippi Basin	LOCATION	'' came out , 484 pages .

		And now , at the end of
1897	DATE	, we have '' The Westward Movement , '' 598 pages .

		These works all bear the same well-known marks thorough original investigation , strong grasp of material especially cartography , and ad - mirable synthesis of historical and scientific elements .

		These are all very great merits in an historical writer .

		In his chosen field no one denies , but all admit , Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's easy supe - riority ; he is a master indeed .

		But when we come to method and style , not so much can be said .

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	is never weak and is some - times picturesque ; but he has no claim to rank , to put it mildly , among the masters of historical composition .

		Still , his works are of solid and enduring value , and when all the facts attend - ing their production are considered , they reveal large resources and great productivity of mind .

		The last one is invested with a tender interest , coming to us , as it does , just after the author 's untimely death .

		It is painful to a student of American history to think that this field of study will never be enriched by further productions from Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's pen .

		We have spoken of the four volumes that have appeared since
1889	DATE	as independent works .

		In name they are so , but the last three in reality constitute a connected series , as is shown by their secondary titles , '' Geographical Dis - covery in the Interior of
North America	LOCATION	in its Historical Relations , 1534-1700 '' ; `` The
Strug	PERSON	- gle in
America	LOCATION	between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, 1697-1763 '' ; The Colonies and the Republic West of the Alleghanies , 1760-1798 . ''

		It is * THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT .

Republic West of the Alleghenies	LOCATION	, 1763-1798 .

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		plain that these volumes lay in their author 's mind as a series , even if he never spoke of them as such or gave them a collective name .

		In such a case , any possible division of the whole subject into separate books or volumes must be more or less arbitrary .

		Still , the present work is well marked off by its subject - matter from what came both before and after .

		It presents three closely connected groups of facts : First , the gathering of forces in the region west of the
Alleghany Mountains	LOCATION	follow - ing the French and Indian War that made it possible for the
United Colonies	ORGANIZATION	to contest its possession with
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the War of the Revolution ; secondly , the resulting contest , which culminated in the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	,
1783	DATE	, determining the first boundaries of the Repub - lic ; thirdly , the subsequent struggle whereby the Republic shook off the British hold of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	and the Spanish hold of the South - west , thus for the first time setting free all its members .

		The author of `` The Westward Movement '' thus describes the compass of the work : '' Adding the time which was necessary to carry out these treaties -LSB-
Jay 's , 1794	DATE	, and
San Lorenzo	LOCATION	,
1795	DATE	-RSB- , it is now an even hundred years since the title of the
United States	LOCATION	to this vast region lying between the
Appala	LOCATION	- chians , the Great Lakes , and the
Mississippi	LOCATION	was un - mistakably confirmed .

		For
more than thirty years after the peace of 1763	DATE	, the colonies and the Republic strug - gled to maintain the American spirit on this eastern - central area of the continent .

		Independence achieved , for twelve or fifteen years the
United States	LOCATION	strove to round out its territorial promise .

		The history of this Western region during all those years was constantly moulded by its geography , and it is the purpose of the present volume to show the ever - varying aspects of this struggle . ''

		The story closes -LRB- although the book itself lin - gers for another page -RRB- with the words : '' So ends the story of the rounding out of the terri - torial integrity of the Republic , as
Franklin	LOCATION	,
Adams	PERSON	, and
Jay	PERSON	had secured it in
1782	DATE	, against the indirection of our enemies , French , Spanish , and British . ''

		Within these limits lies , no doubt , the ablest exposition of the important topics they embrace which has ever been given to the public .

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	is called upon , in dealing with these topics , to pass judgment upon some mooted points .

		To two or three of these we shall direct attention .

		From the days when the American plenipo - tentiaries at
Paris	LOCATION	were struggling to bring the Revolutionary War to a successful diplomatic issue , there have been two opposing views of the real relation of the French Government at that time to our national integrity .

		As re - spects the West ,
England	LOCATION	was naturally dis - THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, posed to make the smallest concession that would meet the case ; while
Spain	LOCATION	was bound that the Republic should be shut up east of the
Mountains	LOCATION	, or , if admitted to the West , should be cribbed and confined within narrow limits .

		But what did
France	LOCATION	want ?

		Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	held , at the time , that Count de
Vergennes	LOCATION	, who for this purpose was
France	LOCATION	, was acting in good faith toward the
United States	LOCATION	; but
John Jay	PERSON	and
John Adams	PERSON	believed that he was secretly playing into the hands of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		These are the
Franklin	PERSON	and the Jay-Adams views of the situation , which have been pro- jected forward to the present time , and neither of which gives a sign of coming to an end .

		The question is a subject for a monograph ; we have space here to say but little more than that it is a fact for scholars to note that Dr. Win - sor , as the last sentence quoted above would suggest , throws the weight of his authority into the
Jay	PERSON	-
Adams	PERSON	scale .

		He holds that the pub - lications of
Circourt	LOCATION	,
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	,
Doniol	PERSON	, and
Stevens	PERSON	have justified the suspicions of the two negotiators rather than the confidence of the one . ''

		Vergennes ' present purpose was patent .

		He wished to weaken the
United States	LOCATION	, and he desired to have
England	LOCATION	acknowledge that the bounds of
Canada	LOCATION	ran to the
Ohio	LOCATION	, so that if ever a turn in fortune rendered it possible ,
France	LOCATION	could recover by treaty her possessions in the
St. Lawrence Valley	LOCATION	. ''

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	might have added , we think , with equal truth , that the French Minister also de - sired to gratify and to strengthen
Spain	LOCATION	.

		For - tunately , the difference of opinion among our representatives at
Paris	LOCATION	did not practically embarrass the negotiations ;
Jay	PERSON	boldly took the initiative in disregarding the instructions of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to consult the Most Christian King at every step ,
Franklin	PERSON	acquiesced , and the pre - liminary treaty of peace was concluded , so far as the Americans were concerned , upon the theory that
Vergennes	LOCATION	was playing double .

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	quotes
Shelburne	LOCATION	to the effect that Franklin '' wanted to do everything by cunning , '' and then adds : '' He was never more astute which may be a more pleasing word than in now yielding to
Adams	PERSON	and
Jay	PERSON	; and he was never more successfully judicious than in disarming the resentment of
Vergennes	LOCATION	when that minister discovered how he had been foiled . ''

		The arguments that disposed
England	LOCATION	to yield up the West is a subordinate , but still an interesting , question .

		It is common for his - torical writers , and especially for historical ora - tors , to point to the conquest of
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	as the decisive fact .

		No man who under - stands Western history will depreciate this bril - liant exploit ; still it is by no means certain that the conquest was the pivotal point on which the surrender turned .

		Some historical scholars certainly will be glad to liear Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	say : '' So the Spanish and French Bourbons were thwarted in reality by the adhesion of
England	LOCATION	to her old colonial charters , and by her purpose to make them an inheritance for her emancipated colonies .

		The conquest of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	by
Clark	PERSON	told in the final result rather more against the pretensions of
Spain	LOCATION	than against those of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		In formulating the American claims to the West , the
Committee of Congress	ORGANIZATION	threw the emphasis upon the chartered limits of the old colonies ; and yet , as already stated , men have not been wanting who denied that the charters had any considerable influence upon the issue .

		But whatever the fact may be , it is not a little curious that
England	LOCATION	, our bitter enemy , was more willing to give us the West than
France	LOCATION	, our firm ally , and
Spain	LOCATION	, the ally of
France	LOCATION	, were that we should have it .

		The Ordinance of
1787	DATE	presents two moot points , one relating to its origin and one to its authority .

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	utters no uncertain sound on either one .

		Once it was the fashion , in accordance with the ancient custom of em - phasizing individual lawgivers , to assign the principal credit of this famous act of legisla - tion to single men , as
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	or
Nathan Dane	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	, of course , adopts the newer and sounder view that several minds contributed to it valuable ideas ; but while not going so far as the late Dr.
W. F. Poole	PERSON	, who led the way in this direction , * he sees plain evidence of the hand of Dr.
Manasseh Cutler	PERSON	, one of the directors of the
Ohio Company of Associates	ORGANIZATION	.

		The other question , while less discussed , is perhaps even more doubtful .

		The form of the Ordinance is peculiarly impressive .

		The last six articles are called '' Articles of Compact between the Original States and the people and States in the said Territory , '' and are declared to be '' forever unalterable , '' '' unless by com - mon consent . ''

		The long struggle over the question of slavery in the Territories gave an added emphasis .

		One of the six articles fixed the boundaries of the future States to be formed out of the Territory ; and yet not one of these States to-day conforms , or practically ever has conformed , to these limits ;
Congress	ORGANIZATION	assumed materially to change lines , and sometimes in `` The North American Review , '' No. 251 : `` Dr.
Cutler	PERSON	and the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	. ''

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 the face of the strongest opposition of the
State	ORGANIZATION	or States affected .

		Again , another article for - ever prohibited slavery within the Territory ; and yet there were slaves , and there long con - tinued to be slaves , within the limits of every one of these States with the possible exception of
Ohio	LOCATION	, while in two if not three of them vig - orous efforts were made to give slavery a per - manent status .

		While these facts detract some - what from the solemnity of the Ordinance , we still think Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	dismisses it too lightly when he says : '' So the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	introduces us to nothing new in human progress .

		There was doubtless that in it which proved a guiding star for future legislation , as in the struggle over the slavery question in
Illinois	LOCATION	; but it may well be questioned if later enactments , without such a beacon , and keeping in sight the interests of the community as they arose , would not have made of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	all that it has become .

		The provisions of this fundamental law were operative just so far as the public interests demanded , and no further , and the public interests would have had their legitimate triumph unaided by it .

		The Ordinance simply shared this con - dition with all laws in communities which are self - respecting and free . ''

		On the other hand , it would not be difficult to show , in our opinion , that much of the large wedge of territory lying between the
Ohio	LOCATION	and
Mississippi	LOCATION	rivers , which reaches so far towards the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, would , to say the least , have been completely given over to slavery for a considerable term of years , as the territory on either side of it was , if it had not been for this powerful bulwark of free labor .

		The name '' Westward Movement '' is sin - gularly well chosen for such a work as this .

		Next to the planting of English civilization on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	slope in the first part of the seven - teenth century , the planting of American civili - zation in the
Great West	LOCATION	in the
second part of the eighteenth century	DATE	is the most impressive event in our history .

		This fact even scholars living east of what used to be called '' the Mountains '' are coming to understand .

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's valuable work will hasten the com - mon appreciation of this great event .

		As we have seen , the work closes with the execution of the treaties of
1794	DATE	and
1795	DATE	, which set free the Northwestern and South - western limbs of the young and growing Re - public .

		This consummation had been devoutly wished for , and striven for , by both people and government ever since
1783	DATE	.

		Once accom - plished , it became the point of departure for the first enlargement of the national dominion , the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, and for the ultimate bringing down of the national boundaries to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	and the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	, and their extension to the
Pacific	LOCATION	shore .

		It is mat - ter for deep regret that Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	did not live to tell the story of our national expansion .

		We have never understood , and do not now understand , why Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	, in the prepara - tion of his last three works , wholly refrained from naming his sources , save as an occasional one is mentioned in the text .

		It is a serious defect .

		The books are all provided with good indexes * B > A <
HINSDALE	LOCATION	.

		GRANT AND : LEE AS NATIONAL HEROES .

		* The issue together of volumes on Grant and Lee in such a series as that of the '' Heroes of the Nations '' gives the critic pause .

		The pub - lishers of this now deservedly popular series of biographies state in their prospectus that '' the current of each national life is distinctly indi - cated , and its picturesque and noteworthy pe - riods and episodes are presented for the reader , in their philosophical relation to each other as well as to universal history . ''

		Here is an explicit proposal to unfold not only the facts but also the underlying * truths of national life out of which those facts flow and by means of which they must be estimated .

		The historian who goes beyond the mere narrative to philosophical relations has assumed the responsibility , if not of a teacher , at least of a prophet , and we have a right to look to him for guidance in our effort to discriminate the good from the hurtful , the permanent from the transient , in national life and progress .

		With such a conception of the function of the historian of a people 's life , we are fain to ask the question , What is a national hero ?

		This may be said to involve the subordinate question , What is a hero ?

		There is no diffi - culty in arriving at a general consensus of opinion on this latter point .

		Men are pretty well agreed on the nature of true heroism , and cheerfully accord to the doer of a brave or self - sacrificing deed or series of deeds their word of praise , without reference to any larger environ - ment of fact or of idea .

		Heroes are to be found in every band of rebels , and heroism in associa - *

		But when one comes to the larger question , What is a national hero ?

		more complex ele - ments are to be faced , and a larger view of life is to be taken .

		Here also personal character may not enter in to make or to mar our estimate , albeit it assuredly may heighten or depress the sum total .

		But will anyone undertake calmly to say that any man is or can be a national hero the supreme effort and achievement of whose career is not efficient toward the life and pro- gress of the whole nation ?

		Far be it from any sane critic to say aught in disparagement of the nobility of soul and of character of that ' magnifi - cent soldier and man ,
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	.

		Men are coming more and more without regard to section to know that this was one of the sweet - est and serenest lives ever lived in the public gaze , and to recognize the transcendent military ability which so long held at bay a lengthening list of commanders , and yielded at last only when resistance was no longer possible .

		One will as readily grant that it was from a mistaken sense of duty that he conscientiously gave his sword to a cause whose motive principle offended his reason and outraged his heart , although aware that men of the South as brave and as conscientious as he abandoned their homes to fight in the ranks marshalled against their people , or else remained to face obloquy and ostracism .

		But that man was no secession - ist who wrote , as late as
January 23 , 1861	DATE	, the words : '' As an American citizen I take great pride in my country , her prosperity and her institutions , and would defend any State if her rights were invaded .

		But I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than a dissolution of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would be an accumula - tion of all the evils we complain of , and I am willing to sacrifice everything but honour for its preservation .

		I hope , therefore , that all constitutional means will be ex - hausted before there is a resort to force .

		Secession is nothing but revolution .

		The framers of our Constitu - tion never exhausted so much labour , wisdom , and for - bearance in its formation , and surrounded it with so many guards and securities , if it was intended to be broken by every member of the Confederacy at will .

		It is intended for ' perpetual Union , ' so expressed in the preamble , and for the establishment of a government , not a compact , which can only be dissolved by revolu - tion , or the consent of all the people in convention as - sembled .

		It is idle to talk of secession : anarchy would have been established , and not a government , by Wash - ington ,
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Jefferson	PERSON	,
Madison	PERSON	, and all the other patriots of the Revolution ... Still , a Union that can only be maintained by swords and bayonets , and in which strife and civil war are to take the place of brotherly love and kindness , has no charm for me .

		I shall mourn for my country and for the welfare and progress of mankind .

		If the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is dissolved and the Govern - ment disrupted , I shall return to my native State and share the miseries of my people , and , save in defense , will draw my sword on none . ''

		It affects this not at all that the Preamble says nothing about '' perpetual union , '' as Lee supposed .

		With the sound of his patriotic words in our ears , one turns page after page of his latest biography with profound melancholy .

		One looks in vain in these four hundred and fifty pages for a calm and adequate estimate of one who was probably the greatest master of military strategy this country has produced , of one who was as pure and unselfish in all his personal life as he was sadly mistaken in his public career .

		The author is too busy in posing as the champion of a lost cause , which time and public opinion have decided not to be a national one or a good one , and which we leave to the condemnation spoken by the words above quoted , ever to take time to do full justice to his hero .

		It is pitiful , in these closing years of the century , to read that '' in the planter 's home the African learned to set a higher value upon the domestic virtues which he saw illustrated in the lives of Christian men and women '' ; to see all the social features of '' the peculiar institution '' set down in the credit column , and only the economic results debited to the powers of evil .

		Let
Lee	PERSON	's own words `` I think it is a greater evil to the white race than to the black race '' be a sufficient answer , though it but half lift the veil from the festering plague-spot of slavery .

		One learns in this book despite
Lee	PERSON	's opinion to the contrary that the idea of the fathers , one and all , did not go further than a temporary and `` trial '' union ; that '' slowly upward toward a fitness for citizenship this mild servitude was lifting the negro . ''

		The Dred
Scott	PERSON	decision is handled as reverently as the ark of the covenant ; one would never gather here that it marked the lowest humiliation of our great court , or that it was obiter dicta .

		One reads regarding Lincoln that '' want of accurate knowledge concerning the origin of the
Federal Union	ORGANIZATION	inspired the historical errors of the Inaugural Address of
March 4 , 1861	DATE	, which was merely the untenable theory of original consolidation , '' and that '' President
Lincoln	PERSON	ventured to designate a committee 's recommendation in
1774	DATE	as a legal instrument establishing a government ! ''

		Of his
Gettysburg	LOCATION	speech we learn that it was '' a masterpiece of rhetorical beauty , and also of the art of shifting great issues . ''

		Of
McClellan	PERSON	, in the
summer of 1862	DATE	, it is said that '' while he was glorying in the title accorded him of * the
Young Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	, '
Lee	PERSON	, on the other hand ,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 was bending every energy to collect the scat - tered Confederates . ''

		But one 's melancholy is quickened into something like indignation , when , turning to the title-page , he reads that this belated exploiter of dead institutions and dead theories of government , who writes the symbols of a double doctorate after his name , is a professor of history in an
American Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , and that one which bears the name of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It is a misfortune for the grand '' Old Dominion '' that its sons are still being taught such strange things in the name of truth , and that the true music of such a har - monious life , personally , as that of Lee should be marred by such an accompaniment .

		One note sounds true in the book .

		It is the presen - tation of the folly of reconstruction methods , which the lamented death of Lincoln made pos - sible .

		Forcible in their antitheses are the fol - lowing sentences : '' The war of aggression against the
Southern States	LOCATION	had been prosecuted upon Lincoln 's theory that these states were still in the
Union	LOCATION	, and could not possibly get out .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	dealt with them upon the theory that the war had left them out of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and they could not enter within except through the mercy of the con - querors , who held them as subjugated provinces ! ''

		The narrative , in this book , of Lee 's cam - paigns is spirited and well done , and if this had been the main theme small room for criticism could be found .

		The same commendation may be given to
Colonel Church	ORGANIZATION	's volume on Grant .

		This writer has handled the military life of his hero with great discernment , and has made a fine summary .

		Here again , however , although the many personal touches espe - cially from the earlier life of Grant are pleasing , there is no attempt at an estimate of the military man , although the constant pres - ence in these pages of three out of four of the greatest soldiers of our age Grant ,
Lee	PERSON	,
Sher	PERSON	- man ,
Johnston	PERSON	continually suggests one .

		The very different character of the task given each one of these men , involving not only military accomplishment , but also resources of men , equipment , and transport , makes a comparison as impossible as it is undesirable .

		It is not necessary to disparage either Lee or Grant for the purpose of estimating the other .

		Each made mistakes , especially in his earlier cam - paigning in

		Each had abilities which the other lacked .

		Professor White makes the most of such criticism on Grant as is found in
Walker	PERSON	's '' History of the
Second Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	, '' with reference to Cold Harbor ; and
Colonel Church	ORGANIZATION	's sketch does not meet fully such attack .

		But General Grant was frank to criticize his own mistakes in his '' Per - sonal Memoirs . ''

		There is , however , a steadily growing conviction that the highest mark of his genius is found in his `` having his own way '' in the face of the political mismanagers at
Washington	LOCATION	, and even of public opinion a thing that all his military predecessors had not been able to dare to do .

		This large cour - age to go ahead and hew out his own road in spite of all adverse criticism was the one thing the nation needed to constrain the genius of Lee , and it could afford even the costly experi - ments of the campaigns from the Rapidan to the James in
1884	DATE	to give such a rider a firm and commanding seat .

		The simplicity of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's nature is well set forth , even in the mistakes which it made pos - sible ; and he comes forth with credit even from the disastrous personal experiences which cast a gloom over his last days .

		The great , simple - hearted , silent warrior , who fought that the land might have peace , and whose grandest voucher as a great commander is found in the undying loyalty of his peer
Sherman	PERSON	stands unadorned in these pages .

		Many who can not share the satisfaction of
Colonel Church	ORGANIZATION	in his contemplation of the presidential career , and who , regretting that the drnm-and-fife theory of government forced the great captain into a political career for which his simple-minded honesty unfitted him , would gladly have seen him pass from his battle record to the rewards of private life , will be content to leave him to his military fame .

		And to that other , while not a hero of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, they will ever give the homage of respect and admiration due to a great soul which , sorely tried , went on its chosen way with an humble and reverent spirit to the end .

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the
United States	LOCATION	, may be regarded as attempts of this sort , and as representing what is likely to be one of the chief phases of the work of geologists in the future , namely , the construc - tive or synthetic phase .

		While the analysis which must precede this sort of work may not yet be complete in any field , it has gone so far in many that synthesis is profitable , even if not final .

		That it is not final , none know better than those who attempt it .

		In the preface to his work on `` Ancient Volcanoes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' Sir
Archibald Geikie	PERSON	says that a book which is abreast of our knowledge to-day begins to be left behind to-morrow .

		While this is probably measurably true , the volumes before us are at least up to date now , and are not likely to become antiquated for a long time to come .

		Sir
Archibald Geikie	PERSON	has become well known as one of the few geologists able to present a technical subject in a semi-popular way without sacrificing the accuracy of the subject-matter involved ; and his present work will in no way detract from his reputation in this line .

		While , as the title indicates , the object is to give an account of the ancient volcanoes of Great Brit - ain , this account is prefaced by a series of chapters that prepare the reader not already thoroughly familiar with this phase of geology for an appreciation of that which follows .

		The introductory chapters give a brief but adequate glance at the views which have prevailed at various times concerning the nature of volca - noes , a brief statement concerning the causes of volcanic activity , a discussion of volcanic products , and a general account of existing volcanoes , from the study of which geologists have learned how to study and interpret the volcanoes of the past .

		But this introductory study of existing volcanoes is in itself most in - structive , far in advance of most text-books .

		The special merit , or at any rate one of the special merits , of this part of the work lies in the fact that volcanoes are looked at from the historic -LRB- in a geological sense -RRB- point of view .

		Existing volcanoes are described as the descend - ants of a long line of ancestors , and their full significance is seen only when studied in the light of this ancestry .

		Only when so studied do they throw their true light on the problems of the physical evolution of the globe .

		The in - troduction of this historical idea into the study of existing volcanoes is an admirable prepara - tion for the more detailed portion of the work , in which the author 's aim , stated in his own language , is as follows : '' I shall try to show the nature and relative import - ance of the records of ancient volcanoes ; how these records , generally so fragmentary , may be pieced to - gether so as to be made to furnish the history which they contain ; how their relative chronology maybe es - tablished ; how their testimony may be supplemented in such wise that the position of long vanished seas , lands , rivers , and lakes may be ascertained ; and how , after ages of geological revolution , volcanic rocks that have lain long buried under the surface now influence the scenery of the regions where they have once more been exposed to view . ''

		In carrying out this plan , the author has taken pains to make sharp distinctions between facts and theories , and between theories that are well founded and those that are merely speculative .

		The study of the ancient volcanoes is taken up historically .

		There is an account of the vol - canoes and volcanic rocks of each of the several great divisions of geological time , beginning with the pre-Cambrian .

		Those of Cambrian , Silurian ,
Devonian	LOCATION	,
Carboniferous	LOCATION	, and Ter - tiary ages are dealt with successively .

		In the case of each period , the study of volcanoes is taken up much as it might be in the case of ex - isting or recent volcanoes ; that is , the ancient volcanoes are studied with reference to their types of eruption , the conditions under which the eruptions took place , the character of the products discharged , the variations in these products during a period of activity , etc. .

		In discussing the volcanic action of the vari - ous periods , the author has frequently taken pains to bring out at the same time the salient points in the physical geography of Great Brit - ain ; thus , we find sections with such headings as '' The Physical Geography of the Cambrian Period , '' and `` Land and Sea of Silurian Times . ''

		These topics , which at first thought might appear to be outside the scope of the volume , really have a bearing upon the main theme under consideration .

		This ability to comprehend and portray the broad relations of things constitutes one of the charms of
Sir Archibald	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		The study of the ancient volcanoes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	has led to many general conclusions which are of interest .

		The ancient volcanoes are found to be distributed in a belt running length - wise of the island and along its west side .

		They have been so widely distributed in time that the persistence of volcanic activity is to be regarded as one of the great facts of geological history .

		Furthermore , the volcanic activity has been intermittent .

		Nearly every great division of Paleozoic time namely , Cambrian , Silurian -LRB- Lower -RRB- ,
Devonian	LOCATION	, and
Carboniferous	LOCATION	has had its great series of eruptions ; but there was
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 general quiet , so far as this phase of activity was concerned , in the Upper Silurian .

		The Meso - zoic periods seem not to have been marked by volcanic activity within the area considered , but such activity was renewed in the early Tertiary .

		While extending through this great range of time , the periods of activity have been separated by long intervals of quiescence .

		The same localities have served repeatedly for the dis - charge of lava and other igneous products .

		Thus , in southwestern
England	LOCATION	there were great eruptions in the Devonian , the
Subcarbonifer	PERSON	- ous , and the
Permian	LOCATION	.

		In southern
Scotland	LOCATION	, within a very restricted area , there were Silu - rian ,
Devonian	LOCATION	,
Carboniferous	LOCATION	, and Permian eruptions .

		Another important conclusion is that the sites of volcanoes , throughout the his - tory of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, were not determined by any obvious structure in the rocks now visible .

		They were not usually connected with faults , even when faults existed near the volcanic region .

		Again , it seems to be clearly indicated that the volcanic vents were , as a rule , on low land rather than on high , throughout the course of the physical history of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The great series of volcanic rocks occuring in the central hollow of the Scottish midlands found their way to the surface in a region which was a great depression at the time they were ex - truded .

		The great Tertiary eruptions took place in the depression between the outer ridge of the Hebrides and the mainland of
Scotland	LOCATION	; while the Permian volcanoes were all in valleys , the adjacent highlands being free from them .

		It is suggested that '' a difference of a few hun - dreds or thousands of feet in the depth of over - lying rock , such as the difference of height between the bottom of a valley and the tops of the adjacent hills , may determine the path of escape for the magna through the least thick - ness of overarching roof . ''

		The conclusion is reached that periods of general crustal disturbance were in a general way periods when volcanic activity was great , and that periods of crustal quiescence were periods during which volcanic action was least .

		The Lower Silurian period was a period of general crustal disturbance in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and these disturbances were accompanied by great volcanic activity .

		The Upper Silurian was a period of general quiet , and there was little volcanic activity .

		The great disturbances of the Old Red Sandstone period were acom - panied or followed by great outpourings of lava ; while the Tertiary volcanic activity , perhaps the greatest in the history of the island , was con - nected in time with the latest great orographic movements of
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		Another conclusion of moment is that there has been essential uniformity of volcanism since the known beginnings of geological history .

		While volcanic activity has been widely distri - buted throughout geological time , the periods of eruption during the Paleozoic seem to con - stitute a diminishing series from Lower Silu - rian to
Permian	LOCATION	, the periods of activity being separated by intervals of quiescence .

		After the Permian there was a long period of qui - escence , following which volcanic activity was renewed on a scale greater than at any previous time : so that it can not be concluded that vol - canic activity is declining .

		The study of the igneous rocks of all ages leads to the conclusion that there is no less and no greater variety of igneous matter in recent than in earlier times , showing that there has been an essential uni - formity of products as well as of activities .

		The study of the ancient volcanoes also shows that there is a recognizable sequence in the nature of the materials erupted during a single volcanic period , from the earliest to the latest times , and that , in spite of occasional departures , the normal order remains broadly uniform .

		In general , the earlier eruptions of each period were most basic and the later most acid , indi - cating that there was in the course of a single period of igneous activity a progressive dimi - nution in the quantity of bases and a corre - sponding increase in the proportion of acids in the lavas discharged .

		The fact that the igneous rocks of various periods are essentially the same , even in the same locality , shows that the magma from which the discharges proceeded must have been renewed from time to time during the period of quiescence , so that the nature and succession of lavas brought out at one period are much the same as those of another .

		The volumes are illustrated by nearly 400 figures , and by seven maps which show the dis - tribution of the volcanoes and igneous rocks of the several periods .

		Professor
Russell	PERSON	's work on the volcanoes of
North America	LOCATION	covers a much wider area than the work just considered , but a correspond - ingly more restricted period of time .

		Its object is `` to make clear the principal features of vol - canoes in general , and to place in the hands of students a concise account of the leading facts thus far discovered concerning the physical features of
North America	LOCATION	which can be traced directly to the influence of volcanic action . ''

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, The scope of this volume is therefore much more limited than that of the preceding work .

		The time is not yet ripe for a treatise on the ancient volcanoes of
North America	LOCATION	corresponding in detail to that on the volcanoes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Before this shall be possible , years of careful work must be done .

		Nevertheless , Professor
Russell	PERSON	's volume , which does not attempt more than is now possible , is a welcome summary of our present knowledge concerning existing and recent volcanoes from the point of view an - nounced by the author .

		Like the author of the preceding volumes , Professor
Russell	PERSON	has devoted an introductory chapter to the discussion of volcanic phenomena in general .

		Following this are chapters devoted to such topics as `` Types of Volcanoes , '' `` Stages in the Lives of Volcanoes , '' '' Characteristics of the Products of Volcanoes , '' '' Profiles of Vol - canic Mountains , '' '' Structure of Volcanic Mountains , '' `` Erosion of Volcanic Mountains , '' '' Subterranean Intrusions , '' and '' Character - istics of Igneous Rocks . ''

		Subsequent chap - ters deal with the general question of the dis - tribution of volcanoes in
North America	LOCATION	, and give longer or shorter descriptions of the vol - canoes of the different portions of the continent .

		Following the chapters which describe the active and extinct volcanoes of
Central America	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	, an account is given of our present knowledge concerning the deposits of volcanic dust .

		A general discussion of the causes of volcanic activity follows the descriptive portion of the volume .

		These state - ments concerning the contents of the volume may suffice to indicate the ground which it covers ; and if it be added that these various topics are treated in such a way as to justify the explanatory title , '' A reading lesson for stu - dents of geology and geography , '' the character of the work will be made clear .

		One of the important and attractive features of the book is its treatment of many of the curious and striking geographic features of the Far West , a region which is as yet too little known even to those who are charged with the direction of geographic study .

		Throughout the work , too , Professor
Russell	PERSON	has introduced the historical idea into his descriptions of the subject-matter in hand , as the topics '' Stages in the Lives of Volcanoes '' and '' The Life - history of a Volcano '' sufficiently show .

		This gives the volume an additional value to teachers , as this is an element which has generally re - ceived far too little consideration .

		The chapter on the deposits of volcano dust deals with a phase of volcanic products which is less familiar than most others .

		The great abundance of such dust , and its wide distribu - tion , give rise to a conception of volcanic activ - ity in
North America	LOCATION	within recent times which is not commonly held .

		In view of the object of the volume , Professor
Russell	PERSON	is perhaps justified in giving some rein to the imagination in connection with this subject .

		He says : '' The great abundance of volcanic dust in the Cor - dilleran region , its wide distribution , and its occurrence in numerous instances at many horizons in the same ver - tical section , is evidence that vast areas in
Western North America	LOCATION	have been shrouded in darkness at many sepa - rate periods , and have time and again witnessed horrors like those which overwhelmed
Pompeii	LOCATION	and
Hercula	ORGANIZATION	- neum .

		Disasters similar to those accompanying the eruptions of Conseguina and Krakatoa occurred at in - tervals throughout the Tertiary and Recent history of fully one-half of
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		The effects of these discharges of volcanic dust , as conceived by Professor
Russell	PERSON	, are thus ex - pressed : '' The volcanic dust of the
Pacific	LOCATION	states sometimes contains the bones of mammals and is frequently charged with quantities of leaves , showing that some of the tem - pests generated by volcanic agencies were disastrous to animal and plant life .

		These and related disturbances in environment probably had much to do with the modi - fication and extinction especially of the higher mam - malian species . ''

		The chapter devoted to a consideration of the causes of volcanic action includes an ele - mentary statement of the principles believed to be concerned , and of the various theories that have been advocated as to the methods according to which these principles work .

		The discussion touches the vital points in the explanation of volcanoes , and in such a way as to be readily understood by readers of maturity , even though their knowledge of geology and allied sciences be meagre .

		While this discussion does not contain much that purports to be especially new , the presentation of the subject is much better than that which appears in most text - books .

		Incidentally , some original suggestions are introduced which are well worthy of con - sideration .

		Professor
Russell	PERSON	's book will be a valuable work of reference for students of geology in the last years of high school , and for maturer students who are interested in geology and geography , even though their preparatory stud - ies in these subjects have been neglected .

		The volume is illustrated by sixteen plates , some of which are maps , and some of which are half - tone reproductions of notable volcanic peaks .

		THE DIAL , 17 THE FEMININE INTERPRETATION OF JESUS .

		* It sometimes appears as if the more learned a life of Jesus is made the less it reveals the personality it seeks to portray .

		Such learned treatises are very numerous and very useful ; but the number is small of biographies of Jesus which make his career much more than a string upon which to hang archaeological disquisitions and pious reflections .

		Indeed , it is as rare to find a life of Jesus in English that is a true narrative as it is to find one that is scientific in its method .

		It is therefore with interest that one turns to a biography of Jesus produced by a skilled story-teller who has at the same time deep sympathies with things that make for beauty and righteousness .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	characterizes her '' Story '' as a narrative that , and nothing more .

		Yet the title itself shows that such a narrative is intended to set forth some conception of who and what Jesus was .

		Such a method is legiti - mate , though unusual in this class of literature .

		It is simply doing for the Gospel what the writer of an historical novel does for his sources .

		Granting that the writer 's imagination is kept within the bounds of what his sources make probable , and that facts are not distorted in the interest of some theory , there is no reason why a character should not be set forth in action as well as by description .

		But these two conditions are absolute .

		As regards the present volume , it can be said that from the point of view of sober historical investigation there is nothing in it worthy of the attention of scholars .

		The general chro - nological scheme of the life of Jesus is that of the conventional harmony of the most conserva - tive sort .

		It is true that some of the difficulties that beset an uncritical handling of the text are obviated by judicious omissions and the proper placing of emphasis in treatment ; but that an interpretative narrative really should aid one in solving such problems of harmoniza - tion as the two cleansings of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	is not to be expected .

		Such few archaeological ele - ments as are introduced are treated with the experienced touch of a maker of novels ; but they are those to be found in almost any life of Christ , and are simply details necessary for literary treatment .

		The same is true of geo - graphical references , although here accuracy is less pronounced and one becomes at times some - * THE STORY OF JESUS CHBIST : An Interpretation .

		what confused in following the footsteps or the vision of Jesus .

		Altogether , in all matters in which scholarship is indispensable and of pri - mary importance the volume is justly regarded by its author as outside of criticism .

		In the region , however , in which the book does profess to be of help , much more can be said in its behalf .

		As one possibly might ex - pect , the narrative at times is somewhat over - told , the dramatic incidents are sometimes over - worked , the completeness of the biography at times is sacrificed to the necessities of dramatic interest .

		But none the less , it is graphic , earnest , and successful in presenting the inter - pretation intended .

		If one is tempted to say that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has preferred to describe mira - cles rather than teaching , to strain out the less difficult elements of the
Gospel	ORGANIZATION	narrative while accepting those about which the critic feels the least confidence , to follow Renan though at a great distance into the uncertain ways of a romance , the reply is ready that such must of necessity be the method of a narrative , and that such elements also may very well be elements in the interpretation .

		And what is the interpretation ?

		The Jesus who looks out from these pages is not a strong , resistless Messiah .

		Despite his ability to raise the dead , and walk on the waves , and feed thousands with a few loaves , he is continually questioning himself as to himself and his mis - sion ; he is repeatedly brought to the verge of despair by the uncertainties that overhang his mission ; he grows weak with alternating periods of exaltation and depression ; he looks much with deep eyes at other souls in silence ; he barely escapes hysteria under severest strain ; he hears about him hosts of unseen spirits .

		Withal , he is passionately religious , but trust - ing ever to his intuition rather than to his reason .

		And thus , altogether , he is a woman and not a man .

		Strong and spiritual , he is not strong and spiritual after a man 's fashion .

		The interpretation is unexpected , is doubtless un - conscious , but as one re-reads the volume it is indubitable .

		And thus we have a new contribution to the ceaseless effort to interpret the personality of Jesus .

		For that this work really adds to our knowledge of him , one can not for a moment doubt .

		All that subtle , emotional life which the mere scholar especially if he be a man so soon outgrows is discerned by the one who comes like Mary to sit in sympathy rather than in analysis and philosophy .

		In the hands of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	some things that have escaped the 18 THE DIAL -LSB-

		PROBLEMS or SELF AND OF SOCIETY .

		* Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	follows up his work on '' Men -
tal Development	ORGANIZATION	in the Child and in the Race '' with a very important and interesting contribution to social psychology .

		The point to be investigated is the relation of individual to social development , and the extent to which one throws light on the other .

		The author describes three methods of dealing with this problem the historic , the sociological , and the genetic ; and he proposes to use the last , without excluding the others .

		This method '' inquires into the psychological development of the human indi - vidual in the earlier stages of his growth , for light upon his social nature , and also upon the social organization in which he bears a part . ''

		The men - tal development of infancy has been the author 's favorite field of study , and his illustrations have the freshness of direct personal observation .

		The volume is divided into two books one on the Person -LRB- 446 pages -RRB- , and the other on Society -LRB- 198 pages -RRB- .

		The discussion of the '' imitative person '' shows the process by which new elements find their way into the life of the soul .

		Social heredity is carefully distinguished from physical heredity .

		The person is built up by assimilating the life of society .

		He becomes himself by becoming a social creature .

		There is no such contradiction between self interest and social interest as Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- jamin
Kidd	PERSON	assumes .

		It is rational for a man to further the common good because his reason itself would not exist save through the creative forces in - herent in society .

		The social person is always an inventor , making discoveries for himself if not for the world .

		Im - portant aids to the inventive process are language , play , and art .

		Play , for example , is not merely the outburst of superabundant vitality running to waste , and it is more than mere imitation of the serious labors of adults ; it is actual training for the motions , gestures , labors , and arts of the community .

Funk A Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The true genius is an inventor in a larger sense than is the average man , but he is not isolated from his kind .

		If he has ability of the highest order , and is thoroughly sane , he will see what is practi - cable and useful .

		There is risk of society thinking him a visionary or a rebel ; but there is also a possi - bility of the insane man imagining himself a genius .

		Under the caption '' The Person 's Equipment '' we have an analysis of instincts , emotions , intelli - gence , and sentiments , and an account of the man - ner in which they are formed by social factors , and yet tend to rise above the level of the actual at new points .

		The person is held to his task by certain '' sanctions , '' and these are not merely outward con - straints , but impulses , desires , ethical and religious sentiments , which are social products .

		Coming to the brief concluding chapters on So - ciety , we find the person set in the only environ - ment which is natural to him .

		The person is the '' particularizing '' force , and society generalizes elements of progress introduced by individuals .

		It is by this reciprocity between habitual conduct and custom on the one hand , and finer or wider accom - modations on the other hand , that society moves onward .

		Strong emphasis is laid upon the distinc - tion between the matter of social organization and the functional method .

		The matter of social or - ganization '' consists of thoughts : by which is meant all sorts of intellectual states , such as imaginations , knowledges , and informations . ''

		The process of social organization turns on the imitative function .

		The person '' reaches his subjective understanding of the social copy by imitation , and then he con - firms his interpretations by another imitative act by which he ejectively reads his self-thought into the persons of others .

		Each of these stages is essen - tial to his growth as a person , and so also is it essential to the growth of society .

		For society grows by imitative generalization of the thoughts of individuals .

		No brief summary can do justice to the wealth of suggestions of this vigorous treatise .

		But a few words of interrogation may put readers on their guard , and set them upon a search for omitted fac - tors in social organization ; and the caution is sug - gested by the author himself in several places .

		We are distinctly told that the historical and sociologi - cal methods , with the data of anthropology and analysis of institutions , are used only in a subordi - nate way .

		The phenomena held in the foreground are those of infant life .

		One may accept as probable the hypothesis that the child recapitulates the pre - vious social history of mankind , and reproduces in his attainment of selfhood the '' dialectic '' by which society advances from mob impulses to ethical con - trol .

		But if the best method of learning the process of child development is to watch and interpret their physical manifestations of psychical life , then the most fruitful and reliable method of studying social psychology must be directly to observe and interpret the embodiments and relations of society in its in - stitutions .

		Since the infant is a product of social 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 history and a prophecy of the social future , we should carefully study him ; but human society never was composed entirely of infants .

		We fully agree with the author 's rejection of the reduction of sociology to a sort of biology , and of the whole process of reasoning from biological analogies .

		An adequate study of the individual mind must , however , consider the relation of mind to body ; and so an adequate study of society must have regard to the material forms which are the revelation of social life and the means of its progress .

		Therefore we may hesitate to accept as final and complete this summary -LRB- p. 522 -RRB- : '' The organiza - tion which is effected in social life is , in all its forms , a psychological organization .

		Its materials are psychological materials : thoughts , with all their issue in desires , impulses , sanctions , consciences , sentiments . ''

		In
New England	LOCATION	graveyards one sees carved on the ancient tombstones images of saints or angels , bodiless figures with only faces and wings .

		The effect on the modern mind is grotesque .

		Society as we know it in this world exists on the land and sea , draws its physical energies from soil and air , and every one of its members is a composite being with all the parts and organs of an animal .

		Ade - quate synthesis of social studies compels a full rec - ognition of what Schaffle calls `` the Social Body . ''

		Yet if we had to choose between the crude material - istic and biological sociology , which has about run its course , and this ultra-spiritual view , we should choose the latter , and agree with the closing word of the eminent psychologist : '' The true analogy is not that which likens society to a physiological organ - ism , but rather that which likens it to a psychological organization .

		And the sort of psychological organi - zation to which it is analogous is that which is found in the individual in ideal thinking . ''

		The Elementary treatise on
City Government	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Delos F. Wilcox	PERSON	, not only makes good use of excellent authorities , but it also goes to sources and draws from them fresh materials .

		The author con - siders three principal topics : the functions of city government , the problems of control , and the prob - lems of organization .

		The style is clear ; the analyses of subjects is suggestive ; and the literary form adapts the book for use as text-book or as a reading - book .

		It is encouraging to find at least a suggestion that a city is not primarily nor principally a political organization .

		It is to be hoped we may some day have a work on cities which gives more attention to the social tendencies , wants , organizations , interests , which constitute their real life .

		This is hinted on page 15 : '' The practical task of political economy and sociology is the assignment of functions to the state and its agents on the one hand , and to indi - viduals and voluntary organizations on the other .

		Politics or political science treats of the methods of fulfilling the functions assigned to the state and its agents . ''

		And also on page 237 : '' Back of the merely political problems of the city lie the great problems of social development . '' ''

		The Coming People '' discussed by Mr.
Charles F. Dole	PERSON	are the products of natural selection in a rational and ethical universe .

		The old moral virtues of honesty , veracity , kindness , justice , are not feeble ideals of optimistic dreams , but their sanctions are in the actual world .

		The might of the cosmos is in them .

		The modern world is producing a higher type .

		For the care of long-horned cattle , wild and fierce , we need rude cow-boys , with revolvers and long whips ; but for sleek short-horns and well-bred Jerseys , another and finer type of man must be chosen as keepers .

		This is the theme of Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's attractive and inspiring book .

		It is a series of ser - mons , optimistic , bearing with stress upon the moral sense , not specially instructive for the student of special social sciences and problems , and giving bare outlines of the ethical ideals of social coopera - tion .

		The severe cost and pains by which progress must be paid for are not overlooked .

		The writer is sane , well-informed , awake to the infamies which blot our civilization , and without any panacea for human ills ; but he is always clear as to the power which makes for righteousness , always sure that iniquity is feeble and truth alone is strong .

		It is a noble and healthy book , by one who has long taught men to regard the duties of society as sacred , and now shows that these duties are based on a rational , practical , and religious view of life .

		The author of '' Moral Evolution '' excites expec - tations of good writing and intelligent interpreta - tions .

		His little treatise on '' Inequality and Pro- gress '' is suggestive and sane .

		Democracy and Christianity both declare for the right of utmost self-development for every human being .

		Before the law , every individual must have a fair hearing .

		In religious belief , all are children of a common Father .

		But equality does not exist as a matter of fact in this world where the Divine will gives law , and where democracy is advancing to supremacy .

		Physically and intellectually , human beings are un - like , and must treat each other according to their natures and capacities .

		Education that treats all pupils alike is a humiliating failure .

		Progressive methods tend to give scope to individuality and variety of talents .

		Progress secures variety and is dependent upon it There must be leaders , if so - ciety is to move onward .

		Monotony is stagnation .

		We live by the awakening and satisfaction of new wants .

		We rise to better ethical and spiritual levels by admiration of superiors .

		Envy is a mean and degrading vice .

		The noble monument of the late Dr.
W. H. Ryder	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, the lecture endowment '' in aid of the moral and social welfare of the citizens of
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' has been the occasion of bringing to the public one of Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	's most powerful and wholesome discussions .

		The aims and limitations of the book , '' Social Facts and Forces , '' are frankly stated by the author : '' No one will expect to find within a space so limited an adequate investigation of subjects so large .

		I have tried to seize upon 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, some of the salient points , and especially to empha - size the tendencies which affect conduct and shape character . ''

		The subjects discussed are the factory , the labor union , the corporation , the railway , the city , the church .

		Technical adaptation of means to ends he usually leaves to experts within each or - ganization ; Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	's purpose is to criticize the ethical value of the ends of action , the results in character .

		The reader is compelled at every step to inquire what will be the social consequences of a particular method of producing wealth and accu - mulating fortunes .

		In one large volume one may now find , for the first time , a brief and clear statement of nearly every important reform movement of our age . ''

		The Encyclopedia of Social Reform '' includes , as we learn from the sub-title , `` political economy , polit - ical science , sociology , statistics , anarchism , chari - ties , civil service , currency , land and legislation , penology , socialism , social purity , trades unions , woman suffrage , '' etc. .

		Some of the articles are signed by leaders of the various movements repre - sented .

		Advocates of the reforms have been chosen to state the case , but the divergent views are also given a hearing .

		There may be some advantage given to editorial positions , but there is a manifest purpose to give the strongest positions of opposing parties .

		The dictionary form of the work makes it very convenient for reference , but breaks up the systematic and organic discussion of particular sub - jects .

		The references are fairly complete for pop - ular uses .

		No profession of service to scholars is made , as specialists do not depend on cyclopaedias .

		For persons remote from libraries , who wish to have a brief statement of the socializing movements of our time , this volume is the best available , and it is unique in its field .

		SOME RECENT STUDIES IN PHIL.OSOPHT .

		* Perhaps the most notable recent contribution to philosophy in
America	LOCATION	is Professor
G. T. Ladd	PERSON	's large volume entitled '' The Philosophy of Knowl - edge . ''

		and of Self , '' '' Implicates of Knowledge , '' '' Truth and Error , '' '' Knowledge and Reality , '' ''
Knowl	PERSON	- edge and the Absolute . ''

		These subjects , whose treatment is embraced under the technical name of Epistemology , are the ones upon which modern philosophy more and more concentrates , and are here treated comprehensively and fairly , and so clearly and untechnically that most educated persons will have no difficulty in following the writer .

		Pro- fessor
Ladd	PERSON	starts from the common consciousness , and , indeed , in a measure vindicates it throughout ; and his constant assumption is the '' I know '' of common consciousness .

		The fundamental assump - tions of the ordinary unreflecting man are shown to have in them a real basis of philosophic truth , and hence the philosopher can not look down in scorn upon the plain man of every-day life .

		But the author proceeds far beyond common-sense realism , and formulates a critical idealistic realism .

		The Self is the key throughout .

		Self-knowledge , the '' I know , '' appears to Professor
Ladd	PERSON	as the clear - est and most certain knowledge , and altogether un - assailable , and so the basis of all knowledge .

		The mind is capable of knowing a world of things or objects only as they are in some sense other-selves , and these as the expression of the
Absolute Self	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another prominent point in the author 's method is the making of knowledge an expression of the whole man , and not an isolated faculty .

		Feeling and will are closely connected with knowledge , and he even goes so far -LRB- page 187 -RRB- as to make feeling the essence of cognition , or again -LRB- page 502 -RRB- he makes cogni - tion '' a species of conduct . ''

		From this unitary point of view , he sharply criticises
Kant	PERSON	.

		There is also much criticism of scepticism and agnosticism in general .

		While Professor
Ladd	PERSON	has learned much from
Lotze	LOCATION	,
Wundt	LOCATION	,
Paulsen	PERSON	, and other German philosophers , he has re-thought the whole into an original exposition and criticism .

		Although we miss in this work that high degree of demonstration , that definiteness and closeness of thought , and that thorough originality of treatment , which character - ize a great philosophical treatise , yet by its suggest - iveness and comprehensiveness , by its clearness and force , it must be assigned a prominent place in American philosophy .

		Professor
Borden P. Bowne	PERSON	's '' Theory of Thought and Knowledge '' is a slighter performance than the foregoing , and at the same time covers a wider field .

		Of the three divisions of philosophy logic , epistemology , and metaphysics this present book is a sketch of the first two divisions .

		By logic is meant , of course , not formal logic , but a philo - sophical discussion of notion , judgment , inference , deduction and induction , the categories , etc. , in re - lation to truth ; in short , a general theory of thought in all its forms and functions .

		The last third of the book is taken up with the theory of knowledge .

		This opens with an analysis of philosophic scepticism , aimed to show the possibility of knowledge ; and the remaining chapters on '' Thought and Thing , '' '' Realism and Idealism , '' etc. , seek to show just how
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 knowledge is possible , i. e. , its fundamental con - ditions .

		Professor
Bowne	PERSON	comes to much the same conclusions as Professor
Ladd	PERSON	.

		While this work shows some acuteness and clearness , yet we can not highly commend it as a whole .

		The treatment is much too summary , and the simplifying is carried too far .

		Further , the tone of the book is very unphilosophic by reason of gross dogmatism and didacticism , and the work is often marred by acad - emic sarcasm .

		Dr.
John Bascom	PERSON	has lately added to his numerous volumes on religion and philosophy a brief work entitled '' Evolution and Religion . ''

		He treats in this book of four main topics , namely , '' Evolution as a Conception , '' '' Evolution as
Giving Unity	ORGANIZATION	to the
Field of Knowledge	ORGANIZATION	and Action , '' '' Evolution in its Present Spiritual Phases , '' and '' Evolution in the Proofs it Offers to Spiritual Beliefs . ''

		Evolution is accepted in the widest sense , and is theistically and spiritually interpreted .

		Suggestive remarks are made on various ethical and social matters .

		The presentation is vigorous , popular , and rather ser - monic .

		While nothing very new is given , yet there is always originality of statement .

		The author is , throughout , very ironic , very sententious , and very enthusiastic .

		While the treatment is not especially profound or thorough , yet it is always broad and generous ; and there are many quickening thoughts which will be of service to those who are seeking to know the signs of the times and to adjust them - selves to a new spiritual basis .

		Many persons ought to find in this book help toward a larger , saner , and freer life .

		Mr.
John Beattie Crozier	PERSON	follows up his work on '' Civilization and Progress '' by Volume I. of the '' History of Intellectual Development , '' which , he explains , is to point out the laws of the evolution of religion , science , and philosophy .

		This is a very large and difficult task , and the author seems to show neither sufficient ability nor training for the work .

		Perhaps the quoting of a single sentence will give some inkling of the mental status of the writer : '' I am aware , of course , of the deep suspicion with which many readers will regard any attempt to reduce to Law those products of thought or action which would seem to depend on the uncertain ca - prices of men ; and can fully realize the surprise of the reader when he hears that an attempt has here been made to anticipate the views which men like Plato ,
Aristotle	LOCATION	,
Buddha	LOCATION	, or
Paul	PERSON	were likely to hold on the great problems of the world and of human life . ''

		While this volume may be a passable com - pilation on the history of Greek ,
Hindu	LOCATION	, and Judaic - Christian thought , and conceived in a broadly the - istic and Christian spirit , it is not a closely scientific study , and can scarcely be considered a serious con - tribution to historical or sociological literature .

		Professor
Oswald Kiilpe	PERSON	's brief text-book on phil - osophy is now translated in a correct and convenient version by Professors
Pillsbury	ORGANIZATION	and Titchener under the title '' Introduction to Philosophy . ''

		This work is much more compendious and impersonal than Professor
Paulsen	PERSON	's work with the same title .

		Pro- fessor Kttlpe aims to give the beginner '' a short ac - count of the development and status of philosophy . ''

		Chapter I. is devoted to '' the definition and classifi - cation of philosophy '' ; Chapter II .

		to '' a survey of the separate disciplines which are now included under the general name of philosophy '' ; and Chapter III .

		to '' a characterization of the more important schools of philosophic thought . ''

		The aim throughout has been '' to assist the student in the understanding of lectures and treatises upon special philosophical topics . ''

		A final chapter gives very briefly the author 's own view as to what philosophy should be and do in the future a view which discourages systems of phil - osophy .

		The standpoint of the book is too German , and the treatment , though clear , is too dry , to be very serviceable to the American student desiring an initiation to '' divine philosophy . ''

		The profuse use of technical and German terms and the historical resume will embarrass many .

		The chief value of the work is as a reference book to help clarify the ideas of advanced students .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A reconstructed The volume by Mr.
Ignatius	PERSON	Singer trminoiyy and Mr.
Lewis H. Berens	PERSON	, entitled Vphytic * .

		u Some Unrecognized Laws of Na - ture '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , offers to the physicist greatly varied interest .

		Seldom does one find propositions more clearly enunciated or more concisely and logi - cally discussed .

		Their exhaustive analysis holds attention and forces conclusions as to many of the terms and conventions of modern science , some of which have claimed the highest prerogative and have generally had their claims allowed .

		As an example may be cited the term `` energy , '' with its derivatives '' conservation '' and '' dissipation '' of energy , kinetic energy , potential energy , etc. .

		To Tail 's definition of energy , `` the power of doing work , '' the present authors do not object ; but to the idea that energy is a '' distinct entity , '' even though '' in - separable , '' they oppose serious and well-founded objections .

		There are those who seem to regard energy as a sort of soul residing in matter , but cap - able of unlimited transmigrations , having present existence , but resting under the possibility of disem - bodiment and final dissipation , perchance ending in a form of nirvana .

		But Tail 's definition needs a re - striction ; energy is '' the power of doing work '' at a given instant , not a power which may have been , or , under conditions , may arrive .

		If a body be thrown vertically into the air , no energy may be attributed to it at the instant which ends its upward flight and begins its descent .

		When the object started upward it had power within itself to do work , work expended in lifting itself to an altitude .

		When its returning fall is finished , it has again ac - quired from the attraction of gravitation the energy perhaps to smash a casemate or to drive a timber 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, into the solid earth .

		A stone lying upon the earth 's surface has in it no inherent '' potential '' energy ; nor would it acquire any if Mr.
Frank Stockton	PERSON	were to bore beside it a hole ten miles deep .

		Like other reformers , our authors began with a revision of ter - minology .

		They affirm that certain psychologic ten - dencies disguise themselves in forms of expression , which tendencies are evil and must be overcome .

		Because suggestive of certain lines of theory , old terms must be discarded ; but may not the new terms be equally suggestive , and therefore reprehensible ?

		Thus , in an early chapter we find the fundamental term '' inertia '' dismissed , and its equivalent -LRB- ? -RRB-

		, '' persistence , '' substituted .

		If equivalent , why sub - stitute ?

		But not only are the terms not equivalent , they are widely asunder .

		It is true that
Newton	ORGANIZATION	uses the word persevere in his definition of vis insita , '' a power of resistance by which everybody endeav - ors to persevere in its present state of rest or motion , '' etc. .

		But in his further explanation of this defini - tion , in the same section , he says : '' A body from the inactivity of matter is not without difficulty put out of its state of rest or motion .

		Upon which ac - count , this vis insita may , with a most significant name , be called vis inertice , or force of inactivity . ''

		Of the two terms offered by
Newton	LOCATION	, his disciples have used that which most perfectly indicates the normally inactive condition of matter , a condition which can neither initiate motion nor diminish motion when once acquired .

		It is a condition of absolute passivity .

		But perseverance , whether of matter or of the saints , and as these authors use the word , im - plies activity , with something like will or determin - ation .

		It is said that when
King Wilhelm	PERSON	, the first German Kaiser , arrived in captured
Paris	LOCATION	, he re - marked , '' Je suis ; je reste '' Of thousands of the soldiers who had marched from the German frontier at the king 's command , but had found their final resting place within French soil , it might have been said with equal truth , but with a very different signification , '' They are here , and they will stay . ''

		The attitude of the conquering
Kaiser	PERSON	was one of perseverance ; that of his buried
Uhlans	PERSON	was one of inertia .

		But to discuss all the things , wise or otherwise , in this book would require another book .

		Among the sixteen chapters that con - stitute '' A batch of Golfing Papers , '' written by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	and others , and published by Mr.
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	, there is one , '' The Devil 's Round , '' a tale of Flemish Golf , that is almost like a piece of fine
Valenciennes	ORGANIZATION	lace among a lot of good Scottish plaids .

		Not that the others are not good golfing papers : they are .

		But they lack the touch of literary quality , somehow .

		For instance , only fancy '' Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	on the Links , '' '' Herodotus at
Saint Andrews	PERSON	, '' ''
Socrates	PERSON	on the Links '' ; neither one of them could possibly be more than a few changes rung on a well-known theme . ''

		A Song of Life and Golf '' -LRB- on the refrain '' The Limmer stimied me '' -RRB- , and the `` Ballade of the Duffer , '' these too , we think , might be imagined with Oolf and
Lettert	PERSON	.

		sufficient exactness .

		`` The Caddies at Saint Andrews '' and '' The Home of Golf '' will not surprise or excite anyone already up in golfing literature .

		Of course they are good in their way ; they are quite the thing a man will read easily in a club corner in the even - ing after a good round .

		Or , now that as a rule one ca n't play the game , they will serve to remind .

		But they have no characters , they are only amusing because they are about golf .

		Now the particular story we speak of , a translation from the French of
M. Charles Deulin	PERSON	, has not nearly so much to do with golf as the others , but it is a better story for all that .

		As you read it , you become conscious that you have moved out of that simple world whose sufficient humor comes from people 's wrath at get - ting into bunkers , and whose acme of development would be a regular sequence of drive , approach , and putt .

		You are off the Links and have got back to Letters .

		The wheelwright 's three wishes , his match with the Devil , his outwitting Death and even the good
Saint Anthony	PERSON	, have the richness and cunning of peasant humor , and are worked out with the skill of a clever story-teller .

		We are fond of golf , and so we read the whole book with pleasure ; and we think most golfers will do so too .

		Still , our serious judgment is that it is best to keep Golf and Letters distinct and separate .

		If a man must read golf in the winter , the `` Badminton '' volume or
Willie Parks	PERSON	's .

		book will be about the best thing for him , for these are pure golf and no literature .

		The stories in this volume are for the most part , it must be confessed , only half-and-half .

		As such , it is hard to see how they can make any real impression on a thoroughbred sport .

		Our Flemish tale , however , though it does not appeal so strongly to the golfing temperament , will certainly be remembered by any - one having more than a slight tincture of letters .

		Novelists search nowadays for curi - ^ * and unheard-of heroes and hero - ines .

		Romances wherein Negro , Indian , Polynesian , and Hindu actors figure are rather in vogue .

		In
France	LOCATION	a popular story has already been written about prehistoric man .

		In Mr.
Stanley Waterloo	PERSON	's '' Story of Ab '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we have a group of cave-dwellers as chief actors .

		In such a story , of course , the background must be realistic and the life true to nature .

		Mr.
Waterloo	PERSON	appears to have made diligent efforts to qualify himself for writing his book .

		Some of his portrayals are clear and suggestive .

		Many mis - takes in archaeology occur , however .

		To cite but one , the whole treatment of the shell-heap men is wrong .

		Where are there fresh-water shell-heaps of Palaeolithic age ?

		More than once Mr.
Waterloo	PERSON	seems to imagine that he stands alone in claiming that there was no abrupt break between Palaeolithic and Neolithic cultures .


Beddoe	PERSON	long ago asserted that the blood of Palaeolithic man still flows in British veins , and that individuals reproducing the ancient cave type may still be found ; Quatrefages held a similar view .

		As for archaeologists , a large num -

		THE DIAL 23 Dr. Putty once more .

		her , particularly in
France	LOCATION	, hold absolutely to the idea of continuity of culture .

		The best thing in the book , from the archaeologist 's standpoint , is the em - phasizing of the importance of individual effort and discovery in prehistoric times : this is admirably brought out .

		Turning from the archaeology in the story to the book itself , we must admit that it is a strange one .

		The cover is a nightmare in black , yellow , and red .

		The author aims at Anglo-Saxon simplicity and at quaint combinations of unusual words .

		This is pleasant and odd for a time , but the reader finally wearies of strange uses of mumbling and thing .

		A fair example , taken almost at hap - hazard , of the style is the sentence , '' To cross that morass safely required a touch on tussocks and an npbounding aside , a zigzag exhibition of great strength and knowingness and recklessness . ''

		This is no doubt ingenious .

		`` We may adopt Mr.
Water	PERSON	- loo 's vocabulary and style , and say that it is a lush book , full of punkish crudity of things , thought products and word forms , fit to fall flatly on truly thoughtful .

		The world is made up of most various types , and it is just conceivable that there are persons to whom the fourth octavo volume of an ecclesiastical biography gives no suggestion of tedium .

		It is barely possible that four sound divines might conspire to make the work so readable that , as children cry for Castoria , so lay - minded folk would clamor for yet one volume more .

		The supposition is perhaps extreme , and the Life of Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	is hardly a case in point .

		We have sought to examine it , at intervals , wakefully , with very moderate success .

		We presently came to feel that it was almost discourteous not to be drowsy in Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	's company .

		We perceived how admirably
Canon Liddon	PERSON	and his literary coadjutors had caught the tone of the subject of their biography , and how the whole work was , as artists say , in keeping .

		It was a wonderful group of men who favored or re - sisted the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		They range from
Newman	PERSON	to
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, from Ward to
Jowett	PERSON	, men full of life and character .

		Even in
Manning	LOCATION	, through the hard and fast shell of the ecclesiastic may now and then be seen the red blood beating .

		In Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	also are microscopic traces of our common humanity .

		It is to the credit of his biographers to have discovered them .

		He was not only a saint in a niche , a painful controversialist , a hammerer of heretics , an automatic letter - writer , and a munificent church-benefactor .

		He was more .

		He could dis - tinguish between things that differ .

		Assisting a worn-out
London	LOCATION	vicar through an epidemic of cholera , it is told of Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	that he insisted on waiting upon him at dinner , tempting him with special morsels , and with his own hands , as he poured it , frothing his beer .

		That last is a touch that brightens the picture .

		Could he have cared to have his own beer foaming ?

		May we venture to con - template him as winking back at '' the beaded bub - bles winking at the brim '' ?

		The conception is audacious , yet we must indulge it .

		For it lends one breath of fragrance , one suggestion of flesh and blood , to two thousand lifeless pages .

		-LRB- Longmans . -RRB-

		The series of '' Literatures of the Wo ' ld '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, has now advanced to its second volume , Professor
G. G. A. Murray	PERSON	's survey of Greek literature having been followed by Professor
James Dowden	PERSON	's survey of French litera - ture .

		We have looked forward with much interest to the appearance of these books , for the production of a uniform series of accurate and readable histo - ries of the great national literatures is a very desir - able thing to undertake , and the successful accom - plishment of the task would mean much for popular culture .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's work , now before us , is all , or nearly all , that such a work might be ex - pected to be , and yet we have read it with a certain sense of disappointment .

		The plain truth of the matter is that a thousand years of rich literary his - tory can not be made very interesting in a volume of a few hundred pages , from which all illustrative quotations must perforce be omitted for the sake of the history itself .

		There are so many names and books to be considered , and so little space in which to talk about them .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's book is probably as good a one as we should have the right to expect from any historian , and in sanity , balance , and literary expression is distinctly better than Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's work , hitherto probably the best of its kind .

		Furthermore , there are many scattered pages which are really instructive , and may be read with much satisfaction .

		But for all that , the book must go to the reference shelf rather than to the library table .

		The `` Handbook of American Au - J2ST22L thora , '' P ^ ared by Mr.
Oscar Fay Adams	PERSON	, and published in
1884	DATE	, was a very small book , very far from exhaustive , and by no means always accurate .

		Yet , in spite of its shortcomings , it has proved indispensable to every student of American literature , and has had no serious competitor short of the voluminous Allibone .

		There will be thousands of literary workers glad to learn that the book has at last grown into the ''
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary of American Authors , '' just issued from the press of
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is now '' fairly inclusive , '' as the editor remarks , for more than six thousand names are mentioned , and the work extends to 444 pages .

		The entries are , of course , very brief , aiming at little more than the name of each author , the place of birth , the dates of birth and death , the occupation , and the -LRB- undated -RRB- titles of the books .

		Now and then we are given a few words ' of criticism or a few bibliographical ref - erences .

		The editor has discriminated between '' poets '' and '' verse-writers , '' an exercise of pre - rogative which may arouse the indignation of some members of the latter class , but which is surely well - advised .

		For example , Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	is a poet , 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, and Mr.
Richard Hovey	PERSON	a verse-writer .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has been at great pains to state his facts concisely and accurately , and a somewhat close examination of the work has shown it to be remarkably free from errors , except such errors of omission as would characterize any work of this sort not com - piled by an archangel .

		Two essays in
Bronte	LOCATION	biography , by Mr - An S u8 M -
Mackay	DATE	, are com - prised in the volume entitled '' The Brontes , Fact and Fiction '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The longer of these is a successful attempt to prove Dr.
Wright	PERSON	's '' The Brontes in
Ireland	LOCATION	'' to be un - trustworthy ; while the shorter , which appears now for the first time , is a sort of running commentary on Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	's recently published ``
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and Her Circle . ''

		In the latter essay Mr.
Mackay	PERSON	accepts most of Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	's conclusions , although he differs from him on two important matters .

		The first of these is with regard to the religious opinions of
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	, which Mr.
Mackay	PERSON	maintains wrongly , we think should be characterized as '' Broad Church . ''

		The second is in reference to
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's relations with M. He * ger .

		Here he adopts the thesis , which we are inclined to accept , that the story about
Charlotte	LOCATION	being in love with her talented master is true .

		He then explains how this may not in itself be discred - itable to the character of the novelist .

		As this is the fullest discussion of this mooted matter we have seen , we recommend the book to anyone who may be interested in the
Bronte	PERSON	' group .

		We wish to add , however , that Mr.
Mackay	PERSON	's Bronte enthusiasm does not seem always to be tempered with sanity .

		This is shown in his acceptance of
Lockhart	LOCATION	's extrava - gant praise of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, and in his yielding to the latter the supremacy over
Jane Austen	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		A pleasant The ^ ve Frenchmen to whom Miss acquaintance with
Mary Fisher	PERSON	introduces us in '' A tome French critics .

		Group of French Critics '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- are
Edmond Scherer	PERSON	,
Ernest Bersot	PERSON	,
Saint-Marc Girardin	PERSON	, Xime ` nes Doudan , and
Gustave Planche	PERSON	.

		Though they are of very unequal importance and stand in many respects in strong contrast with one another , the group derives a sort of coherence from their agreement in a serious and intelligent treat - ment of literature as one of the great permanent human interests , and in a cool and conservative atti - tude toward new literary fashions .

		They respect and cherish the long results of human experience ; they enforce the distinction between bad and good literature ; they maintain that an art that works in a material so preeminently moral as human conduct can not be rightly indifferent to moral issues .

		This volume is the outgrowth of the author 's admiration for this kind of criticism , and of a desire to make its qualities better known among us .

		Her purpose is not to expound or discuss the history or the meth - ods of French criticism , but to set the person of the critic before us and let him speak for himself , not in complete essays but in extracts that are character - istic of his personality and his point of view .

		This purpose has been fairly realized .

		If we in no wise make the complete round of any of these critics , we manage to get an interesting and instructive glimpse of each , and many will wish to pursue further the acquaintanceship thus begun .

		Napoleon 's art of war .

		The ordinary reader who has passed the fighting enthusiasm of his youth is not greatly interested in special military history .

		- Disgust at the barbarity of war destroys interest in it as a game of skill , while one need not follow the details of a battle or a campaign to ap - preciate its historical importance .

		But the mature civilian will find Lieut.
H. H. Sargent	PERSON	's '' The Cam - paign of Marengo '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , with comments , both interesting and profitable reading .

		The horrors are veiled ; the drum and trumpet are not brought out ; but the campaign is treated as a magnificent game of science and skill , so explained that the untrained reader can follow it even though he can - not appreciate fully the quality of the skill displayed .

		The author 's method is to take up each part of the campaign in a chapter , giving first a narrative of it and then comments and criticism .

		A chapter of general comment follows , in which the author ranks
Napoleon	PERSON	as easily first among soldiers , the equal of any as an organizer and a tactician , and the great - est of all in strategy .

		Indeed , the book may be con - sidered as a discussion in little of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's art of war .

		For busy pastors with limited purses , for Bible-class teachers , leaders of young people 's meetings , and mis - sionary studies , Mr.
E. M. Bliss	PERSON	's `` Concise History of Missions '' -LRB- F. H. Re veil -RRB- is admirable .

		It has the limitations of a '' short cut '' presentation of a vast subject , but the brief and select bibliography will guide the reader to more extended discussions .

		The little volume sketches missions of the early church , of the Roman Catholics , early Protestants , British ,
American	ORGANIZATION	, and European .

		Then he turns to the field , and outlines the characteristics and peculiar needs of various countries , North and

		In the last part the author discusses organization and methods .

		Dean
Farrar	PERSON	's restless pen still pro- duces readable books .

		His latest , `` Men I Have Known '' -LRB- Croweli -RRB- , is a unique compilation .

		The Dean has sought and cultivated an acquaintance with many of the leading English-speaking authors , churchmen , and scientists of his day .

		In this volume he spreads before us charming bits of reminiscences of some of these great lights .

		We are told in detail how he became acquainted with , and how he improved and enjoyed the companionship of , several eminent men .

		This A conciie history of Missions .

		Men whom Dean
Farrar	PERSON	has known .

		1898 . -RSB-

		25 book of 292 pages sketches in a personal way such acquaintanceship some slight and some intimate of fifty-six Englishmen and Americans .

		In addi - tion to the Dean 's personal memoirs there are many facsimile reproductions of autograph letters which the author has received at some time or other .

		Of especial interest to many will be the half-tone full - page portraits of twenty-five men .

		Some of the less widely known yet highly prized pictures are those of
F. D. Maurice	PERSON	, Dr.
Thomson of York	ORGANIZATION	,
Archbishop Benson	PERSON	,
Canon Liddon	PERSON	,
Dean Plumptree	PERSON	, and Dr.
Jowett	PERSON	.

		Though the book is strongly seasoned with Ego , it will be heartily welcomed by the ecclesias - tical and biblical public , as giving us another kaleido - scopic view of some of the men about whom we are always anxious to learn more .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons have published some '' Selected Poems by
George Meredith	PERSON	'' in a volume so exquisite in design and mechanical execution that the most fanatical of Meredithians could ask for nothing worthier .

		We are told that the selection has been made under the author 's personal supervision , a method which is usually more interesting than satisfactory .

		At any rate , in the present case it gives us `` Juggling Jerry '' and does not give us the magnificent ode to
France	LOCATION	'' in the hour of her agony , thus illustrating anew the fact that a poet is usually a poor judge of his own productions .

		In fact , the selection as a whole slights the simple and fresh work of the author 's earlier years for the sake of the contortions and grotesque affectations of his later style .

		A worse service than this could hardly be done him even by the most superior person among his small but devoted following .

		The '' Poems of Thomas Hood '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by the Rev.
Alfred Ainger	PERSON	, have been published in two volumes of the ever-charming '' Eversley '' form , and all students of literature and readers of poetry must be grateful for the attractiveness of the publication , as well as for the scholarly care which the editor has ex - pended upon the memoir , the notes , and the text itself .

		The first volume contains the '' Serious Poems , '' and the second a selection -LRB- perhaps two-thirds of the whole -RRB- from the '' Poems of Wit and Humor '' that Hood pro- duced so copiously for the '' Comic Annuals '' and other ephemeral publications .

		Hood was not so great a poet as to make it desirable to preserve with scrupulous care every scrap of his writing , and the editor is quite justified in having used his discretion in this matter .

		The '' Shakespeare Note - Book '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- is a blank book with proper headings and divisions for the convenience of students in making memoranda for ready reference to the items which are considered of most importance in the study of the plays .

		The first three pages are given to printed matter condensed from
Dowden	PERSON	's `` Shaks - pere Primer , '' in relation to such points as chronological order , classification by types , reference books , etc. .

		Mr.
William S. Walsh	PERSON	, the compiler of a popular '' Handy-Book of Literary Curiosities , '' has just supplied that entertaining work with a companion volume , entit - led '' Curiosities of Popular Customs '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and dealing with all sorts of rites , ceremonies , and festivities familiar to the folklorist .

		Such compilations as these supplement the conventional encyclopaedias in a very ac - ceptable way , and are useful both for reference and for miscellaneous reading .

		How many know off-hand , for example , what is the ceremony of '' Cutting of the Khalig , '' or can discourse upon the '' Blood - Tax in the Pyrennes . ''

		Mr.
Walsh	PERSON	's book is for those who do not know such things , but would like to know them .

		A few months ago we noticed in THE DIAL -LRB-
July 1	DATE	-RRB- Mr.
Frank M. Chapman	PERSON	's '' Bird-Life , '' a volume con - taining '' as much information regarding a hundred or more of our familiar birds as could be compressed within its limits . ''

		The work lacked but one feature colored plates representing the birds as they appear in life ; and this feature has now been supplied in a new edition just issued by
Messrs. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are seventy-five full-page colored plates , so well done that we can emphasize our previous commendation , `` The student who selects this work as a guide to his observations of bird-life will not go amiss . ''

		Philip II .

		of
Spain	LOCATION	is the subject of a volume , by Mr.
Martin A. S. Hume	PERSON	, in the `` Foreign Statesmen Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Those who have had the good fortune to become acquainted with Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's earlier studies in the history of
England	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	in the six - teenth and seventeenth centuries , and who remember especially the few paragraphs given in one of his essays to an estimate of the character of Philip II. , will know how valuable and readable an extended biography of Philip from his pen must be .

		Nothing of its kind exists in English .

		It may be unhesitatingly and highly praised .

		Dr.
William H. Griffis	PERSON	's '' The Romance of Discov - ery '' -LRB-
Wilde & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is really a general account of American discovery from the time of the Norsemen to the present ; and it is particularly designed for young people .

		However , the story is too summary and too obviously inade-to-order to be of the highest interest to either young or old .

		The volume contains some good illustrations , but lacks a map .

		The third quinquennial supplement to ''
Poole	PERSON	's Index to Periodical Literature '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Messrs.
William I. Fletcher	PERSON	and
Franklin O. Poole	PERSON	, with the cooperation of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, has just made its appearance .

		It is a bulky volume of over six hundred quarto pages , that is , about one-third more voluminous than either of its predecessors .

		The num - ber of sets of periodicals covered is one hundred and eighty-seven , sixty of which have not been included in any previous issue .

		Of the latter , forty-two have had their origin since
1891	DATE	.

		On the other hand , twenty - three sets represented in the list of five years ago have been dropped .

		As is eminently fitting , this volume con - tains a portrait of
William Frederick Poole	PERSON	, and a brief sketch of his industrious and useful life .

		The volume for
1897	DATE	of `` American Book - Prices Current , '' compiled from the auctioneers ' catalogues by Mr.
Luther S. Livingston	PERSON	, has just been published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a volume of five hundred and fifty pages , and the edition is limited to six hundred copies .

		The record is based upon sales made hi
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and Cin - cinnatti , for the year ending with last
August	DATE	.

		The general rule has been to include accurately described lots bringing three dollars and upwards , which means over eight thousand entries in the present case .

		The highest price of the year was 81250 , paid for an edition of the `` Book of Common Prayer , '' dated
1788	DATE	, and having considerable autograph and ownership interest connected with it .

		Messrs.
Hinds	PERSON	& Noble publish , in their '' University Tutorial '' series , a third and enlarged edition of Mr.
John S. Mackenzie	PERSON	's '' Manual of Ethics , '' a work that has met with much success as a college text book .

		Mr.
Charles A. Bramble	PERSON	's book '' Klondike '' -LRB-
Fenno & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a compilation , largely from the newspapers , but apparently serviceable to those wishing a practical knowledge of the Klondike gold fields and how to get there .

		A belated holiday publication is Mr.
Sydney George Fisher	PERSON	's interesting work on '' Men , Women , and Man - ers in Colonial Times . ''

		The work is in two volumes , attractively illustrated , and sent out in a neat box by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have issued a new edition of their well-known '' Portrait Catalogue . ''

		The number of portraits has been increased to sixty-three , and all are entirely new , having been made especially for this edition of the catalogue .

		Volume XVIII .

		of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Round Table '' is a stout quarto of nearly thirteen hundred pages , abun - dantly illustrated .

		It contains no less than eight com - plete serial stories , besides its hundreds of other fea - tures interesting to young people .

		The Jewish Chautauqua Society of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	sends us an interesting syllabus of a reading course in '' Jew - ish History and Literature , '' covering the period of '' The Crusades and the Spanish Era , '' and prepared under the direction of Professor
Richard Gottheil	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Frederic G. Kenyon	PERSON	is about to publish , through the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, the text of the recently discovered poems of Bacchylides .

		The editor will furnish an introduction and commentary , while the fragments will be printed in both ordinary and uncial type . ''

		Rampolli '' is the title given to a volume by the Rev.
George MacDonald	PERSON	, just published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains a sheaf of trans - lations in verse , mostly from the German , and one long original poem , entitled `` A Year 's Diary of an Old Soul . ''

		Mr.
George Laurence Gomme	PERSON	has undertaken to edit a '' Library of Historical Novels and Romances , '' which are to be published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first two volumes of this series , just issued , are
Bulwer	PERSON	's well-known ''
Harold	PERSON	, '' and
Charles Macfar	PERSON	- lane 's little-known romance '' The Camp of Refuge . ''

		The editor contributes an elaborate introduction to each volume , together with illustrations -LRB- the
Bayeux	LOCATION	tapestry , for instance -RRB- and notes .

		Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	is about to publish in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- and we shall doubtless soon have it in this country -RRB- a work on '' Modern
France	LOCATION	, '' written by
M. Andre * Lebon	PERSON	for the '' Story of the Nations '' series .

		This will pre - cede even its appearance in the country and language of its origin .

		Two bound volumes of '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	, '' embracing the whole of the year
1897	DATE	, and the semi-annual bound vol - ume of '' The Century Magazine , '' have found their way to our table , as usual at this time of year , from the offices of the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are quite as full of good things as ever , and it would be invidious to attempt to particularize .

		Ex-President
Cleveland	LOCATION	's address at the
Princeton Sesquicentennial	ORGANIZATION	is published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	as a booklet with the title '' The Self-Made Man in American Life . ''

		It is just the sort of thing for young men to read , with its homely , yet fijiely impressive plea for ideals of a sort too often neglected in our rushing American life .

		In a very thin volume some nameless one , who may be a great authority , gives a final settlement to a series of problems whose mere titles occupy about seven pages in the table of contents . ''

		Posterity , or , Democracy in A. D. 2100 '' -LRB-
Putnam	LOCATION	-RRB- has hints of Looking Back - ward . ''

		If one could be sure of only one of these solu - tions he would be willing to read a longer book .

		Two mites are contributed to the growing mass of text-book literature by instructors in the
Chicago High Schools	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Harry Nightingale	PERSON	has edited for
Messrs. Ainsworth & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a pamphlet of '' Selections from Wash - ington ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and
Bryant	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
Fred	PERSON	.


L. Charles	PERSON	has published on his own account a pamphlet guide to the young geologist , entitled '' How to Read a Pebble . ''

		We have received a little pamphlet entitled ''
Nick	PERSON	- names and Pseudomyms of Prominent People , '' com - piled by Mrs.
Fannie Parmelee Deane	PERSON	,
Holyoke	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		Among the '' prominent people '' listed are those ancient ladies , the nine Muses .

		We also learn that one
Quintus Fabius	ORGANIZATION	was also known as Crunctator .

		The booklet does not seem to have been edited with much discrim - ination .

		Bishop
Creighton	PERSON	's '' History of the Papacy from the
Great Schism	LOCATION	to the Sack of
Rome	LOCATION	'' has for some years occupied a place among the standard productions of English historical scholarship .

		Many students will be grateful to Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the his - torian 's publishers , for the neat new edition of this work , just published in six volumes , and at a price materially lower than that at which the history has heretofore been issued .

		A well-printed volume comes to us from Mr.
William Doxey	PERSON	, of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and contains the '' Sonnets of Jos ^ -
Maria de Heredia	PERSON	, '' done into English by Mr.
Edward Robeson Taylor	PERSON	.

		To translate
M. Heredia	PERSON	at all is to attempt the impossible , and Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	, if he is to be congratulated upon his ambition , can not be con - gratulated upon his work , which is entirely inadequate , besides giving evidence of an imperfect knowledge of the French language .

		It is a singular fact that the English language has yet to await a good , an even tolerable , complete transla -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL tion of the '' Origines '' of Kenan .

		A good beginning has at last been made by Messrs.
Roberts Brothers	PERSON	, who some time ago published Mr.
Joseph Henry Allen	PERSON	's translation of the '' Life of Jesus , '' and who now issue a translation of '' Anti-Christ , '' made by the same com - petent hand .

		It is to be hoped that the other five vol - umes will follow in equally satisfactory versions .

		Messrs.
J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who have given us so many pretty editions of English authors , have surpassed them - selves in their '' Waverley '' novels , the first of which has just been placed on sale by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , who import the edition for the American market .

		Thin but reasonably opaque paper makes possible the combination of readable print with a very small volume .

		There are to be forty of them altogether , with facsimile title-pages , bibliographical notes , and illustrations , each volume daintily bound in lambskin .

		A movement of an international character has been started among the friends and admirers of the late Pro- fessor
J. J. Sylvester	PERSON	for the purpose of '' founding a suitable memorial in honour of his name and for the en - couragement of mathematical science . ''

		The memorial is to take the form of a '' Sylvester Medal , '' to be awarded at certain intervals for mathematical research to any worker , irrespective of nationality .

		It has been estimated that
$ 5000	MONEY	will be needed for the proposed endowment , of which sum about one-half has already been subscribed in
England	LOCATION	.

		American subscriptions may be sent to either Dr.
Cyrus Adler	PERSON	, of the
Smith	PERSON	- sonian Institution ,
Washington	LOCATION	, or to Dr.
George Bruce Halsted	PERSON	,
2407	DATE
Guadalupe St.	ORGANIZATION	,
Austin	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	.

		Through some inadvertence in the publication of Dr.
J. H. Barrows	PERSON	's recent work on '' Christianity , the World - Religion , '' Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	is made to appear as the '' Presi - dent and originator '' of the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	held in
Chicago	LOCATION	during the World 's Fair .

		The phrase is in - correct and misleading , and has given rise to a misappre - hension which has somewhat widely extended .

		Those at all familiar with the facts are aware that the
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment of Religions was a part of the grand series of World 's Congresses held in official connection with the World 's Fair .

		There were over two hundred of these separate Congresses , each organized and held under the direction of a committee whose chairman was the ex - ecutive head of that particular congress ; and this was precisely Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	's relation to the Religious Con - gress , or the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was but one President , Mr.
C. C. Bonney	PERSON	; and he was the prime originator and director of the Congresses as a whole , and in a very special sense of the
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	, which at first met with no little disfavor but in the end proved the most successful and notable of the series .

		Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	's splendid services in procuring this result are too widely known and appreciated to need any over - statement in his behalf ; and no one has been more em - phatic than he in recognizing the preeminence of Mr.
Bonney	PERSON	as the originator and director of the Congresses .

		In an article in '' The Forum '' -LRB-
Sept. 1894	DATE	-RRB- Dr. Bar - rows said : ''
Charles C. Bonney	PERSON	, a broad-minded lawyer of
Chicago	LOCATION	, is entitled to the great and lasting honor of having originated and carried to success , in spite of numerous obstacles , the entire scheme of the World 's Congresses of
1893	DATE	.

		The
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	was one of more than two hundred of these conventions ; and was , according to Mr.
Bonney	PERSON	, ' the splendid crown ' of the series . ''

		In his '' History of the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	, '' also , Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	has made the facts qnite clear as we have stated them .

		A HINT FOR THE HOLIDAYS .

		FOR THE PRESENT HOLIDAY SEASON , Book-lovers have the chance to procure for gift purposes such a literary treasure as was never before seen .

		To Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, as its editor-in-chief , belongs the palm of victory for this achievement in book production .

		The '' Library of the World 's Best Literature , '' as it has been happily named , might also fitly be termed the world 's crowning effort in the creation of books .

		Either praise or minute description of this magnificent work would seem almost needless to a public that has read its eulogy , since the appearance of the very first volume , in all the chief literary periodicals of the country .

		Just here may be noted briefly the principal features that constitute the Library a work of surpassing excellence for profit and enjoyment : CRITICAL ESSAYS .

		About a thousand graphic essays , by living scholars and writers of eminence , furnish in popular style their critical , interpretative , biographical , and historical comments on the world 's great authors and their principal works , alike of ancient and modern times .

		In every one of these the critic is also a specialist in relation to his subject .

		SELECTED LITERATURE .

		Following the interpretative studies are presented the master productions of the most famous writers of all ages and countries .

		The collection includes Poetry , History ,
Romance	ORGANIZATION	, Oratory , Biography ,
Science and Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, Theology , Letters , Drama , Wit and Humor , and every other form of literary expression .

		HISTORY OF LITERATURE .

		The Library contains histories of all the world 's literatures , ancient and modern , written in each case by a specialist who is recognized as author - ity on the subject .

		The sacred books of the nations also form special studies .

		SYNOPSIS OF BEST BOOKS .

		Three thousand of the world 's best books are separately analyzed and given in clear synopsis of narrative , plot , and characters .

		Refreshes our past reading and guides to that of the future .

		BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY .

		The most complete and accurate dictionary of the lives of great authors ever made .

		It embraces 12,000 names and gives under each all essential facts and literary successes .

		INDEX .

		The most elaborate and careful ever yet compiled for a work of magnitude .

		It indexes by reference and cross-reference every name , event , book , selection , topic and senti - ment treated of on any page of the Library .

		An immense boon to literary workers .

		Such are the chief features that distinguish the `` Library of the World 's Best Literature . ''

		But they are not all .

		There are others that serve to make it as helpful to the student and scholar as it is bright and entertaining for mere intellectual recreation .

		FOR THESE HOLIDAYS ONLY , Not for those of next year or the years to follow , can the LIBRARY be obtained at the excep - tionally low price now made available through the
Harper	PERSON	's
Weekly Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was only established as an introductory figure to enable the public to learn the merits and value of the work .

		THE PRICE is TO BE ADVANCED AFTER NEW YEAR 'S DAY .

		None should miss the present opportunity to secure full particulars under the exceptionally advantageous offer made for the month of
December	DATE	to all who become members of the

		57 ENERGY AND
AST	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	speaks somewhere of the dis - tinction , which yet amounts to '' no mutually exclusive division , '' between the gods and the giants of literature .

		Practically the same dis - tinction is made by his friend , Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	, in the statement , which recurs frequently in the writings of the latter critic , to the effect that poetic energy and poetic art are '' the two forces that move in the produc - tion of all poetry . ''

		The distinction is illumi - nating for the understanding of poetry , for these two forces are the fundamental elements of the effective appeal of literature , as , indeed , of all the forms of artistic endeavor .

		In the greatest of poets , to be sure , we find the two forces to coexist in such supreme degree and perfect balance that they become , as it were , merely the two aspects of the phenomenon which we call genius , and we understand that for the highest achievements of literature the one is but the necessary complement of the other .

		This is what we find in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	and
Dante	PERSON	and
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, possibly also in
Goethe	LOCATION	and
Milton	LOCATION	.

		But when we view the work of the poets who just escape inclusion in the small company of the supreme singers of the world , we nearly always discover some preponderance of energy over art or of art over energy .

		As coming under the latter category , for example , we think of Sophocles and
Virgil	PERSON	and
Tenny	PERSON	- son ; while the former category embraces 2Eschylus and
Lucretius	PERSON	and
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		Taking a step still further away from the great masters , we meet with such fairly antipodal contrasts as are offered by
Horace	PERSON	and Juvenal , by
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	and
Jonson	PERSON	, or by
Keats	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	.

		In these cases we have either art so finished that the energy has become potential , or energy so unrestrained that the art has been well-nigh ignored .

		This thought may profitably be pursued into the domain of prose literature , and even , as was above suggested , into the field of the fine arts in general .

		The noblest prose that of
Plato	LOCATION	, for example has the same balance of energy and art that is displayed by the noblest poetry .

		On the other hand , we have tremen - dous energy with but scant art in such a writer 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, as
Carlyle	LOCATION	, well-nigh perfect art with but little energy in such a writer as Landor .

		In archi - tecture , the Gothic style astonishes us with its energy , the classic style entrances us with its art .

		In sculpture , the one type is represented by
Michel Angelo	PERSON	, the other by Thorwaldsen .

		In painting , the predominance of energy in
Tintoretto	ORGANIZATION	is as unquestionable as the predomi - nance of art in
Raphael	LOCATION	.

		And in music , while
Bach	PERSON	and
Beethoven	PERSON	stand for the Shakes - pearian harmony of both forces in their highest development , we may easily discern the over - plus of energy in
Liszt	LOCATION	and Tschaikowsky , of art in
Gluck	LOCATION	and
Mozart	PERSON	.

		The broad distinc - tion between the classic and the romantic styles , which runs through all the arts , is , moreover , to a considerable extent , the distinction between these two primary forces under other names .

		In a recent number of `` The Athenaeum '' there are some interesting remarks upon this subject as it is related to literary criticism , re - marks in which it would be an affectation to pretend not to recognize the hand of Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	. ''

		It would be unseemly here to criticize contemporary criticism , but it may , without intending offense , be said that while the appreciation of poetry as an energy is as strong as ever in the criticism of the present day , the appreciation of poetry as an art is non-existent , except in one or two quarters which we need not indicate ... To go no further back than the time when
Rossetti	PERSON	's poems were published , compare the critical canons then in vogue with the critical canons of the present day .

		On account of a single cockney rhyme , the critics of that period would damn a set of verses in which perhaps a meas - ure of poetic energy was not wanting .

		The critics of to-day fall for the most part into two classes : those who do not know what is meant by a cockney rhyme , and those who love a cockney rhyme . ''

		If this is true , it is a serious matter , for we are not content to share the non-committal position of the writer , who confines himself to saying : `` We merely record an interesting and suggestive fact of literary history .

		If in poetical criticism the wisdom of one generation is the folly of the next , it is the same in everything man says and in every - thing he does , so whimsical a creature has the arch-humorist Nature set at the top of the animal kingdom . ''

		For our part , we believe that the appreciation of poetry as an art is essential to the very ex - istence of criticism , and are far from willing to admit that it is non-existent at the present day .

		It is true enough that a great deal of verbiage about poetry issues from the '' blind mouths '' of self-constituted critics who know not whereof they speak ; but that has always been the case .

		Our writer himself makes the saving admission that the art of poetry still finds appreciation '' in one or two quarters which we need not indicate , '' and that is prob - ably all that might be said of the criticism of
Rossetti	PERSON	's time , or of a still earlier generation .

		When we are well along into the twentieth century , it is precisely the criticism from these unindicated quarters that will alone survive , and will urge the writers of that period in turn to say things about the decay of criticism in their own time .

		The ineptitudes of the criticism that greeted the early work of
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, were surely as unfortunate as any utterances of the present day , and , what is particularly to the point , they were lacking in precisely that appreciation of poetry as art for which Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	seeks almost in vain in our current critical literature .

		Having entered this protest against a state - ment that seems altogether too sweeping , we are now prepared to admit that a good many present-day facts lend countenance to the con - tention .

		Popular opinion naturally cares more for energy than for art in literature , for the obvious reason that it is stirred by the one and not easily susceptible to the appeal of the other .

		It feels the power of
Browning	PERSON	, for example , and , although by long familiarity made dimly conscious of the exquisite art of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, is disposed to allow the one quality to offset the other , and consider the two as equally great poets .

		It is the same rough-and-ready sort of judgment that for a long time held
Byron	PERSON	to be a greater poet than
Wordsworth	PERSON	, that in our own time thinks of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	as a greater master of fiction than Tourguenieff , or that made Juvenal seem a greater poet than
Yirgil	PERSON	to the indi - vidual idiosyncrasy of Hugo , or
Wordsworth	PERSON	and even
Byron	PERSON	greater poets than
Shelley	PERSON	to the individual idiosyncrasy of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		It is the sort of judgment that reaches the cul - mination of extravagance in the things that are sometimes said about
Walt Whitman	PERSON	by the injudicious among his admirers .

		When we consider that
Whitman	PERSON	's verses are not even what the worst of
Browning	PERSON	's are '' verses from the typographical point of view '' we may realize to what an extent criticism gone mad is capable of ignoring poetic art and rest - ing its case upon poetic energy alone .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 The reference to
Arnold	LOCATION	suggests reflections of a deeper sort .

		That the writer who was on the whole the truest and finest English critic of our generation occasionally went wrong , is well enough understood ; and it is generally admit - ted that his dicta about
Shelley	PERSON	constitute the most wrong-headed of all his utterances .

		Now the substance of his criticism was that
Shelley	PERSON	's poetry is `` beautiful but ineffectual '' the passage is too familiar to need quotation in full and the implication clearly is that it is more important for poetry to be effectual charged with energy , that is than beautiful .

		This is mainly interesting as going to show how a critic of the best type may be deluded by a formula , since this condemnation of poetry for being ineffectual is merely an application of the '' criticism of life '' formula which gave a doc - trinaire tinge to so much of
Arnold	LOCATION	's writing .

		`` We do not for a moment admit that
Shelley	PERSON	's poetry is ineffectual we have known too many young and generous souls to be moved by it as by a trumpet call but we understand that its energy is so bound up with the loveliness of its art that the critic who is looking chiefly for the bearings of poetry upon conduct might easily be led as
Arnold	LOCATION	was to underestimate the energy in the presence of so dazzling an art .

		All of which goes simply to show that the critic who is bent upon finding the effectual in poetry may miss it for the very reason of an unworthy distrust in the beautiful . ''

		Beauty is truth , '' but this does not mean that the truth need stick out at all sorts of angles from the beautiful structure .

		On the whole , while there are some signs that energy gets more attention than art from critics nowadays , and while popular judgments are based , as was always the case , upon little save energy in poetry , we are inclined to say that the only criticism that counts seriously does not notably disregard the claims of art .

		There are still men like Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	and
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	to expound poetry to an incredulous public , and we do not recall that earlier periods have been much better served .

		And the same incredulous public re - mains , as it always did remain , mostly imper - vious to the doctrine of the critic , and con - tinues to worship its false gods occasionally blundering into worship of a true one com - fortably thinks that it is enjoying poetry when it is only dazzled by rhetorical fireworks or dazed by sledge-hammer blows upon the brain , and gets a great deal of Philistine satisfaction out of life generally , and regards critics as daft persons of most unaccountable tastes .

		And the beautiful remains the beautiful in all ages , its laws immutable and its strength sure , while some there be who find it out , and , not content to know it for their own enjoyment alone , bid others to the feast and help them to understand how , although poetic energy by itself may ac - complish much , conjoined with poetic art it may accomplish more , and that the abiding power of literature resides in its form more than in its force , or rather that the form alone can preserve the force from becoming spent in the hour of its birth .

		THE MODERN-LANGUAGE MEN IN COUNCIL .

		There was a time when the Modern-Language teachers and students of the
United States	LOCATION	found in the meetings of the Philological Society a sufficient opportunity for the presentation of papers and the discussion of questions in their field .

		Some fifteen years ago it seemed advisable to found a separate Association ; and three years ago a
Central Division	ORGANIZATION	of the latter was established in the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		On both occasions the parent society was somewhat critical of the advisability of the newer organization ; but in each case it was ultimately recognized that real needs had been met .

		It is very significant that it was the modern languages that first found the bounds of the general society too confining , and still more so that this society now maintains two successful meetings .

		Nor must it be supposed that numbers alone are involved in this matter .

		When it comes to scientific training and natural ability , the moderns have every reason to welcome a com - parison .

		This is all natural enough , and would cause no comment were it not for the fact that it is but a short time ago that the prophecy of such a state of things was generally ridiculed in scholarly quarters .

		The times were ripe for the development of modern-language study ; capable men were at hand ; and the public gladly , the schools less readily , granted recognition to the new scholarship .

		The relations between the national society and the
Central Division	ORGANIZATION	are now very agreeable .

		The good sense of the great majority of those in attend - ance at the recent Western meeting prevented even the recognition of the grumblings of the one or two who still fail to see that the
Central Division	ORGANIZATION	is not a separate society , but simply affords the Western members of the national association a more con - venient place of gathering .

		The dates of the ses - sions were so arranged that it was possible for members to attend both meetings , and one or two did so .

		The
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	meeting was held in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , at the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	; the
Western	LOCATION	meeting convened at
Northwestern Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity in
Evanston	LOCATION	.

		Of the twenty-four papers read 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, nineteen were by men from States bordering on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, five by men representing
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	.

		In addition to these five papers , all the fifteen papers read at
Evanston	LOCATION	were by Western men .


Ann Arbor	PERSON	still forms the boundary between the
East	LOCATION	and the West , being represented at both meetings and in both cases by English papers .

		The attend - ance at the Western meeting was larger than usual , and more representative of the best the
West	LOCATION	has .

		At the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	meeting there was a noticeable in - crease in the number of rising young men .

		The papers read at the two meetings indicate , to some extent , the comparative activity in the differ - ent fields of work , though the hand of the Secretary is quite properly exerted to regulate this to some extent and thus make the meetings equally attractive to men representing the various languages .

		There is usually a dearth of Romance papers ; this year there was a great change in this matter at the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	meeting , there being nine English , eight Romance , and five Germanic papers .

		At
Evanston	LOCATION	there were six English , six Germanic , and but two Romance papers , though the Secretary made espe - cial efforts to have the
Romance	ORGANIZATION	department better represented .

		An unusual paper at the
East	LOCATION	was one on recent work in Celtic -LRB- which was , however , scarcely more than a bibliography -RRB- ; while at the
Western	LOCATION	meeting there were three papers dealing with Scandinavian subjects : one on the
Scandina	LOCATION	- vian element in English , by Professor Egge ; one by Professor Dodge , on the gender of English words in the Danish spoken in this country ; and one on the literary language or languages of
Norway	LOCATION	, by Professor Bothne .

		These papers , for the most part , represent the activity of men of Scandinavian de - scent living in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and show how local meetings tend to bring out the less general phases of linguistic study .

		More than half of the papers at both meetings dealt with literary , and most of the remainder with philological , subjects .

		At the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	meeting , Professor Hunt of
Princeton	LOCATION	read a semi-pedagog - ical paper extolling the new requirements in '' En - trance English '' ; the paper was censured for its indulgence in generalities .

		A pedagogical paper , read by Professor
Clark	PERSON	at the
Evanston	LOCATION	meeting , on '' Methods of Studying English Masterpieces , '' was criticised because it advocated the study of English masterpieces , not as literature , but as illus - trations of rules in formal rhetoric , and as a means of increasing the student 's vocabulary , which latter point the writer seemed to regard as one of the chief aims of such study .

		Of the literary papers presented at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, several dealt with prob - lems in comparative literature , and one , by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, with a problem of general liter - ature .

		The writer called attention to the fact that we have gone too far in regarding the drama as only a phase of literature .

		The conditions under which the real drama can succeed are quite different from those under which most literature is best ap - preciated , and these conditions can not be ignored in writing drama , and must be borne in mind in criti - cising a drama as a piece of literature .

		The address of the President , on '' The Province of English Philology , '' was also of a somewhat general nature in that it made an appeal for the maintenance , or rather the establishment , of the broader and higher signification of the word '' philology . ''

		It is to be doubted whether this meaning will ever really attach itself to the word , unless the higher conception is actually realized in a large number of our institu - tions , and in that case it would come about without personal resolves or the resolutions of learned socie - ties .

		Another paper that aroused general interest was that of Professor Fulton , of
Wells College	ORGANIZATION	, '' On Translating Anglo-Saxon Poetry '' ; for the discussion soon passed to the subject of the trans - lating of any kind of poetry .

		Professor Fulton advocated a metre that should conform as nearly as might be to that of the original , and in this was supported by Professor Bright and others .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	advocated greater freedom , and Professor Cook even contended for the use of prose in order to secure a faithful rendering of the thought , though at the total sacrifice of the form .

		In an interesting paper entitled '' Verbal Taboos , their Nature and Origin , '' Professor
Scott	PERSON	, of
Michigan	LOCATION	, explained , from the point of view of the psychologist , how it comes about that some of the natural developments of language fall under the ban of the makers of rhetorics and grammars .

		There can be no doubt that , as Professor
Scott	PERSON	said , these taboos of various forms of speech are often based on personal likes and dislikes of the authors of such books ; but it must be conceded that these personal likes and dis - likes are generally due to the belief that certain forms accord with real or assumed laws of language .

		What is needed is that scholars possessing a higher and truer knowledge of the life and growth of lan - guage be willing to write elementary books on the subject .

		In the meantime , such papers as Professor
Scott	PERSON	's will do much to bring into ridicule the pro- nunciamentos of ignorant pedants who have assumed dictatorship in the matter of speech usage .

		In a paper of unusual breadth of view , Professor
Schelling	PERSON	undertook to reconstruct the history of the
Classical School	ORGANIZATION	with
Ben Jonson	PERSON	as the corner - stone .

		He reviewed the well-known character of
Jonson	PERSON	's work and influence , and made clear the direct and important relation existing between these and the essential characteristics of the
Classical School	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the meeting at
Evanston Professor Hempl	ORGANIZATION	, in accordance with the principles laid down in the paper read by him at
New Haven	ORGANIZATION	two years ago , made clear the relation existing between the ''
Palamon	LOCATION	and Arcite '' and the '' Knight 's Tale , '' and showed that about two-thirds of the latter is essentially as it was in the earlier poem .

		Professor
Jack	PERSON	, of Lake Forest , presented a careful study of those passages in '' Piers the Plowman '' that have been regarded , especially by Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	, as reflecting facts in the life of the author , and showed that it
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 is exceedingly unlikely that these passages furnish any but the most insignificant biographical data .

		Professor
Goebel	PERSON	, of
Stanford	LOCATION	, sent to the Western convention a paper on
Heine	PERSON	's relation to
Wolfgang Menzel	PERSON	, in which , with considerable intensity of feeling , he undertook to show that
Heine	PERSON	had plun - dered
Menzel	PERSON	and then reviled him .

		The assertions and arguments of the paper were severely handled by Professor
Hatfield	PERSON	, of Northwestern , in a brief but pointed criticism .

		Professor
Hatfield	PERSON	himself read a paper on the earliest poems of
Wilhelm Miiller	PERSON	, and invited the convention to examine a collection of
2500	DATE	volumes of early and rare edi - tions of modern German writers , which the library of
Northwestern	ORGANIZATION	has just acquired through the efforts of Professor
Kohn	PERSON	.

		Professor
Voss	PERSON	, of Wis - consin , called attention to the need of a more thor - ough study of the prose writings of
Thomas Murner	PERSON	, which has hitherto been much retarded by the lack of suitable reprints .

		Of the papers touching on German literature that were read at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, that of Professor Wood , of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, on the proto - type of Leonore .

		attracted especial attention and aroused the acute criticism of Professor Thomas of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The election of officers resulted in the selection of Professor
Fortier	PERSON	, of
Tulane University	ORGANIZATION	, as presi - dent of the national society ; and of Professor
C. A. Smith	PERSON	, also of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, as president of the
Central Division	ORGANIZATION	.

		The next meeting of the national society will be at
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	; the place of meeting of the
Central Division	ORGANIZATION	has not yet been determined upon .

		DIALECT , OR ENGLISH ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		May I ask the opinion of yonr critical readers on a question of English ?

		The growth and popularity of the dialect story has caused words unknown to polite litera - ture to appear in conservative periodicals .

		That seems to be accepted as necessary .

		But how far can we per - mit this to go ?

		Can we afford to admit these tramps in the world of words into the society of their betters on terms of equality ?

		Can dialect and colloquial terms take the place of words which are acknowledged as standards in literature apart from the dialect story ?

		In an article in a recent number of '' Scribner 's
Maga	PERSON	- zine '' I find the word '' tote `` in the following sentence : '' The sellers of the unsubstantial cakes called barquillos , 1 little boats , ' tote around their roulette machines which resemble fire-extinguishers . ''

		What is the reader to understand from the sentence ?

		Is it supposed to be humorous ?

		or does the author , Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	, so far forget his
Connecticut	LOCATION	birth and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	training that he prefers a colloquial term to an orthodox English word ?

		The `` Century , '' `` International , '' and `` Standard '' dictionaries give '' tote '' as a word of unknown origin , a colloquial
Southern United States	LOCATION	word , in use especi - ally among negroes .

		The '' Century '' adds that it is '' in humorous use in the
North and West	LOCATION	. ''

		In an article on the
Southern States	LOCATION	, the occurrence of the local word might be justified by a desire for what is known as local color .

		But what justification can there be for using it in a description of a Spanish town ?

		Pursuing '' tote '' a little further , we find two instances of the use of the word cited in the '' Century '' diction - ary .

		One is in '' Science , '' Vol .

		XL , p. 242 , in a query concerning human beings as pack-animals : '' The first pack-animals were men and women ... They toted -LRB- carried on the head -RRB- ... '' In this instance , '' tote '' has a definite meaning peculiarly its own , which the user feels bound , however , to explain .

		The other citation is the '' Century Magazine , '' Vol .

		XI. , p. 224 , the passage being from a story by Miss Alice French -LRB- Octave Thanet -RRB- ; the scene is an
Arkansas	LOCATION	town , and the man in whose conversation the word occurs is an illiterate native , using the word in his own way .

		The two instances illustrate the legitimate use of the word , and leave Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	to explain why he finds it needful to use it in writ - ing of life in a place so remote from the home of the colloquialism which it certainly is .

		THE DIAL 41 Heio 1B00h8 .

		THE
NAVY	ORGANIZATION	AND THE NAVAL POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES .

		* Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	's '' History of Our
Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' is a popularly written work devoted mainly to descriptions of naval actions and warlike opera - tions afloat generally , participated in by our ships and sailors , from the '' Gaspe '' affair in
1772	DATE	down to recent times .

		Dwelling thus chiefly on the more romantic and picturesque side of his theme , the author has treated briefly and incidentally the drier and more technical topics of naval administration and development .

		What he says in the latter regard , however , is instructive and to the point , and seems to de - note a closer knowledge on his part of marine matters than is to be gained from histories and manuals alone .

		We are not prepared to assert that Mr.
Spears	PERSON	has actually been in the ser - vice , but his book has , to our thinking , an un - mistakable professional ring .

		Sea terms and scraps of nautical vernacular drop from his pen as easily and aptly as from Mr.
Clark Russell	PERSON	's , and he describes a sea fight with a zest and verve and a grasp of marine technicalities hardly to be looked for in the work of a landsman .

		His account of the famous actions of the War of
1812	DATE	is notably good though here the English reader , used to the consolatory versions of his own historians , may perhaps detect a note of undue exultation in Mr.
Spears	PERSON	's effusively patriotic pages .

		In his opening volume Mr.
Spears	PERSON	touches briefly on the origin of the
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and then passes on to the narration of the naval actions of the Revolutionary War and the first war with the Barbary pirates .

		The story of the War of
1812	DATE	occupies the whole of Volume II .

		and about half of Volume III. ; and the latter volume contains also accounts of the second war with the
Algerines	PERSON	, of the naval operations of the Mexican War , and of
Perry	PERSON	's
Japan	LOCATION	Expedition .

		There are special chapters on the British press-gang system , British prisons , naval duels , the
West India	LOCATION	pirates , etc. .

		The fourth and concluding volume is devoted to the Civil War , and closes with a suggestive chapter on our new
navy	ORGANIZATION	and the naval policy which in the author 's opinion this country ought to pursue .

		Mr.
Spears	PERSON	's views in this regard seem sounder than those generally advanced * THE HISTOKT OF OTJR

		by advocates of naval expansion one of whom he is , though in a comparatively moderate way .

		The gist of Mr.
Spears	PERSON	's contention seems to be that the important thing for us is not so much the immediate possession of a great array of battleships and big guns as the maintenance at all times of an ability to con - struct them when needed .

		The conditions which force European nations into the costly race for naval supremacy do not obtain in our case .

		We have no chronic quarrels on hand , no `` imperial policy '' of foreign aggression and annexation , no outlying and vulnerable posses - sions to defend .

		* We need not aspire to rate first , or even third , among naval powers in point of numbers .

		But in point of ability to construct we should aim at all times to be abreast of the first .

		We must not allow our plants to decay , our tools to rust , our artisans and inventors to stagnate .

		We must '' keep our hand in '' ; and to this end a relatively moderate degree of continuous activity in ship - building and gun-making , positive and experi - mental , will suffice .

		Mr.
Spears	PERSON	thinks we ought to lay down at least one new ship of the first class yearly .

		This course would serve not only to maintain and foster the ability in ques - tion , but also to keep afloat under our flag such a navy as sense and experience point to as the ideal one for us that is to say , a navy rela - tively modest in numbers , but unsurpassed in efficiency .

		As for our former cheese-paring policy of '' letting other nations do the experi - menting for us , '' events have shown us the futility of that .

		We '' saved the dollars , '' it is true ; and we had the fleeting satisfaction of chuckling over what we thought our '' cute - ness '' in getting our experience gratis .

		But they laugh best who laugh last .

		We speedily found , when we concluded some ten or twelve years ago to put our cheaply gained '' experi - ence '' to the test , that it was practically next to no experience at all ; that what we had saved in dollars we had lost in capacity ; that we could no more , of our own knowledge and re - sources , build a first-class battleship than
China	LOCATION	could ; and that if we needed one on compara - tively short notice we should be reduced to buying it of the nations that had been '' doing our experimenting for us . ''

		That was humiliat - ing .

		More than that , it was alarming , since it disclosed our defenceless condition , and nobody in his senses contends that we are so absolutely exempt from the danger of foreign war as to The acquisition by this country of
Cuba	LOCATION	or
Hawaii	LOCATION	would of course necessitate some revisal of our author 's conclusions .

		42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, need no degree of '' preparedness '' for it what - ever .

		Not even
Jefferson	PERSON	went so far as that ; for he advocated , as we know , a defensive navy to consist of a sort of amphibious gun-boat that could be stored on land in times of peace , and rolled down on the beach for launching in case of invasion .

		So , when we discovered the folly of expecting to absorb , without cost or effort , the hard - won skill and capacity of other nations , we set about mending matters with an energy and judgment of which we are now beginning to reap the reward .

		Fortunately , we slipped through the ticklish period of our apprentice - ship in modern naval construction without seri - ous foreign entanglements ; else we must have had to pay for our former penny - wise methods in the solid coin of national shame and disaster .

		For years , with an elastic and vaguely conceived
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, a minatory press , and a blus - tering coterie of Congressional Bobadils on our hands , the condition of our navy was such that had we gone to war with even a minor power like Chili which at one time showed some - thing like a desire to `` get at us '' we should probably have met at the outset a series of mortifying defeats .

		Time , enabling us to bring our vast general resources to bear , must have reversed matters ; but in the meantime we should have drunk of the cup of national humiliation deep enough , perhaps , to satisfy even our British post-prandial friends and well - wishers , and enable them to return in kind our compliments on their exploits against petty foes at
Majuba Hill	ORGANIZATION	and elsewhere .

		Turning to current events , can anyone doubt that the greatly improved condition of our
navy	ORGANIZATION	to-day is a factor making mainly for peace in our present entanglement in Spanish-Cuban quarrels , or that if our navy were twice or thrice as strong as it is our position at
Madrid	LOCATION	would be twice or thrice as strong also ?

		It needs but a slight acquaintance with Spanish opinion as mirrored in the usual organs of expression to see that the first consideration that presents itself to the Spanish mind when weighing the alternative of `` Peace or War ? ''

		with this country is not a moral or even an economical one , but the purely practical one as to the chance of success the
Spanish navy	ORGANIZATION	would have in a conflict with ours .

		The Spaniard is con - vinced that we are totally and flagrantly wrong on this Cuban question ; he is convinced of his patriotic duty to resent what he deems our insolent intermeddling in his private affairs ; and it is by no means unreasonable to assert that were our navy to-day what it was ten or twelve years ago we should have a war on our hands within six months .

		As it is , our diplo - matic efforts to abate the Cuban nuisance are already bearing good fruit , and will doubtless be crowned with ultimate success .

		Complications such as this with
Spain	LOCATION	may arise at any time , and from unforeseen quarters .

		The policy to which we stand committed , of opposing vi et armis on this continent such political enter - prises on the part of European nations as that of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	in
Mexico	LOCATION	, or as are now -LRB- thanks to the prevalent craze for '' Imperial - ism '' and schemes of '' colonial expansion '' of the Jamesonian order -RRB- on foot in
China	LOCATION	, and indeed almost everywhere else where the local power is notoriously weak and unsupported , is in itself , one would think , enough to warrant us in keeping afloat such a navy as Mr.
Spears	PERSON	holds to be commensurate with our needs and our political pretensions .

		The building of our new navy virtually began with the formation by Secretary
William H. Hunt	PERSON	of a board , headed by Rear - Admiral
John Rogers	PERSON	, '' to determine the requirements of a new navy . ''

		The board found that the
United States	LOCATION	ought to have twenty-one battleships of the first class , seventy unarmored cruisers , twenty torpedo boats , five torpedo gunboats , and five rams .

		The estimate was not extrava - gant , and it was largely approved by the nation .

		Then we started , or tried to start , to build our ships .

		We had a beautiful theoretical knowl - edge of how everything was to be done , and the time had come to show a rather skeptical world how extremely sharp we had been in getting all this knowledge without expending a dollar or handling a tool .

		But somehow or other , when we turned to our ship-yards and foundries things did not work as smoothly as our politi - cians and naval doctrinaires had led us to ex - pect .

		There was an ominous hitch at the start .

		We found that we could not build even one of the armored ships .

		We could not roll even the thinnest of armor-plates , nor make a gun that would pierce even the cheap plating of the ramshackle old monitors we had lying up in ordinary .

		In short , we had to begin our edu - cation in modern naval construction almost de novo ; and so , instead of building battleships off-hand as we had expected to do , we started in tentatively on third-rate cruisers .

		Of course we had to buy our first armor-plates abroad , and we even went abroad for the plans of one of our cruisers the ''
Charleston	LOCATION	. ''

		Had war been impending we should have had to buy our ships outright and fully equipped wherever
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , they could be found .

		But , as Mr.
Spears	PERSON	ob - serves , we were building a navy in time of peace ; and a ship that '' could not get out of her own way , '' if built by our own mechanics and designers , was then more to our purpose than the best one afloat would have been if purchased abroad .

		The important thing for us at the start was not so much the product as the training , the building of men rather than the building of ships .

		The product , however , of our earliest efforts was very creditable to us .

		Our first cruisers were the ''
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' the ``
Atlanta	LOCATION	, '' and the ``
Boston	LOCATION	'' ; and these ships , while by no means `` the best of their class afloat , '' as our enthusiastic reporters and poli - ticians of course declared them to be , were remarkably good ships , considering the circum - stances under which they were built .

		Says Mr.
Spears	PERSON	: '' As the product of apprentices in the art of building modern warships , they are marvels of excellence .

		But since they were designed we have learned something . ''

		Since they were designed we have indeed learned a great deal .

		We have , for instance , learned to design and build a ship like the ``
New York	LOCATION	, '' of which Mr.
Spears	PERSON	says : '' She cost ' a whole lot of money , ' it is true , but as we recall the thrill that stirred the nation when the story of her trial trip was told when it was told that we had built the swiftest and most powerful cruiser in the world , we are bound to say that twice the sum in - vested in any other way by the government could not have given the nation so great a benefit .

		It was not that anyone was incited to a point where he wished the nation to go to war ... With the
New York	LOCATION	' afloat , the American patriot was so far assured that his country would not be bullied , and so we should have peace . ''

		Swift cruisers like the twenty-two knot '' Co - lumbia '' and the still swifter ''
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, '' and a shoal of little cruisers and gunboats for shallow waters , followed the ''
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		In the meanwhile we were at work on real battle - ships , beginning with the ''
Maine	LOCATION	'' and ending with the ''
Iowa	LOCATION	, '' the ''
Indiana	LOCATION	, '' the ''
Kear	PERSON	- sarge , '' and the '' Illinois . ''

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, the English author of '' Ironclads in Action , '' draws an instructive comparison between our ''
Iowa	LOCATION	'' and the British '' Majestic , '' and concedes that the American ship , though considerably smaller than the British one , is fully a match for her .

		Says our author : '' Let no mistake be made about this .

		It is a matter of the greatest moment when our ship of 11,500 tons is conceded to be a match for one of 15,000 tons in the best navy in the world not because we have the ship , but because we have developed the men who can do that kind of work and the tools for their use . ''

		While we were developing shipbuilders we were also developing gnnmakers .

		As we have said , we could not ten years ago make a gun that would pierce the armor of one of the old '' Monitors . ''

		The '' Monitor '' turret was com - posed of eight layers of one-inch iron plates , laid so as to break joints , and our best gun of that day , a seven-inch
Brooke	PERSON	, firing a solid shot weighing 150 pounds , was unable to do any material damage to it .

		Nowadays we make guns throwing projectiles that would pierce the turret of a '' Monitor '' as a rifle - bullet would pierce a bandbox .

		The fact that our mod - ern cannon throw projectiles weighing 1,100 pounds , which strike with a force sufficient to lift a thousand tons twenty-five feet , tells the story of the development of the gun .

		The modern eight-inch rifle throws a steel bolt weighing 250 pounds , at a muzzle velocity of 2,500 feet per second , with a striking power of 10,830 fooUons .

		The fact that the old eight - inch iron shot could not penetrate four inches of iron plates , while the modern steel bolt pene - trates twenty-six inches of wrought iron , is sug - gestive .

		The best thirteen-inch modern rifles have a striking power of about 35,000 foot-tons , and penetrate thirty-four inches of wrought iron .

		Thus , after an apprenticeship of ten years the gunmakers and shipbuilders of the
United States	LOCATION	have done enough , as Mr.
Spears	PERSON	thinks , to entirely satisfy their countrymen .

		We can now build and equip our own ships .

		Among the navies of the world ours ranks , at best , fifth , hardly as high as it should rank even now , perhaps , and certainly far lower than it should rank were the government to embark on that '' forward policy '' of which the annexation of
Hawaii	LOCATION	would be the first step .

		Whether or no that step will be taken is doubtful ; and there now seems to be a growing tendency to adopt Speaker
Reed	PERSON	's sober dictum , '' Empire can wait , '' as a watchword .

		We all know the magic influence on opinion of catching phrases currently repeated ; and it is not unlikely that this one of Speaker
Reed	PERSON	's will go far to turn the scale in settling the impending Hawaiian question .

		Mr.
Spears	PERSON	's `` History of Our
Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' is , all things considered , the best that has yet been produced , and it is profusely and appro - priately illustrated .

		* '' I am a Swiss by birth , a German by edu - cation , an American by choice . ''

		Such was Dr.
Philip Schaff	PERSON	's description of himself nationally .

		Had he said , '' I am a Christian , '' he would have expressed his real relationship theologically .

		True , he was connected with a denomination ; but he was claimed by the whole Christian church .

		As his life was given in service for the whole church , so an account of that life is of interest in every branch of the church .

		His son , as his biographer , realizes the deli - cacy and difficulties of his position . ''

		A son is prompted by natural disposition to mistake matters of a purely private interest for matters of public concern , and to dwell upon what is usual and common as though it were exceptional and distinctive . ''

		But he has selected his mate - rials most wisely , and has proved his fitness for his task by showing a fair discernment of his father 's abilities , and by a marked modesty in reference to matters in which he personally was a participant .

		He tells us of his father 's life , not of his own .

		In reading of Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	's early days , we gain an insight into
Continental	ORGANIZATION	methods of instruc - tion in both preparatory and university work .

		And as Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	's long life was spent in the class-room , this view is extended even into our own times , and in this country as well as in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		More than this , the biographer , having access to memoranda preserved by Dr. S chaff , shows us much of his father 's association with the leading theological and philosophical teach - ers of the last sixty years .

		And , still further , we gain Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	's own intelligent estimate of these leaders of thought .

		Extracts from his journal are more valuable than encyclopaedic articles , as being less formal , and as being the written appreciation of one who knew them intimately .

		Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	impressed all his acquaintances as an intensely spiritual man .

		With him knowl - edge never took the place of piety .

		His was a simple yet perfect trust on Jesus Christ .

		Much of his conversation had this as its topic .

		The first chapter of this biography tells of his con - version , and the influence in his early life of pastor and teachers .

		It was his most precious attainment .

		Much interest naturally centres about the * THE LIFE OF

		occasion of his coming to
America	LOCATION	, and the views held by German Christians as to the con - ditions and needs of this country .

		His coming was largely in the missionary spirit .

		His first twenty years of service were given in the semi - nary of the German Reformed church at Mer - cersburg ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		His inaugural address , at the age of twenty-five , on '' The Principle of Protestantism , '' opened a new line of thought , and has been regarded as the most influential work of the denomination in this country .

		It led to a trial of its author upon charges of heresy , and , because of his acquittal , the with - drawal of leading men from denominational affiliation .

		But the
Mercersburg	LOCATION	theology , so - called , as developed out of this discussion , has exerted a helpful influence upon the statements of all the Reformed communions .

		The last twenty-three years of Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	's life were devoted to teaching in
Union Theo	LOCATION	- logical Seminary .

		To this work he brought the abilities gained by long years of close study , by twenty years of teaching experience , and by thirty years of personal contact with the leading educators of the world .

		His long service in
Union Seminary	LOCATION	was particularly fruitful .

		His instruction was helpful and au - thoritative .

		His influence upon students was encouraging and uplifting .

		His service to the church was wide-reaching .

		His opportunities for research and authorship were unlimited .

		A look at Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	's relations to his stu - dents may be pleasant .

		Many will remember , as does this writer , his custom of inviting us to walk with him , one on either side , for half an hour , seeking to become better acquainted with us , and to give such direction and encour - agement in our student work as was possible .

		These half-hours out of his busy life were among his best gifts , and awaken renewed gratitude when recalled to memory .

		His stu - dents also found employment in his study , at remunerative prices , in clerical work in con - nection with his publications .

		The study of Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	's life really shows us the history of the great religious movements during the last half-century .

		During these years
Protestant Christianity	ORGANIZATION	has become more compact .

		Its members have come closer to - gether .

		A heartier fellowship exists .

		Prob - ably no other agency has been so helpful in this respect as the
Evangelical Alliance	ORGANIZATION	; and at times it seemed hardly too much to say that
Philip Schaff	PERSON	was the
Evangelical Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he could work as could no other , because of his extraordinary acquaintance in all parts
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 of the Christian world , and the eminent re - spect and affection felt for him by leaders in all denominations .

		And the reason was evi - dent .

		He did not seek or expect an organic union of churches . ''

		He urged confederate union between allied Protestant communions . ''

		In the service of the
Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, and looking toward such a union of sentiment and effort , he gladly gave his time , and made it the sub - ject of constant thought and prayer .

		He believed that American theology should be Christocentric .

		The Bible Revision idea early secured his attention .

		He saw the need , and he labored unceasingly and persistently for its accomplish - ment .

		To him was entrusted the responsibility of organizing the American companies of Re - visers .

		Through him the communications be - tween the English and American companies were continually held .

		And when , because of the terms imposed by the
University Presses	ORGANIZATION	, to whom the English Revisers transferred the copyright , the original relations to the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can Revisers could not be maintained , and it seemed impossible to hold the American com - panies together , it was again Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	who , by his intermediary relations , restored the har - mony , and enabled the project to succeed .

		Perhaps the one feature in his theological life most pleasant to him was his relation to German and American theologians .

		He called himself '' a mediator between German and Anglo-American Theology and Christianity . ''

		Dr.
Mann	PERSON	called him '' the presiding genius of international theology . ''

		His breadth of view and catholicity of temperament led him to enter with enthusiasm into the project for a
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment of Religions , at
Chicago	LOCATION	, in
1893	DATE	, and to take an active part in this world-famous gath - ering .

		He did not regard this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as some seem to have done , as an exaltation of non - Christian religions , nor did he consider himself as sacrificing any Christian convictions by sharing in its discussions .

		He looked upon it as a step toward the reunion of Christen - dom , the thought to which he had given his whole life , and which formed the subject of his address read at the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Henry H. Jessup	PERSON	characterized this paper as '' apos - tolic , one of the most Christ-like utterances in all church history . ''

		Dr.
Schaff	PERSON	is known most widely by his writings .

		Men marvel at reading the list of original and edited works , both in English and in German .

		His '' History of Christianity , '' his '' History of the Creeds , '' and his '' Person of Christ '' will live , and long be recognized as leading works in their spheres .

		Thus we have tried to give an idea of the picture of this great life as portrayed in the stately volume before us .

		It is only a sugges - tion .

		The reader will not want to leave the book .

		It is well written .

		It presents a faithful picture .

		It is not overdrawn .

		It shows us the man .


HARRY W. REED	PERSON	.

		MR. GRANT AL. I/EX AS AX ANTHRO - POLOGIST .

		* Everyone knows Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's style : it is always bright and attractive .

		Its charm is not absent in his first extensive work in anthropology , '' The Evolution of the Idea of God . ''

		In this work he aims to get at the way in which our modern idea of God has originated and developed .

		He recognizes two conflict - ing schools of thought upon the matter , that of the humanists and that of animists , and says , '' This work is to some extent an attempt to reconcile them . ''

		Having made this statement , he proceeds to draw up what is perhaps the most complete and forceful statement of the ghost-theory pure and simple that has been presented .

		The book shows an enormous amount of thought and ingenuity .

		While he does not appear to us to demonstrate the fal - lacy of animism , he certainly presents many points favoring the ghost-theory , which must be considered .

		Having thus indicated the author 's position , we may briefly trace his outline of treatment .

		The origin of gods is in every case traced back to the dead man . ''

		We see at once that no gods exist for them -LSB- i , e. , simple savages -RSB- save the ancestral corpses or ghosts . ''

		The subject of the worship of stones and stakes is then taken up .

		The claim is made that the sacred stone is in its origin the gravestone : at first merely a bowlder rolled upon the grave to keep the dead man down ; later , a true gravestone , coming in time to be the ` representative of the man ; lastly , his carved representation .

		In similar wise it is claimed that the sacred stake was at first driven through the body to hold the dead man .

		It followed much the same line of development as the stone , and came in time to really represent the dead man in his divine form .

Jahweh	PERSON	was a sacred gravestone , which was carried in the ark of the covenant and represented a long - deceased ancestor .

		In the light of his investi - gations to this point , the gods of
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Israel	LOCATION	are studied , and the rise of monotheism out of polytheism traced .

		At this place we find the author saying : '' We have shown how polytheism came to be , and how from it a certain particular group of men the early Israelites rose by slow degrees through natural stages to the monotheistic conception ... How did this purely local and national Hebrew deity advance to the conquest of the civilized world ?

		... Why do most of the modern nations which have nominally adopted monotheism yet conceive of their god as com - pounded in some mystically incomprehensible fashion of three persons the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost ? ''

		In elucidation of these questions , the matters of incarnation and the intentional manufacture of gods are discussed .

		Of such manufactured gods , the gods of cultivation , and especially the gods of corn and wine , are studied .

		Here the vast mass of materials gathered by Mannhandt and Tragen are drawn upon , though Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's point of view and mode of treatment are radically different from theirs .

		Resurrec - tion , sacrifice , the sacrament , atonement , are investigated in connection with such gods .

		Two principles are then enunciated '' first , that a dying god , human or animal , is usually selected as a convenient vehicle for the sins of the people ; and second , that without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins . ''

		The reader can easily see that Mr.
Allen	PERSON	is leading up to his climax .

		Christ is the god of a Syrian population ; a corn-and-wine god , whose death frees the world from sin and whose resurrection proves that man shall rise again .

		The sacra - ment of his flesh and blood , bread and wine , is paralleled by many similar sacraments to such gods elsewhere .

		We have thus fully presented Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's treatment , because fairness appeared to demand it .

		It is at once thoughtful and ingenious ; it is presented as inoffensively as possible .

		It deserves careful study , not only from the an - thropologist of whatever school , but also from the religionist who pays no attention to anthro - pology proper .

		While the animist will not be convinced by the argument , he will certainly be given abundant matter for thought , pre - sented strikingly and fearlessly .

		PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION ?

		* The interesting initial volume of the projected pub - lications of the
Philosophical Union of the Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
California	LOCATION	bears the title `` The Conception of God . ''

		It is the product of a debate in the Univer - sity between Professors
Royce	PERSON	,
LeConte	PERSON	,
Howison	PERSON	, and Meres .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	led off in the discus - sion , and his presentation was made the pivotal point of what followed .

		The later and larger por - tion of the volume is made up of a more complete statement and more careful defense of his positions .

		His view is that of Monism , rendered in the form of Idealism ; and the doubt it occasioned was whether any adequate room could be found in it for the transcendental personal character of God .

		The defense and the attack necessarily led to the question of freedom , the distinguishing point in personality , and the dividing point in forms of law .

		It is this question especially which Professor
Royce	PERSON	treats in his final statement .

		One observes with interest the assertion of each of the contestants , that he finds as the fruit of the debate but little occasion to modify his own opinions .

		The grasshopper plunges through the ingenious web of the spider .

		It is of no moment ; there is thread enough in the spinneret to repair the damage .

		The same instinct that wove the first tissue will readily restore it .

		Is it simply the cohesion of a philosophical con - ception we seek after , or is it a faithful rendering of all Christian experiences ?

		Does philosophy follow after faith with a theory conformable to facts ; or does a theory predetermine the contents of faith , giving faith less or more room as the ruling idea expands or contracts upon it under the hand - ling of the mind ?

		There can hardly be a doubt as to which is the proper relation .

		Religious belief , religious activity , and religious sentiment constitute the controlling evolutionary facts which make up the spiritual world .

		It is the business of philosophy simply to take these facts at their true value , which is their empirical value , and give them adequate support and inner coherence .

		The subtlety of the ideas developed in this process , and their logical coherence , are of little moment compared with their conformity to the religious history of the world in its depth , power , and diversity .

		The effort of Professor
Royce	PERSON	seems to be to broaden an idea , the inade - quacy of which the mind instinctively feels , so that it may , with some color of truth , embrace the facts * THE CONCEPTION OF GOD .

		THE DIAL 47 of a spiritual world , in itself so ample , unimpeach - able , and grandly significant .

		These experiences are crowded together and belittled , simply that a ruling conception may have some show of covering them .

		We much prefer the idealistic to the em - pirical rendering of the world ; but we can accept neither , because neither is adequate to its work .

		One can hardly touch the discussion involved in this book without being at once immersed in it .

		Pro- fessor
Royce	PERSON	shows much ingenuity of thought , and clearness and grace of expression .

		The fatal defect in his theory is that it is a web floating in the air .

		To pursue it with the eye is to fall over the things nearest to us and be bruised upon them .

		It is fitted to give correction to the inadequate statements of realism , not to displace them .

		It is only an invigo - rating intellectual gymnastic to encounter idealism .

		The doctrine is far too-removed from the general mind the facts which that mind stands for to make any extended conquests .

		The criticism of Professor
Royce	PERSON	on the thing-in - itself as an unknowable term , brought in to no pur - pose to expound phenomena , seems to us just .

		We do not think it holds , however , as against force and phenomena , regarded as one inseparable fact . ''

		The Providential Order of the World '' is the title of a volume containing a series of lectures given in the
University of Glasgow	ORGANIZATION	, on the Gifford foundation .

		Lord Gifford , in endowing these lec - tures , assigned as the theme , A Knowledge of God , and directed that the lectures should be addressed to the general student and that they should keep pace with current thought .

		The well-trodden con - ventional paths of apologetics were thus closed to them .

		The subject chosen by Professor
Bruce	PERSON	, and the discussion under it , were in harmony with this purpose .

		The salient points are man 's place in the universe , the worth of man , the discipline of the world as developing character .

		No themes could be more vital and comprehensive .

		The author treats them with liberal resources of knowledge , and with a broad and generous spirit .

		We can not , however , think his thoughts quite as incisive , nor his conclu - sions quite as masterful , as the topic demands .

		While he does not fall below the occasion , he does not signally rise to it .

		`` Christian Aspects of Life '' is a volume made up of occasional addresses by the Bishop of
Durham	LOCATION	, delivered in the ordinary routine of his work .

		They are united by a loose cohesion of topics , under a variety of headings , such as `` The National Church , '' `` Foreign Missions , '' `` Education , '' `` Social Service . ''

		They are hardly vivacious or fresh , but they are eminently sober and substantial .

		We are left in no doubt as to whether they are philosophical or relig - ious .

		They are profoundly religious ; yet taken out of the region of cant by an erudite and reflective temper .

		Bishop
Westcott	PERSON	is one more in the long list of experienced , devout , and cultivated divines whom the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	has nourished in its communion .

		They have been men who have deeply felt the force of religions ideas as applied in a sober and extended form to the affairs of life .

		They have had a faith conformable to and strengthened by a varied , positive , and fruitful experience .

		Little as we may be inclined to accept the details of doctrine or ritual associated with this
Church	ORGANIZATION	, we can hardly fail to see that there is a solid and undeniable ele - ment of fact and truth in this continuous develop - ment of human life under religious belief .

		RECENT AMERICAN POETRY .

		* It is many years since it was last possible to in - clude a new volume by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	in any review of recent poetry .

		The student of literature does not altogether bemoan the lapsed period , for it at least enabled the poet to win another sort of dis - tinction by producing , in his three volumes of prose , the most substantial and serious body of literary criticism that has yet been written by any American .

		Meanwhile , although
Lowell	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Holmes	PERSON	went to join the majority of poets dead and gone , we knew that one of their noblest fellow - singers was still with us , and were not infrequently reminded of the fact by an occasional contribution to some periodical publication .

		48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, contributions , and many others heretofore unpub - lished , have at last been brought together in a volume of '' Poems Now First Collected , '' and our literature is made the richer by a book which not only exhibits no decline from the standard of the familiar '' Household Edition '' of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's verse , but in some respects marks an advance in power of expression , a severer artistic restraint , a richer music , and a riper passion .

		Some of these pieces , indeed , are already familiar enough . ''

		The Hand of Lincoln '' long ago took its place among the best poems inspired by the great leader whose life and tragic fate also inspired the ''
Commemo	PERSON	- ration Ode '' of
Lowell	PERSON	and the immortal threnody of Whitman .

		The `` Provencal Lovers , '' too , has long been a favorite illustration of the vein of mingled sentiment and fancy that has been so char - acteristic a feature of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's work .

		Of such poems as these little remains to be said , and we note , rather , some of the less familiar pieces in the collection now published .

		Among these a high place must be given to the Christmas ballad or carol of '' The Star-Bearer , '' which has an imaginative reach and splendor of diction to which the poet has not often attained .

		The first two stanzas may be quoted . ''

		There were seven angels erst that spanned
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's roadway out through space , Lighting with stars , by God 's command , The fringe of that high place Whence plumed beings in their joy , The servitors His thoughts employ , Fly ceaselessly .

		No goodlier band Looked upward to His face .

		`` There , on bright hovering wings that tire Never , they rested mute , Nor of far journeys had desire , Nor of the deathless fruit ; For in and through each angel soul All waves of life and knowledge roll , Even as to nadir streamed the fire Of their torches resolute . ''

		A music simpler , but no less exquisite , is found in '' A Sea-Change , at Kelp Rock , '' a reflective strain suggested by reading Sophocles one
summer	DATE	day .

		It is the music of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's '' Wine of Cy - prus , '' and is quite as haunting in its melancholy beauty . ''

		Drops the book but from its prison Tell me now what antique spell , Through the unclaspt cover risen , Moves the waves I know so well ; Bids me find in them hereafter , Dimpled to their utmost zone With the old innumerous laughter , An ^ Egean of my own ? ''

		Even so : the blue .

		iEgean Through our tendriled arches smiles , And the distant empyrean Curves to kiss enchanted isles : Isles of Shoals , I know yet fancy This one day shall have free range , And yon isles her necromancy Shall to those of Hellas change . ''

		Still another strain , this time stately and austere , breathes from the noble ode ''
Corda Concordia	PERSON	, '' written for the opening in
1881	DATE	of the
Concord School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The poem ends with these fine stanzas : '' So come when long grass waves Above the holiest graves Of them whose ripe adventure chides our own Come where the great elms lean Their quivering leaves and green To shade the moss - clung roofs now sacred grown , And where the bronze and granite tell How Liberty was hailed with life 's farewell . ''

		Here let your Academe Be no ignoble dream , But consecrate with life and death and song , Through the land 's spaces spread The trust inherited , The hope which from your hands shall take no wrong , And build an altar that may last Till heads now young be laurelled with the Past . ''

		As a writer of poems dedicated to persons or in - spired by occasions , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	at his best is not surpassed by any of his fellow-singers .

		The '' com - memorations '' section of his new volume gives us , in such poems as that last mentioned , a music and an ethical passion combined beyond which even
Lowell	PERSON	did not go , in the `` Ubi Sunt Qui ante Nos '' with such touches as `` There the blithe divines , that fear no more the midnight chimes , sit each With his halo tilted a trifle , and his harp at easy reach '' a lambent humor that
Holmes	PERSON	never bettered ; and in the exquisite sonnet '' Ad Vigilem , '' addressed to the poet who had inspired the blank verse of '' Ad Vatem '' a score of years before a note of tender reverence that is all his own .

		And even yet we have not tasted all the varied richness of this vol - ume .

		The considerable section of lyrics and descrip - tive pieces styled collectively '' The Carib Sea '' has put the color and the languorous passion of the tropics into verse so exquisite that the lack of space which forbids us further quotations seems more oppressive than usual ; while the closing poem , an ode written for the
Shelley	PERSON	centenary , brings to a worthy end the most precious volume of American poetry that has seen the light for many years .

		It seems to us the most important volume that the author has ever produced , for it exhibits the restraint of the full-grown artistic consciousness in combina - tion with the qualities that we most associate with youth the freshness of feeling and the ardor that the advancing years of the poet have had the singu - lar happiness to preserve uncooled and undimmed .

		The best of our other poets must suffer in com - parison with Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, but there is still a niche in the temple of song for such sincere and fastidious verse as is found in Mr.
Robert Underwood John	PERSON	- son 's new volume , '' Songs of Liberty , and Other Poems . ''

		Better , in our judgment , than Mr.
John	PERSON	- son 's more pretentious poems is the tender senti - ment of such a lyric as '' Oh , Waste No Tears . ''

		`` Not for the flaws of life shall fall The tear most exquisita ah , no ; But for its fine perfections all : For morning 's joyous overflow , For sunset 's fleeting festival , And what midwinter moons may show ;

		* ' An interesting section of this volume is devoted to a series of paraphrases from the Servian poet ,
Lmai	PERSON	lovan lovanovich , made with the help of Mr.
Nikola Tesla	PERSON	.

		They give English students of poetry to understand , not for the first time , the meaning of the quatrain which we reproduce . '' '

		Why , ' yon ask , ' has not the Servian perished , Snch calamities about him throng ? '

		With the sword alike the lyre he cherished : He is saved by song ! ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	closes his volume with a plea , both reasoned and impassioned , for a closer kinship of feeling between the two great branches of the En - glish race .

		The thought , so dear to the finer spirits of both peoples , has seldom found better expression than in this poem , '' Hands Over Sea , '' from which we may make one characteristic extract . ''

		True , there are those of onr impassioned blood Who can forget bnt slowly that thy great Misread the omens of oar later strife , And knew not Freedom when she called to thee .

		These think they hate thee !

		these , who have embraced Before the altar their fraternal foes !

		Not white of

		The bedtime wonder of onr children holds
Vicksburg	LOCATION	coeval with the siege of Troy .

		And the scorned slave so hastened to forgive The scar has lost remembrance of the huh . ''

		Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	's second volume of verse , Memorial Day , and Other Poems , '' exhibits a dis - tinct advance over '' Dumb in
June	DATE	, '' his first .

		He has much to learn or perhaps we should say to practice of the technique of his art , but his verse already shows marked poetical feeling , and an in - stinct for the right thing in form and expression .

		We read him at his best in such a piece as '' My Poets . '' ''

		I saw them in my dreams , a goodly band With lyre of gracious make within each hand , A laurel wreath upon each shining head , All young as youth and all fair - garmented . ''

		They swept the strings beside a magic sea That ever beat its waves in melody Upon a shore where blooms immortal sprang Between their feet , for solace while they sang . ''

		I waked , and saw them in the light of day : A motley crowd , for some were bent and gray , And some clothed on with rags and hollow-eyed , And others limped , as they had journeyed wide . ''

		And oftenwhiles they sang when racked with pain , Or spake of field and flower , of Love 's domain , When mured about by sad and noisome sights And lacking air and space and
May	DATE	delights .

		`` And yet methinks I love their motley more Than those dream-singers that I saw before ; And yet methinks they looked of heavenly race By some strange token on their brow and face ! ''

		In one of the stanzas of '' Memorial Day '' we find an echo of the prayer embodied in the poem above quoted from , '' Hands Over Sea . '' ''

		Nay , on this day memorial ne'er forget The visioned good , the revelation
august	DATE	Of Peace betwixt the peoples : may we let Onr martial blood be cleansed of any lust Of war , and this
America	LOCATION	clasp hands Close with the parent English , two proud binds Before the world who let their weapons rust . ''

		We can not come across this sentiment too often in American poetry .

		It was a year ago that we hailed in a modest pamphlet of verse sent us by Mr.
Edwin Arlington Robinson	PERSON	a strong and distinctive note of song , and we are glad that the privately printed booklet has now been brought to the sight of a wider public .

		It is not strictly the same volume , for there are a number of new pieces , while the old ones are re - vised and rearranged . ''

		The Children of the Night '' gives a title to this new volume .

		Note - worthy among the added verses are a number of gnomic `` Octaves , '' for one of which we may find space . ''

		Nor jewelled phrase nor mere mellifluous rhyme Reverberates aright , or ever shall One cadence of that infinite plain-song Which is itself all music .

		Stronger notes Than any that have ever touched the world Must ring to tell it ring like hammer-blows , Right-echoed of a chime primordial , On anvils , in the gleaming of God 's forge . ''

		Mr.
Henry Rutgers Remsen	PERSON	seeks to attract attention to his verse by printing it on thick gray paper which makes the print difficult to read , and by a form of binding so peculiar that we should find it difficult to describe .

		Such adventitious allure - ments are apt to betoken scant literary art , and are not in the best of taste .

		The volume is called '' The Daughter of Ypocas , and Other Verse . ''

		Its opening is guarded about by several pieces of which we have failed to get any definite impression .

		The first of them is a plea for some ideal which we must confess our inability to understand , and closes with the startling line , * ' Or else hearest thon the voice ?

		America is
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Is this an
A. P. A.	PERSON	manifesto ?

		The Daughter of Ypocas , '' moon-child , maiden of magical spells , '' is a queer creature with whom we should prefer not to associate . ''

		Padre Mateo '' yields a very taking rhyme , '' All the loathsomeness Of filthy rags that showed her sloathsomeness . ''

		It has a jabberwocky sound , and we rather like it .

		Later in the volume we find some fairly satisfactory verse .

		This echo from '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' for example : '' Love is not all .

		Ah , would that it might be !

		Stilled would the spirit sleep within the breast !

		And life would seem but love 's eternity , Circled with kisses like the laurel-tree Folded with sunshine 's passion .

		Aye , the West Would meet the
East	LOCATION	, and bid the day-cares flee .

		If love were all ; if love were only best . ''

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, This also is a pretty stanza : '' Deeply wrapped in All Saints ' peace Earth lay like a lover keeping Watch and ward o'er
Summer	DATE	's sleeping In the City of Surcease . ''

		In short , Mr.
Remsen	PERSON	exhibits a pretty talent when he deals with simple forms and sentiments , but suf - fers something like shipwreck in his more ambitious ventures .

		Yet even here we must qualify , for it is certainly ambitious to translate the `` Atys , '' and Mr.
Remsen	PERSON	has done it with considerable success .

		Such misprints as '' fun ` rel , '' '' similies , '' and '' linia - ments '' we can not help viewing with suspicion .

		A modest little book of modest and pleasing verses is the '' Shadows '' of Mr.
Howe	PERSON	.

		There are bits of description , retrospective glimpses with the proper tinge of melancholy , and echoes from the author 's favorite poets .

		An example is '' Before the Snow . ''

		`` The yellow flame of goldenrod Is spent , and by the road instead , The flowers , like smoke-wreaths o'er the sod , Hang burned and dead ! ''

		The sumac cones of crimson show Beyond the roadsides , black and charred ; The trees , a bloodless , ashen row , Stand autumn-scarred . ''

		Dark are the field-fires of the year ; Let all the flickering embers die !

		Without , the cold white days are near ; Within are warmth and you , and I. '' Mr.
George Horton	PERSON	is putting to good uses the leisure hours of his consular position .

		His '' Aph - rdessa '' is the third or fourth volume that has come to him since he took his post at
Athens	LOCATION	, and is marked by the same good taste and sincerity of purpose that distinguished the others .

		The titular poem is , more - over , the most nearly perfect thing that the author has yet done , a pastoral tinged with the sensuous glow of
Keats	PERSON	, and telling a lovely tale , woven of charming fancies , concerning a new Endymion .

		We extract this exquisite lyric : `` Who would catch a Nereid maid He must follow , follow Fleetly on through sunny glade And through sylvan hollow .

		Come away at early morn If you love me , mortal , While the knight bee winds his horn At the rose 's portal . ''

		Three or four other pieces , all upon Greek themes , make up the remaining contents of this little book .

		Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	's new volume , '' Out of the Silence , '' is made up in part of pieces heretofore unprinted in collected form , in part of revised ver - sions of the poems published in two earlier volumes .

		Of the new pieces , the best seem to be a series of lyrics dedicated to the several months .

		Here is a ''
December	DATE	'' sonnet : '' And wherewithal shall Earth be clothed , to-day ?

		What music will she make , and speak what word , What beauty have , before unseen , unheard ; How will she stand , and what thing will she say ?

		She thinks not of one loveliness of
May	DATE	, Of any bloom of
June	DATE	, or singing bird , Of any autumn hue ; white-robed , unstirred By faintest breath , she speeds the light away .

		White-robed and voiceless , yet in mead or bough Never before so beautiful ; pure , still , A virgin , mindful only of her vow , She chooses well ; fitly will she fulfil The sacred rite . '

		T is dusk ; she sees it now Once more , the star upon the Syrian hill . ''

		This is Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	at his best ; at his second best , he too often has a catchy and whimsical utterance that seriously disturbs the flow of poetical feeling . ''

		The choir invisible we praise ; But I would join the choir I see , Of noble souls , who , glad and free , The living of the world upraise . ''

		This stanza serves as comment upon the title , '' The Choir Visible , '' given by Mrs.
Charles Kendall Adams	PERSON	to her volume of verse .

		It also strikes the keynote of the contents , which express , in various measures , one constant glow of love for mankind , one constant aspiration toward the divine .

		The diction of these pieces is simplicity itself : but they are informed by a large sincerity that lends to the simplest phrases both beauty and strength .

		Since the religious motive is prominent throughout , we can not do better than quote from the book one of its most distinctively religious utterances , '' Light at Eventide . '' ''

		If shadows overcast my morn And clouds its sunlight hide , I only ask thee ,
Lord	LOCATION	, to send Thy light at eventide . ''

		Though storms still hide my sun at noon , And darkness yet abide , My soul submissive only pleads For light at eventide . ''

		And while I plead , I know , O Christ , If I am near Thy side , Life 's storms will end in peace at last And light at eventide . ''

		The volume includes a considerable series of sonnets , and a number of poems written for occasions .

		Miss
Kimball	PERSON	's '' Victory , and Other Verses '' offers a collection of pleasing and finished work , subjective for the most part , and dealing with the abstractions that betoken a reflective rather than a creative mind .

		There is in them a marked religious note , attuned to the subtle harmonies of mysticism , which is well illustrated by the long poem which gives a title to the volume .

		We quote a few verses , expressive of the final vision of peace vouchsafed to the soul that has held its own against the leagued powers of darkness . ''

		Even as I gazed , that Power that slew my heart , My life itself , turned to a spectral thing , Such as one pure and perfect thought pricks through ; And darkness was annihilate by Light .

		Then from the battlements , I saw the clouds , Thinning to gray , sail swiftly past the sun ; He pierced them with his golden arrows keen ; And bade them hasten as they passed his throne ; And some he riddled through and through , and turned To veils of iridescent pearliness , That melted swiftly , imperceptibly , Till last he shone triumphant from clear space ; And Earth was glad , and sang his victory , And told the tale of darkness he had slain , Through the full throat of all her inborn life . ''

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 Nature is almost the sole inspiration of Miss
Evaleen Stein	PERSON	's `` One Way to the Woods , '' as , indeed , the subject of this title poem would indicate .

		A typical stanza is the following , from `` Flood - Time on the Marshes '' : '' Where , fringed with lacy fronds of fern , The grass grows rich and high , And flowering spider-worts have caught The color of the sky ; Where water-oaks are thickly strung With green and golden balls , And from tall tilting iris-tips The wild canary calls . ''

		This sort of landscape inventory is one of the com - monest features of modern minor verse , and it is usually so well done that we can not escape wonder - ing at the thoroughness with which one , at least , of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's lessons has been learned by his latter - day disciples .

		The '' Songs Ysame '' of Mrs.
Annie Fellows Johnston	PERSON	and Mrs.
Albion Fellows Bacon	PERSON	-LRB- two sis - ters , apparently -RRB- present nothing particularly note - worthy .

		From the first-named of the two we select '' Spring 's Cophetua . '' ''

		She came with garments scant and poor and thin , And white feet gleaming bare ; With pallid smiles where
April	DATE	tears had been , And snowflakes on her hair . ''

		Oh , never
Winter	DATE	thought such gentle look In all the land was seen !

		From his gray locks the diadem he took And crowned her as his queen .

		`` And now , in silken robes and gowns arrayed ,
Fair Spring	ORGANIZATION	reigns in his stead .

		Upon his throne she sits , the beggar maid '
Cophetua	PERSON	' is dead . ''

		The second writer yields a pretty elegy on '' Ophelia . '' ''

		Calm dost thon lie in wave-swept resting-place .

		No more the glances of the haughty Dane Can fill thy gentle breast with longing vain .

		The waves that stilled thy heart have drowned thy pain , And washed the sorrow from thy sweet , pale face , Ophelia . ''

		Thine be the violets , but his the rue .

		Though hope should sleep , and deep regret should wake , Thy clasped hand from Death 's he could not take ; The spell on those mute lips he could not break .

		What more with life and love hast thon to do , Ophelia ? '' ''

		Love 's Way '' is a '' monodrama , '' and the hero - ine 's name is Lilian .

		The story of the poet 's love is told in a series of lyrics , various in form , and , unlike the story of ''
Maud	PERSON	, '' ends with the chime of wedding bells .

		Mr.
Swift	PERSON	's '' other poems '' are two long essays in heroic verse , '' The Vision of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	'' and `` Heracles upon CEta , '' both dignified and finely wrought , and a few short pieces .

		Our selection must perforce be made from the latter , and so we take the sonnet '' Far above Rubies . '' ''

		All that we dream of gracious or divine In woman hath its type ; each holy sprite , Poet or seer , or saintly eremite , Resembles woman ; all that doth refine The arts , the manners , to her sway benign Owes high allegiance ; all things fair and right Her weakness champions in the world 's despite : Where woman is , no home but hath a shrine ; How oft , alas , profaned !

		Men crucify Her gentle spirit , and to shame betray Her innocence with a kiss ; her agony And sweat of blood the winds that ever stray Forever witness ; and her bitter cry Goes up to heaven for vengeance , night and day . ''

		We trust that Mr.
Benjamin Sledd	PERSON	is not as mel - ancholy a person in real life as his verses would make him out to be .

		His songs '' From Cliff and Scaur '' have their being in deep gloom , relieved by hardly an occasional ray of light .

		This , for exam - ple , is the sort of thing he gives us : '' No life was there in that lone land : Or only lived the shuddering sand , Blind , hungry thing , Which round my helpless feet would cling And strive to clasp me fast In its cold arms .

		There was no light , And yet I felt that height on height Shut in the dead black vast . ''

		The trouble with Mr.
Sledd	PERSON	's gloom is that it is not convincing .

		He leads us to no '' city of dreadful night '' in which he has long sojourned , but rather bids us share a perverse mood that he has forced upon himself for literary effect .

		We have examined every page of '' The Death of Falstaff , and Other Poems , '' hoping that the vol - ume might yield some bit of verse with the touch of distinction upon it , but the search has been in vain .

		We can find nothing better than such a stanza as this : '' Tell me ,
Lady Moon	PERSON	, though morning Beckon from the distant hill , Where my lady lies , adorning Sleep itself , do dreams distill Songs more sweet than bird can trill In the day-dawn when it hovers Songs my happy name containing ?

		Ah , no longer fear complaining That you are too kind to lovers ! ''

		Of such commonplace texture is Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's verse throughout , sometimes stilted , but never inspired .

		A breath of gentle melancholy fills Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's `` Songs of Flying Hours , '' a collection of poems which exhibit considerable technical skill , a wide range of serious thought , and a certain command of felicitous diction .

		They are verses of which no man would need to be ashamed , yet they are such verses as hundreds of men can write equally well .

		We reprint the sonnet-like poem called '' Death . '' ''

		And if we sleep ?

		If souls go out and die , As soft notes die upon the evening air , And if we fade and wither like a sigh , As fade the flowers that are so wondrous fair , Why should we grieve ?

		The life we lose was sweet , Or it was bitter good to have or lose ; And sleep comes soft , and no man may refuse The summons when he hears its stealthy feet .

		And if it lead us through the dark , blindfold , To where , we know not : still the hour may come When , with our eyes unbound , we may behold Whatever waits a prison or a home ; Or will it lead , still on , with fainter tread , Into some voiceless land , and leave us dead ? ''

		There is much verse of this grave meditative sort in 52 -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's volume ; it is too vague to make a sharp impression , and too diffuse to make a lasting one .

		The greater part of Mr.
Van Zile	PERSON	's volume is made up of such verse as journalism begets , verse that cares more for a '' point '' than for an idea , and is not meant to be taken seriously .

		Occasionally , as in '' The Unknown Sea , '' the author rises above this plane and achieves melodious stanzas . ''

		Long ere
Columbus	LOCATION	sailed the unknown sea , Upon the sands a lonely dreamer lay , And , gazing westward , sought to pierce the void Beyond the sky-line 's unresponsive gray . ''

		There at his feet the ocean , throbbing , strove To tell its secret to the weary soul , But knowing not the language of the sea He heard no message in the billows ' roll . ''

		Beyond the mist , where sky and ocean met , Reposed the waiting islands of the West , But naught the dreamer learned save that his heart Grew heavy with the vainness of his quest . ''

		So are we dreamers on the strand of life , Scanning an ocean heeding not our cry ; And , dim with tears , our straining eyes see not The smiling islands of the bye-and-bye . ''

		With Mr.
Irving Browne	PERSON	's '' House of the Heart '' we reach the end of this review of recent American poetry , and to the end of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's book do we turn for our final excerpts .

		There are , indeed , temptations by the way , for the author 's humorous fancies are often very cleverly expressed , but we have found nothing better or more characteristic than the series of short poems on '' The Moon as Viewed by Various Persons . ''

		First , there is the young woman , who is sentimental , then the physi - cian , who is practical .

		The one says : '' Under the moon my lover walks with me , And swears his love will never know eclipse , '' while the other comments grimly : '' The moon is my good patron , fruitful source Of aches and pains and cold is moonlight walk . ''

		The painter is vexed because he does not know how large to make the moon on his canvas , while the burglar objects to it for rising at a most inopportune hour .

		The astronomer remarks that he can no longer be expected to be devout at sight of a moon which reveals only '' A lot of empty craters , Dotting her surface like huge nutmeg graters , '' and the farmer complains that '' That pesky moon is always wet or dry , A turnin ' down or up her darned old horn , A rottin ' all the taters and the rye , Or burnin ' up the garden-sass and corn . ''

		Thus the practically - minded .

		The poet , meanwhile , sees nought of these things , but instead this vision : `` And still the moon moves on in God 's highway , Heedless alike of fond
Endymion	ORGANIZATION	's sighs , Of querulous man 's lament , of watchdog 's bay , And shows nor scorn nor pity nor surprise .

		So shall she move , until this trivial world , In hopeless ruin and confusion hurled , Lies shattered at the awful judgment day . ''

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The period of the Renaissance has for some time been a matter of cul - tivated acquaintance and interest .

		Such a book as '' Earthwork out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	'' shows that
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Symonds	PERSON	and Pater , as well as many another too in other ways than those of liter - ature proper , have so familiarized us with the gen - eral outline of Italian art and life , that a book which assumed really a great deal would find many readers .

		It is chiefly in painting , to tell the truth , that this interest manifests itself , but
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	painting has given reflected interest to many things else .

		One rather marked exception , however , is architec - ture .

		In the popular mind the architecture of the Renaissance has never taken a place alongside of painting and poetry .

		In fact , to many the idea of Renaissance architecture has been accursed , in ac - cord with the well-known views of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	as expressed in '' The Stones of
Venice	LOCATION	. ''

		This may have been partly because there was already a strong architectural favorite in the public mind , namely Gothic architecture , a favorite which had had
Scott	PERSON	and
Pusey	PERSON	as sponsers and the great cathe - drals of
Europe	LOCATION	as its own intrinsic merit .

		The victory of Gothic had been won during the century over the weak followers not so much of
Palladio	ORGANIZATION	even , as of Mansard and the
Barocco	LOCATION	artists , and the popular mind did not incline to see excellence in that which had been but recently displaced .

		These types , however , had not much connection with the Renaissance , they were really but remnants , as it were .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's book on '' Italian Renais - sance Architecture '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- deals with the real Renaissance , with the sixteenth cen - tury , with the period from
Brunaleschi	LOCATION	to
Palladio	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is based on lectures given before the
Glasgow School of Art	ORGANIZATION	, and has , as the author observes , '' a rudimentary and popular character '' which recom - mends it to the untechnicai reader .

		It is further very fully illustrated with excellent pictures , so that it is not onry intelligible but useful .

		It will be found , on the whole , rather more available than anything else on the subject that we know of .

		It is always important to compare the Disquisitions on the e i _
Dandiacal Soul	ORGANIZATION	.

		opinions of great men on great sub - jects .

		Hence the debt which the thinking world owes to Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	for his presenta - tion of the views of
Walter Pater	PERSON	and
Maurice Barres	PERSON	on the Blessedness of Egoism .

		It is by such work that we in
America	LOCATION	are able to keep in touch with the advancing thought of the Old World .

		Another opportunity is now at hand .

		American readers can at last weigh against Mr.
Max Beer	PERSON	- bohm 's theory of Dandyism the estimate of
Barkey D'Aurevilly	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has long been known that there was a difference of opinion , but so far Mr.
Beer	PERSON	- bohm has had the advantage of the last word in a case where the first had never been heard .

		For , beyond the mention in '' Dandies and Dandyism , ''
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 53 we fear that
Barkey	PERSON	D'Aurevilly has heretofore been largely conceived in
America	LOCATION	merely as a per - son who delighted in the use of inks of various colors and wore rose-colored silk hats and gold-lace neckties , facts drawn from a book entitled u
Degen	PERSON	- eration . ''

		The widely-read author of that entertain - ing work inferred hysteria from the violent colors and ego-mania from the hats and cravats .

		Mr.
Douglas Ainslie	PERSON	, however , who now presents us with a translation '' Of Dandyism and of
George Brum	PERSON	- mell '' -LRB-
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , does not seem to agree with the great scourge of letters ; he would seem to regard these matters as unimportant .

		Certainly they can not be weighed in importance with the great fundamental question .

		And here it must first be remarked that our two authorities differ in more respects than had been previously mentioned .

		They disagree not only in theory , but on facts .

		For instance , although they agree that it was not a fool - ish fancy for a uniform that led Brummell to join the
Tenth Hussars	ORGANIZATION	, they differ as to his reasons for leaving the corps .

		Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	says it was be - cause of a reprimand for appearing on parade in a blue tunic :
Barkey D'Aurevilly	PERSON	says that it was because the regiment was ordered to
Birmingham	LOCATION	.

		Let not such differences seem insignificant .

		Where facts differ , theories will differ , at least they ought to .

		The real difference between these two thinkers may perhaps be traced to some such variation in fact as this .

		Of the two , it is obvious that Mr.
Beer	PERSON	- bohm upholds the aesthetic doctrine , while
Barkey D'Aurevilly	PERSON	is distinctly ethical in his treatment .

		One thinks of Dandyism as an exquisite art , the other conceives it as an exquisite way of life .

		The difference is of course fundamental , and our readers will wish to pursue it and to decide for themselves .

		We recommend to them this translation with confi - dence .

		Its appearance , in type , paper , and binding , is worthy of its topic , and its topic is worthy of those who can appreciate it .

		The late Professor
Palgrave	PERSON	set for himself so high a standard of taste and discernment in that Golden Treasury '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which has by common acclaim been received as the best of English an - thologies that we were prepared to find in his '' second series '' of the publication , covering the period since
1850	DATE	, a work somewhat less satisfactory than its predecessor .

		But we did not anticipate so marked a falling-off , or a selection distinguished by so much unevenness , as the new anthology reveals .

		It was not Professor
Palgrave	PERSON	's fault that copyright considerations prevented the inclusion of anything by
Morris	PERSON	or Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	although a Victorian anthology without these poets seems hardly worth making , so unrepresentative must it be but the judgment was surely at fault that exalted such minor poets as
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	and
William Barnes	PERSON	as we find them exalted in this volume .

		These writers have seventeen and twelve poems , respect - ively , in the collection , as against one each from Two new Golden Treasuries .

		Landor ,
Peacock	PERSON	, and Mr.
Aubrey De Vere	PERSON	.

		The lapses from a balanced critical judgment in the selections from such men as
Kingsley	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and
Patmore	PERSON	seem to us also very noticeable .

		Of course , the contents of the volume are still '' choicely good , '' but we expected more than that from the editor of the first '' Golden Treasury . ''

		Mr.
Frederic Law	PERSON	- rence
Knowles	PERSON	, in his '' Golden Treasury of Amer - ican Songs and Lyrics '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , has brought together one hundred and forty-seven poems by sixty-one writers from Freneau to Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	.

		Fre - neau 's '' The Wild Honeysuckle '' fitly ushers in such a collection as this , but Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	's pretentious sonnets have by no means won for him a deserved place among our poets .

		Poe has no less than nine lyrics , the largest representation given to any poet .

		Whitman is excluded , with regret , for reasons that we must respect , although the canon is questionable that can not overlook considerations of form in a case like his .

		Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	has done his work with taste and discretion , for the most part , although it may hardly be taken as more than a tentative effort toward that definitive anthology which we hope for in the future .

		The volume is exceptionally charming from the mechanical point of view , and does great credit to the new house whose imprint it bears .

		`` Music :
Itt	ORGANIZATION	Ideal * and Methods .

		Mr.
W. S. B. Mathews	PERSON	has recently brought together into a sizable vol - ume nearly two score brief essays upon various aspects of the art of music , both theo - retical and practical .

		These articles are reprinted from the periodicals to which Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	has been a contributor of late years largely , in fact , from the excellent monthly magazine '' Music '' of which he is the editor and are now published by Mr.
Theodore Presser	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	is one of the few American writers about music who really have something substantial to say .

		Over - much journalism has set its mark upon his style , and his manner of writing often degenerates into a slapdash utterance that is anything but commend - able ; yet there is always a serious reflective basis for what he says , and he not infrequently has at his command the felicitous phrase and the symmetri - cally crystallized expression of his thought .

		Few writers with whom we are acquainted have come as near as Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	comes , when in his best and most serious moods , to finding adequate words for the expression of what is essential about musical art in general , or about some form or illustration of that art in particular .

		He never gets far away from the fundamental thought that music provides men with one of the deepest forms of culture , and that all questions of technique and pedagogical method should be held strictly subordinate to that idea .

		The root of the matter is in such a passage as the fol - lowing : '' For by just so much as music says some - thing to those who give themselves up to it , by just so much it becomes a force with influence upon their lives , and upon their doing and being .

		And so we 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, may look for a time when this force will be under - stood and intelligently employed in education , as it sometimes begins to be now ; but upon wider and higher scale , until many things which have not yielded to the pulpit nor yet to the press , will soften themselves to music .

		Who knows ?

		The
Pytha	PERSON	- gorean tuning of mind by means of tones will be - come a reality ; and it will sometime be found that the intellect is sharpened and the imagination kindled by tonal fantasy , not merely for itself , but for great and noble deeds . ''

		We may fairly call this the language of prophecy , for few even among professional musicians have yet conceived of their art in this significant sense , the sense in which it offers not merely entertainment or beguilement , but rather education in the truest and best meaning of the term .

		We do not always agree with Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	in his special dicta .

		Sometimes we disagree with him so vehemently that words could hardly express our feeling .

		How can a man say that '' there is not an element of the ideal '' in '' Tristan und Isolde '' ?

		But we are in the deepest accord with a writer who can speak words like these : `` With steady step music has progressed towards the art of saying something to human souls .

		Out of the vast inner world of the Unseen , the
Blest	LOCATION	, and the Eternal , the prophetic seer brings in tones his living and moving message .

		We do not need a story ; we do not need an expla - nation .

		Simply to hear and hear again , and to be silent and hear again this is the road and the only road .

		These great works are written like the messages of inspiration ' for those who have ears to hear . '

		The inner message of music , like the inner tone of the creation , is for him who listens within . '' ''

		Durch alle Tone tonet , Im bunten Lebenstraum , Ein leiser Ton gezogen Fiir den , der beimlich lauschet . ''

		These words , which
Schumann	PERSON	took as a text for his wonderful '' Fantaisie , Op. 17 , '' belong , in a wider sense , to all great music , and this is the truth that Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	embodies in many a chapter of his stimulating book .

		We believe that the nature of a man 's mind gives the form to his style .

		We even believe that , given the technical characteristics of any piece of writing , one should be able to infer the character of the author 's mode of thought .

		It must be allowed that literary criti - cism is not quite as far advanced on this line as might be desired .

		Still , we feel quite sure that there are a number of our readers who can gauge pretty exactly the mental calibre of a man who writes sentences which are , on the average , from eleven to fourteen words long , whose work has a distinctly staccato movement due to the constant unconnected and direct statements , and who con - veys his doctrine one half in epigrammatic generali - zations and the other half in metaphors .

		Such is the way Mr.
W. A. Quayle	PERSON	expresses his ideas in `` The Poet 's Poet and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Curts & Jennings	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is also , we believe , a matter of ex - Essays in English .

		pression rather than of idea that he should regard the '' New Arabian Nights '' as '' a piece of enchant - ing verbiage '' ; that he should hint that
George Eliot	PERSON	entertained '' nugatory theories of Hebrew history '' ; that he should assert that a particular line of '' In Memoriam '' '' keys the music of this elegy '' ; that he should note the place where Haw - thorne and Poe '' quit company , '' or that he should hold that
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' treatment of a theme is essentially spirituelle . ''

		These are technical points of style , and yet we feel sure that they are the ex - pression of a particular mode of thought , if we may so call it .

		It is to be remarked , however , that Mr.
Quayle	PERSON	nowhere makes any claim to the power of criticism .

		He says distinctly that he has loved literature , and therefore has written , more doubtless with a view '' to stimulate affection for the men and works he loves '' than with any idea of pronouncing sound critical judgments .

		And that is no mean desire .

		We can not but think well of the man who entertains it , or of the city which seeks these essays more eagerly than the latest works of
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	or
James Lane Allen	PERSON	.

		Still , we can not quite agree with Mr.
Quayle	PERSON	's publishers that '' seldom have such personalities as
Browning	PERSON	... or such epochal characters as Cromwell ... been more vividly reproduced by human pen . ''

		We are inclined to think that what Mr.
Quayle	PERSON	has vividly reproduced is the current of his own ideas .

		This is not an especially easy thing to do , but we think that in this book it is very effectively done .

		A compact Readers of the '' Century Magazine '' popular life of need not be reminded of the graphic
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	.

		q ua ii ty an d choice pictorial attrac - tions of Miss
Anna L. Bicknell	PERSON	's '' Story of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	. ''

		The work recently formed a leading feature of successive numbers of that periodical , and it now appears in book form -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and a very worthy and attractive volume it makes .

		Miss
Bicknell	PERSON	has given us the best popularly written life of the ill-starred Queen at least we can point to none better .

		She is a good narrator , and wastes no time in pointing a moral or adorning a tale that assuredly needs neither pointing nor adornment .

		She shows sensibility , without drenching her recital with tears like the lachrymose M. de la Rochterie , for ex - ample , in whose watery elegiacs over his '' mar - tyred queen '' now over a century dead there is just a touch of '' Sergeant Buzfuz . ''

		One is reminded of
Mark Twain	PERSON	at the tomb of
Adam	PERSON	.

		Miss
Bicknell	PERSON	is accurate as to facts , and her judgments are tem - perate .

		She adheres mostly to the generally accepted versions of leading incidents .

		She respects the statement that
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	, in ascending the scaffold , struck the executioner 's foot , and apolo - gized quickly , with a polite '' Pardon ,
Monsieur	PERSON	.

		1 '' The story seems improbable enough , and it has lately been again denied , on the authority of a credi - ble eye-witness of the queen 's execution .

		A lady -LRB- the grandmother of M. de
Rochefort	PERSON	-RRB- who was seated on a cart near the scaffold , testified that '' the
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 queen , frightfully overcome , looked as if she was bent double .

		She was almost lifted onto the plank , where she fell without a movement ... This -LSB- the story in question -RSB- is pure fable ...
Marie Antoi	PERSON	- nette broke down in the arms of the executioner 's assistants ; she was laid beneath the knife completely inert ; no kick was given ; no dialogue passed be - tween her and the executioner ; and if her foot did touch his , she was not in a state to perceive it . ''

		This account of the queen 's condition tallies well with that terrible sketch of her , as she sat in the tumbril , made by
David	PERSON	, who saw the cortege pass his window .

		Miss
Bicknell	PERSON	's book is exceedingly readable the best compact popular Life of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	obtainable .

		It is beautifully illustrated , mainly with portraits of the queen and her circle , after Mme.
Lebrun	PERSON	.

		Peter the Great appears in ordinary histories and brief biographies as a personage of extraordinary vitality and originality , and the exponent of modern prog - ress in the civilization of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Whether it is a desirable revelation to force upon the general public that he was an unspeakably vulgar , unspeakably cruel , unspeakably licentious monster , is a question which , at any rate , does not seem to have given pause to the Russian author of the latest life of
Peter	PERSON	, translated by Lady
Loyd	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author justifies the lurid lights which he throws upon his hero and his people on the ground that '' courage to acknowledge what one is , and even what one has been , is a very necessary quality . ''

		But it is hard to believe that he is a genuine admirer of
Peter	PERSON	, however much he professes to be such .

		Supported as are the revolting allega - tions regarding
Peter	PERSON	's beastly life by references to contemporary accounts , it seems impossible to deny their truthfulness .

		But what is the use of the author 's declaring '' I can discover nothing in
Peter	PERSON	's case which would point to the authentic mark of the real wild beast the greedy delight in inflicting suffer - ing , the downright taste for blood , '' on the same page -LRB- 125 -RRB- with the admission that he '' pursued the men he had doomed to death with reproaches and invectives jeered at them even in their death agony '' ?

		The author also declares at the close , `` He thirsted for blood '' -LRB- page 533 -RRB- .

		All of the real achievements of
Peter	PERSON	's reign that are rehearsed in this volume are familiar to the world .

		The principal result of publishing the atrocities which hitherto have been hidden in rarer volumes and in foreign languages must be to make it impossible to hear again the name of
Peter	PERSON	the Great without disgust and loathing .

		Myttifying the mysterious in theology .

		A little volume of 120 pages , by Mr.
Charles H. Mann	PERSON	, entitled '' The Christ of God '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is a mod - ern deliverance on the interpretation of the mean - ing of the Christ .

		It requires the patience of a pa - triarch and the perseverance of a saint to wade A mpernal Biblt .

		through it .

		And what then ?

		One has the recollec - tion of a man who has tramped through a stretch of miry road , rather disagreeable and unsatisfactory .

		The author 's elaborations are too verbose , his sen - tences too long , to conduce to clearness .

		His theory is that the Christ must be interpreted parabolically . ''

		Jesus Christ is the very image of God begotten in the life of the human race during its spiritual his - tory '' -LRB- page 36 -RRB- .

		In the unfolding of this thought he soars to the regions of the mystical , and fails to carry his reader with him .

		Repeated readings fail to make him clear .

		In handling the so-called vicari - ous theory of the atonement as held by some scholars , and as contained in the fifty-third chapter of
Isaiah	LOCATION	, the author simply explains those verses -LRB- 4 and 5 -RRB- of least difficulty , and lets the reader struggle away with the giant difficulties , which he never so much as touches .

		He is apparently not out of the woods himself .

		If he is , let him condense and clarify .

		Of making many Bibles there is no end .

		But of making the ideal Bible there is just now a beginning .

		After decades of experience and of experiments , the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	has achieved a real success in manu - facturing Bibles .

		Their latest product is '' The Ox - ford Self-Pronouncing Teacher 's Bible '' of
King James	LOCATION	's version .

		It is a marvellous piece of book - making .

		It is octavo in form , printed in bourgeois type , and occupies the same space as that heretofore taken by minion type , two sizes smaller .

		Every proper name is separated into syllables , wherein the quality of each is marked and the accented syllable noted .

		This work is done on strictly scientific prin - ciples , and is authoritative .

		Added to the whole
Bible	ORGANIZATION	is a series of 124 full-page plates illustrating manuscripts , versions , and antiquities .

		To this is appended '' Helps for the Study of the Bible . ''

		And last , but no less than the climax in Bible-making , is the fact that the entire
1624	DATE	pages , printed on
India	LOCATION	paper , is just one inch in thickness , or , with strong lids of flexible leather , less than one and one-eighth inches .

		In the charm of its typography , in its self - pronouncing character , and in its small , convenient compass , it is the peer of any Teacher 's Bible now on the market .

		Continuing his series of the '' Foot - P rint8 of the Patriots '' -LRB- Lee & Shep - ard -RRB- , Mr.
Abram English Brown	PERSON	leads us '' Beside Old Hearthstones '' in northern
Middlesex County	LOCATION	, in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Searching out the homes of the minute-men who answered
Paul Revere	PERSON	's alarm '' thro ' every Middlesex village and farm '' on
April 19 , 1775	DATE	, the author tells us those little incidents of their daily lives that make clear to us their personality and environment .

		Among these men were many whose names are memorable for some great work or deed ; and these visits to their old homesteads , the talks with their descendants , the glancing into old diaries yellow with age , and the inspection of curious relics of those troubled times , have afforded material for an interesting and profit - 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, able volume .

		It is illustrated with pictures of many notable homesteads , relics , documents , quaint tomb - stones , and portraits of the patriots and their de - scendants .

		An interesting account is given of the first blood shed at Bunker Hill , when
Asa Pollard	PERSON	's head was taken off by a ball from one of the British ships , as the minute-men rested at their noonday meal .

		Another version of the story of '' Old Put '' and the wolf is given from the lips of his great-granddaughter on her eighty-ninth birthday .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Dr.
George McLean Harper	PERSON	has edited for
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a selection from Sainte-Beuve 's '' Causeries du Lundi , '' seven in number , including '' Qu'est - ce qu'un Classique ? '' ''

		Grande Epoque de la Prose , '' and the studies of
Pascal	LOCATION	,
La Fontaine	LOCATION	, Saint -
Simon	PERSON	,
Madame de Maintenon	ORGANIZATION	, and
La Duchesse de Bourgoyne	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is well done , and the author is one of the most important to be taken up in advanced courses .

		What gives the book its special distinction , however , is the elaborate prefatory essay on
Sainte	ORGANIZATION	-
Beuve	LOCATION	, which reminds us to say that much of the best critical writing of the present day in this country is to be found in just such school-books as this , a fact quite as important for the general reader to know as for the person of strictly pedagogic intent .

		Such books as this belong quite as much in the private libraries of culti - vated persons as in the class-rooms of the colleges .

		It is with much satisfaction that we commend the enterprise of
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a new firm of
Boston	LOCATION	publishers , in producing for the first time a tasteful and adequate edition of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's poems .

		We have been compelled hitherto to put up with editions as far removed from the traditions of ar - tistic publishing as the '' Leaves of Grass '' themselves are removed from the traditions of the poetic art .

		The handsome volume now before us remedies all this , and gives us , within a single set of covers , the complete poet - ical works of Whitman , including '' Sands at Seventy , '' '' Good-bye , My Fancy , '' and '' Old Age Echoes , '' besides the prose '' Backward Glance o'er Travel 'd Roads . ''

		Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	is the latest American writer to receive the somewhat premature honors of a uniform subscription edition of his works .

		It is styled the '' Homestead '' edition , and Messrs.
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons are the publishers .

		There are to be ten vol - umes in all , similar in get-up to the editions of
Stevenson	PERSON	, Field , and Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	already published by this enterprising firm .

		`` Neighborly Poems and Dialect Sketches '' is the title of the first volume , now before us . ''

		Nineteenth Century Questions '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the title of a volume of essays prepared for publication by the late
James Freeman Clarke	PERSON	shortly before his death , and now placed before the public .

		The questions dis - cussed fall .

		into three groups '' Literary Studies , '' '' Religious and Philosophical , '' and '' Historical and Biographical . ''

		They include , among others , '' Did Shakespeare write
Bacon	PERSON	's Works ? '' ''

		Have Animals Souls ? ''

		`` Affinities of Buddhism and Christianity , '' '' Buckle and His Theory of Averages , '' and '' The Rise and Fall of Slave Power in
America	LOCATION	'' nineteenth century questions indeed , yet having a strangely old - fashioned ring in these closing years of the century .

R. H. Stoddard	PERSON	in the editing of one of our best anthologies of English poetry .

		Litera - ture claims him also in an indirect way as the husband of Mrs.

Mazzini	PERSON	,

		His emigra - tion to this country in

		EVOLUTIONAL ETHICS AND ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY .

		By
E. P.EVANS	PERSON	, author of '' Animal Symbolism in Ecclesias - tical Architecture , '' etc. 12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		This book describes the evolution of ethics , or the growth of rules of conduct in primitive human societies , particularly with reference to man 's ideas regarding the lower animals and his treatment of them .

		The first part , on Evolutional Ethics , discusses that conduct of tribal society , the influence of religious belief on it in the course of evolution , and man 's ethical relations to the animals , closing with a chapter on the doctrine of metempsychosis .

		The second part , on Animal Psychology , treats of manifestations of mind in the brute as compared with those in man , the possibility of progress in the lower animals , their powers of ideation , and speech as a barrier between man and beast .

		On the scientific foundation which he thus aims to construct the author bases a claim for the recognition of the rights of animals , which he regards as subordinate only to the rights of our fellow-men .

		The book is spiced with interesting anecdote , and is exceedingly readable .

		Memory is the most important function of the brain ; without it life would be a blank .

		Our knowledge is all based on memory .

		Every thought , every action , our very conception of personal identity , is based on memory .

		Without memory , all experience would be useless ; reason - ing would be based on insufficient data , and would be , therefore , falla - cious .

		In this volume the author demonstrates that memory is a definite faculty , and has its seat in the basal ganglia of the brain , separate from but associated with all the other faculties of the brain .

		88 LE WIS CARROLL . '' ''

		There is such a thing as nonsense , '' says
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	in one of his essays , '' and when a man has once attained to that deep con - ception , you may be sure of him ever after . ''

		This is no doubt a true saying , but it needs to be supplemented .

		To attain to the conception in question is only the beginning of wisdom , for there should go with the realization that non - sense exists a healthy instinct for its enjoyment when it is of the innocuous sort , and for its vigorous repudiation when it assumes a perni - cious form .

		There is hi most human nature a streak of irrationality which makes people an easy mark for certain forms of very dangerous nonsense for the pseudo-scientific jargon of palmistry or theosophy , let us say and hope - less indeed is his case who becomes entrapped by these pitfalls .

		Yet the irrational instincts that find such vent belong to the normal psy - chological make-up of mankind ; they are sur - vivals , probably , although a neo-Schopenhauer - ianism might claim for them a deeper cause than that , but in any case they have to be reck - oned with .

		Most people chafe , consciously or unconsciously , under the limitations of a world rigidly subjected to the principle of casuality , and seek at times to escape into some world in which fancy may rove untrammeled , in which life may seem less strenuous than science makes it out to be .

		This is a somewhat ponderous exordium for a few observations about the work of that gentle '' maker '' of nonsense whose recent death has made childhood of all ages the poorer wherever the English language is spoken , but it was peculiarly the gift of ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' to open our eyes to just such a '' land of wonder - wander '' as we all need to see at times , and need all the more in proportion as our habitual outlook is uncompromisingly logical and matter - of-fact .

		If we can not take refuge in some such world of transparent impossibilities we are in danger of gratifying our deep-seated irrational instincts by straying off into delusions of the sort that paralyze the powers of thought , of confusing vagaries with realities , and of dissi - pating our intellectual substance in specula - tions that can not possibly lead to anything ; whereas we may give ourselves up to the charm 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, of
Alice	PERSON	and her Wonderland without the least compunction , and do not run the slightest dan - ger of taking too seriously the doings of the Mad Hatter , the
March Hare	DATE	, or the
Queen of Hearts	ORGANIZATION	.

		If these things are '' to the Greeks , foolishness , '' we are sorry for the Greeks , and remain unshaken in our loyalty to the imagin - ings of the chronicler of
Alice	PERSON	, the poet of the Boojum and the Jabberwock . ''

		A little nonsense now and then Is relished by the wisest men , '' so runs the old saw , and to ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	, '' purveyor of the most delightful nonsense in our language , a debt of the deepest gratitude is due .

		Of that eminent clergyman and distinguished mathematician , the Kev .


Charles Lutwidge Dodgson	PERSON	, the public knows little beyond an occasional amusing anecdote , like that which relates how the Queen , charmed with the story of
Alice	PERSON	, requested the author to send her his other works , and was not a little surprised when she received a collection of mathematical treat - He was born about sixty-five years ago , ises .

		took his degree at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, and remained a college don for the greater part of his life . ''

		Alice 's Adventures in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' was published in
1865	DATE	, '' Through the Looking - Glass '' in
1872	DATE	, and `` The Hunting of the Snark '' in
1876	DATE	.

		Among his other books that belong to literature , we may mention '' Phan - tasmagoria , '' '' Doublets , '' '' Rhyme ?

		and
Rea	PERSON	- son ? '' ''

		Euclid and His Modern Rivals , '' '' A Tangled Tale , '' and ''
Sylvie	PERSON	and
Bruno	PERSON	. ''

		The three books first mentioned have not only be - come classics of the nursery , but have also won a place among the books with which every cul - tivated reader is expected to have some ac - quaintance .

		Their characters and incidents are quoted '' to point a moral and adorn a tale '' almost as frequently as the characters and inci - dents that appear in the novels of
Dickens	PERSON	or the poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		They have added new words to the common English vocabulary , and people make use of '' beamish , '' and '' galumph - ing '' and '' chortling '' as of familiar concepts .

		Such verses as '' The Walrus and the Carpen - ter '' and '' How doth the little crocodile '' are as well known as the best lyrics of the more serious poets ; while the story of the slaying of the Jabberwock rivals in its haunting mystery the story of
Childe Roland	PERSON	and the Dark Tower , besides being rather more intelligible .

		It is no ordinary triumph to have thus imposed a new literary genre upon the consciousness of the reading public , and the extent of the achieve - ment is best realized when we compare the suc - cess of ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' with the comparative failure of even the best of his many imitators .

		The books that are concerned with childhood may be divided into three classes .

		The first and largest of these classes includes the books that are written for children alone , that have no message at all for the adult reader .

		The second class includes those few books that state things from the childish point of view , but are really intended for the delight of children of a larger growth .

		`` A Child 's Garden of Verses '' and '' The Golden Age '' are the two matchless examples of this kind of literature .

		Here we have the freshness of feeling that remembers what being a child was like , conjoined with an exquisite literary art which revives that feeling in the grown-up reader , who could not possibly summon it back into consciousness unless thus aided .

		But the child , although he may take some interest in these books , can not possibly enjoy them as the '' Olympians '' do .

		The books of the third class , to which belong those which we owe to the creator of ''
Alice	PERSON	, '' are equally appreciated by young and old -LRB- although of course in different ways -RRB- , and make for a better understanding between the ages , because they create a new bond of sympathy , setting the child and the man for the time being upon a common ground of interest .

		SOME IDEAS ON CRITICISM .

		There is a story of a young lady seated beside
Tennyson	LOCATION	at dinner , and all intent for oracles , who was rewarded at last by having the poet remark to her , '' I like my mutton in hunks . ''

		The story is not Apropos , but the phrase is apt for my purpose .

		The most of us like our criticism in hunks .

		Funda - mental distinctions , fine discriminations , exquisite tests for purity or alloy , these are not for us .

		Rather we like the one-sided , the lop-sided , and the factional .

		We like to have one critic tell us that all good literature springs from contemporary life ; and another , that character is best studied from the outside ; and yet another , that it is useless to kick against the pricks of the sordid and vulgar , and that majorities count in literature as in elections .

		Even among our brothers across the sea , criticism in hunks prevails .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	, the subtle and elaborate , had eyes only for style .

		He conceived literature to con - sist mainly of phrases .

		Swathed in his rhetoric , his Greek and Italian idols are as indistinguishable as the mummies of Egyptian kings .

		Mr.
Buskin	PERSON	has been a great maker of critical hunks , and although those of his right hand differ from those of his left , this does not prove his comprehensiveness .

		The
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 total of free , disinterested , comprehensive criticism has been , at all times , small .

		Critical opinion has always been in great measure the expression of personal feeling , the propaganda of a party , or the polemic of a fad .

		Literature itself is a conflict of ideas ; bat the judgment of it ought to have more unity than a Donnybrook Fair .

		The born reader , the man who lives in the serene air of good literature , rarely , perhaps , writes criti - cism .

		He is like a dog who has found a bone , and proceeds to dig a hole and bury it .

		and then comes and looks in your face and wags his tail as though to say , '' I know where there is a most excellent bone , but I am not going to let on . ''

		Some of the best criticism we have is in the letters of men of genius , like Gray and
Keats	PERSON	and
Fitzgerald	PERSON	and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		In their correspondence the minds of these men are in undress ease , and judgments that are the essence of good taste and good sense come from them as naturally as gum oozes from a tree .

		But formal criticism is a necessary thing .

		If people read , they must have opinions , and opinion expressed is criticism , and the best informed opinion is good criticism .

		The things that are abiding underlie all litera - tures ; but the fashions in thought and expression change as do the fashions in clothes .

		The eigh - teenth century conceived poetry to be a kind of transported prose prose with a ball and chain about its ankles ; and it called all its writers , indif - ferently , wits .

		The nineteenth century has tried to bring prose and poetry together , by a species of ar - terial transfusion , and , in
France	LOCATION	at least , all imag - inative writers are allowed to be poets .

		Again , the first great literary critic ,
Aristotle	LOCATION	, defined poetry to be a '' making , '' and in his '' Poetics '' he ignores lyric , satiric , and philosophical poetry .

		The pen - dulum has swung to the other extreme to-day , and the lyric is the overwhelmingly dominate form of verse .

		Not only the tendencies of that entity we call an age , but national peculiarities and prejudices , pre - vent a steady assessment of literature .

		Shakespeare , who sank into the German mind like rain on a mel - low soil , has always run off from the hard-surfaced glittering French intellect .

		The attitude of
England	LOCATION	to American literature is a case in point .

		The cul - tivated Englishman is an unassuming enough per - son within his own gates , but when he goes abroad he seems to be possessed with the idea that he wrote the plays of Shakespeare with his own hand , and paid for building the cathedrals out of his own pocket .

		He comes to or looks at this country , and he sees nothing as good as Shakespeare or the cathedrals , and he condemns our art in mass .

		He forgets that modern
England	LOCATION	has nothing so good as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	or the cathedrals either .

		A main cause of critical confusion is our inability to get the forms and qualities of literature ranked in the order of their importance .

		Nearly every critic has a prepossession for some one quality or some one kind of manifestation of genius .


Victor Hugo	PERSON	, in his great essay on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, asserts that all masterpieces are equal .

		The saying is a fine one , but must be taken with limitations .

		When
Dante	PERSON	begins the ascent of heaven , he is surprised to find sphere rising above sphere and order upon order of superhuman beings superimposed .

		He in - quires whether there is not , then , equality in heaven , and is told , No ; those nearest God absorb most of His light , which in turn they emit to those farther off .

		But this , he is assured , does not trouble any - one , for '' in His will is our peace . ''

		Something like this may be said of human genius . ''

		Shine , poet , in your place , and be content , '' is Words - worth 's version of the idea .

		The great writers are modest among their peers .

		Dante took the sixth place in the company of poets ; and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, speak - ing of Moliere , said , '' It is good for us little men to return often to the masters . ''

		But readers and critics , captivated by some gift that appeals to them personally , are always for oversetting the hierarchy of genius .

		We have all our idols of illusion .

		For myself I have such an admiration for the '' Hype - rion '' of Keats that I have to put force on myself to keep from calling it the finest piece of verse in existence .

		It is the supreme of outward poetry the poetry of form and color and sound .

		There is enough emotion in it to flush its statues with life , enough intellect to make them lift their lofty heads and utter elemental things .

		But I know that , com - pared with the great world-poems which furnish ideals for action and materials for meditation , it is an empty thing .

		Keats never gave better proof of his keen critical instinct than in the revised version , which , done as it is with an almost utter failure of verbal charm , shows an attempt to get humanity into the poem .

		If the personality of a critic is a translucent or opaque medium for genius to shine through , the personality of an author may dim or heighten the light he emits .

		Byron rebels , and draws after him the third part of our human hosts ; and admiration of his audacity and energy blinds us to his flaws of I art .

		Dante and
Milton	PERSON	stand in mighty isolation , attractive to us as the magnetic mountain was to
Sinbad	LOCATION	's ship .

		When we study them we feel that to walk erect it is necessary to walk aloof .

		Their characters intensify their poetry as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's do not .

		Perhaps
Lessing	PERSON	comes nearest to the ideal critic of all who have ever officiated Minos-wise .

		Yet even he coils his tail around him nine times , and
Racine	LOCATION	and
Boileau	PERSON	are consigned to the lowest pit .

		Aristotle , as I have said , seems to have been indif - ferent to the individual element in genius .

		Coming down to modern times , Sainte-Beuve was so much interested in the characters of his authors that he forgot to assess their talents .

		Every French soldier may carry a marshal 's baton in his knapsack , but surely every French author has not immortality hidden in his baggage .

		When Nature or Fate for - got this present , Sainte-Beuve often slipped it in , as
Joseph	PERSON	did the silver cup into
Benjamin	PERSON	's sack .

		68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, Besides , the French delight in lucidity and elegance is too strong in him .

		He can appreciate grace , but is half afraid of greatness .

		When he describes the Greek and Latin and French authors assembled in the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	of Fame , he merely adds , ''
Shakes	PERSON	- peare is there . ''

		The great creative outburst in En - gland at the beginning of this century was paralleled by an equal critical activity .

		Whether the last had anything to do with producing the first , or whether , '' as a gate of bronze , fronting the sun , receives and renders back its figure and its heat , '' it was merely secondary , it certainly betrays the same tendencies .

		The canons of an earlier age were torn to shreds , and imagination warred against common sense .

		As the earth revolves about its axis in one direc - tion , and moves around the sun in a second , and is carried with the solar system in a third , and has perhaps a multiplication of other movements , until the mind is appalled and wonders if there be direc - tion or motion at all , so literature has its cross and contradictory revolutions and processions , and criticism is caught with them , like flotsam on cur - rent and eddy , and can not stand aside on some serene spot of contemplation and comprehend the whole .

		Popular American criticism has always demanded two things : That our authors should paint from life , and that they should deal with American sub - jects .

		If , instead of the first requirement , an author should be made to write about what he knows best , there might be something to say for it .

		A poet may very easily be more familiar with fairies and god - desses than with people of flesh and blood , and he had best stick to his acquaintance .

		Or , a scholar may be so saturated with the past as to be unable to see the present .

		It is remarkable that every great period of English literature has been fecundated , as it were , by pollen blown from some remote time or removed place .

		In the Elizabethan epoch , it was the Italian influence which enriched and impregnated the native stock .

		In
Dryden	PERSON	's time , the literature of
France	LOCATION	did the same work ; and the Georgian bloom and fruitage was largely caused by ideas brought from
Germany	LOCATION	and forms revived from
Greece	LOCATION	.

		As to the supposed necessity for American writers to deal with American subjects , it may be remarked that the authors of no other countries have been so restricted .

		None of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's themes are contemporary , and few are English .

		Milton is antique or antediluvian .

		In this respect a distinction must be made between the different forms of literature .

		The lyric is purely personal , and hardly needs location .

		Satire must be contem - porary and local , or it does not exist .

		There is no use in our satirizing Nero or the Emperor of
China	LOCATION	.

		Comedy , too , is mainly an affair of locality ; though
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's imaginative comedy the enchanted playground of the world is bound by no real limits of time or space .

		Ideal poetry in its greatest efforts of tragedy or epic instinctively seeks remote - ness .

		Mountains can only be seen at a distance , and though genius can do much , even genius must find it hard to draw from the near and common faces and forms about it the lineaments and limbs of those tragic personages who resume into them - selves an epoch or embody universal humanity .

		Dante , indeed , took the names and suggestions of his own time and country , and turned them to great account ; but he first dipped them in Styx and sur - rounded them with the scenery and machinery of the other world .

		A man of genius is like a tree which must be rooted in the ground , but draws the greater part of its subsistence from the air which is world - wide and the sun which is universal .

		Changes of taste , vicissitudes of opinion , oblivions and revivals , these , every work of art must endure .

		Time is the true judge ; and in the nature of things
Time	ORGANIZATION	is never final .

		On the walls of
Karnak	LOCATION	there is sculptured a long procession of forms the Egyp - tian judgment-givers , the Forty-two Assessors of the Dead .

		This cold scrutinizing line is no bad emblem of what awaits those who aspire to be among the Princes of Posterity .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		SOME OF ARNOLD 'S QUALITIES AS A CRITIC .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The opening article of your journal for
January 16	DATE	characterizes
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as '' on the whole the truest and finest English critic of our generation . ''

		I am inclined to agree with this estimate , and would like to add a suggestion or two as to the qualities on which such a claim should rest .

		The style of
Arnold	LOCATION	has frequently been called high - bred .

		This means , first of all , that he is perfectly simple and sincere ; secondly , it means that he endeavors never to intrude himself upon his subject ; and thirdly , that he instinctively seeks whatever is excellent and true in the person with whom he is dealing .

		Exceptions to these statements there undoubtedly are , yet I believe they will prove the rule .

		When we turn , however , from style to matter , we find a good deal to object to .

		Even the excellent essay on
Keats	PERSON	is now a trifle obsolete because the thesis of that essay has been set forth in a more scholarly way by Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	; and the charming essay on Gray is almost valueless because of the author 's inadequate knowledge of Gray 's character .

		The truth is that
Arnold	PERSON	was too hard-worked , as an inspector of schools , to allow one of his mental breadth to perfect himself in the many subjects in which he could not but interest himself .

		He was , too , as much an observer of men and manners as of books ; and in dealing with books he is almost the supreme critic of literary manner .

		I believe that
Arnold	PERSON	is found at his best in subjects requiring little or no scholarship , in subjects where the high breeding of his style is all-sufficient .

		An example is found in his felicitous manner of introducing to the public authors whose literary work is small in volume and little known .

		Joubert ,
Maurice de Gudrin	PERSON	, and
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	will , let us hope , never be dragged into the scuffling-ground of literary scholars .

		They did not in their writings make a bid for fame , and we like
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 to treat them as gentlemen .

		To hare known them is of inestimable value ; yet Gue ` rin , at least , would be almost unknown to English readers but for the excellent essay of Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	.

		The Journal Intime contains pas - sages of unsurpassed poetic prose ; and it is thanks to
Arnold	LOCATION	's essay that they will find fit audience among the Anglo-Saxon race .

		Even those who content them - selves with the essay itself will derive exquisite pleasure from the charming translations it embodies .

		An En - glish translation of the whole Journal exists , but I have not seen it , and am unable to speak of its claims on the attention of English readers .

		SHAKESPEARIAN PLAYS ACTED BY COLLEGE MEN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		It is , of course , only a coincidence that about the time when Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	as reported in the last issue of THE DIAL was urging upon teachers of literature the importance of observing , in the criticism of dramatic writing , the stage conditions under which alone the real drama can be successful , the students of a Western college were putting on the boards , under the direction of the Pro- fessor of English , a Shakespearian comedy .

		And yet it is a coincidence rich in suggestion .

		Perhaps we have in the recent performance of '' Much Ado About
Noth	PERSON	- ing '' by the students of
Indiana University	ORGANIZATION	a hint of one of the methods by which the contention of Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	may be applied in a practical way to college classes , and our academic study of the drama thereby rendered more exact and complete .

		The accurate re - production of a Shakespearian play , for instance , on the historical Shakespearian stage , will go far toward giving a college audience a definite understanding of the play itself , as well as contributing to their appreciation of its purely dramatic qualities .

		At any rate , the benefits to be derived by the student who takes part in such a per - formance are evident to the most casual observer ; be - sides learning directly and by experience something of the conditions which satisfy the demands of the stage , he is saved from the mistake of regarding the drama as only a phase of literature .

		The value of such revivals by college people , in cul - tivating among them , better than the formal routine of the class-room can do , a taste for the best plays and a demand for good acting , is surely not insignificant ; par - ticularly when one takes into consideration the fact that under present conditions most college communities are deprived of all opportunity to see good plays well acted .

		The more hopeful of us may even imagine that we have here at baud a potent means for bringing about the long - desired '' elevation of the stage '' and the consequent removal of the lingering prejudice against the theatre among many good people .

		The student of English literary history is reminded of the sturdy impulse given to the drama in the early days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	through the frequent presentation of plays by
the Universities	ORGANIZATION	and Inns of Court : is he likely to be counted too enthusiastic if he venture fondly to hope that through such academic performances in our own day , once they become general , there may be stimulated a revival of dramatic literature of serious proportions and artistic completeness ?

		AN INTERESTING AND IMPUDENT BIT OF PLAGIARISM .

		The publication of the second volume of '' The French Revolution , '' by Mr.
Justin H. McCarthy	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	-LRB- son of the leader of the Irish party in
Parliament	LOCATION	and the author of '' A History of our Own Times '' -RRB- , recalls an interest - ing plagiarism in his first volume .

		In treating the im - portant subject , '' Taxation , '' he takes bodily from Mrs.
Gardiner	PERSON	's excellent little work , '' The French Revolu - tion , '' one of the '' Epochs of Modern History '' series , and gives no credit therefor .

		I subjoin the passages referred to .

		GAKDUJKE , PP. 9-10 .

		`` Some provinces and towns were privileged in relation to cer - tain taxes , and as a rule it was the poorest provinces on which the heaviest burdens lay .

		One of the most iniquitous of the taxes was the gabelle , or tax on salt .

		Of this tax , which was farmed , two-thirds of the whole were levied on a third of the kingdom .

		The price varied so much that the same measure which cost a few shillings in one province cost two or three pounds in another .

		The farmers of the tax had behind them a small army of officials for the suppression of smuggling , as well as special courts for the punishment of those who disobeyed fiscal regulations .

		These regulations were minute and vexatious in the extreme .

		Throughout the north and centre of
France	LOCATION	, the gabelle was in real - ity a poll tax ; the sale of salt was a monopoly in the hands of the farmers ; no one might use other salt than that sold by them , and it was obligatory on every person aged above seven years to pur - chase seven pounds yearly .

		This salt , however , of which the pur - chase was obligatory might only be used for purely cooking purposes .

		If the farmer wished to salt his pig , or the fisherman his fish , they must buy additional salt and ob - tain a certificate that such pur - chase had been made .

		Thousands of persons , either for inability to pay the tax or for attempting to evade the laws of the farm , were yearly fined , imprisoned , sent to the galleys , or hanged .

		The chief of the property taxes , the faille , inflicted as much suffering as the gabelle , and was also ruinous to agriculture .

		Over two-thirds of
France	LOCATION	the faille was a tax on lands , houses , and industry reas - sessed every year , not according to any fixed rate , but according to the presumed capacity of the prov - ince , the parish and the individual taxpayers .

		The consequence was that , on the smallest indication of prosperity , the amount of the tax was raised , and thus parish after parish and farmer after farmer were reduced to the same dead level of indigence . ''

		`` Some provinces and towns were privileged in relation to cer - tain taxes , and as a rule it was the poorest provinces on which the heaviest burdens lay .

		One of the most evil of the taxes was the gabelle , or tax on salt , which , as we shall see , aroused the indigna - tion of
Arthur Young	PERSON	.

		Of this tax , which was farmed , two-thirds of the whole were levied on a third of the kingdom .

		There were special courts for the punishment of those who disobeyed fiscal regulations of the most minute and grotesque kind .

		Throughout the north and centre of
France	LOCATION	the gabelle was in reality a poll tax .

		The sale of salt was a monopoly in the hands of the farmers , who had behind them a small army of officials for the suppression of smuggling , or using other salt than that sold by them .

		Every person aged above seven years was forced to purchase seven pounds yearly , though the price varied so much that the same measure which cost a few shillings in one province cost two or three pounds in another .

		Yet this salt might be used for cooking pur - poses , and cooking purposes alone .

		The fisherman who wished to salt his catch , the farmer who wished to salt his pork , must buy more salt and obtain a certificate that they had bought more salt .

		The ex - chequers were swollen , the galleys were manned , the gallows were weighted yearly with the fines of purse or of person paid by the vic - tims of this odious tax .

		But the gabelle was not the only infliction .

		There was the faille , the first of the property taxes , the faille that was as cruel as the gabelle , and as fatal to agriculture .

		It was fan - tastically reassessed every year , not according to any regular eco - nomic rule , but according to that more Oriental plan which varies its taxation with the varying for - tunes of the place or person taxed .

		The over-taxed victims soon dis - covered that the smallest indica - tion of prosperity meant an in - crease in the amount of the tax .

		Under its blight farmer after farmer and parish after parish were degraded to a common ruin and a common despair . ''

		Considering the large celebrity of the name of

Feb. 1	DATE	, AUDUBON 'S STORY HE-TOLD .

		* It is nearly fifty years since
John James Audubon	PERSON	passed from the sight of men , yet his name is fresh in every mind .

		It is as yester - day that the modest biography published in
1869	DATE	gave us an outline of the leading facts in his history .

		The record was of a fascinating character , unique in many particulars , strongly tinged with romance , and vivid in its suggest - iveness .

		It set forth so remarkable a person - ality , at once charming and commanding , that one could not fail to retain the impression and be glad to revive it at any hour .

		When , there - fore , a more complete account of the man is now presented , chiefly through his journals set in order by his granddaughter , the pleasure is heightened by the interest of the facts already known ; and as the final page is reached in this last full and authentic narrative , in an access of enthusiasm one is impelled to turn back to the earlier volume , and hunt it through , as so often before , for material to feed the reawakened interest .

		It is not so much the genius of Audubon , his gifts and accomplishments , that delight us : it is , first of all , his manliness , the rare balance of sweetness and strength , of dar - ing and humility , of impetuosity and patience , of grace and virility , of passion and purity , of fidelity , industry , and endurance , in a word , of the masculine and feminine elements which together make up the perfect humanity .

		It would be superfluous to rehearse any but the most significant incidents of
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		Everybody is familiar with the chance which procured his birth on American soil , the gay , roving Frenchman , Admiral Audubon , having married a beautiful Spanish Creole and become a temporary resident in the vicinity of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		The mother did not long sur - vive the advent of her son , and the day and year of his arrival were afterward lost in ob - livion .

		They may be placed , according to his granddaughter , somewhere not far beyond 1772 .

		The formative years of
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	's life were spent in
France	LOCATION	, where every privilege was afforded him which wealth , a doting step - mother , and a prudent father could provide . ''

		The handsomest boy in
France	LOCATION	, '' as the step - mother declared , was trained in all the graceful arts befitting a gentleman of his time .

		danced and fenced and drew , and played the flute and violin and flageolet with unusual skill , displaying in every direction both versatile and masterful talents .

		An absorbing love for na - ture in all its phases was his dominant charac - teristic , and in early childhood he began paint - ing the birds about him , a pursuit from which finally he was to earn lasting fame .

		He had already made two hundred sketches of these feathered wonders , when , at seventeen years of age , he returned to
America	LOCATION	, to become an independent citizen of the country to which he was ever loyally attached .

		For some years his home was at
Mill Grove	LOCATION	, a farm belonging to his father , situated near Schuylkill Falls in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Here he led a life devoid of care and devoted to pleasures of a harmless sort , in which music and drawing were not neglected .

		He had no vices .

		Later in life , he wrote : '' Cards I disliked .

		... I lived on milk , fruits , and vegetables , with the addition of game and fish at times , but never had I swallowed a single glass of wine or spirits until the day of my wedding .

		The result has been my uncommon , indeed iron , constitution .

		This has been my constant mode of life ever since my earliest recollection .

		... I never went to dinners , merely be - cause my choice of food occasioned comment , and also because often not a single dish was to my taste , and I could eat nothing from the sumptuous tables before me .

		... All this time I was as fair and as rosy as a girl , though as strong , indeed stronger than most young men , and as active as a buck . ''

		Audubon was a model of manly beauty , with a lithe , sinewy frame , capable of wonderful feats of strength and endurance , and a counte - nance marked by a pair of large , beaming eyes , a noble forehead , long locks of curling hair falling to the shoulders , and an expression of singular energy and intelligence .

		In his indif - ference to society , he permitted his future wife to dwell for months on an adjoining estate be - fore he discovered her proximity .

		At the first interview he was aware of his mistake .


Lucy Bakewell	PERSON	was a woman of solid attainments , gained in the English home from which she had lately removed , and of the stanch qualities needed in the wife of Audubon .

		He was an ardent lover , but the young girl 's father advised him to make some study of business before assuming the responsibilities of a family .

		He therefore turned to the mercantile trade , in which his experiences were such as might be anticipated of an untamable genius whose inclinations were averse to bartering in goods and accumulating pelf .

		He was married in
1808	DATE	, and immediately departed for
Louisville	LOCATION	,
Ky.	LOCATION	, with the intent to lead the staid life of a
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 merchant and a
Benedict	LOCATION	.

		How he pursued that intent we read in his own artless confession that , engrossed in the study of birds , he never thought of business beyond '' the ever-engaging journeys '' for the purchase of goods , which took him through '' the beautiful , the darling forests '' of the country lying between
Louisville	LOCATION	and
New York City	LOCATION	.

		He writes : '' Were I to tell you that once , when travelling and driving several horses before me laden with goods and dollars , I lost sight of the pack-saddles , and the cash they bore , to watch the motions of a warbler , I should only repeat occurrences that happened a hundred times and more in those days . ''

		Two years in
Louisville	LOCATION	were followed by a brief venture in
Henderson	LOCATION	, and a later attempt to build up a trade at
St. Genevieve	LOCATION	, all of which were fruitful chiefly in depleting his for - tune .

		In
1811	DATE	his business relations with his partner were dissolved , Audubon declaring that ''
Rozier	PERSON	cared only for money and liked
St. Genevieve	LOCATION	'' ; and
Rozier	PERSON	writing , '' Audubon had no taste for commerce , and was continually in the forest . ''

		The succeeding seventeen years comprised a period of trying vicissitudes in the experience of the Audubons .

		The wife , always patient and faithful , gave unreserved sympathy to the wandering proclivities of her husband , and while his plan for the production of his great work delineating '' The Birds of
America	LOCATION	'' was taking shape , she lent him every possible en - couragement .

		She bore the long terms of separation necessary to his purpose without complaint , meanwhile caring for their two sons , and contributing largely toward the family maintenance by teaching , which at that early day was a fertile source of revenue in the South .

		Audubon was often without a dollar in his pocket , yet when reduced to the severest straits he was able easily to coin money out of his varied accomplishments , now drawing portraits in chalk at
five dollars	MONEY	a head , and now giving dancing lessons which in a few winter months could be made to yield two thousand dollars .

		Like Agassiz , he could not afford to stop his life-work for mere money-making . ''

		One of the most extraordinary things in all these ad - verse circumstances , '' he states , '' was that I never for a day gave up listening to the songs of our birds , or watching their peculiar habits , or delineating them in the best way that I could . ''

		One hour of sad despondency he de - scribes as '' the only time in my life when the wild turkeys that so often crossed my path , and the thousands of lesser birds that enlivened the woods and the prairies , all looked like enemies , and I turned my eyes from them , as if I could have wished that they had never existed . ''

		In
1826	DATE	he visited
Philadelphia	LOCATION	with his portfolio of pictures , desirous of taking a few lessons of
Peale	PERSON	or of Sully , that he might im - prove in his beloved art , and also to devise ways of bringing his work before the public .

		Here , his scanty means being soon exhausted , he re - sorted anew to his pencil for help , and writes ,
July 19	DATE	: ''
Young Harris	PERSON	, God bless him , looked at the draw - ings I had for sale , and said he would take them all , at my prices .

		I would have kissed him , but that is not the custom in this icy city . ''

		Finding that his * ' Birds of
America	LOCATION	'' could not be properly lithographed in this country , he devoted the next two years to the enlarge - ment of his collection , and the gathering of a little fund that might enable him to visit En - gland .

		With a '' God speed '' from his wife , and a stout heart in his breast , he set out on his doubtful enterprise from
New Orleans	LOCATION	,
April 26 , 1826	DATE	, and landed in
Liverpool	LOCATION
July 21	DATE	.

		He had an extraordinary gift for making friends , and everyone was attracted by the simple manners and prepossessing mien of this talented , unsophisticated '' man of the woods . ''

		In his various absences from home , Audubon was in the habit of committing to a journal the incidents of each day for the perusal of the loved ones left behind .

		His heart was laid bare in these pages , and very interesting it is to view the intense emotions that excited him as he strove to enlist sympathy and aid in the costly endeavor on which he was now intent .

		Alternate hopes and fears rioted in his breast .

		Of the first exhibition of his pictures before a prospective patron , he writes : '' What sensations I had whilst I helped to untie the fastenings of my portfolio !

		I knew by all around me that these good friends were possessed of both taste and judgment , and I did not know that I should please .

		I was panting like the winged pheasant , but ah !

		these kind people praised my birds , and I felt the praise to be honest ; once more I breathed freely ... Oh !

		what can I hope , my Lucy , for thee and for us all ? ''

		So great was his encouragement that in two weeks ' time he cheerily announced : '' I am well received everywhere , my works praised and admired , and my poor heart is at last relieved from the great anxiety that has for so many years agitated it , for I know now that I have not worked in vain . ''

		Still there was ever-recurring suspense for the shy , humble artist to endure , as he presented his work to the eye of each possible subscriber .

		On his way to
Lizars	PERSON	, the skilled engraver who was to pass judgment on his art , he says : ** I lost hope at every step , and I doubt if I opened 72 -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, my lips .

		I slowly unbuckled my portfolio , placed a chair for him , and with my heart like a stone held up a drawing .

		Mr.
Lizars	PERSON	rose from his seat , exclaiming : My God !

		I never saw anything like this before . ' ''

		For two years
Andubon	PERSON	was carrying his portfolio from city to city in
England	LOCATION	,
Scot	PERSON	- land , and
France	LOCATION	, and from the presence of one rich man 's door to another , to gather names enough on his list to sustain the costly publica - tion of his '' Birds of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It was the largest and most expensive work of the sort that had ever been undertaken , and only Au - dubon 's enthusiasm and tenacity of purpose could have conceived and carried through the immense achievement .

		When he returned to
America	LOCATION	he had secured a hundred and forty - four subscribers , and the work was far advanced in the process of printing .

		It was published in parts of five plates each -LRB- '' elephant folio '' in size -RRB- , at two guineas a part ; and , when com - pleted , comprised eighty-seven parts , giving 506 species and
1065	DATE	figures of birds .

		About one hundred and seventy-five copies are now known to be in existence , eighty of which are in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is one of the few illustrated works , if not the only one , an eminent orni - thologist has said , which steadily increases in price with the passage of time .

		The rare copies now occasionally thrown on the market com - mand from
$ 1500	MONEY	to
$ 2000	MONEY	.

		The cost of printing the work was over
$ 100,000	MONEY	.

		While managing the details of this large enterprise , Audubon was obliged to use the utmost diligence to keep himself and his print - ers in funds .

		He found a quick sale for single drawings at remunerative prices , and it was no unusual occurrence for him to sit painting four - teen or even seventeen hours on a stretch .

		Four hours of sleep sufficed him , and he loved to be up and out for a long tramp , or settled to his day 's labor , at three o'clock in the
morning	TIME	.

		It was hard to adapt himself to the habits of ordinary men , and he was restive and misera - ble in the gatherings where all eyes were sure to be riveted upon his striking person .

		His English friends besought him to have his hair cut and to put on a fashionable coat before he appeared in
London	LOCATION	.

		After one such earnest solicitation , he remarks , '' I laughed , and he laughed , and my hair is yet as God made it . ''

		The importunity was urgent , however , and finally yielding to it , ' he thus noted the event in a black-bordered page of his journal : ''
March 19 , 1827	DATE	This day my hair was sacrificed .

		... As the barber clipped my locks rapidly , it reminded me of the horrible French Revolution , when the same operation was performed upon all the victims murdered at the guillotine ; my heart sank low .

		... I knew I was acting weakly , but , rather than render my good friend miserable about it , I suffered the loss patiently . ''

		Audubon had been fond of dress and of lux - urious belongings in his youth , but all that was far in the past .

		It had been crowded out of his thought by more noble and absorbing aspi - rations ; and to renew the lost interest was not now possible . ''

		No dash , no glimmer or shine about him , '' was the comment of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, `` but great simplicity of man - ners and behavior , slight in person and plainly dressed . ''

		The returns from the '' Birds of
America	LOCATION	, '' and later publications of a similar nature , en - sured Audubon a competence for his remaining years .

		He purchased a tract of twenty-four acres on the banks of the
Hudson	LOCATION	, now known as
Audubon Park	LOCATION	, within the present limits of
New York City	LOCATION	.

		Here , with wife , children , and grandchildren , in one happy household , his old age was supremely blessed .

		His indus - try continued undiminished , his study of the birds , to which were now added the quadrupeds , his rambles in the forests , his delightful com - panionship with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1833	DATE	three months were consumed in a trip to Labrador , and in
1843	DATE	he gave eight months to an investigation of the wild life in the forests bordering the
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		A venerable man at this latter date , he was still in possession of astonishing phy - sical powers .

		In his prime he had once said that , in a walking match , '' I think I could kill any horse in
England	LOCATION	in twenty days , taking the travel over rough and level ground . ''

		Until the last , his form was erect , his step like that of a deer , and his eye as keen as an Indian 's .

		It is said by his sole surviving comrade of the tour to Labrador : '' You had only to meet him to love him , and when you had conversed with him for a moment , you looked upon him as an old friend , rather than a stranger ... To this day I can see him , a magnificent gray-haired man , child-like in his simplicity , kind-hearted , noble - souled , lover of nature and lover of youth , friend of humanity , and one whose religion was the golden rule . ''

		A monument in old
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	churchyard ,
New York	LOCATION	, marks the spot where Audubon was buried .

		These two generous volumes of his journals , enriched by ten portraits of himself , with others of his wife and sons , and various miscellaneous engravings , give him back to us as he was in life , an honor to his country and his race .

Elliott Coues	PERSON	has added to the scientific value of the present book by an abund - ance of painstaking and scholarly notes .

		His survey of events penetrates at once to the underlying currents , and so locates them as to define the fixed relations of the events .

		It is a relief to all who delight in the ro - mantic of American history to see that the authenticity of the story of Captain

		THE HOPE OF THE LABORING MAN .

		* The pleasing assumption that by legislative process we can give to the poor a greater share of the produce of capital and labor , while not diminishing the aggregate production , ought to reveal its inherent absurdity in the mere state - ment .

		Nevertheless , the belief that this can be done is very prevalent .

		It is Mr.
Means	PERSON	's object , in his work on '' Industrial Freedom , '' to show that no taxation of capital , no legisla - tion compelling a new division of the shares of labor and capital , no socialistic device , can accomplish the end desired .

		These attempts can only diminish the total from which both profit and wages are paid , and so inflict further injury upon the laborer .

		A grievance does indeed exist .

		Everyone admits that the majority of mankind must re - main obscure , poor , and without the great means of development and culture .

		Yet , while this is true , the material condition of such men is so infinitely better than it was a hundred years ago , and their eyes have been so opened to the possibilities of this life , its opportunities for development , its ease and comforts , so much the more desirable when unpossessed , that a feeling of revolt is almost universal .

		This feeling is intensified by what seems to be the injustice of their lot .

		Hence the demand that the injustice shall be rectified by law ; that the rich shall give of their fulness to the poor , and that by a new arrangement of the social system all men may enjoy the blessings and rewards of material prosperity .

		But what is this injustice ?

		Certainly , if the conditions complained of are due to natural means , and not to the acts of men , we can not speak of any injustice which has a possible meaning in this connection .

		The injustice complained of must be the remediable injustice of man to man .

		If such exists , then it is , in - deed , the duty of the legislator to correct it .

		* INDUSTRIAL FREEDOM .

		By
David MacQregor Means	ORGANIZATION	.

		With an Introduction by the Hon.
David A. Wells	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	8 , + & tttat Kb rttm So much is willingly admitted .

		But let no man out of the depth of his bitterness accuse the social system because there is a necessary strug - gle for existence ; or because natural conditions are hostile to the physically and mentally weak ; or because machinery and inventions have dis - turbed the temporary organization of the in - dustrial world for its lasting benefit ; or because many laboring men are improvident ; or because the earth is so constituted that the means of subsistence have a tendency to increase in a different ratio to the increase of population .

		If these things are injustices , there is an end to the argument , and the laboring man is more than vindicated in his rebellion .

		Conceding that these conditions are neces - sary , we are confined to an inquiry into the ac - tual relations between employer and employed , an inquiry which has for its object the deter - mination of the province of legislative inter - ference between the two .

		What is the actual status ?

		It is presumably one of free , open , and complete competition , with the power on both sides of making contracts .

		This being the case , the advocate of legislative interference declares that the laboring man is a slave , and his condition that of `` industrial slavery . ''

		The truth is not in accordance with this assertion .

		In the matter of law , for instance , the employed is less a slave than the employer , for the law permits workingmen to combine to raise wages , while it prohibits capitalists from combining to raise prices ; the workingman can break his contract with impunity , while the law will hold the employer to the strict letter of the same contract .

		Nor is the position of the laborer harsher in other respects .

		Capital can as little afford to lie idle as can labor .

		In fact , it sometimes can not so well afford this , since the loss to capital is not only the loss of profit , but of rent and interest as well , a loss on the machinery and buildings which are lying idle .

		Moreover , the capitalist may have contracts which he is bound under heavy penalties to fill .

		In such a case , he is at the mercy of the work - ingman .

		At the best , he is often compelled to pay wages which are above the rate that would be paid if competition were indeed free and open , for a strong trades-union will have con - siderable power to raise wages , and even greater power in hindering the capitalist from hiring non-union men .

		It has been held that the relations existing between employer and employed are materially changed when a corporation is the employer .

		But there is no good ground for this assertion .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 Competition still exists , and has to be taken into account .

		Much as the corporation might like to secure its labor for half price , it can not do so , but must pay for it what other competi - tors engaged in the same industry pay ; just as it must pay equal prices for the lumber and coal and iron that it buys .

		It has no choice , and to speak of industrial slavery in such a case is nonsense .

		Isolated instances of reduced wages will occur , but they can not last , for the tendency on the one hand is to cut down all expenses , on the other hand to compel a rise in wages .

		Hence other corporations will try to reduce wages , while the laborers will strive for an advance which will make their wages equal to those of other workers in the same industry .

		Consequently wages are bound to reach a common level .

		Notwithstanding these facts , it is particularly upon corporations that war is waged ; it is upon them that many people feel there lies the duty of raising wages ; of being forced by law to `` dis - gorge . ''

		The injustice of these demands is ap - parent , and becomes even more apparent when we examine into the real nature of a corpora - tion .

		A corporation consists of a body of stockholders and their agents , the officials who manage its affairs ; the acts of a corporation are the acts either of the stockholders or of the agents ; the property of a corporation is un - doubtedly that of the stockholders ; the '' crimes '' of a corporation are the '' crimes '' of its agents ; the '' disgorging '' demanded must be done by the stockholders ; if the corporation must pay higher wages , these must come from the same source .

		And who are the stockholders ?

		In thousands of cases they are men of moderate means .

		Stock is often held by charitable in - stitutions , or by widows and orphans who can - not manage their own property , and so invest it in corporate stock .

		When we have stated these simple and well-known facts , the injustice of the demand that corporations should pay higher wages and have fewer rights than other employers becomes evident .

		And when we examine statistics it is found that the stock - holders rarely receive large profits .

		Many of them receive none whatever .

		Seven-tenths of the railroad stock in the
United States	LOCATION	pay no dividends , and other corporations in the same plight are numbered by the thousand .

		The difficulty here is two-fold .

		In the first place , most people are so ignorant of the facts that they confound the agents of the corpora - tion with the owners of the property , while the former are primarily the managers only .

		The second error lies in drawing a hard-and - fast line between capitalists and employees .

		No such line exists .

		The workingman who is thrifty and saves his money is also a capitalist , and in many instances he is a stockholder .

		In the year
1893	DATE	the deposits in the savings banks of the
United States	LOCATION	were
$ 1,800,000,000	MONEY	, and the depositors numbered 4,830,000 .

		These savings were capital , and these depositors were capitalists .

		Looked at in this light , the propo - sition to tax corporations because they are cor - porations resolves itself into a very simple scheme to tax thrift and sobriety for the benefit of those who possess neither of these qualities .

		When these truths dawn upon the labor agitator and the socialistic thinker , the demand is instantly made that the manager be taxed , or at least that the rich man be taxed because he is rich .

		Perhaps there is more justice in this demand .

		Certain it is that the man who gets rich by his managerial ability the well-known but somewhat indefinable `` captain of indus - try '' can be taxed without appreciably dimin - ishing the amount he will produce , so long as the law stops short of taking all that he pro- duces .

		This is so , because to refuse to produce all that he can will be more harmful to himself than to anyone else .

		Mr.
Means	PERSON	thinks that such a tax on profits , if it could be levied , would be objectionable because the smaller dealers , the men who produce just at the margin of profit , would be forced out of business ; and this , he seems to think , would be calamitous .

		Cer - tainly it would not .

		The result would be analo - gous to the introduction of labor-saving ma - chines , hard on a present generation of laborers and tradesmen , but finally beneficial to all .

		A tax on incomes would be more certain than a tax on profits , and as just as any tax can be , though Mr.
Means	PERSON	does not think so .

		A tax on the '' unearned increment '' would also be just , but is less easily applied , and pretty cer - tain in its incidence to fall upon the man who pays the rent instead of upon the owner .

		Hence this is not at present a possible form of taxa - tion .

		We may say the same of many forms of tax upon bonds and stocks of corporations , such as railroads , breweries , mining companies , etc. .

		The consumer pays the tax .

		Hence taxes upon capital are sure to fail .

		The alternative proposition that the government shall take all great corporate enterprises into its own hands is met by Mr.
Means	PERSON	with a reference to the failures of the government so far , and to the extravagance and corruption at present inherent in government methods and government agents .

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, The Public Printing-office is one illustration ; the annual deficit in the Post-office department is another ; the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	experiment in owning gas-works is a third .

		The enthusiast who advocates government ownership in the
United States	LOCATION	must be gently but firmly re - pressed until the advent of the millennium jus - tifies his hopes .

		When all is said , it remains true that com - petition , full , free , and open , is the best hope of the laboring man .

		But there is a domain in which law should and must be active .

		For instance , the law should see that the employer does not suffer from rampant trades-unionism ; that the non-union man is not oppressed by the same means ; that the employer is kept from '' inducing '' the laborer to buy land from him , or to rent from him alone , or to trade at his store exclusively .

		Any man acquainted with the conditions of the life of the laborer in many parts of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	will know how serious these questions are , and how essential the use of legal restraint has become .

		The law can dis - pense justice here , precisely as it has already done in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in respect to the employment of women and children in mines and factories .

		And such legislation would in - crease the real wages of laborers , and would not in general reduce the aggregate production .

		It seems to the reviewer that there is in Mr.
Means	PERSON	's book a failure to point out a very real difficulty in the industrial situation , and one apparently inseparable from it under the regime of freedom , the fact that the welfare of the individual is too often opposed to the general welfare .

		For example , it is a benefit to glass-blowers to have glassware broken ; to printers to have type set by hand ; to small retail dealers to have department stores abol - ished ; to carpenters that fires should be numer - ous ; to smart financiers that superfluous rail - roads should be constructed and unnecessary buildings erected .

		Yet all these things are opposed to the general welfare .

		The man who builds an unnecessary railroad is guilty of an act that is destructive to the interests of capital and labor alike .

		What is to be done with such an one ?

		How are we to reconcile the conflict - ing interests of individuals with the interests of all the people ?

		This is in fact the great problem , and the man who solves it will deserve eternal honor .

		A general criticism of Mr.
Means	PERSON	's method may be offered .

		What he says is true enough , but only when the conditions specified are all present .

		But these conditions never are all present ; and hence the conclusions point only to a general policy to be pursued .

		Again , while Mr.
Means	PERSON	defines his terms strictly , he uses them loosely ; occasionally , too , he omits some element of the problem which would put a very different face on the argument .

		Thus , on page 42 he reasons as if the entrepreneur did not exist , while in his chapter on the nature of profits the great manager is very prominent indeed ; he declares that railroads which are not able to declare dividends pay their em - ployees '' not only all that their services are worth , but more than they are worth '' -LRB- page 46 -RRB- , while on page 99 he declares that '' We must maintain as our standard of justice the equality of reward with sacrifice . ''

		If this is the true principle , certainly the services of a brakeman on a railroad are not to be measured by the corporation 's ability to pay dividends .

		He also fails to note that frequently the rail - roads have only themselves to blame if they can not pay dividends -LRB- page 46 -RRB- , while later he clearly points this out -LRB- page 116 -RRB- .

		He holds that the rate of profits may be measured to some extent by the rate of interest -LRB- page 155 -RRB- , and yet he shows that this is not so , '' since the decline of interest ... has taken place be - cause property has been protected and profits increased under modern methods of govern - ment '' -LRB- page 189 -RRB- .

		When all exceptions are taken , however , it must be said that Mr.
Means	PERSON	has given us a very helpful and very readable book , and one which is well calculated to convince the man we all wish to convince , the honest third man who is in doubt and is willing to be set right .

		THE DIAL 77 all the improvement seen in the manufacture of theological works , there is none more marked than that which distinguishes this sumptuous volume from its literary ancestry .

		In reality , the present volume contains two separate commentaries , each by as eminent a biblical student as
Scotland	LOCATION	can boast .

		Between the two treatises there is naturally a general similarity in method .

		Each has its Introduc - tion , and each its interpretative portion .

		To examine any one of these four portions in de - tail is quite impossible ; but each has its excel - lences and its insufficiences .

		Chief among the latter is that which is common to both the use of the Textus Receptus .

		Why this aston - ishing relapse of scholarship is permitted , is very lamely explained .

		It is true that critical readings are inserted below the text ; but why , in this stage of the textual criticism of the
New Testament	LOCATION	, it is necessary to force every stu - dent to make his own critical text , is hard to see .

		So far as the Introductions go , there is a surprising conservatism in that of Professor
Dods	PERSON	, who devotes over twenty-three pages to a learned and elaborate establishing of the un - modified Johannine authorship of the gospel , of which space only a page and a half deal with the hypothesis that the book as it stands is of Johannine origin but written by one of
John	PERSON	's disciples .

		It is disappointing to see the off - hand fashion in which this position is pushed aside in what seems a sort of postscript to the real discussion .

		In Professor
Bruce	PERSON	's Intro - duction we have a characteristically graphic presentation of the synoptic problem , which is admirably brought down to date .

		In fact , it would be difficult to find elsewhere so good a statement of the entire matter in the same space .

		In the exegesis , it will perhaps be found that the relative worth of the two parts will be higher .

		Professor
Dods	PERSON	is thoroughly at home in working as an exegete within the limits set him in a brief running commentary , and the work of Professor
Bruce	PERSON	has preserved , even in its conciseness , much of its attractive literary quality .

		Neither author could be guilty of unscholarly writing , though there is a decided difference between the somewhat formal exe - getical studies of the one and the flowing com - ment of the other .

		There may be some ques - tion whether in either case the compression of
Alford	PERSON	has been equalled , and one can not help regretting occasionally that the perspective of interpretation has not been better kept , and that Professor
Bruce	PERSON	's critical positions have not been of greater service in exegesis .

		But , taken all in all , if we are to have
Alford	PERSON	re - divivus it is probable that the present volume is as good as we could expect .

		Certainly it is eminently usable , and much of its exposition is stimulating and illuminating ; while , apart from the matters above indicated , its insufficiencies are due to the endeavor to get text and comment within certain fixed limits of space .

		At all events , it is no small advantage to have the opinions of two such men as the present authors upon the four gospels , even though we may not be able to know all the data upon which these opinions are based .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, consideration , the ``
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	, '' known to her friends as Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	, the interest is pecu - liarly marked , for the striking qualities displayed in her first two or three books were of a sort which might give distinction to a social sketch or a draw - ing-room comedy , but which could not be counted upon to give distinction to work done upon a large canvas or having the world for a stage .

		In other words , it takes more than cleverness to produce seri - ous fiction , and the sparkle and caustic wit that sufficed for such books as '' Some Emotions and a Moral '' offered no promise of such a book as '' The School for Saints . ''

		Moreover , Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	had produced one book of ampler dimensions which could be regarded as only a failure , and her later work had seemed to offer indications that a rather thin vein of observation was about exhausted . ''

		The School for Saint ?

		, '' then , comes to us as an agree - able surprise , for it shows an unexpected growth of the powers of the writer , and a grasp of the deeper problems of life for which her earlier efforts had done little to prepare the public .

		It is a full-grown novel in itself , and at the end we learn that it is but the first part of a still larger work , the continuation of which we shall await with impatience .

		The book is essentially a picture of European society in the last days of the
Third Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		It deals with polit - ical and social life in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	, as well as the mythical Duchy of
Alberia	LOCATION	, and gives us bold presentations of such public men as
Disraeli	LOCATION	, such events as the Carlist uprising of
1869	DATE	, and such tendencies of thought as the rising tide of the reaction against liberalism .

		It is , moreover , made intensely vital by the strong personality of
Robert Orange	PERSON	, who is a part of all these things a friend of Disraeli , a knight-errant of Spanish legitimacy , and a type of the conservative temper that can find rest only in the acceptance of authority in religious , and of consecrated tradition in political , matters .

		The point of view is one which can not be ours , or that of any purely rational student of affairs , and it is a noteworthy tribute to the author 's success to acknowledge that she compels our sympathy for the outworn ideals that are hers ; investing them with both dignity and moral attractiveness .

		To sum up , '' The School for Saints '' is a book based upon much reflective knowledge , and having both strength and distinction of manner .

		Per contra , it retains a little too much of the '' pointed '' epigram - matic style that served so well to introduce the writer into literature , and its idealism now and then skirts the regions of sentimental absurdity .

		The hero at times barely escapes the imputation of priggishness , and the heroine usually speaks in a language better fitted to a woman of sixty than to a girl of sixteen . ''

		The
Beth Book	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Sarah Grand	PERSON	, '' offers us no such development of power as is illustrated by the volume last under discussion .

		Every dis - cerning reader of '' The Heavenly Twins '' must have realized that chaotic performance to be the work of a woman for whom , no matter how many books she might produce , no intellectual growth was possible , and nothing like artistic success ever attain - able .

		Accumulation , not selection , is her method , and her paragraphs are chunks of verbiage rather than polished instruments of expression .

		Her book is an attempt to do for a girl what Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	did for a boy in '' Sentimental Tommy '' that is , to describe the development of a child of genius .

		If she had left off where Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	did , leaving us to imagine the years of ripened power instead of at - tempting to characterize them , we should have had a different verdict to record from that which the book as a whole makes necessary .

		For the story of
Beth	PERSON	's childhood is told with no little insight and charm , and she is too winsome a creature for the fate that awaits her in the later chapters . ''

		The Beth Book '' is clearly a book with a purpose , although it is difficult to state just what purpose .

		It might be described as a tract directed against a certain class of hospitals for women , although even on this point the writer 's logic is painfully to seek .

		To assume that the sex is degraded by the provision of such hospitals is an utterly impossible thesis , yet it seems to be maintained in all seriousness by this writer .

		In a larger view , her purpose is to pro- claim the wrongs of downtrodden woman , which is done by placing
Beth	PERSON	in contrast with the uncon - vincing domestic tyrant who figures as her father , and the utterly unimaginable brute who makes her his wife .

		The working out of this contrast , together with much railing at the wickedness of man in gen - eral , and at the social ideals of the mid - Victorian period , serves to keep the story going for many long chapters after it has ceased to have any human in - terest .

		There are many touches of vitality and glimpses of sincere feeling in the book , a fact which makes its shapelessness and bad temper and lack of artistic restraint only the more exasperating .

		A considerable but somewhat perverse power is displayed in '' The Tormentor , '' which again directs attention to the author of ''
Nancy Noon	PERSON	. ''

		The chief character in this book is a young man whose conduct is uncontrolled by any apparent ethical motive , and who , conscious of the possession of in - tellectual powers much out of the common , applies them to the moral vivisection of his neighbors .

		He thus becomes , in pure wantonness , the '' tormentor '' of a considerable number of his fellow-beings , and the recital of his experiments is anything but edify - ing .

		The book has a certain distinction of style and phrase which gives it a remotely Meredithian flavor , but it is not pleasant either to peruse or to think about afterwards . ''

		Margot '' is a pretty story of love and suffering , which links in strange fashion the fortunes of an English gentleman , a girl of unfortunate parentage , and a Siberian exile .

		The scene is laid partly in
England	LOCATION	and partly in
France	LOCATION	.

		There are some amateurish features about the book , and more of sentiment than passion , although the author has evidently sought to introduce the latter quality into his book .

		The sections of the story are not very
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL deftly articulated , but it all comes somehow to a conclusion , and a reasonably happy one at that .

		Miss
M. E. Coleridge	PERSON	is the author of '' The King with Two Faces , '' a historical romance of
Sweden	LOCATION	at the close of the last century .

		The striking figure of
Gustavus III	ORGANIZATION	.

		occupies a central position in the narrative , and the episode of the siege of
Gothen	PERSON	- burg is made the subject of some descriptive pas - sages that are vivid and almost brilliant .

		After this , we witness the efforts of the King to establish himself as an absolute monarch , and finally his end at the hands of an assassin .

		With all this historical matter there is interwoven a tragic tale of private love , and a great diversity of incidental matter .

		The book is of considerable interest , although it drags in the closing chapters . ''

		By a Hair 's Breadth '' is a novel of nihilist con - spiracy , and deals with certain imagined attempts upon the life of the present Tsar upon the occasion of his imperial progress through
Austria	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	.

		The material of the plot is all so hackneyed that a more talented romancer than Mr.
Headon Hill	PERSON	could hardly have hoped to invest it with any fresh interest .

		The agent of the
Third Section	ORGANIZATION	is not a convincing sort of person , and the nihilists whom he tracks are all figures taken from the melodramatic stage .

		Even his Englishman cuts a poor figure , although all that could be expected of a man betrothed to as slangy a sort of girl as the English heroine .

		The sort of romance that Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	weaves out of the materials afforded by Scottish history is pretty well known by this time , and little need be said of '' Lochinvar '' beyond recording the fact that its scene is laid partly in
Scotland	LOCATION	and partly in
Holland	LOCATION	, and that it dates from the eventful year
1688	DATE	.

		The Prince of Orange himself figures in two or three episodes , and the book is filled with ro - mantic adventures of the most exciting sort .

		It is one of Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	's best books , and is written largely in the English language .

		We wish that we might say also of Lord
Ernest Hamilton	PERSON	's border romance , '' The Outlaws of the Marches , '' that it is written in the English lan - guage , for we are sure that it would be interesting if it were intelligible .

		But when a single page , taken almost at random , yields such linguistic nug - gets as '' prein-head , '' `` ongains , '' `` mirdin ' , '' `` gau - kieing , '' `` snoick , '' `` mim , '' `` meeth , '' `` whitter , '' '' pake , '' '' tynd , '' '' cow-clynks , '' '' sharnie , '' '' flea - luggit , '' '' clushete , '' '' daidling , '' and '' quey , '' be - sides the more familiar forms of the Scots dialect , we feel bound to protest .

		Nor does the glossary at the end of the book relieve our feelings ; we can not escape the suspicion , moreover , that some of this is bad language .

		As for the story , we have made out its general trend , and find the gist of it to be a ro - mance of the Scottish border in the sixteenth cen - tury .

		It tells how the mighty race of the Armstrongs -LRB- a clan suggestive of Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's Doones -RRB- long defied both God and man , but met their deserved fate in the end .

		The love-story is a pretty one , and the illustrations , which are all plates of scenery reproduced from photographs , are not only a joy in themselves , but offer a valuable hint to those illus - trators who design groups of puppets more wooden even than the descriptions to which they are fitted .

		The average illustration of the average novel is a most distressing thing , and the expenditure which it involves is something worse than waste . ''

		The Juggler '' is not a particularly well-made story , nor is the figure of its chief character an attractive one .

		But it has the two unfailing ele - ments of Miss Murfree 's strength clear insight into the character of the
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountaineer and a marvellous power of poetical interpretation when it deals with the natural aspects of the region which he inhabits .

		When inspired by her beloved moun - tains , the powers of the author become , as it were , transfigured , the utterance is so large , so free from the trammels of her individuality , so finely conso - nant with the mystery and the majesty of the scenes she describes .

		This one thing Miss Murfree has done for American literature so supremely well that she stands almost without a rival .

		It is as far as possible removed from fine writing ; it seems to have the inevitable quality , and bears no mark of the self-conscious rhetorician .

		Nothing could be more sharply contrasted with such work than the photographic realism of
Miss Wilkins	LOCATION	, exhibited already in so many studies of
New England	LOCATION	character .

		Here nature counts for little , and life for nearly everything , a life , more - over , that is pictured with touches whose delicacy suggests
Jane Austen	PERSON	or Meissonnier . ''

		Jerome , a Poor Man '' is the most ambitious of Miss
Wilkins	PERSON	's books , and its realism is not so uncompromising as to refuse absolutely admission of the elements of romance .

		Although the hero is '' a poor man , '' and although we are spared no detail of his grim strug - gle with poverty , he is allowed the good fortune of a windfall in the shape of a legacy , and his toil leads in the end to prosperity and happiness .

		The story of this legacy involves the one questionable point in the whole scheme of the book .

		As a boy , impelled by a great desire to help those who are , like himself , struggling for the means of subsistence ,
Jerome	PERSON	makes a vow that if he ever becomes possessed of any large sum of money he will distribute it indis - criminately among the poor of his township .

		The legacy permits fulfilment of this rash vow , and we are not sure that the author does not believe such indiscriminate charity to be desirable and really helpful to its beneficiaries .

		Her main object is , of course , to illustrate the effect of this conduct upon two other men , who are shamed into something like emulation of it , and to close the book in a sort of Christmas atmosphere of good will toward men .

		But the moral is still questionable from the stand - point of a sound sociology , and we wish that the main result might have been achieved by some other means .

		The heroine , appropriately named
Lucina	PERSON	, is not a success , and we can hardly wish
Jerome	PERSON	joy in the possession of so insipid and doll-like a creature .

		80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, But men in love do not always know what is best for them , and a familiar moral is thus pointed once more .

		We go once more to the mountains in the com - pany of Mr.
John Fox , Jr.	PERSON	, whose story of '' The Kentuckians '' is the most serious piece of work thus far attempted hy this growing writer .

		There is little here to suggest
Miss Murfree	PERSON	, for to Mr.
Fox	PERSON	the mountains hardly exist as natural phenomena , but are merely the physical environment of a hardy human stock kept out of the march of civilization by their barriers , and relapsed into something like bar - barism .

		The core of this book is the story of a feud between two mountain clans , a feud as grim as those of the sixteenth century borderers described in '' The Outlaws of the Marches . ''

		When we read in the newspapers of two Kentuckians who meet in the streets of some town , and try to kill each other at sight , we read only of the efflorescence of an antag - onism whose roots and trunk are likely to be hidden in some fastness of the wilderness .

		Hence our edi - torial sermonizing is apt to fall wide of the mark , mistaking what is accidental for what is essential .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	does not sermonize overmuch , but he ex - plains , thereby doing far better service to the stu - dent of these social phenomena .

		His standpoint is right ; these things are a part of savagery , but they are not to be done away with by appeals to a social ideal that simply does not exist in the mental make - up of those concerned , that must , in fact , first be created by a laborious educational process before it may be appealed to effectively .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	has given us in this book a virile presentation of his theme , and we are grateful to him for it .

		Mr.
Charles K. Lush	PERSON	is a new writer , and if he has it in him to produce more books of the quality of '' The Federal Judge '' he is not likely to lack encouragement from the critics .

		His story takes us straight into the heart of present-day politics and involves one of the burning social problems of the hour .

		It is , briefly , the story of a railway king and an incorruptible judge .

		The former is a man of the keen , forceful , unscrupulous type who figures so largely in the industrial life of the present ; the latter is a man of simple straightforward character , who becomes , without in the least suspecting it , the mere tool of the other .

		The manner in which Judge
Dunn	PERSON	, the sworn foe of monopolies and corporate wealth , is raised from the obscurity of his country circuit to the federal bench by the designing
Gard	PERSON	- well , and the way in which his very simplicity is wrought upon to his undoing , is described in a skil - ful way , and is to a considerable extent typical of actual conditions .

		The lesson that no man may entirely escape being affected by his environment , and that the best-intentioned of judges will be influ - enced by the subtle forces that electrify the atmos - phere in which the money-getters of a great city have their being , is admirably presented in this book , and there is no need of pointing the moral .

		Thus it comes about that our judge , in spite of his natural bent , is persuaded to join hands with the schemer who has gained his confidence , and to issue , at a critical juncture in the affairs of a great rail - way system for the control of which two equally unscrupulous factions are contending , one of the famous strike injunctions that made so great a stir two or three years ago .

		Here is the burning ques - tion raised by the novel , and we are bound to say that both sides of the argument that rages about such injunctions are presented with fairness , although the balance of the author 's sympathies does not seem to incline in the direction in which we would have it .

		And we must confess that to
Gardwell	PERSON	, who is also in a way the product of an unwholesome environ - ment , the author seems to have meted out too harsh a fate .

		Unscrupulous as the man is , there are as - pects of his character that excite admiration and even respect , and when he dies , we have something of the feeling of the boy-reader who follows hia favorite pirate to execution .

		One is much prepossessed in favor of ''
Lorraine	PERSON	, '' the new romance of Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	, by the poem that serves as a preface .

		It is so charming that we must reproduce it entire . ''

		When Yesterday shall dawn again , And the long line athwart the hill Shall quicken with the bugle 's thrill , Thine own shall come to thee ,
Lorraine	PERSON	! ''

		Then in each vineyard , vale , and plain , The quiet dead shall stir the earth And rise , reborn , in thy new birth Thou holy martyr-maid ,
Lorraine	PERSON	! ''

		Is it in vain thy sweet tears stain Thy mother 's breast ?

		Her castled crest Is lifted now !

		God guide her quest !

		She seeks thine own for thee ,
Lorraine !	PERSON

		`` So Yesterday shall live again , And the steel line along the Rhine Shall cuirass thee and all that 's thine .


France	LOCATION	lives thy
France	LOCATION	divine Lorraine ! ''

		Unless we are much mistaken , this lyric will be pre - served in the anthologies .

		The story which it intro - duces is much the best piece of work that Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has given us , and the best story of the Franco-Prussian War , with the possible exception of
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	's ''
Allzeit Voran	PERSON	, '' that has ever come to our notice .

		By an ingenious conceit , the name of the French province is also the name of the heroine of the book , and one of the sweetest creations of recent romance is thus linked by both verbal and actual association with the fair province which might but not right wrested from the bosom of the mother-country a quarter of a century ago .

		The story is delightful from beginning to end , ten - der and pathetic , at one moment the embodiment of delicate feeling , at another stirred with war 's alarums and vivid dramatic action .

		The only his - torical figure of any consequence is that of the Man of Sedan , viewed in the hour of impending or accom - plished retribution , and the sketch is not one to be easily forgotten .

		We think , however , that the au - thor fell into an artistic fault when he made his heroine the daughter of the Emperor , stolen at birth by a frenzied sufferer from the coup d'etat .

		And
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 we wish that Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	had refrained from venting so much spleen upon
Thiers	PERSON	and
Gambetta	PERSON	, whom he cordially detests .

		Such matter as the fol - lowing is out of place in a work like ''
Lorraine	PERSON	, '' and strikes a painfully false note : ''
Gambetta	PERSON	.

		that incubus of bombastic flabbiness , roaring prophecy and platitude through the dismayed city , kept his eye on the balcony of the particular edifice where , later , he should pose as an animated
Jericho	LOCATION	trum - pet .

		So , biding his time , he bellowed , but it was the
Comedie Francaise	ORGANIZATION	that was the loser , not the people , when he sailed away in his balloon , posed , majestically squatting as the god of war above the clouds of battle .

		And little
Thiers	PERSON	, furtive , timid , delighting in senile efforts to stir the ferment of chaos till it boiled , he , too , was there , owl-like , squeaky-voiced , a true ' bombyx a lunettes . '

		There , too , was Hugo often ridiculous in his terrible moods , egotistical , sloppy , roaring .

		The Empire pinched Hugo , and he roared ; and let the rest of the world judge whether , under such circumstances , there was majesty in the roar . ''

		Well , we should say that the world had judged , and found a very different verdict from that brought by Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	.

		Even Thiers by no means deserves such censure , for he was a patriot at heart , although he made terrible mistakes of judgment , and was of anything but heroic aspect .

		We are sorry that so good a piece of fiction as Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has here given us should be marred by the occasional introduction of such a screed as has been quoted .

		The writing is vigorous , but the criticism is both wrongheaded and misplaced .

		Encouraged by the success of his earlier novel , '' On the Red Staircase , '' Mr.
M. Imlay Taylor	PERSON	has undertaken , in '' An Imperial Lover , '' to produce what is to all intents and purposes a sequel to that interesting romance .

		Once more the hero ,
M. du Brousson	PERSON	, finds himself in
Petersburg	LOCATION	, this time as a grizzled marshal of
France	LOCATION	, sent on a diplomatic mission to the court in which he had won his own bride years before .

		In his suite is a young friend , who figures as the jeune premier of the present work , and whose love for the fair
Najine	ORGANIZATION	meets with no less an obstacle than the rivalry of Peter the Great .

		The characterization of the Tsar is a fine piece of work , although his figure is given some - thing more of romantic coloring than the facts will warrant , and the series of plots and intrigues whereby his imperial will is thwarted and the lovers find the happiness that they deserve is devised with much ingenuity .

		The story is a clean and wholesome example of the sort of historical romance so much in vogue at present , and seems to us even better than its predecessor .

		The American short story seems to be increasingly given to studies in `` local color . ''

		Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, indeed , one of our adepts in the art of short-story telling , frankly styles his latest collection `` Outlines in Local Color . ''

		The locality is , of course , the city of
New York	LOCATION	, and a dozen of the minor phases of its multifarious life are deftly pic - tured for us .

		We were a little startled when , open - ing the volume at random , we came upon the following remark : '' I could not stand the vulgarity of the Dial .

		I 'm an old woman now , and I 've seen a good deal of the world , but the Dial was too much for me .

		It seemed to be written down to the taste of the half-naked inhabitants of an African kraal . ''

		But it soon appeared that the sheet thus referred to was the
New York	LOCATION	'' Journal '' in an unhappily ehosen disguise , and our feelings were relieved .

		These sketches by Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	are extremely slight affairs , but they impress one with their truth - fulness , their fine sentiment , and the artistic quality of their style .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's ''
Lin McLean	PERSON	, '' although ostensibly a collection of short stories , is in reality a continuous narrative , having for its central figure a cowboy , and for its incidents a series of episodes in his free , impulsive , and checkered existence .

		It presents to us a vividly conceived and loveable per - son , whose native refinement of character is not concealed either by his swaggering mien or his illiterate speech .

		He is a '' type '' in the artistic sense of that much-abused term , and he is drawn for us with knowledge and generous sympathy .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's book has both humor and pathos ; both are dry , but for that reason none the less effective , and our only wish is that the volume were twice as thick .

		Back to the
East	LOCATION	the provincial East this time we go with
Miss Eliza Orne White	PERSON	, who has pro- duced a volume of bright stories dealing with the social types and incidents of the
New England	LOCATION	vil - lage .

		They are not very sober sketches , any of them , and the minute study of her subjects has not prevented the writer from being broadly human , or from working a vein of quiet humor that seems to be a distinctive part of her nature . ''

		A
Browning Courtship	ORGANIZATION	'' is very amusing indeed , and '' A
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck Dinner '' hardly less so .

		We may commend the stories for entertainment , at least , if not for any - thing more serious .

		Humor , also , is not lacking in Miss Alice French 's collection of seven stories styled '' A Book of True Lovers , '' but there is besides a touch of pathos some - thing deeper than Miss White offers her readers .

		Again we are in the West , the meridian of
Iowa	LOCATION	and of
Arkansas	LOCATION	, in the region and among the people of whom the author has so often written so lovingly , and whose homely ways she describes with so much insight into human nature . ''

		Sir Guy the Neuter , '' which is a story of sixteenth century En - gland , offers the one exception to the above char - acterization , and seems rather out of place in the book , although it , too , is concerned with true lovers .

		The other six stories are of a piece in more respects than this , and exhibit a much more complete mas - tery of their material .

		Again we bring the name of Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	into this review , for the purpose of saying a word or two of the charming qualities of the bits of romantic fiction which he has entitled , without the least ap - parent reason , '' The Mystery of Choice . ''

		Perhaps 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, it is because of the mystery which hangs over most of these stories , leaving one greatly in douht as to what has really happened , and free to choose almost any interpretation that he pleases .

		Certainly the charm of these sketches is as elusive as it is undeni - able , for the most matter-of-fact incidents are invested with an atmosphere of nebulous romance , and the reader must often plunge without a mo - ment 's warning from every-day actuality into a world of poetical and frequently uncanny imagin - ings .

		It is so different an aspect of the author 's talent from that presented by his romances of mod - ern French history that it is difficult to believe the same pen at work in the two cases .

		Some , at least , of the stories comprised within Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	's new volume have already appeared in the magazines , where they attracted marked attention by their delicacy of manner and subtlety of analysis .

		They seem at times over - subtle , indeed , and suggestive of the attitude of pre - ciosity , although the writer makes a brave effort to seem careless and colloquial .

		Their essential pre - occupation is art , although it is the art of life quite as much as the art that is practised in studios , for life offers material no less plastic than clay in hands of the proper deftness .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	has thus far produced only literary figurines , but they are skil - fully modelled , and not without strength as well as S race <
WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Some American President
Eliot	PERSON	's book entitled '' Am - contributions erican Contributions to Civilization '' to civilization .

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of occa - sional addresses and magazine articles , mostly bear - ing on political and social questions .

		One of the most typical , the one which gives the collection its name , is the first , '' Five American Contributions to Civilization . ''

		The five contributions in question are , an advance towards the abandonment of war , religious toleration , universal suffrage , the absorp - tion of many races , the diffusion of material well - being .

		Of course in making these contributions to civilization ,
America	LOCATION	has been greatly aided by good fortune .

		The wide
Atlantic	LOCATION	has kept us from con - tact with European rivalries and ambitions , and so we have been able to avoid wars .

		The other lines of development have come naturally from the posi - tion of a new people in a new land .

		So , in fact , President
Eliot	PERSON	might have attributed quite as much to these favorable circumstances as to our especial merit .

		He commends President
Monroe	PERSON	for his declaration of
1823	DATE	. ''

		This announcement was designed to prevent the introduction on the
Ameri	PERSON	- can continent of the horrible European system with its balance of power , its alliances , offensive and defensive , in opposing groups , and its perpetual armaments on an enormous scale . ''

		After reading this luminous exposition of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, one may perhaps be permitted to wonder that the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	president fails to see that the extension of the system of European colonies this side the ocean the Africanization of
South America	LOCATION	will surely bring upon us the very state of things which
Monroe	ORGANIZATION	aimed to prevent .

		But the Cleveland-Olney policy as to
Venezuela	LOCATION	and the maintaining of a strong navy Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	strenuously deprecates .

		In fact , it is clear enough that they are two things which will keep us from the necessity of militarism on a large scale a necessity which some day will be on us if the western world is filled up with the colonies of the great military nations .

		Fugitive papers and addresses are hard to keep alive .

		Those in the present volume will hardly form a permanent addi - tion to literature .

		But nevertheless they are worth reading and that , after all , in these days , is high praise for any book .

		The great English astronomer , Prof. The dawn of T XT T i L Astronomy .

		J -
Norman Lockyer	PERSON	, has given us a study of the temple-worship and mythology of the ancient Egyptians , in a work entitled '' The Dawn of Astronomy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a happy contribution to the sciences of myth - ology , comparative religion , and early civilizations .

		Dr.
Lockyer	PERSON	visited the land of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	and ex - amined for himself the temples of the gods ; he has searched widely in literature for the latest light on early astronomy , and has found it all in the alembic of his own trained mind .

		While visiting
Greece	LOCATION	a few years ago , he was struck with the orientation of the great temples .

		It occurred to him that pos - sibly they owed their positions to the founders ' ideas of the heavens .

		This thought he carried to
Egypt	LOCATION	, and applied it to the solution of the orientation of the scores of temples scattered over that land .

		Each temple was so built that a ray of light , sun , moon , or star , entering at the front could pierce into the most holy place .

		He soon discovered that some of the temples at Karnek are oriented to the sun-rising or to the sun-setting at the solstices .

		The temples at
Gizeh	ORGANIZATION	are oriented to the sun-rising and setting at the equinoxes .

		In fact , the temples of
Egypt	LOCATION	were the first astronomical observatories in the world .

		The temple at
Denderah	ORGANIZATION	is ornamented with some remarkable astronomical representations .

		It is evident from these and other points that the solstices were recognized in
Egypt	LOCATION	as early as 5000 B. C .

		In fact , such an instrument as the temple was scientific in its ability to determine with accu - racy the length of the year , provided the observa - tions continued for some period of time .

		Besides the sun-temples , there were star-temples , oriented so that at a specified time a given star could penetrate the long avenue of the temple and flash its light into the sanctuary at the farther end .

		The author names -LRB- on pp. 306-14 -RRB- eight stars to which , alto - gether , forty-two temples had been oriented .

		Of course , this must be determined -LRB- 1 -RRB- by the date of the construction of the temple as nearly as can be learned from inscriptions , -LRB- 2 -RRB- by the astronomical
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 83 on things in general .

		calculations of the location of the star at that period .

		Astronomer and archaeologist together can thus locate with great accuracy the age of a temple .

		It is ascertained as a fact that some of the stars were observed as early as 5000 B. C .

		These facts lead to the conclusion that the temples of
Upper Egypt	LOCATION	mark an age earlier than those in and near the
delta	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
Egypt	LOCATION	, the Greeks borrowed the same method of temple-orientation .

		While much of the book is technical , it is brimful of interest , with its facts and illustrations .

Lilian Bell	PERSON	is now furnishing the
Western Continent	ORGANIZATION	with her im - pressions of

		There is an originality and a brilliancy about these views that may make some readers desire to read Miss Bell 's '' From a Girl 's Point of View '' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- , even although they have no idea of what the particular topics may be that are viewed from the Point in question .

		For such as hesitate to acquire at random any stray considerations by
Miss Bell	ORGANIZATION	, we will say that the matters girlishly viewed are , for instance , Men as Lovers ,
The Philosophy of Clothes	ORGANIZATION	, Love-making as a Fine Art , Girls and Other Girls , and so forth .

		A broad sympathy may make one desirous , perhaps , of knowing what a girl 's view on these subjects may be .

		We incline to think that it will be more satisfactory to the male reader , at least , to receive an oral exposition of these man - ners from whatever girl he happens to like best .

		Such presentations are not very hard to come by , and are said to be often of considerable interest .

		As for read - ers of the other sex , the younger ones will like this book , for it is always nice to see one 's own ideas in print ; those past their first youth , however , will probably wish to avoid it as anyone avoids the recollection of any follies of earlier days .

		We fear that no one will believe that we can really appre - ciate better than Miss Bell so delicate a matter as a girlish view of love or clothes .

		We shall not , there - fore , attempt to say whether the ideas of this book are or are not really from a girl 's point of view .

		One thing we will venture to note .

		A characteristic element of girlhood -LRB- as of boyhood -RRB- is the appreci - ation of various matters very commonly and widely known , with the firm idea that they are now appre - ciated for the first time .

		This feeling is to be per - ceived in many of the remarks of Miss Bell , and we congratulate her on having herein so entirely assumed the position she had in mind .

		An vp-to-daie Theology .

		Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	's '' Theology of an Evolutionist '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- carries the distinction of being thoroughly up to date .

		It is primarily based on Professor Le
Conte	ORGANIZATION	's definition of evolution : '' A continuous pro- gressive change , according to certain laws , and by means of resident forces . ''

		This little volume -LRB- of 191 pages -RRB- discusses only specific questions in the - ology ; some of these are , '' Creation by Evolution , '' '' Genesis of Sin , '' '' Evolution of Revelation , '' '' Place of Christ in Evolution , '' '' Redemption by Evolution , '' '' Evolution and Sacrifice , Propitiation , Miracles , and Immortality . ''

		These lectures are , in the main , a popularization and condensation of the latest utterances of Le Conte ,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Romanes	PERSON	, and
Drummond	PERSON	, on the relations of evolution and Christianity .

		At the outset , the author acknowl - edges that he is a radical , but at the same time a theistic evolutionist , who holds that religion '' is better comprehended , and will better be promoted , by the philosophy which regards all life as divine , and God 's way of doing things as the way of a con - tinuous progressive change , according to certain laws and by means of one resident force , '' and that , God -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- .

		The application of the principles of evolution to the doctrines of theology is the real point at issue .

		In the first lecture , '' Creation by Evolution '' was , if the author 's reasoning holds , simply an initial dualism , where God and matter were two separate existences , combined only when matter began to revolve -LRB- p. 25 -RRB- .

		The lecture on '' The Genesis of Sin '' results in a non-committal statement by the author -LRB- p. 39 -RRB- , who says , never - theless , that '' every sin is a falling back into the animal condition '' -LRB- p. 49 -RRB- .

		In the lecture on the '' Place of Christ in Evolution '' the author adopts a kind of pantheism or monism -LRB- or is it dualism ?

		cf. p. 25 -RRB- , when he says , '' All life is God ; all force is God '' -LRB- p. 76 -RRB- .

		The whole discussion , though very readable , and plain as a rule , yet suffers from con - densation .

		The vital problems the genesis of matter , of the moral nature , of sin , of Christ are no clearer at the conclusion of Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's book .

		Other questions named in the contents acquire a newer and richer meaning at his hand .

		Collections of epigrams should not k 6 read aU at one time ' One cock ' tail or a taste of caviare is very nice , but you can not make a meal off either .

		Too many leave a bad taste .

		Mr.
F. W. Morton	PERSON	's compilation of '' Men in Epigram '' -LRB- `` McClurg -RRB- is an interesting book , and a useful book too , in a way .

		Useful , we mean , to people who want epigrams ; for there is a double index , of subjects and of authors , so that one may easily get epigrams on the matter in hand or by the author in question .

		Interesting it is , too , or amusing if yon will , because you may pick it up a dozen times a day and always find something new and smart .

		If , however , you read much of it at a time , you not only become quickly satiated , but you come right up against this curious question : Why is it so much easier to say a disagreeable clever thing than one that is agreeable ?

		Epigrams , as a rule , call attention to some folly , weakness , or failing .

		It is a great man who can make a clever comment on his kind that will lead you to think better of it .

		This book makes one rather ashamed of the species : if the epigrams be true , men are but poor things ; if they be false , the case is not much better , for what 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, a pitiful spirit is shown in this affected knowledge of life and affected smartness and affected doubt of goodness .

		A book of epigrams is a most valuable commentary on the principle of realism .

		Every - thing may be true by itself alone , but the whole book is something of a falsity . ''

		A man of maxims only , '' says
Coleridge	PERSON	, on page 213 , '' is like a Cy - clops with only one eye , and that eye in the back of his head . ''

		Let us fortify ourselves with this con - solation , and we may for the moment smile even at La Rouchefoucauld .

		There is an immense amount of ma - '' Song-tore . ''

		terial in Mr.
Adair Fitz-Gerald	PERSON	's `` Stories of Famous Songs '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- , although , as would be inferred from the title , it is presented in an easy and unconstrained fashion , and without much attempt at infusing order into what comes near being a chaos .

		To tell the truth , the subject of Famous Songs is hardly one with any really organic unity to be developed .

		It drifts on one side into a study of Ballad-poetry , which to-day is almost one of the learned professions ; on another it touches and overlaps parts of the history of Music and Literature ; and on another it becomes a sec - tion of what Stendhal would have called Folk - psychology , if such a matter still exist .

		From none of those points of view , however , does Mr.
Fitz-Gerald	PERSON	contemplate the topic ; indeed , his work makes no claim to be a scientific treatise .

		He has for a long time collected material concerning well-known songs , and now orders it according to the simple and ex - cellent method of putting together those songs which seemed to him to be more or less connected .

		It is an interesting book to run through , and probably may also be of use as a book of reference , although the author often seems rather lenient in selecting authorities .

		It is very comprehensive ; several times we thought that something important had been omitted , but sooner or later we came upon the object of search .

		It is always pleasant to read about old favorites , and here , as one turns the page , hundreds of half-forgotten melodies run through the mind and give pleasure additional . ''

		My true intent is all for your delight , '' says the author ; and we think that he may congratulate himself on a very fair measure of success .

		Sebastian Cabot appears to have had a better fortune than most men who have attempted to masquerade in the merits of others .

		Even as late as
1894	DATE	he was given the chief credit , in so authoritative a work as the
Histoire Generate of Lavisse	ORGANIZATION	and Ram - baud , for the discovery of
North America	LOCATION	, especially through the voyage of
1498	DATE	.

		But during the last few years a more careful examination of documents long known , and of those recently unearthed , has led historians like
Henry Harrisse	PERSON	to regard
Sebas	PERSON	- tian as little better than an impostor , appropriating his father 's work as his own .

		Nearly all the evi - dence in the case is to be found in Mr.
G. E. Weare	PERSON	's volume on ''
Cabot	PERSON	's Discovery of
North America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Weare	PERSON	prints the original docu - ments , with translations , accompanied by the com - ments of other writers .

		His book is therefore particularly valuable to students .

		He is unhappily inclined to leave the general reader to wander about among these '' sources '' with very little in the way of consecutive guidance .

		Although less polemic than
Harrisse	PERSON	, he is evidently as ready to deprive Sebastian of his stolen honors , and to return them to the real discoverer ,
John Cabot	PERSON	.

		Literary and other statesmen .

		In his sheaf of essays in literary criticism entitled '' Literary States - men and Others '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	gives us some clever and suggestive appreciations of Messrs.
John Mor	PERSON	- ley ,
Balf	PERSON	our , and
Henry James	PERSON	.

		Other and slighter papers treat of
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	,
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	, Me ` rime'e , American Art Criticism , and
American Cosmopol	ORGANIZATION	- itanism .

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	's touch is light and true , and his perception of the subtler individualities of style and method is keen .

		His essay on
John Morley	PERSON	is a really clear-cut and effective piece of criticism .

		In one or two points , however , we are inclined to differ with Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	as to Mr.
Morley	PERSON	for instance , when he says that Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's '' princi - ples '' are '' not set in a style of distinction , but rather in one soured by moralism and dessicated by science . ''

		There is a certain leaven or nuance of truth in the stricture ; but it is certainly too sweeping .

		Perhaps a re-reading of , say , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's eloquent introduction to his ''
Voltaire	PERSON	, '' or of his essay on
Condorcet	LOCATION	, would lead Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	to qualify his judgment .

		The publishers have issued this volume in their usual tasteful style .

		Colonel

		citizens have long known him as an amiable man and a first-rate admin - istrator .

		A dainty booklet entitled `` Whip and Spur '' -LRB-

		Should they avail themselves of this chance they will not regret it , since
Colonel Waring	ORGANIZATION	shows conclusively that in addition to his genius for street-cleaning he has a very pretty talent for story-telling .

		In this little book he tells the stories and fondly paints the characters of horses that he has owned '' Vix , '' '' Ruby , '' Wellstein , '' ''
Max	PERSON	, '' and so on , and recounts incidentally some campaigning experiences , amusing , pathetic , and exciting .

		There is a closing chapter on '' Fox-Hunting in

		THE DIAL 85 A new edition their social , industrial , commercial , and political aspects .

		Man rather than nature is the author 's theme .

		The '' uprising of
1895	DATE	'' receives more attention than an eruption of
Kilauea	LOCATION	, and the con - trasted civilizations of the Occident and Orient ex - cite more interest than the changing panorama of tropical verdure , mountain , and sea , in this Para - dise of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Politically speaking , the title belongs in the realm of prophecy ; but the history of recent events , of the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment and vicissitudes of the repub - lic , is told with vividness and fulness .

		In this par - ticular the book supplements the earlier work of
Jarvis	PERSON	and
Alexander	PERSON	, though it lacks somewhat of their judicial candor and scholarly discrimination .

		The illustrations are abundant , and as a rule are well chosen .

		The centenary of the death of
James Macpherson	PERSON	is fitly commemorated by the publication of a handsome new edition of the '' Poems of Ossian , '' from the press of Messrs.
Patrick Geddes	PERSON	& Colleagues of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		In addition to a brief Introduction and notes by Mr.
William Sharp	PERSON	, the volume contains the notes of
Macpherson	PERSON	, and also of
Hugh Campbell	PERSON	, editor of the edition of
1822	DATE	.

		In his Introduction Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	makes a careful review of the famous '' Os - sianic Controversy , '' and sums up the evidence in the case as follows : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB-
Macpherson	PERSON	's '
Ossian	PERSON	' is not a genuine rendering of ancient originals ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- he worked incoherently upon a genuine but un - systematised , unsifted , and fragmentary basis , with - out which he could have achieved nothing ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- inherent evidence disproves
Macpherson	PERSON	's sole or even main authorship as well as
Ossian	PERSON	's , and that he was at most no more than a skilful artificer . ''

		Mr. Sharp further adds that '' if
Macpherson	PERSON	were the sole author , he would be one of the few poetic creators of the first rank , and worthy of all possible honour '' ; and also , `` no single work in our litera - ture has had so wide-reaching , so potent , and so enduring an influence . ''

		Mechanically , this new edition is entirely satisfactory , and should find great favor with all lovers of these heroic fragments .

		In his '' Fighting a Fire '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Charles Thaxter Hill	PERSON	gives a graphic account of the life of a metropolitan fireman , based on his own long and close association with the members of the
New York	LOCATION	fire department .

		The book tells how the fire department of a great city is organized , how the men are trained , how fire-alarms are transmitted , etc. , and some space is devoted to the description of the many ingenious appliances of the well-equipped modern engine-house .

		Every branch of the service is explained , including '' The Floating Fire-Engines , '' `` The Fire Patrol , '' '' The School for Firemen , '' etc. , and there are a number of good stories illustrative of firemen and their ways and of the peculiar perils they are called on to encounter .

		The book contains some thirty spirited pictures by the author .

		The booklet with this title , translated from the French of
Arsene Darmester	PERSON	-LRB-

		The uninterrupted work of Judaism from
Ezra	LOCATION	to the
sixth century	DATE	of the Christian era , a period of a thousand years , is gathered within the bounds of
The Talmud	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a most unpromising volume from the typographical point of view , the
Whitaker & Ray Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	have put forth `` The Complete Poetical Works of
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	. ''

		This is Mr.
Miller	PERSON	's definitive edition of his work , and , as such , must have a place in every library of American poetry .

		Even now , '' he says , '' after all my cutting and care , I am far from satisfied , and can com - mend to my lovers only the few last poems in the book . ''

		These pages contain a garrulous mixture of autobiog - raphy and didacticism , interesting to read , and extremely characteristic of their author .

		The new edition of '' The Spectator , '' which Messrs.

G. Gregory Smith	PERSON	. ''

		The main intention of these volumes is to preserve the orig - inal freshness of the text , to reject , in the words of old

Feb. 1	DATE	, ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
Jan. 15 , 1898	DATE	.

		Naturally , at the opening of a new year , the hope which '' springs eternal in the human breast '' finds its best definition by the experience of what has already touched us , and by our reflection on that experience .

		In this way we make resolutions and delude ourselves into a belief that what we wish will happen .

		The last year has not been altogether a pleasant one for those who dig and delve in the land of literature .

		If to a few it has brought the fulfilment of promise , to a great many more , on the other hand , it has denied this .

		Reputations have come and gone .

		Two years ago the air was resonant of the praise for newly discovered geniuses .

		Poets abounded in every garret of
New Grub	LOCATION	street , and the welkin rang with snouts for
John Davidson	PERSON	,
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	,
William Watson	PERSON	,
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, and the rest .

		Vigo street and the
Head of Bodley	ORGANIZATION	were having their innings .

		There were '' jawblings '' and '' jucundings , '' and the '' Yallerbock '' was at large .

		But the year just ended has brought a change .

		We have had our fun , and now we are meditating on the foolishness of it all .

		It has been a time of quiet , on the whole ; and it is , perhaps , well that it was so .

		It has enabled us to devote a little space to some high thinking on the works of such men as
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	; for the biographies of these two fine workers , if they can not rank as great literature , yet furnish us with a storehouse of sugges - tions .

		We have had no new
Boswell	PERSON	, but that does not much matter , since we do not often get a
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	.

		Without a doubt , the Boswellian spirit is dead , and the days of hero-worship gone .

		He who now has the ability to appreciate greatness and to express that appreciation , believes himself to merit a
Boswell	PERSON	on his own account .

		And so the days go by with their quota of novels and verses ; and the biographic art is lost .

		In history also we can not boast much .

		Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- diner 's further contribution on the seventeenth century , and Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	's final addition to his '' His - tory of Our Own Times , '' make no great display .

		The only book of travels of any true literary value was Miss
Kingsley	PERSON	's ''
West Africa	LOCATION	, '' and this in spite of the tre - mendous Nansen pother .

		We thought that in poetry , surely , this year would be prolific and possibly strong .

		But we look in vain in Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's volume , or in Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's '' Hope of the World , '' or in Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's '' New Poems , '' for any sign that the flame is burning .

		No ; the year just ended must , without question , be called the year of the novelist .

		He has reaped a rich harvest both of money and fame .

		Whatever may be thought of the sensational writers or the problem solvers , they have certainly furnished much matter for talk and much '' copy '' for critics .

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	and Mrs. Grand and ''
George Egerton	PERSON	'' have earned well of that society which feels itself impelled to '' save '' mankind ; and it must be confessed , if appreciation is to be measured by large sales , these writers have been excellently well served .

		But apart from these , the year is distinguished for
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's '' St.
Ives	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's '' Well-Beloved , '' Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's Da - riel , '' Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' Captains Courageous , '' Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's `` What Masie Knew , ''
Ouida	PERSON	's `` The
Massa	PERSON	- renes , '' Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's The Invisible Man , '' Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	's '' Water of the Wondrous Isles , '' Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's '' Phroso , '' and Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's ''
Uncle Bernac	PERSON	. ''

		Here we see the explanation for the forgetting of the arts of writing history or biography .

		The gay play of the imagination finds fuller freedom and a more joyous existence in the kingdom of fiction ; so that we find writ - ers , whose style truly fit them for the office of historian or biographer , heavily weighting their fancy with the cumbrous phrases of character analyses , and the strained developments of intricate circumstances .

		They are , in reality , writing contemporary history ; only they often include that which is not in life , or , if they deal with life , they forget to picture the other side .

		But the criticism should be , not so much against the writers of fiction , as against the conditions which enable them to flourish .

		The transfiguration of life either in the form of romance or of poetry must always appeal to us strongly . ''

		We look before and after , and pine for what is not . ''

		Romance and poetry serve to feed healthily this primal instinct of our natures .

		But the presentation of social problems and physiological theo - ries belongs not to fiction but to sociology and medicine .

		Our scientific researches and discoveries have overlapped our aesthetic taste , and we are fast erasing the lines which separate the arts .

		I have given so much space to retrospective matter that I can only touch on a few of the promises of the new year .

		As yet , however , there are few that call for mention .

		There is to be issued shortly a great book on the
Yukon Territory	ORGANIZATION	, giving the American and
Cana	LOCATION	- dian points of view ; the former to be stated by Mr.
W. Dall	PERSON	, a gentleman sent out officially years ago , to report on the district .

		I am glad to learn that the edition-de-luxe of Lever 's novels , about which I have already written to you , is to be published on your side of the water by
Messrs. Roberts Brothers of Boston	ORGANIZATION	.

		As it would be unfair for you to take all our good things , a publisher in
London	LOCATION	is to issue a small edition of the magnificent Wormeley '' Balzac '' which
Boston	LOCATION	had the enterprise and good taste to achieve .

		Thus we take a good thing from you .

		The trouble about booksellers and discounts is not yet over .

		To the report of the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, a leading bookseller of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, Mr.
Robert Maclehose	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, has furnished a convincing reply .

		It may be news to you , and if it is it will be strange news , to hear that a bookseller , in this country , to make a profit of
$ 850	MONEY	per annum has to accomplish a net turnover of
$ 52,500	MONEY	; while on a net turnover of
$ 30,000	MONEY	, there would be a loss of
$ 100	MONEY	!

		Yet this , Mr.
Maclehose	PERSON	proved some time ago .

		Of course , the action of the Society in re - jecting the proposals made by the Publishers and Book - sellers ' Associations can not affect the result .

		But at present the question is held over .

		To the few here who have a copy of Mr.
Growoll	PERSON	's book , '' American Book Clubs , '' the volume is a great delight and a source of much interest .

		It is an exceed - ingly able contribution to bibliography , and I congratu - late Mr.

Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are now the publishers .

		The Kashmirian birch-bark manuscript of the A t h arva -
Veda	LOCATION	is one of the most precious Oriental documents in existence .

		It was brought to light in
1875	DATE	by the re - searches of Professor
Rudolph von Roth	PERSON	, who guarded it until his recent death , when it passed into the posses - sion of
the University of Tuebingen	ORGANIZATION	.

		It consists of 287 leaves , written on both sides , with dimensions of 20 x 25 cm .

		Professor
Maurice Bloomfield	PERSON	is about to prepare a photographic reproduction of this manuscript , and in - vites subscriptions at
twenty-five dollars	MONEY	for the pro- posed edition of two hundred copies .

		Mr.
N. Murray	PERSON	,
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, will receive applications for the work .

		The publishing section of the American Library As - sociation has at last got well under way with a long - projected plan for cataloguing the contents of current periodicals of the more serious sort .

		The work is made possible by the initiative of five of the largest libraries in the country , but it needs a great deal more coopera - tion than has yet been secured to ensure its success upon a scale as large as is desirable .

		The beginning now made takes the form of an arrangement for print - ing catalogue cards , indexing the contents of 184 peri - odicals and proceedings of learned societies , and supply - ing these cards either in full sets or in selections to libraries that may wish to subscribe .

		The undertaking is one of the greatest importance , and deserves every encouragement .

		The plan permits of indefinite exten - sion , and its value will increase in a far greater ratio than that of the increase in subscriptions .

		It is the duty of every large library in the country to further this en - terprise by making use of the cards and by assuming some share , however small , of the work of preparation .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum , '' celebrating on the first of
January	DATE	its seventieth birthday , seized the occasion as a pretext for an extremely interesting retrospective re - view .

		The history of the paper has been one of remark - able unity and consistency , owing to the fact that since the
third year	DATE	of its existence it has been owned by successive members of the same family , holding to the same literary and ethical principles .

		It did yeoman work in its early years in fighting to the death '' the dragon of trade criticism , '' and it proudly boasts that it has ever remained independent of publishing and log - rolling influences , that it has never succumbed to the vicious practices of puffery , or `` smart '' writing , or sensational enterprise .

		The most interesting feature of this retrospective article is provided by the extracts from early files of the paper which serve to show that the '' Athenaeum , '' in its contemporary judgments upon such men as
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Moore	PERSON	, expressed substantially the opinions that are now universally accepted .

		We congratulate our English contemporary upon its years , its record for honest dealing , and its proud preeminence among its rivals living or dead .

		Only the possessor of a powerful memory can win and hold a chief position in the world of work .

		Among the many features which contribute to the general excellence of the book a few may be briefly mentioned as follows : More and better Illustrations and Maps than have ever appeared in any text-book on the subject .

		Carefully selected lists of books for supplementary reading .

		Suggestive questions for pupils to discuss .

		Introductory chapter of hints to teachers , illuminating the author 's method of treatment .

		Notes throughout the text explanatory of general state - ments .

		TO THE TEACHER .

		-LRB- Extract . -RRB-

		The Recitation .

		The purposes of the recitation should include more than a test of memory : they should include a comparison and discussion of facts acquired in the preparation of the lesson .

		At the beginning of the recitation a topic should be named and the pupil required to recite upon it without question or comment from the teacher .

		Such a method , if persisted in , will inevitably develope flu - ency and readiness of expression .

		Teachers ask too many questions questions that seriously interfere with the flow of thought and with its free expression .

		Such interference is without doubt the most serious defect of the average recitation .

		The best work lies in help - ing the pupil to get definite ideas and then to give these ideas clear expression in well-connected sentences .

		He will thus acquire more available knowledge and better mental training through the acquisi - tion of this knowledge .

		In other words , the language faculty and the logical faculty will each receive good training .

		Special stress laid upon the industrial and social develop - ment , with a lucid presentation of the powerful influence exerted by routes and modes of travel , soil , and climate .

		Prominence given to the characteristics of our great national leaders .

		Emphasis of the importance of the West and South in our national development .

		Pupils are led throughout to form high ideals of social duty .

		In spite of the fact that the last few years have witnessed the appearance of numerous works on Psychology , there still exists a need for a clear , concise , elementary , yet scholarly volume , adapted to classroom use in our higher institutions of learning , colleges , and normal schools .

		Dr.
Ladd	PERSON	, who has won an international reputation by his many-sided ability as author and teacher , at the request of many friends has written a brief but thorough text-book of Psychology to meet the demands of the present situation .

		The unprecedented success of Professor
Ladd	PERSON	's more advanced books , and of his `` Primer of Psychology , '' insures widespread popularity for this opportune addition to the apparatus of psychological study .

		126 A TALE OF TWO CITIES .

		One of the most interesting as well as hopeful developments in the history of American public education is that offered by the schools of
New York City	LOCATION	under the enlightened regime of the past three years .

		Not so very long ago , the case of the public schools in the greatest of American cities seemed well-nigh hopeless .

		The inadequate provisions made for their sup - port , the dull routine into which their adminis - tration had fallen , the baleful influences of the pettiest sort of politics , and the seeming lack of public interest in the institution which should be the chief civic pride of every democratic community these were the causes that com - bined to make of the
New York	LOCATION	system a by - word in educational discussion , to teach the educator that the work done in almost any inland city of moderate size was more likely to yield methods deserving of imitation and praise than the work done in the metropolitan city of the continent .

		Teachers might look for inspi - ration to
Cleveland	LOCATION	or
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, even to
Peoria	LOCATION	or
Kansas City	LOCATION	, with some reasonable prospect of finding it ; to expect inspiration from the city of
New York	LOCATION	was only to suffer the most complete disillusionment .

		How these conditions have been changed under the reform administration of the past three years is a tale familiar enough to the few who make a business of keeping track of edu - cational movements , but to the many whose interest in education is general rather than pro- fessional the facts are as yet little known .

		They are set forth in summarized form by the editor of '' The Educational Review '' in the
January	DATE	issue of that invaluable periodical , and we make no apology for calling them to the attention of our readers . ''

		Three years ago
New York	LOCATION	was governed by an antiquated and cumbrous school law .

		Divided respon - sibility , wheels within wheels , and a series of political catch-basins made the schools a splendid drill ground for inefficiency , jobbery , and personal ` pulls . '

		No administrative reform was possible until this system was abolished .

		To abolish it required not only a legis - lative enactment , but the support and approval of Mayor Strong .

		Everything that misrepresentation , political influence , and even threats , could do was done to change the Mayor 's purpose .

		But he stood firm , and the reform school bill became a law .

		That , of itself , was a public service of the first magnitude .

		A 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, second service , of equal importance , was performed by the Mayor in the high character and ability of nearly all of his appointments to the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result has been the summoning together of the most earnest , intelligent , and courageous body of men that has ever served the cause of public education in
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		This is the substance of what has been done in three years , largely through the instrumen - tality of the executive , and we doubt if a finer tribute has ever been paid to the retiring mayor of any great American city than is embodied in this richly-deserved praise of Mayor Strong for the performance of the most important part of his official duties .

		When will the American public recognize and take to heart the fact that absolutely nothing else that a mayor has to do is as important as the performance of his duties with relation to public education , that the surest test of a mayor 's deserts is supplied by an examination of that part of his policy which is concerned with the schools of the city which he governs ?

		The summary of Dr.
Butler	PERSON	from which we have already quoted proceeds to specify , under fifteen heads , the distinctive achievements of three years of enlightened educational admin - istration in
New York	LOCATION	.

		All of these achieve - ments are important , but three or four of them so overshadow the others that they must have nearly all of the space that we can give to the discussion .

		For this reason , we merely note in passing the extension of the kindergarten sys - tem , the establishment of truant and vacation schools , the preparation of a scientific course of study , the plans adopted for protection against contagious diseases , the reorganization of the study of music , and the introduction of manual training into all the schools .

		Important as these things all are , they are less deserving of our admiration than the work that has been done for secondary education , the ample pro- vision of new buildings , and the framing of a schedule of salaries that is at once rational and generous .

		It is because these three mat - ters are those which most press for attention in
Chicago	LOCATION	, besides being of the greatest intrinsic importance , that our remarks are entitled '' A Tale of Two Cities , '' and that we have sought to draw a lesson from the example of our East - ern neighbors .

		The establishment of a series of high schools of the best modern type in
New York	LOCATION	removes the chief reproach under which that munici - pality has hitherto suffered .

		It has at last supplied itself with what every self-respecting civilized town having one per cent of the pop - ulation of
New York	LOCATION	has always regarded as a prime necessity of the public school system .

		And not only have these schools been estab - lished , but they have been so generously pro- vided for that they have been able to secure the services of able and experienced faculties , and may reasonably be expected to do the work proper to high schools in an efficient way .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	, on the other hand , although the high schools have for forty years been a part of the educational system , they have tended to suffer more and more of late years from a newspaper criticism either ignorant or malicious , or both , which has resulted in the formation of a con - siderable body of public opinion either adverse to them altogether , or willing to accord them only a grudging support .

		The inducements which they offer to trained educators are much less than were offered
twenty years ago	DATE	, whereas the inducements offered in all other departments of the system have been materially increased during the period in question .

		The result has been the only possible one : the men of the type most needed in the high schools have left them , attracted by the larger inducements offered elsewhere , the general character of the work has declined , and the teaching force in the lower schools , which is mainly recruited from the young women who get their education in the secondary schools , has suffered to an extent not easily to be measured , but none the less unquestionable .

		The bare fact that an educator in the high schools of
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	may receive a salary fifty per cent higher than is paid him in
Chicago	LOCATION	carries its own implica - tion .

		It seems a sordid way of looking at the situation , but the view is one that must be reckoned with .

		The question of salaries is , after all , one of the fundamental questions of educational ad - ministration , and the efficiency of any system must depend largely upon the way in which this question is settled .

		It is not solely a ques - tion of liberality , although in education , as else - where , it is possible to preach such effective sermons on '' The Economy of High Wages '' as we find , for example , in the last ''
Educa	PERSON	- tional Review . ''

		But quite as important as mere liberality , is the adoption of some rational plan for promotion , some plan which shall make it an object for teachers to do the best work of which they are capable , some plan which shall insure to merit its due reward and to incom - petency its just reproof .

		The question of the salaries paid to teachers in the lower grades in the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools has been violently agitated
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 103 during the past two months , and the news - papers have day after day devoted columns to its consideration .

		Yet a careful study of all this discussion fails to reveal so much as a sug - gestion that teachers , like other people , should be rewarded according to the value of their work .

		Instead of any well-considered scheme , the old plan of wholesale promotions based upon length of service and nothing else is brought forward , and whoever has anything to say ar - gues either for the plan or against it , without seeming to have the least suspicion that all such plans are in their nature irrational .

		In this matter the example of
New York	LOCATION	is pecu - liarly instructive .

		* ' A new and scientifically adjusted schedule of salaries , founded upon length of service and merit , has been framed .

		This schedule provides an average increase of seven and
one-half per cent	MONEY	on the salary of every teacher now in the public-school system . ''

		It is not easy to classify several thousands of teachers in accordance with their merit , and possibly the
New York	LOCATION	method of doing it is not the best method possible , but the thing must be done somehow , for it involves the most vital problem of city school administration .

		During the last twelve years , bonds have been issued to the amount of thirty-three mil - lions of dollars for the purchase of school sites and the erection of school buildings in the city of
New York	LOCATION	.


Chicago	LOCATION	has issued no bonds for this purpose , since the Constitution of
Illi	PERSON	- nois limits the city indebtedness to an amount long since reached , and all school expenses must be provided for by annual taxation .

		This has made it impossible for the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools to catch up , as those of
New York	LOCATION	have now done , with the growing population , and the expendi - ture for sites and buildings in the former city has been for the same period something like one-third of what it has been in the latter .

		The difficulty here encountered is one which calls for a legislative remedy .

		Since the future may not be mortgaged by an issue of bonds , the annual tax-levy must rise , and the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	is here confronted with a statutory provision which , while allowing a generous levy for school buildings , restricts the levy for other educational purposes to the amount of two per cent of the assessed valuation of taxable prop - erty .

		Since the system of assessment in
Chicago	LOCATION	has fallen into so scandalous a condition that property is listed at an average of less than one-tenth of its real value , the possible educa - tional tax really amounts to less than two mills on the dollar , which is simply not enough to provide proper support for a great metropolitan system of schools .

		The situation in this respect has grown so desperate that a reform of some sort will be forced in the near future , but until
Chicago	LOCATION	can escape from the tangle of consti - tutional and statutory prohibitions that now impede its natural growth it must be content to view with envying admiration the immense work for education that has been accomplished in
New York	LOCATION	, but can not hope for the present to imitate so worthy an example .

		ED UCA TION OF WOMEN IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		The recent agitation at
the University of Cam	ORGANIZATION	- bridge over the admission of women to degrees has again directed the attention of the academic world to a question which has been practically settled in the
United States	LOCATION	, but is still a burning one on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		A brief sketch of the education which
England	ORGANIZATION	provides for its girls and women may therefore be of interest .

		In order to understand the English educational system , it mast be borne in mind that the schools which correspond to our public schools and colleges are the only ones about which it is possible to col - lect any trustworthy statistics .

		The private schools , which educate the daughters of the aristocracy and to a large extent of the upper middle class , must be dismissed with the general observation that they have been very much improved of late years , and that the finishing schools for superficial accomplish - ments have for the most part raised their standards .

		I will first speak briefly of Elementary Educa - tion , which is the education provided by the
Board	ORGANIZATION	and Voluntary schools for the youth of both sexes .

		Without going into a discussion of the complicated English school system , it suffices to say that the Voluntary and
Board	ORGANIZATION	schools are the public schools of
England	LOCATION	in the American sense , and that the Voluntary schools are supported by grants from the royal treasury and by voluntary subscription , the
Board	ORGANIZATION	schools by grants and a school-tax on private property .

		The child may or may not receive religions instruction in both these schools , according to the wish of its parents .

		Co-education scarcely exists in
England	LOCATION	, and the boys and girls are taught in separate classes .

		The curriculum is the same for both sexes , except that sewing is compulsory for girls .

		Reading , writing , and arithmetic are obliga - tory for all , to which some three of the following subjects must be added : English , geography , his - tory , singing , algebra , chemistry , domestic economy , French , cookery .

		The usual school age is from three , when children may enter the infant depart - ment , to thirteen .

		The law allows a child to leave school at eleven , and the half-time system prevails in many places .

		The Higher Grade schools con - tinue the course of instruction to sixteen or even 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, eighteen years , and it is stated that a majority of pupils in these continuation schools are girls .

		This is in brief the education which
England	LOCATION	gives the daughters of the people .

		The Secondary schools are not public in the American sense .

		They are the old endowed schools , like
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and
Harrow	PERSON	, and scores of others less re - nowned .

		The pious founders and benefactors of these schools , in many cases women , made no pro- vision for girls .

		In the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	, when most of these schools were founded , the education of girls was confined to the nunneries , although Miss
Brem	PERSON	- ner , in her recent book entitled '' Education of Women and Girls in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' tries to show that girls were not originally excluded from some of the endowments .

		According to her , they were shut out of the Secondary schools after the Refor - mation , which was unfriendly to female education .

		During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and the first half of the present century , the educa - tion of girls was in the hands of the `` ladies ' schools , '' where they received flimsy instruction in the '' ac - complishments . ''

		In
1865	DATE	a royal commission , ap - pointed to examine boys ' Secondary schools , inquired also into the condition of the girls ' schools .

		The commission reported a lamentable state of affairs in these so-called finishing schools .

		About the time that the report of the commission appeared , several forces began to work toward the raising of the character of girls ' secondary education .

		First among these forces are the
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	local examinations , which , mainly through the efforts of a number of pioneer women , were opened to girls , the
Cambridge	LOCATION	examinations in
1865	DATE	and the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
1870	DATE	.

		The best schools entered into these examinations with enthusiasm , and were soon followed by many others that were obliged to improve their curricula and methods in order to keep the pace .

		The second force that con - tributed to this reformation was the work of the
Endowed Schools Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many of the old endowments that had been diverted from their origi - nal purposes were divided , and a part applied to the founding of girls ' schools .

		Many of the wealthy city companies were induced to spend some of their accumulated funds on the education of girls , and many of the best girls ' schools owe their existence to the generosity of these guilds .

		Almost simultaneously with the beginning of these reforms , several associations of women were formed throughout
England	LOCATION	, whose chief object was the improvement of women 's education .

		The Girls ' Public Day School Company was the outcome of one of these unions .

		This is an interesting example of the application of commercial methods to educa - tion .

		The company has been from the first a pay - ing concern , yielding to its stockholders a yearly dividend of five per cent .

		Profits above this amount are applied to the improvement of the schools .

		The company has thirty-six schools in different parts of the kingdom , which have as head mistresses and teachers excellent women of the new type .

		The buildings and equipment are up to the highest standard .

		The
Church Schools Company	ORGANIZATION	, with definite Church teaching as a part of its constitution , is a similar institution .

		These Public Day schools , or High schools as they are often called , are demo - cratic in their tone , while many of the others are '' class '' schools in the English sense .

		The Ladies ' College at
Cheltenham	ORGANIZATION	, one of the pioneer schools for girls ' secondary education , makes it a point that all pupils shall be daughters of professional men , or those who hold a certain social position .

		The fees of the Public Day schools range from 5 15s to 9 9s , which closes them practically to the lower middle classes .

		For them there is no secondary education beyond what the
Higher Grade Board	ORGANIZATION	schools offer .

		The best girls ' secondary schools prepare for the university colleges , the pupils leav - ing when about eighteen or nineteen years old .

		We come now to
Higher Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		What En - gland is doing in this field for women is of most interest to the foreigner , especially at the present time , when the recent events at
Cambridge	LOCATION	are still fresh in the mind .

		To the casual reader this agitation might give the impression that
England	LOCATION	, like
Germany	LOCATION	, is just awakening to the higher in - tellectual needs of women ; but such is not the case .

		The
Birkbeck Literary	ORGANIZATION	and Scientific Institution , a great evening college in
London	LOCATION	, opened its doors to women in
1833	DATE	, the same year that
Oberlin	ORGANIZATION	sent out from the wilds of
Ohio	LOCATION	its call to young women .

		Fifteen years later , Queen 's College ,
London	LOCATION	, was founded , and was followed the next year by Bed - ford
College	ORGANIZATION	, an undenominational institution .

		Miss
Emily Davies	PERSON	, one of the chief pioneers in the cause , conceived the idea of founding a woman 's college in connection with one of the old universi - ties , and in
1869	DATE	opened a house with six students at
Hitchin	LOCATION	, a country town not far from
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		This was the humble beginning of
Girton College	ORGANIZATION	, which in
1873	DATE	was removed to
Girton	PERSON	, a village near
Cambridge	LOCATION	, from which it takes its name .

		With
Newnham	PERSON	, it is the best known of all the English women 's colleges .

		A visit to
Girton	PERSON	is a part of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	visitor 's programme .

		The college is situated two miles from the town , a wise precaution as its founders thought , but now a serious incon - venience .

		Flies are furnished to convey the stu - dents to and from the university lectures .

		The handsome building of red brick is situated in the midst of ample grounds , large enough for numerous tennis courts and a small golf course .

		The lawns are as carefully kept as the university '' quads . ''

		There are accommodations for one hundred stu - dents , each girl having a study and a small bedroom .

		These little studies present as many aspects as there are different girls .

		The large pieces of furniture provided by the college are supplemented according to the taste of the occupant .

		The tea table is a prominent feature of each apartment .


Girton	PERSON	has had in all 575 students , 370 of whom hold the '' equivalent of a degree . ''

		Among the honor scholars are Miss
Charlotte Scott	PERSON	, who took high rank among

		THE DIAL , 105 the wranglers , and is now professor of mathematics at
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	, and
Miss Ramsay	PERSON	, the first classicist in
1887	DATE	, who afterwards married the
Master of Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, the man who set her questions .


Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	, close by
Cambridge	LOCATION	, was opened in
1871	DATE	by
Miss Cloogh	PERSON	, a sister of the poet
Clough	PERSON	, with six students .

		It has now grown to three halls , with rooms for 158 students .

		Newnham is undenominational , whereas
Girton	PERSON	provides relig - ious services in accordance with the principles of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fees are also less , being seventy-five guineas at
Newnham	ORGANIZATION	and a hun - dred at
Girton	LOCATION	.

		Newnham has also had her share of honors .

		In
1890	DATE	Miss
Philippa Fawcett	PERSON	, daughter of the blind Postmaster-General of
England	LOCATION	, made herself famous by excelling the Senior Wrangler ; and since then
Miss A. M. Johnson	PERSON	was , one year , the only person who passed the highest mathemati - cal examination given by the university .

		The per cent of honors at both
Newnham	LOCATION	and
Girton	PERSON	is fully as high as at the men 's colleges , while the average work of the women is on a higher level than that of the men .

		The two colleges have the same mode of government .

		They are presided over by a princi - pal , assisted by vice-principals , ladies of culture and social position , who do not , as a rule , take part in the instruction .

		Miss
Helen Gladstone	PERSON	, daughter of the ex-premier , was until recently one of the presiding ladies at
Newnham	LOCATION	.

		The colleges under - take to furnish all the instruction necessary in fitting for the university examinations .

		This instruction is given by resident women lecturers and men from the university .

		Eleven out of the seventeen colleges which compose the
University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	admit the women students to their lectures and laboratories .

		What is the relation between the women 's col - leges and the university ?

		An undergraduate is legally a member of the university before he takes his degree .

		The women never become members of the university .

		They have no rights whatever ; the privileges they now enjoy are mere favors granted by courtesy .

		In
1880	DATE	a great effort was made to have the university degrees opened to women .

		The result was the formal permission to women to take the honor examinations .

		Thus they are excluded from the mere pass examinations , which the ma - jority of the men choose .

		In
1887	DATE	the attempt was renewed , and the university refused even to con - sider the question .

		But the women insisted , and in
1896	DATE	the matter came up again .

		The university appointed a committee of fourteen members to investigate the subject and report the next year .

		This is the famous Syndicate whose report stirred up such a hornets ' nest in
Cambridge	LOCATION	circles last year .

		The Syndicate took great pains to gather evi - dence from different sources , and presented a volum - inous report to the
University Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		This report , which was signed by nine of the fourteen members of the Syndicate , was a compromise between the two factions .

		It recommended that the titles of the dif - ferent degrees of the
University	ORGANIZATION	be conferred upon women who had fulfilled the required conditions .

		The word title was of the greatest significance ; women graduates were not to be made members of
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The report called forth a storm of discussion .

		The intensity of `` undergrad '' feeling is shown by the fact that the students condemned the proposal by a vote of
1723	DATE	con to 446 pro .

		The final voting occurred
May 21 , 1897	DATE	.

		Everybody knows the result a refusal by three votes to one , said to be largely the work of country clergymen who flocked to
Cambridge	LOCATION	from all quarters to show their disapproval of this new sign of progress .

		Here it is to be observed that all graduates of the Univer - sity who have taken the degree of Master of Arts compose , ex ~ officiis , the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and have the right to vote on all subjects submitted to that body .

		Among the reasons for refusal , two are prominent :
Cambridge	LOCATION	is a university for men , the admission of women would spoil its unique character , senti - mental reason ; opening the degrees to women would lead eventually to their sharing in the endowments , practical reason .

		As a balm for the wound thus inflicted , a number of prominent opposers have suggested a women 's university with powers to grant specific women 's degrees .

		One proposition is that the existing royal
Holloway College	ORGANIZATION	, at
Egham	LOCATION	, be incorporated as the
Queen Victoria University for Women	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bat the women do not want this ; they wish to enjoy the peculiar advantages of the two great universities .

		They also wish a degree in recognition of their work , and this is all they ask .

		The situation at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is much the same as at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The women have their halls of resi - dence , and are allowed to take the examinations , but the
University	ORGANIZATION	grants them no certificates .

		The proposal to admit women to the
B.A.	LOCATION	degree was brought before the authorities in
1896	DATE	, and rejected by a vote of 215 to 140 .

		The new universities have been more liberal than the two ancient foundations .

		The University of
London	LOCATION	makes no distinction be - tween men and women .


Victoria University	ORGANIZATION	follows the example of
London	LOCATION	.

		Durham excludes women from divinity .

		The
University of Wales	ORGANIZATION	, all the uni - versities of
Scotland	LOCATION	and the
Royal University of Ire	ORGANIZATION	- land grant degrees to women .

		Dublin refuses them .

		Coeducation in
England	LOCATION	deserves a word .

		The Voluntary and
Board	ORGANIZATION	schools separate the boys and girls , and all private schools do the same as a matter of course .

		A very few secondary schools are trying the experiment of coeducation .

		The university col - leges that is , those colleges in different parts of the kingdom which prepare for the
London	LOCATION	,
Durham	LOCATION	, and
Victoria	PERSON	examinations are using the joint - class system .


University College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and a few others , exclude women from the medical department .

		This brief sketch sufficiently shows that
England	LOCATION	has not been illiberal in meeting the demands of women for the higher education .

		Cambridge and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	refuse to share with them , but there are still several institutions in the
United States	LOCATION	which show the same spirit .

		LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a review , by Mr.
R. C. H. Catterall	PERSON	, of the book on '' Industrial Freedom , '' printed in your last issue , I find the following : `` The pleasing assumption that by legislative process we can give to the poor a greater share of the product of capital and labor , while not diminishing the aggregate production , ought to reveal its inherent absurdity in the mere statement . ''

		I suppose I am warranted in assuming that by the term '' the poor '' is here meant , not the pauper nor the chronic unemployed , but the class that economists call the `` proletariat '' ; and I think I can show , if I may , one or two reasons why the inherent absurdity of the pleasing assumption referred to has not yet forced itself upon legislators and others .

		Mr.
Thorold Rogers	PERSON	, in his '' Six Centuries of Work and Wages , '' pays particular attention to a certain law , enacted during the reign of
Edward III.	PERSON	, called the
Statute of Laborers	ORGANIZATION	.

		It remained , we are told , prac - tically a dead letter until the time of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, when the justices in Quarter Session were empowered to fix , at stated periods , the rate of wages in husbandry and the handicrafts .

		This law was enforced , and , in the opinion of Mr.
Thorold Rogers	PERSON	, it was one of the three great causes which induced pauperism in
England	LOCATION	, and brought the laborer down from the position where he could earn a year 's stock of food in fifteen weeks to the position where a year 's labor , Sundays included , would hardly do it .

		Even allowing for Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	's well - known radicalism , it is hardly to be denied , by readers of his book , that the legislative process which resulted in abolishing this method of fixing wages resulted also in giving to the laborer a greater share than before of the product of capital and labor , and , instead of diminishing the aggregate production , actually increased it .

		Legislative process in
England	LOCATION	has also resulted in the freedom of laboring men to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining with their employers ; and there are those who will claim that trades unionism , which has undeniably given the laborer a greater share of the proceeds of industry , has not diminished the aggregate production .

		Finally , if we may -LRB- economically -RRB- class the writers of philosophic books as members of the proletariat , I should like to call attention to certain '' Views Concerning Copyright , '' promulgated by Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, and recently printed in a book called '' Various Fragments , '' issued by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	was then , and apparently is still , of the opinion that the leg - islative process called the Copyright Law has resulted in reducing the prices of such books as his own , and has given to the writers of such books a better return in money for their labors , increasing the aggregate pro- duction at the same time by encouraging philosophers to still more superhuman efforts to get readers .

		Those , therefore , who persist in the `` inherent ab - surdity '' of assuming that legislation may , under certain circumstances , beneficially influence the relations be - tween capitalist and laborer , are not to be harshly con - demned , but gently labored with , to the end that they may abandon the heresies of Mr.
Thorold Rogers	PERSON	and Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		THE
SMITHSONIAN	ORGANIZATION	INSTITUTION .

		* In a noble quarto volume , conceived upon a plan and executed in a method commensurate with its own character and dignity , the
Smith	PERSON	- sonian Institution presents the history of its inception and organization , and of its achieve - ments during the first half-century of its life .

		While engaged in the preparation of this vol - ume , two of its editors in succession , Dr.
James C. Welling	PERSON	, a Regent , and Dr.
G. Brown Goode	PERSON	, Assistant Secretary of the Institution , passed into the silent land ; but the work which one had planned the other so nearly completed that it is issued almost without change as he left the manuscript .

		The thirty chapters which make up the history bear the signatures of leading specialists who have builded their own fame while serving '' in the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men . ''

		In all respects the
Smithsonian Institution	ORGANIZATION	has a peculiar history .


James Smithson	PERSON	, its founder , born in
1765	DATE	, was the son of
Elizabeth Keate Macie	PERSON	, a widow , a kinswoman of the
Duke of Somerset	ORGANIZATION	, through whom she was descended from
Henry Seventh of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		His father ,
Hugh Smithson	PERSON	, failing in his pledges to her , married her cousin ,
Elizabeth Percy	PERSON	, and became the
Duke of Northumber	ORGANIZATION	- land .

		Permission to assume the name of
Smithson	PERSON	was granted to the son by
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment , after the death of his mother .

		He in - herited the most of his property through his mother , from her son by a former marriage .

		The circumstances of his birth were bitterly remembered by
James Smithson	PERSON	.

		He wrote : '' The best blood of
England	LOCATION	flows in my veins .

		On my father 's side I am a
Northumberland	LOCATION	, on my moth - er 's I am related to kings ; but this avails me not .

		My name shall live in the memory of man when the titles of the Northumberlands and the Percys are extinct and forgotten . ''


Smithson	PERSON	was graduated as Master of Arts from
Pembroke College	ORGANIZATION	,

Board of Regents	ORGANIZATION	, charged with the duty of conducting the busi - ness of the Institution .

		This
Board	ORGANIZATION	consists of the Vice-President and the
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	, with three members of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, three of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, and six citizens , no two of whom may be citizens of the same
State	ORGANIZATION	, but two must be residents of the city of Washing - ton .

		The list of those who have served as Regents in the fifty years which have passed includes representative and distinguished men from every section of the nation , and their character is a sufficient explanation of the In - stitution 's success .

		The Regents elect a Secretary and clothe him with authority as their executive officer .

		He is charged with the disbursement of the funds of the Institution , is the custodian of its property , its librarian , and the curator of its museum .

		The office of Secretary of the
Smith	PERSON	- sonian Institution is doubtless the most dis - tinguished and responsible position to which an American scientist may aspire .

		Three persons have occupied this position in the half-century .

		The first Secretary , serving from
1846	DATE	to
1878	DATE	, in fact the organizer of the Institution , was
Joseph Henry	PERSON	.

		Born in
1799	DATE	, Henry be - came first known in
1827	DATE	by investigations 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, which he pursued while a teacher in an academy at
Albany	LOCATION	, N. Y. His first great gift to science was the electro-magnet , made by winding a conducting wire about a core of soft iron , and available at places remote from the source of excitement .

		This discovery , made in
1829	DATE	or
1830	DATE	, was the one step needed to make tele - graphy possible .

		By the consensus of scien - tists , American and foreign ,
Henry	PERSON	was declared to be the one man to whom the organization of the new Institution should be committed .

		In
1850	DATE	,
Spencer Fullerton Baird	PERSON	was appointed to aid
Henry	ORGANIZATION	as Assistant Secretary .

		Henry was distinctively a physicist ;
Baird	PERSON	was a natu - ralist .

		In those days
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was sending numerous parties to explore the but partially known areas which lay between the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	and the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		All such parties were accompanied by naturalists , who returned laden with collections in every scientific specialty , and these collections were by law deposited with the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution for examination , classification , and report .

		For the supervision of this work Professor
Baird	PERSON	was eminently fitted , as was shown in his own work upon the birds of the
United States	LOCATION	, a quarto volume of more than a thousand pages .

		In
1871	DATE	the
Fish Commission	ORGANIZATION	was organized , and Professor
Baird	PERSON	was placed at its head .

		In
1878	DATE	he was elected to succeed Professor
Henry	PERSON	as Secretary .

		Dr.
G. Brown Goode	PERSON	, who had assisted in both offices , was appointed Fish Commissioner , the two offices thus being sepa - rated .

		Through the agency of Professor
Baird	PERSON	, a large part of the scientific material exhibited in
1876	DATE	at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	was transferred to the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		To house this collection properly , a building of large capacity , although not architecturally pretentious , was erected upon a site adjacent to that of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	In - stitution ; and the two enterprises , though nomi - nally distinct , have for some years been under the same management .

		Professor
Baird	PERSON	passed away in
1887	DATE	.

		He had already appointed
Samuel Pierpont Langley	PERSON	, then director of the
Allegheny Observatory	ORGANIZATION	, to be First Assistant Secretary , and during the same year Professor
Langley	PERSON	became the third Secretary of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution .

		Professor
Langley	PERSON	's fame rested chiefly upon the progress which he had made in astrophysical research directed especially to solar phenomena .

		His bolometer , an instrument of infinite deli - cacy , measured the minutest variations of tem - perature by their influence upon an electrical current indicated by a galvanometer .

		To this was added the holograph , which photographi - cally recorded the movements of the galvan - ometer needle .

		By means of this apparatus knowledge of the solar spectrum , and particu - larly of its invisible portions , has been greatly increased .

		Professor
Langley	PERSON	has also studied with great care the phenomena of aerial loco - motion .

		The funds received from the
Smithson	PERSON	estate amounted originally to
$ 550,000	MONEY	.

		By the ad - dition of accrued interest and savings , this sum has been increased to more than
seven hundred thousand dollars	MONEY	.

		Within a few years , dona - tions amounting to more than a quarter of a million dollars have been added directly , so that the sum now lying to the credit of the endow - ment fund , mostly in the treasury of the
United States	LOCATION	, amounts to nearly
one million dollars	MONEY	.

		With the proceeds of this fund the operations of the Institution are mainly supported .

		It has also been the recipient , indirectly , of large na - tional subsidies , and of abundant favors at the hands of railway , steamship , and other corpo - rations , and it has secured the aid of an army of professors and students , who have given freely their labor , looking for no compensation beyond the honor of its recognition and their own love for science .

		The will of
Smithson	PERSON	directed that the pro- ceeds of his bequest should be used '' for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men . ''

		In his '' Plan of Organization '' Pro- fessor
Henry	PERSON	noted clearly that the terms '' in - crease '' and '' diffusion '' are logically distinct , and he urged that each should receive its literal interpretation ; and '' That the increase of knowledge should be effected by the encouragement of original researches of the highest character , and its diffusion by the publication of the results of original research ... That if preference be given to any branches of research , they should be to the higher and more abstract , to the discovery of new principles rather than of isolated facts . ''

		He would have the Institution do nothing which could be equally well done through other agencies .

		He believed that local objects , as museums , libraries , and lectures , should not be supported by the Institution , and strongly op - posed the erection of a costly building .

		He was not satisfied until the money which had been so used was by careful economy restored to the fund .

		He had the satisfaction , before he died , of seeing the library , which was becom - ing cumbersome , transferred to the Congres - sional Library ; the
Weather Bureau	ORGANIZATION	transferred to the War Department ; the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 109 supported by direct appropriations , and the resources of the Institution left comparatively free to be used for what he conceived to be its exclusive purpose .

		The series of papers included in this History , prepared by specialists in the various fields cul - tivated under the auspices of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution , show with what broad catholicity the fundamental principles laid down by
Henry	ORGANIZATION	have been interpreted and applied by the suc - cessive secretaries .

		The work of research is necessarily complemented by that of diffusion .

		Something must be learned before it can be told ; when thoroughly known , it can not be told too soon nor distributed too widely .

		Hence the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	motto , PER OEBEM .

		Its fields of investigation have been world wide ; its sub - sidies have been granted whenever there has been reasonable assurance that they would aid in extending the boundaries of human knowl - edge .

		The realm of pure science was one of the earliest to be occupied , in mathematics , physics , and their applications in astronomy , geography , and especially in the development of electrical science .

		The public generally , and men of science too frequently , in view of the later and more brilliant achievements of
Morse	PERSON	and
Bell	ORGANIZATION	and
Edison	ORGANIZATION	, forget that the prolific source of all this subsequent progress was opened by the discoveries which
Henry	ORGANIZATION	made or fostered .

		But the first two secretaries were not slow to discern that a special opportunity lay before the new Institution , one which must be seized promptly and pursued vigorously , or it would forever vanish .

		A vast area of virgin country lay between the great river and the western sea .

		Its surface had not been carefully ex - plored , even geographically .

		Beneath it were unknown stores of minerals , precious and econo - mic .

		Above it plant and animal life adapted to horizons and conditions indefinitely varied .

		From one boundary to its opposite , this land was strewed with the relics of one people sup - posed to have quite faded away , and with the scanty possessions of another race whose dis - appearance could not be remote .

		Over this country the wave of settlement was already rising with a resistless surge .

		In a few decades , the Indian , with his customs , his homes , and his implements , the buffalo and the grizzly , the seal and the salmon , the forest and the prairie flower , would have vanished before the white man 's constructive and destructive march .

		The decade beginning with
1850	DATE	showed great ac - tivity in explorations .

		These were usually un - dertaken for some purpose of national economy , as the determination of a boundary , the location of a railway , or the fixing of geodetic positions ; but the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Secretary took care that each should be accompanied by an efficient corps of scientific observers and collectors , and that the abundant harvests which these gath - ered should be discussed by competent experts .

		Thus were these explorations made to assist the increase of knowledge .

		To make this knowledge effective and endur - ing , two further movements were necessary .

		The first provided for the preservation of the material thus carefully investigated , and essen - tially correlated to the knowledge acquired .

		Hence arose the necessity for a Museum which should be national , both as to the source from which its contents should be gathered , and as to the completeness of its accumulations .

		A real museum is not a mere curiosity shop , but is a mass of carefully chosen material , scientifi - cally determined and systematically arranged .

		It is a means of giving to knowledge a concrete and crystalized identity , freed from the jug - glery of phrases .

		It is a conservator of science .

		As it must have a local habitation , its utility is localized , yet its influence extends per orbem .

		In this view the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	must be recognized as the coadjutor to and the supple - ment of the legitimate
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	work .

		The
National Park	ORGANIZATION	is only a department of the
Museum	ORGANIZATION	, adapted to living exhibits .

		A library , properly selected , becomes part of the appa - ratus of scientific investigation .

		What more than this had once been accumulated has found a more suitable home with the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		So , also , have some elements of an Art Gallery been transferred to the Corcoran collection .

		The duty of the diffusion of knowledge is fulfilled in the varied issues of
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	publications .

		Beginning with
1846	DATE	, the Insti - tution issued an annual report showing its con - ditions and operations , and from
1849	DATE	these reports gave account of the progress of knowl - edge in the world .

		Since
1889	DATE	the issue of these reports has been discontinued .

		The ''
Smith	PERSON	- sonian Contributions to Knowledge '' con - sist of thirty-two volumes of quarto form .

		To these volumes nothing may be admitted '' which does not furnish a positive addition to human knowledge resting on original research ; all unverified speculation to be rejected . ''

		A third series in octavo , now of thirty-eight volumes , bears the title ''
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Miscellaneous Collections . ''

		Much of the material so issued has been recast into forms especially useful to scientists who are making collections or con - 110 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		A series of proceedings issued by the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	is now in its nineteenth volume .

		The Museum has also issued many bulletins and circulars of instruc - tion .

		The
Bureau of American Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	issues separate series of publications .

		As another means of distribution of knowl - edge , the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution has estab - lished within itself a bureau of exchanges , by means of which American scientific materials may be distributed to European societies , and foreign books , instruments , etc. , may be dis - tributed in this country , usually without cost .

		In conclusion , it may be asserted that , con - sidering the character of those who at all times have been the managers or the administrators of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	bequest ; the variety , breadth , and scope of the interests fostered thereby ; the amount of the work accomplished as well as its preeminent quality the
Smithsonian Institu	ORGANIZATION	- tion reflects the highest honor upon its donor , upon science , and upon the American people .

		A NOBLE WOMAN 'S WORK FOB WOMAN 'S EDUCATION .

		* Perhaps no social movement of the time has made such rapid strides as the higher educa - tion of women .

		So closely has achievement pressed upon the heels of effort that even those who are to the manner born find it difficult to keep the pace .

		Necessarily the history is varied and complicated , so that a clear presentation of one phase of it , such as Miss
B. A. Clough	PERSON	has given in her pleasing Memoir of her aunt , late Principal of
Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	, is most welcome .


Anne Jemima Clough	PERSON	was born
January 20 , 1820	DATE	, in
Liverpool	LOCATION	, where her father , of an old Welsh county family , had established himself as a cotton merchant .

		This business brought him to the
United States	LOCATION	, and in
1822	DATE	he removed his family to
Charleston	LOCATION	, which was their home for the next fourteen years .

		Anne 's childhood was thus passed in an
Ameri	LOCATION	- can Southern city ; and a happy childhood it was , as she described it in the reminiscences contributed , in
1869	DATE	, to the memoir of her brother ,
Arthur Hugh Clough	PERSON	.

		Their home was an ugly red brick house on the
East Bay	LOCATION	, from whose nursery windows the children could * A MEMOIR OF ANNB

		see the ships sailing in and out of the harbor .

		Below stairs was their father 's office , where they played among the heaps of cotton . ''

		Arthur used to do sums in the office lying on the piled-up pieces of cotton bagging . ''

		Miss
Clough	PERSON	retained the liveliest memories of her early years in the
Southland	ORGANIZATION	a striking trait of character is shown by the fact that she cor - responded with one of her
Charleston	LOCATION	friends for the rest of her life , a period of fifty-six years .

		The doughs were too English to let their children go to school in
Charleston	LOCATION	, so the three boys were sent to
England	LOCATION	to be edu - cated ; but beyond lessons from her mother ,
Anne Clough	PERSON	had no instruction .

		She never went to school .

		Upon her return to
England	LOCATION	, in
1836	DATE	,
Miss Clough	LOCATION	eagerly sought every means of acquiring knowledge .

		A journal kept at this time describes vividly the difficul - ties and disappointments she met with .

		There were then few opportunities of education for girls except in incoherent lessons from masters , and Miss dough 's father was not able to pro- vide private tuition for her .

		Indeed , it is clear that she felt thus early the necessity of doing something for herself , for she seems to have begun , in her seventeenth year , to visit and teach in a
Welsh National School	ORGANIZATION	which her father had helped to found .

		The Journal tells of her ups and downs in teaching , of the books she read , and of her relations to her brother
Arthur	PERSON	.

		At one time she is getting up at six o'clock to study before going to her school ; she had stinted herself to do in a month , '' One book of
Euclid	LOCATION	, as far as the 80th page , in the Greek grammar , translate book ii .

		of Virgil from the German , read 2nd and 3rd volumes of
Milman	PERSON	's His - tory of the Jews ,
Milton	PERSON	over again , and the second vol - ume of
Wordsworth	PERSON	. ''

		Another entry ,
January , 1844	DATE	, is : `` Have been reading Trench 's poems , which are beautiful , also in the last year
Moultrie	LOCATION	's and
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's , some of Shakspere 's plays , The Last of the Barons -LRB- a disagreeable book -RRB- , The Hour and the Man , Lives of Celebrated Scotchmen , some of
Cowper	PERSON	, a few of
Newman	PERSON	's sermons , and
Arnold	LOCATION	's ; the last , the new volume , are beautiful . ''

		It was
Arthur Clough	PERSON	who had brought to her from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	the poems of
Moultrie	LOCATION	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		She had a quite special affection and admiration for this brother , whom she calls her '' best friend and adviser . ''

		He dis - cussed with her questions large and small , now disestablishment or eternal punishment , and now the best way to treat a case of pilfering among her poor children .

		He realized the un -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ill rest of her life , her longing for some adequate outlet for her pent-up energies ; and for this reason he encouraged her work among the poor .

		But he thought her ardor in this direc - tion excessive , and he seems to have had little or no conception of her peculiar ability .

		This is what he wrote to her about her studies : '' I will consider the subject you speak of , my dear .

		On the whole , I should incline to study arithmetic and grammar , perhaps ; but you must remember that a great advantage is given by any sort of cultivation -LRB- music , drawing , dancing , German , French , etc. -RRB- for intercourse with the poor . ''

		It was happily said during the recent contest for degrees for women in
Oxford	LOCATION	, '' if there is any peculiar affinity between French and music , often badly taught , and the minds of women , it has never been demonstrated by the advocates of the fine-lady type of education . ''

		Miss
Clough	PERSON	continued to grope about for an opportunity of giving practical shape to her ideas .

		Of her own education she writes : '' I always feel the defects of my education most painfully when I go out . ''

		Her lack of train - ing for her work she sought to correct by attending one or two different training schools in
London	LOCATION	.

		Among her brother 's friends whom she met there was
Francis Turner	PERSON	Pal - grave , of whom she says : '' I wondered to hear Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	talk about women as if only those like
Lady Maria	LOCATION	in
Arthur	PERSON	's story are to be admired .

		I do n't much fancy men often understand women ; they do n't know how restless and weary they get . ''

		The result of Miss
Clough	PERSON	's studies in teach - ing was the establishment , at Ambleside ,
West	LOCATION	- moreland , of a school for the children of trades - people and farmers .

		This school she conducted successfully for the ten years from
1852	DATE	to
1862	DATE	; and it was what she learned here of the defects of
Middle-Class Education	ORGANIZATION	, especially for girls , that led finally to her great achieve - ments in advancing education for women in
England	LOCATION	.

		Her thoughts began to take definite form in a remarkable paper , entitled '' Hints on the Organization of Girls ' Schools , '' which she contributed to ''
Macmillan	PERSON	's Magazine , '' in
October , 1866	DATE	.

		This short paper contains in germ much that has since been done in
England	LOCATION	for the secondary and higher education of women .

		It described the inadequate state of girls ' schools of all kinds , and attributed the evil in large measure to the fact that there was no standard by which schools for girls could be tested .

		A plan of improvement was then sketched out , which , curiously enough , has developed into two widely different results .

		It is not generally known that the whole scheme of
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	originated with
Miss Clough	PERSON	in a modest '' hint '' towards the betterment of girls ' schools .

		The most striking idea in the paper was the suggestion of courses of lectures in large towns for girls and women , to be given by
University	ORGANIZATION	men , with syllabuses and examinations .

		This sug - gestion was the origin of the association known as the
North of England Council	ORGANIZATION	for Promot - ing the
Higher Education of Women	ORGANIZATION	, which , in
1867	DATE	, started courses of lectures for women in
Liverpool	LOCATION	,
Manchester	LOCATION	,
Sheffield	LOCATION	, and
Leeds	LOCATION	.

		The lectures succeeded from the first , and their establishment in the two
University	ORGANIZATION	towns was the practical beginning of the women 's colleges there .


University Extension	ORGANIZATION	is the popularization of the movement .

		Another matter to which the
North of England Council	ORGANIZATION	gave its attention turned out also to be of wider import than was at first intended .

		This was the establishment of a satisfactory examination for women over eighteen years of age , with the view especially of testing teachers .

		The
University of Cam	ORGANIZATION	- bridge received favorably the memorial of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	on this subject , and appointed a syn - dicate which drew up a scheme of examina - tions , to last provisionally for three years .

		At the end of that time the examinations were made permanent ; and when , two years later , men applied for admission to them , the name was changed from Women 's Examinations to the
Higher Local Examinations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since then the Higher Local has alternated with the his - toric Little Go as an entrance examination to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and it is considered the better test of the two , as based on modern conditions in education .

		With the growth of
the University	ORGANIZATION	idea in this country , the affiliated college , whether as a school of medicine or law , or a school for women , has become familiar .

		It is not neces - sary to trace the history of
Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	, from its small beginning , in
1871	DATE	, as a rented house of residence for fine women attending private lectures , to its present commanding position .

		Women were first admitted of right to the
Tripos Examinations	ORGANIZATION	in
1881	DATE	; the Principal 's Report for
1894	DATE	, thirteen years later , states that
Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	stood third in the
University	ORGANIZATION	in the number of students who took honors .

		It was outranked only by St.
John	PERSON	's and
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, the two largest colleges for men , both old and wealthy foundations .

		This is a great achievement ; but the unique 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, personality of the woman who brought it about was even greater .

		In the first place , paradoxical as it may seem ,
Miss Clough	PERSON	was not naturally a student , nor even an intellec - tual woman .

		Though she had a strong sense of humor , her niece notes her insensibility to its intellectual forms , to humorous fancy , or to wit .

		She had great respect for learning , and sometimes expressed it in a wholly unexpected way , as when she said of a student who had been disappointed in not obtaining a high class in the
Mathematical Tripos	ORGANIZATION	, ``
Mathe	PERSON	- matics is a deceiving subject . ''

		She was most of all interested in human life , and her devo - tion to education grew out of that .

		She looked upon education as the best possible preparation for life , and she saw no reason why women should not be prepared for the world 's work as well as men .

		That was so simple to her own mind as to be axiomatic .

		Those who knew her sometimes wondered how a woman so practical and so optimistic could have been the sister of a poet who , with all his tenderness and humor , is commonly regarded as being introspective , sad , and skep - tical .

		While
Arthur Clough	PERSON	seems to have been asking himself , doubtfully , whether there was '' aught that was worth the doing , '' or the saying either , for that matter , her life was a continual assertion of the worth of doing , even in small things .

		But there was far more spiritual kinship between them than at first appears .

		Clough 's mind ran mainly on moral and social questions .

		Mr.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	says of him , that '' it was the warmth of his feelings , the width of his sympathies , the fine - ness of his physical sensibilities that made him a poet , '' and that it was `` his extraordinary union of sincerity and sympathy that most endeared him to his friends . ''

		Sympathy and sincerity were marked traits of character in
Miss Clough	LOCATION	.

		But hers was undoubtedly the stronger spirit .

		The '' Ambarvalia , '' the '' Amours de Voyage , '' all are pierced with the pain and mystery of life , for which the poet offers no alleviation and no solution .

		The passion that stirred the sister 's life to rich fruition was the narrowness of the lives of women .

		She often spoke of the many new openings for women , and referred pathetically to what the young women of her own time had suffered from lack of training and opportunity .

		To a - friend who was impatient for happiness , she said gently : `` You should not expect hap - piness , my dear ; I had to wait for mine till I was fifty . ''

		She was nearly fifty-two when she began her work at
Newnham	LOCATION	.

		Twenty-five years before , in
1846	DATE	, her Journal records : '' We -LSB-
Arthur	PERSON	and
Anne	PERSON	-RSB- had a great deal of con - versation about various things , principally about our future plans ; the necessity , or rather the great benefit , of women finding work , and considering it a duty to do so , and also whether they are at liberty to choose their own paths in some cases -LRB- I mean single women -RRB- , with - out reference to their families . ''

		And again : '' Had various discussions about married and single life , and one long talk with
Jane Claude	PERSON	about work - ing .

		Told her some of my notions about its being right in certain cases to quit even one 's father and mother and family for work as well as for a husband . ''

		The quarter of a century during which these ideas had been revolving in her mind was one of great awakening in thought , and women had shared perforce the inheritance of men .

		Mary
Carpenter	PERSON	and
Florence Nightin	ORGANIZATION	- gale had opened up new lines of social activity for women ; Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	had shown with renewed vigor that there is no sex in literature ; those women , like
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	and
Harriet Mar	PERSON	- tineau and
Mary Somerville	PERSON	, who advocated the political enfranchisement of women , had found a parliamentary leader of the first rank in
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	.

		There could be no longer any doubt that a sound education is a good thing for a woman to have .

		What remained was to prove the feasibility of get - ting it ; and that , in
England	LOCATION	, involved bring - ing over the great universities to the novel idea that it is the business of a university to educate the human race .

		The selection of
Miss Clough	LOCATION	to perform this delicate and difficult task at
Cambridge	LOCATION	was due to the wisdom and foresight of Professor
Henry Sidgwick	PERSON	, who knew the situation and the woman .

		Miss
Clough	PERSON	disarmed criticism from the start .

		She was not learned , she was not aggressive ; she was so afraid of saying too much that she said very little ; she was an entirely inoffensive person .

		On the other hand , she had prestige , a quick intelligence , great powers of organization , unfailing tact , and an indomitable persistence .

		She gained no point by direct assault , but when an advan - tage fell in her way she was always ready to make the most of it , and she never lost ground .

		She herself expressed , with singular poetic in - sight , her own manner of working : '' It seems to me that to be quiet and to be active , or , rather , to be quietly active , constantly going on with untiring energy , and yet so softly as scarcely to be perceptible , this seems to me to be an approach towards perfection .

		And this lesson we learn from
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 Nature , which is unceasingly and yet imperceptibly changing . ''

		This is precisely how her work impressed those who came to know it intimately , like that of Nature , so silent , gradual , barely per - ceptible , apparently unconscious it was .

		Innumerable little touches throughout the book restore
Miss Clough	PERSON	to her students u in her habit as she lived . ''

		There is her busy mind overflowing with suggestions and expedi - ents of all sorts , sometimes whimsically impos - sible , but oftener the very best thing to do in any given circumstances .

		She had accumu - lated an inexhaustible fund of practical wis - dom , and her wide acquaintance with people enabled her to fit together the most diverse interests .

		For a student going to the
Lake Country	LOCATION	and expecting to take a certain walk over the fells , through a perfectly safe but rather wild region , she knew the last house on the road where definite information could be had for the rest of the way .

		She advised a party of students who proposed to spend a vacation travelling slowly through the south of
England	LOCATION	, to apply to the local postmasters for good lodgings , a plan that was found to work admirably well .

		She was a great believer in the benefit of change .

		She thought Wesleyan ministers '' must get a wide view of the world and of people , '' and she suggested a similar interchange of cures between town and coun - try clergy .

		So she writes to a teacher , suffer - ing from the climate of
India	LOCATION	: `` I wish some of our English women of leisure would undertake to do work abroad for a couple of years .

		... I should like to make a circle of teachers moving round . ''

		She encouraged her students to undertake work in distant lands , if only for a few years ; and she was always delighted to receive foreign students at
Newnham	LOCATION	.

		Apart from the good they might gain , she thought they did good by bringing in fresh life and widening the other students ' horizons .

		For American students she had a special regard ; her knowledge of American democracy was unusually intelligent , and she readily appreciated the savoirfaire of the American college women who came to her .

		Possibly it may have been sometimes that they seemed to possess the earth , as it had been in her own heart to do at their age .

		What she would have called '' a useful little book '' might be made by collecting her wise sayings , clothed always in simple , homely words ; for although her ideas were sometimes poetical , she had no gift of expression .

		Many such sayings are scattered throughout this book , and many more doubtless are to be had from her letters to her students .

		Some of the best of them here are on work . ''

		There is great enjoyment in work ... Work puts us into connection with others , it gives us interest and experience , and scope for our affections . '' ''

		If one can only do one 's work well , one may bear anything . '' ''

		Do not be afraid of humble work , whatever it may be .

		Take what comes and put your minds to it .

		But I advise you always to try for leisure , and contemplate your work , and avoid slavery . ''

		No one but Miss
Clough	PERSON	could have summed up the good of a three years ' University course with '' My dear , you will be able to amuse them better when you go home , '' which , says the student , '' is exactly what I had to try and do . ''

		Miss
Clough	PERSON	died at
Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	,
February 27 , 1892	DATE	.

		Among the flowers that were laid on her grave , near that of
Henry Fawcett	PERSON	, in
Grantchester	ORGANIZATION	churchyard , were two wreaths that the Newnham women felt pecu - liarly grateful for .

		We think of it as a blessing when we realize how much more earn - estly than ever before the problems of teaching are being attacked , how many more high capaci - ties are being given to the work , how rational and effective have been some of our recent pedagogical advances .

		But the shield has an - other side , and current pedagogy may well seem little more than an evil to him who ob - serves the growing influence of shallow theor - ists and charlatans , the random experimentation done at the expense of thousands of luckless children , and the dreary flow of words without knowledge that gushes forth at so many an '' educational '' gathering and fills the pages of * ARNOLD OF RUGBY : His

New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, so many a pedagogical periodical .

		These things make one look back longingly to a time when education was more human because less scien - tific , when it was conceived of as the contact of mind with mind rather than as the mechanical application of a system of pedagogy .

		The name of
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	is deservedly famous in the history of education , but many of our modern educators are so '' advanced '' in their own conceit , so excited over the pos - session of the new toy which they call psychology , that they would doubtless find it surprising to be told , in all seriousness , that
Arnold	LOCATION	's atti - tude toward the fundamental problems of edu - cation was a more enlightened one than is easily to be found among educators of the present day .

		We do not express this opinion outright , but we assert that it is at least an arguable matter .

		Who in our own time , for example , has formu - lated a finer expression of the pedagogical ideal than may be found in this passage from a letter written by Arnold in
1836	DATE	to Mr.
Justice Coleridge	PERSON	? ''

		I am sure that the more active my own mind is , and the more it works upon great moral and political points , the better for the school ; not , of course , for the folly of proselytizing the boys , but because education is a dynamical , not a mechanical , process , and the more powerful and vigorous the mind of the teacher , the more clearly and readily he can grasp things , the better fitted he is to cultivate the mind of another .

		And to this I find myself coming more and more : I care less and less for information , more and more for the pure exer - cise of the mind ; for answering a question concisely and comprehensively , for showing a command of lan - guage , a delicacy of taste , and a comprehensiveness of thought and power of combination . ''

		We have made this extract from a volume recently edited by Mr.
J. J. Findlay	PERSON	, a volume which ought to find its way into the hands of every teacher .

		It is entitled `` Arnold of Rugby : His School Life and Contributions to Educa - tion . ''

		It contains , besides the editorial pre - face , an introductory chapter by the
Bishop of Hereford	ORGANIZATION	, a biographical notice with extracts from
Arnold	LOCATION	's letters , a reprint of those sections of Stanley 's '' Life '' which deal with the school work at
Laleham	LOCATION	and Rugby , a selection from the sermons preached by
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	at
Rugby Chapel	ORGANIZATION	,
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's miscellaneous essays on edu - cational topics , and a bibliography .

		In other words , the work supplies , within the compass of a single volume of moderate dimensions , the material for a very thorough knowledge of Ar - nold 's educational methods and ideals .

		Narrow as
Arnold	LOCATION	was in some ways , and almost fanat - ical as he was in his insistence upon the injec - tion of dogmatic theology into his system of discipline , the study of his life-work can not be other than inspiring , and it is easy to separate the dross of his pedagogical doctrine from its pure gold .

		In a famous passage , he once spoke of physical science in the following terms : '' Rather than have it the principal thing in my son 's mind , I would gladly have him think that the sun went round the earth , and that the stars were so many spangles set in the bright blue firmament . ''

		This is an extreme form of statement , but it embodies a fundamental prin - ciple of sound educational theory , and , what is just now more to the point , it illustrates the tenacity with which Arnold held to the essen - tials of his system .

		His conviction was abso - lute that some subjects are of more importance than others , and the case for the classics was never put more cogently than in the following sentences from an article written by Arnold in
1834	DATE	for '' The Quarterly Journal of Educa - tion '' : '' Expel Greek and Latin from your schools , and you confine the views of the existing generation to them - selves and their immediate predecessors : you will cut off so many centuries of the world 's experience , and place us in the same state as if the human race had first come into existence in the year
1500	DATE	... The mind of the Greek and of the Roman is in all the essential points of its constitution our own ; and not only so , but it is our own mind developed to an extraordinary degree of perfection .

		Aristotle , and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and Thucydides , and
Cicero	PERSON	, and
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, are most untruly called ancient writers ; they are virtually our own countrymen and contemporaries , but have the advantage which is en - joyed by intelligent travellers , that their observation has been exercised in a field out of the reach of com - mon men ; and that having thus seen in a manner with our eyes what we can not see for ourselves , their con - clusions are such as bear upon our own circumstances , while their information has all the charm of novelty , and all the value of a mass of new and pertinent facts , illustrative of the great science of the nature of civil - ized man . ''

		Essentially sound as were the chief positions maintained by
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	during his career as an educator , they had , of course , accidental features that it would not be well to insist upon overmuch after the lapse of half a century .

		Fortunately , however , the name of
Arnold	LOCATION	was destined to be bound up with the history of English education for another generation , and the more famous son of the famous Master of Rugby was an example of the rare type of man who can recognize , with exquisite discernment , the legitimate demands of the Zeitgeist , while holding , in the main , to a well-approved con - servative ideal .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's position in English literature was so distinguished that his admirers are apt to forget that the poet and critic was also an educator of the first rank ,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 and that a large share of his best activities was given to the inspection of schools , the marking of examination papers , and the preparation of those official reports which , while omitted from the uniform editions of his works , are never - theless to be reckoned among the classics of pedagogical literature .

		It is for calling re - newed attention to these writings that we are chiefly thankful to Sir
Joshua Fitch	PERSON	, who has prepared for the '' Great Educators '' series a volume entitled ''
Thomas	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and Their Influence on English Education . ''

		The book is written in a spirit of generous sympathy , and is pleasant reading from first to last .

		The chapters devoted to
Arnold	LOCATION	pere duplicate the substance of Mr.
Findlay	PERSON	's com - pilation , and emphasize much the same aspects of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's activity .

		The chapters that take up the work of Arnold fils afford a well-con - sidered and judicial estimate of the poet who was also an inspector of schools , and whet the appetite for his educational books by making many happy extracts from their pages .

		The spirit in which
Arnold	PERSON	did his official work is made clear by such a statement as this : '' If he saw little children looking good and happy , and under the care of a kindly and sympathetic teacher , he would give a favourable report , without inquiring too curiously into the percentage of scholars who could pass the ' standard ' examination .

		He valued the elemen - tary schools rather as centres of civilization and refin - ing influence than as places for enabling the maximum number of children to spell and write , and to do a given number of sums without a mistake . ''

		Of peculiar interest is
Arnold	LOCATION	's reported opin - ion concerning the ''
Tom Brown	PERSON	'' view of school life at Rugby . ''

		As
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	once said to me , the story has been praised quite enough , for it gives only one side , and that not the best side , of Rugby school life , or of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		It gives the reader the impression that it is the chief business of a public school to produce a healthy animal , to supply him with pleasant companions and faithful friends , to foster in him courage and truth - fulness , and for the rest to teach as much as the regu - lations of the school enforce , but no more .

		It is to be feared that
Hughes	PERSON	's own boyhood was not spent with the best set at Rugby ... His typical school-boy is seen delighting in wanton mischief , in sport , in a fight , and even in a theft from a farm-yard , distinguished frequently by insolence to inferiors , and even by coarse - ness and brutality , but not by love of work or by any strong interest in intellectual pursuits ... This pic - ture of a public school , in spite of its attractive features and of its nnquestionable power and reality , will prob - ably be quoted in future years as illustrating the low standard of civilization , the false ideal of manliness , and the deep-seated indifference to learning for its own sake which characterized the upper classes of our youth in the
early half of the nineteenth century	DATE	. ''

		This is a somewhat unusual view to take of the famous schoolboy classic , but it is not without justification , and has peculiar interest from the fact that it is presented , in a way , as reflecting
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's own opinion .

		Sir
Joshua	PERSON	quotes one passage from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	which has a pathetic personal interest .

		It is from the preface to the little volume of '' Bible Reading for Schools , '' which was never used , as far as the writer knows , in any school whatever .

		* ' For anyone who believes in the civilizing power of letters , and often talks of this belief , to think that he has for more than twenty years got his living by inspect - ing schools for the people , has gone in and out among them , has seen that the power of letters never reaches them at all , and that the whole study of letters is thereby discredited , and its power called in question , and yet has attempted nothing to remedy this state of things , can not but be vexing and disquieting .

		He may truly say , like the
Israel	LOCATION	of the prophet , ' We have not wrought any deliverance in the earth ! '

		and he may well desire to do something to pay his debt to popular education before he finally departs , and to serve it , if he can , in that point where its need is sorest , where he has always said its need was sorest , and where , nevertheless , it is as sore still as when he began saying this twenty years ago .

		Even if what he does can not be of service at once , owing to special prejudices and difficulties , yet these preju - dices and difficulties years are almost sure to dissipate , and the work may be of service hereafter . '' ''

		Of service hereafter . '

		Yes , in many ways of which a man can himself hardly conceive , work done for education in
Matthew Arnold	LOCATION	's spirit is sure to make its influence felt .

		That spirit , embodied in
Arnold	LOCATION	's many volumes of poetry and prose , is working like a leaven in thousands of generous minds , each of them in turn bringing others into its beneficent contact .

		Hence we welcome to the educational workshop such books as the two already discussed in this article , as well as the small volume of ''
Selec	PERSON	- tions from the Prose Writings of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, '' which Professor
Lewis E. Gates	PERSON	has just edited for school use .

		The selections em - brace '' what is most characteristic in
Arnold	LOCATION	's criticism of literature and life , '' his best thoughts on style , translation , the function of criticism , the place of science in education , the antithesis of Hebraism and Helenism , the doc - trine of '' sweetness and light , '' and the argu - ment for '' the not ourselves '' as the basis of a rational religious belief .

		There are about a score of selections altogether , filling nearly three hundred pages , and followed by some fifty pages of notes .

		The book is a companion to the ed - itor 's similar volume devoted to
Newman	PERSON	, and is provided , like its predecessor , with an elabo - rate introductory essay .

		This essay is deserv - ing of very high praise .

		It is artfully contrived 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, to present a conspectus of the whole circle of Arnoldian ideas , yet there is no suggestion of pedantic formalism in the treatment ; it is grace - ful , acute , subtle in suggestion , full of delicate felicities of expression , and altogether the most satisfactory critical discussion of
Arnold	LOCATION	with which we are acquainted .

		A part of the closing paragraph may be copied here to illustrate the quality of the whole . ''

		He accepts with some sadness , it is true , and yet genuinely and generously the modern age , with its scientific bias and its worldly preoccupations ; hu - manist as he is , half - romantic lover of an elder time , he yet masters his regret over what is disappearing and welcomes the present loyally .

		Believing , however , in the continuity of human experience , and above all in the transcendent worth to mankind of its spiritual ac - quisitions , won largely through the past domination of Christian ideals , he devotes himself to preserving the quintessence of this ideal life of former generations , and insinuating it into the hearts and imaginations of men of a ruder age .

		He converts himself into a patient medi - ator between the old and the new .

		Herein he contrasts with
Newman	PERSON	on the one hand , and with the modern devotees of sestheticism on the other hand ...
Arnold	LOCATION	, with a temperament perhaps as exacting as either of these other temperaments , takes life as it offers itself and does his best with it .

		He sees and feels its crude - ness and disorderliness ; but he has faith in the instincts that civilized men have developed in common , and finds in the working of these instincts the continuous , if irreg - ular , realization of the ideal . ''

		THE POLYCHROME BIBLE .

		* The white light of Holy Writ has passed through a prism of '' eminent biblical scholars , '' and has been broken into the colors of the critical spectrum .

		This process has been an - nounced in laudatory terms through many chan - nels for the last five years .

		We have been told that this will be the focal point of modern bib - lical scholarship , and in these terms : `` The Poly - chrome Bible will have the unique distinction of representing the united Biblical scholarship of the civilized world . ''

		Then '' We are the people , '' and do other nationalities go for naught in biblical scholarship ?

		This spectrum
Bible	LOCATION	is to be a translation into modern English of a revised Hebrew text .

		It is to be so clear and intelligible as to do away with glossaries , commentaries , etc. .

		It is to be a work not for scholars only , but '' for the peo - ple . ''

		To indicate to '' the people , '' '' the results of modern biblical criticism as to the different sources from which some of the Old Testament Books have been made up , the -LSB- English -RSB- text is printed on variously colored backgrounds exhibiting the composite structure of the books . ''

		To these visual delights are added illustrations of the monuments of
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	, of biblical sites , etc. .

		If these predictions and pledges are all fulfilled we shall have the most marvellous and most welcome and most useful religious work of the century the quintes - sence of modern biblical scholarship , modern literary English with ample explanatory notes and illustrations , and the banishment of com - mentaries .

		The appearance of three volumes of this series is hailed with peculiar satisfaction .

		With a lively interest we dip into their pages .

		Their chromatic and pictorial character lightens the appearance of the task , and gives them at first sight an air of popularity .

		We discover that each volume has the same twelve pages of '' Introductory Remarks , '' in which the reader is dazed by two full pages , and double columned at that , of abbreviations ; and '' the people '' here ascertain , as they must if they are to read these volumes , the signification of J , E , JE , D , E , E2 , H , and a lot of other alphabetic symbols .

		The volume on Judges uses a full set of seven colors , and also italics , to designate the different strata of documents originating from the ninth century down into post-exilic times .

		Chapter VI .

		alone exhibits six colors or backgrounds six documents pieced together with amazing inge - nuity .

		Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	's
Isaiah	LOCATION	, rather group of Isaiahs , is both a critical analysis by colors , and a tearing up and a new arrangement of the entire book .

		There is nothing like it in all the field of biblical criticism .

		It is subjective , eru - dite , and revolutionary .

		The volume on the Psalms is not polychrome at all .

		It is a straight - forward white-page translation of the Psalter .

		A translation into modern English is one great aim of this series .

		These three books are quite enough to test the results .

		Of course ,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 117 the age-worn and smooth-sounding phrases of the Authorized and Revised Versions are missed , but in many passages , particularly in the Psalms , they are replaced by expressive and pithy mod - ern English .

		This indeed is not always the case .

		The beauty and clearness of translation , however , is sometimes marred by the element of emendation or conjecture which underlies it .

		The lay reader is often in doubt as to whether what he reads faithfully represents the original or is a conjectural emendation of the editor .

		Again , what timorous motive led the editors to put into the English translation such an un - pronounceable combination as JHVH ?

		Why not say either Jehovah or Jahweh ? ''

		The explanatory notes '' are critical , topo - graphical , and sometimes exegetical .

		But the pictures are only fair to medium are not new , but are found in other works , and some of them even reveal the hand of a late redactor , and still the colors are missing .

		It should perhaps be said that no one of the editors of the volumes already issued would dogmatically say that his statements are final ; in fact , '' probable '' is as strong a word as he would use .

		The volumes represent , not '' the united Biblical scholarship of the civilized world , '' but each volume represents the scholar - ship of one man , with marks of a redactor 's hand .

		They give us , visually , the analysis of the Old Testament as made by some of the most advanced schools of critics .

		Scientific students in literary and historical fields , and all Bible students , can now test the literary and historical methods and conclusions of these '' eminent scholars . ''

		The
Polychrome Bible	LOCATION	, with its technicalities , its analyses , its critical standards , will be of value to scholars only ; ordinary Sunday-school or Bible-class teachers will find little if any interest in it .

		The popular features in illustration , in luxurious initial pieces , and chapter closings , will not outweigh its technique , will not make it a book '' for the people . ''

		At present estimates , the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment alone will cost in twenty volumes about
$ 40	MONEY	not too much if it should fulfil all the promises made for it .

		But it falls far short , and bids fair now to be a scholarly work by `` eminent scholars , '' and of real value through - out to scholars only .

		SOME RECENT BOOKS ON EDUCATION .

		* The latest addition to '' The Great Educators '' series is a volume on ' -
Horace Mann	PERSON	and the Common-School Revival in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	.

		Professor
Hinsdale	LOCATION	has given us an interesting , a judicious , and a capable sketch of this great educator , and of the common - school revival in which he bore so large a part There is also a well-considered and valuable resume of the progress of elementary education in the
United States	LOCATION	for the first two centuries of its his - tory .

		Professor
Hinsdale	LOCATION	naturally gives most attention to
Mann	PERSON	's labors as Secretary of the Mas - sachusetts
State Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		Daring the twelve years he held this post he effected little less than a revolution in common-school education in that state , and his manifold self-sacrificing labors are set forth with clearness and with considerable fulness .

		One chapter is devoted to a very useful summary of
Mann	PERSON	's famous Reports to the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author concludes this chapter by the remark that these documents present
Mann	PERSON	to the world '' as an educational statesman rather than a philosophical educator or a trained peda - gogist . '' ''

		The reports are among the best existing expositions , if , indeed , they are not the very best ones , of the practical benefits of a common-school education both to the individual and
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The student or educator , the journalist or politician , who is seeking the best arguments in favor of popular education , will find them here . ''

		The book contains a selected bibliography .

		Altogether the work is a well-written and trustworthy account of perhaps the greatest hero in American educa - tional history .

		Professor Thwing , of
Adelbert University	ORGANIZATION	, has lately added to his already considerable list of books on college subjects a work entitled '' The
American College	ORGANIZATION	in American Life . ''

		In this volume he aims '' to bring the American college into closer relationship with American life , and so far as may be to bring American life into a more vital touch with the American college . ''

		Hence he is concerned chiefly with the college , not as producing scholars , but men of affairs and citi - zens , and as a general fitting-school for any worthy career .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, cussed , among others , as to whether we have too many colleges .

		The author decidedly thinks we have too many , and that every effort should be made '' to prevent the foundation of more colleges ; to unite , if it be possible , certain ones of those now existing ; to strengthen the colleges already well endowed , well established , and well situated , to make these not only great but the greatest possible . ''

		It is to be noted that President Thwing neither here nor elsewhere seems to consider the relation of college to university in reference to this question .

		Perhaps an ideal apportionment would be one high-school to every ten thousand population , one college to every hundred thousand , and one univer - sity to every million .

		Other chapters deal with such topics as college religion and morals , college expenses , difficulties and dangers of college life , etc. ; and finally there is an optimistic chapter on the future of the American college .

		The volume is , as a whole , a good conspectus , and will be especi - ally serviceable to all who have to do with college administration .

		The `` Teaching of Morality , '' by
Sophie Bryant	PERSON	, D.Sc. , is a brief but suggestive handbook for teachers and parents .

		The opening chapter is a close philosophical and psychological treatment of `` Moral Education in General , '' followed by chap - ters on the `` Intellectual and Moralizing Processes Involved in the Study of Morality , '' on the ''
Prin	PERSON	- ciples of Teaching , '' and on `` Virtuous Character '' and `` Social Membership . ''

		Great stress is laid on initiative , on leading the pupil to a stage of rational self-activity .

		The whole book shows a clear insight , based on both experience and reflection ; and we regret that a large portion is so condensed , abstract , and dry , that it must fail of the widest service .

		A single sentence is worth quoting as giving some idea of the author 's method and standpoint . ''

		My experience based on some teaching to school girls between the ages of twelve and eighteen is , -LRB- 1 -RRB- that young people are much interested in the ideas of right and wrong ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that they are apt to be impressed and effectively moved by that strain of moral reflection which shows the unity of virtue in all variety of virtues ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- that they acquire this kind of knowledge as naturally as any other , while they are apt to apply it with more interest and skill . ''

		Dr.
Francis Warner	PERSON	, who is already favorably known for his works on psychology , has given us a valuable manual on '' The Study of Children and their School Training . ''

		It is distinctly a physio - logical study of the growth of the child from early years through adolescence , giving special attention to nerve-signs of all kinds .

		In a very definite , concrete way , and with illustrations , the reader is taught to observe in children such physical expres - sions as twitchings , `` fidgetiness , '' hand and head postures , etc. , and to interpret them aright .

		This book seems to us an extremely suggestive and important one for teachers and parents ; and being simply written , and free from technicalities , it may be understood and applied with ease by any reader .

		As an example of Dr.
Warner	ORGANIZATION	's method of expound - ing his subject , we quote a paragraph from the Introductory Chapter . ''

		A boy , eight years of age , in preparatory school , was said to be so dull at learn - ing Latin that it was thought impossible to continue the attempt to teach him .

		He was healthy and well made ; he showed no signs of mental defect , and was , otherwise , quick and bright .

		He had learned to read well , and read story books for pleasure .

		I noticed that , in reading , he followed the words on the printed line by moving his head , not moving his eyes in their orbits ; this did well enough for story-reading , when he skipped much of the page .

		Moving the head in place of turning the eyes did not admit of sufficient accuracy for studying Latin .

		Some attention to eye-drill soon removed all the difficulty complained of , and the boy made good progress .

		This cause of mental dullness serves to illustrate the usefulness to teach - ers of personal observation . ''

		Another book on
Child Study	ORGANIZATION	is Professor
James Sully	PERSON	's `` Children 's Ways , '' an abridgment of his work on `` Studies of Childhood , '' made to suit '' the requirements of the general reader . ''

		This book consists mainly of anecdotes dealing with children who have attained some command of language .

		The work is a compilation , largely from
Stanley Hall	ORGANIZATION	and other American observers ; but it is not a very clear or well connected whole .

		In his efforts at popularizing , Professor Sully sometimes assumes a certain condescension which is uncalled for either by the subject or by the reader .

		Some of Professor Sully 's remarks will doubtless seem questionable , both to the general reader and advanced student , as when he assures us that animals have no imagination .

		While the book as a whole can hardly be regarded as adequate to the subject , it will undoubtedly be of considerable inter - est and value to parents and others .

		Bishop Spalding 's latest volume , '' Thoughts and Theories of Life and Education , '' contains a series of addresses of a general character on the nature and spirit of education in relation to life .

		These discourses are not meant so much for information as for inspiration ; but while the truth is mostly truism , it is always earnestly and often eloquently rehearsed with an Emersonian sententiousness .

		The last chapter , on `` The Teacher and the School , '' speaks bravely for the elevation of the common school above politics , and of teaching to a definite rank as a profession .

		Number XLII .

		of the
International Educational Series	ORGANIZATION	is '' Bibliography of Education , '' by Mr.
W. S. Monroe	PERSON	.

		This is a selected list of 3,200 books printed in English , and mostly of recent date .

		In some instances a descriptive note is added .

		We find this list lacking in some points , as , for instance , it mentions neither
Brodrick	PERSON	's '' History of
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	'' nor
Charles Dickens	PERSON	's `` Schools and Schoolmasters '' ; nor yet do we find notice of Emer - son 's '' College Year Book , '' or of '' Minerva . ''

		But though we do not think this list as good a one of its size as might be made , yet it will be found serviceable , especially by reason of a very full index .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	's ''
Ameri	PERSON	- ^ n Ideals , and Other Essays Social and Political '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is in many respects an excellent book for young Americans especially to read .

		The best part of it is its tren - chant discussion of the problems and scandals of our municipal politics and of the duties of the citi - zen in relation thereto .

		What Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	says in this regard is so sound and patriotic that his oc - casionally rather '' bumptious '' manner of saying it is the more regrettable .

		There is a certain something in Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's manner or personality that has led people to take a somewhat comic view of him , and to treat his pretensions as a social and political philosopher and teacher with some levity .

		But it can not be denied that his own record is exception - ally such as to entitle him to a most respectful hear - ing on municipal questions , and even to warrant him in lecturing with some asperity the deplorably large class of people who shirk the performance of all such political duties as involve the prospect of risk or inconvenience or unpleasantness to them - selves in fact , of such duties as make a real de - mand on one 's manhood and patriotism .

		Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt has himself gone down into the thick of the fray like a man , and done battle with the '' boss '' and the '' heeler '' on his own ground ; and he nat - urally harbors a robust contempt for those whom he calls the '' timid good . ''

		He has no sort of pa - tience with the superfine folks who shun contact with their ruder and coarser fellow mortals , and mince daintily through life much as a sleek house - cat picks its way over a gutter .

		In his opinion , the man who is too timid or too finical or too indifferent to take part in the often rough and disagreeable preliminary work that must be done at the caucuses and primaries , if we are to have honest government and decent officials in this country , is out of place in a republic .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's patriotic heat leads him into a little inconsistency now and then .

		He scolds , for instance , at the American who , electing to live abroad , makes his home in
England	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	or
Germany	LOCATION	, and tries to become an Englishman or a Frenchman or a German , accordingly ; but for the foreigner , on the other hand , who expatriates himself , who abjures his native patriotism and the land of his birth , who comes to us and tries by every means in his power to divest himself of his own nationality and become an American , Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt has nothing but praise .

		But Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's rule seems to be one of those poor ones that will not work both ways .

		The essays in the present volume are reprinted from leading periodicals , and they deserve for the most part their more durable setting .

		In tracing the
History of Oratory	ORGANIZATION	, The eommonttt Professor
Lorenzo Sears	PERSON	produced a form of oratory .

		* book popular enough to be of general interest and yet careful enough in its plan and treat - ment to be of value to the student .

		His later work , `` The Occasional Address '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is of some - what similar character ; it is founded upon material carefully gathered from many sources ; it is planned and developed carefully , and with sufficient par - ticularity ; it is written in a pleasant vein that makes it easy reading .

		As in the previous book , the man who searches for definite facts is often vexed at not finding them , or at sometimes , perhaps , finding de - batable matters stated in too confident a way .

		But these books do not affect to be works of deep eru - dition : they are rather , we should say , designed first for the college student , and we think them well calculated to reach their audience .

		`` The Occasional Address '' is the term chosen by Professor
Sears	ORGANIZATION	to designate a form of demonstrative oratory very common here in
America	LOCATION	, and one which comes most readily within the reach of college students .

		The term denotes speeches , orations , addresses , made on special occasions , commemorations , cele - brations , and the like .

		To be more exact , and to mention as examples the special forms discussed by Professor
Sears	ORGANIZATION	in Part III. , it includes such forms of speaking as the Eulogy , the Commemorative Oration , the Expository Address or Lecture , the
Commencement Oration	ORGANIZATION	, the After-Dinner Speech .

		To such forms of speaking , we Americans , as has often been pointed out , are greatly inclined ; every one of us may therefore read Professor
Sears	ORGANIZATION	's book with a sort of personal interest .

		It includes not only a discussion of the different forms noted above , but also of the different qualities necessary to such speaking , and also -LRB- indeed , the topic is treated first -RRB- an analysis of the elements of such an address , as purpose , subject , particular parts .

		The topic is undoubtedly one of very considerable and very broad interest .

		And although we regret in this book a sort of vagueness or even of inaccuracy which we sometimes perceive , we presume that these matters are almost of necessity incident to a mode of treatment which will put the topic in an attrac - tive manner before the large audience which will find interest in it .

		A certain catholicity of taste , if it be genuine , is generally earnest of power of mind as well as breadth .

		A man may be familiar with
Leopardi	PERSON	and
Senancour	PERSON	and the poetry of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, and yet be a prig .

		He may be devoted to
Browning	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, and yet be merely following a current fashion .

		He may see great and wonderful things in
Walt Whitman	LOCATION	's Hermcneuiic crtiicitm .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, every line , and yet be what he too often is .

		He may be interested in
Hauptmann	LOCATION	, and yet have no espe - cial care for literature beyond a sort of journalistic '' modernity . ''

		But it is not easy to imagine a man to have had all these interests without being , or at least becoming , himself rather an interesting per - sonality .

		There has also been held to be a certain sacramental effect in a great author ; so that a man who has read Balzac , for instance , must be different from a man who has not .

		Such an effect may not be inevitable with one or another , but to some de - gree it is inevitable after such broad reading as we have been speaking of .

		Here are two adequate reasons for looking at Mr.
W. N. Guthrie	PERSON	's `` Poet Prophets '' -LRB-
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Nor will the book disappoint confident expectation .

		As a rule , we distrust the criticism that takes as a fundamental position the view implied in that title , because that criticism is too apt to be a kneading-up of the whole - wheat flour of
Carlyle	LOCATION	with the water of book-club wisdom , often without the yeast of individuality .

		But a follower of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	is not apt to have tidings of
Leopardi	LOCATION	, nor is a book-club prophet apt to speak intelligently of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Guthrie	PERSON	's table of contents restored the equanimity shaken by his title .

		We recommend his book to the reader .

		From a good many of his opinions we dissent .

		But that minor matter is lost in the refreshing feeling which comes from a new volume of essays on literature , that is neither a bundle of clever enough aperrus dredged up from forgotten periodicals , nor a few pleasant revivals of current literary gossip .

		This is a volume of essays on literary topics , thought out coherently and in earnest , and put down seriously , although not with the heavy hand that allows noth - ing for the amenities of writing .

		.

		We think that Mr.
Guthrie	PERSON	on the whole takes a standpoint some - what too philosophical .

		We think that this pre - vents him from being a great critic , because it does not disclose some more purely literary values .

		It may also prevent some from reading him with pleasure , because he often gets beyond the easy com - prehension of the healthy general reader .

		Still , this is rather a small point , and perhaps also something of a matter of opinion .

		In the latest issue of the '' Contem - P rai 7 Science Series '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- we have an admirable monograph upon an extremely important but neglected subject , the blessed gift of sleep .

		The book comes originally from
Russia	LOCATION	; and its author ,
Marie de Manace	PERSON	`` ine , exhibits an unusual power of judicious statement and orderly arrangement .

		The volume sums up in a very readable form our knowledge regarding the condition in which we pass a third of our lives .

		This knowledge is grouped about four headings , the physiology of sleep , its pathology , its hygiene , and its psychology .

		What occurs within the body during sleep ; the intensity of sleep at various pe - riods of the night ; the changes in the nature of sleep as we grow older ; the changes in the circula - tion of the blood , in respiration , and , most signifi - cant of all , in the nervous system , these and many equally important factors that distinguish the con - dition of the body in sleep from that in waking hours are clearly described in the light of recent research .

		The pathology is mainly given over to the nature and varieties of insomnia , and of its opposite , the excessive tendency to sleep , and also to sleep-like conditions , somnambulism , half-waking states , and the like .

		How we ought to sleep is told us in no pedantic or arbitrary strain , but in the light of ascer - tained principles judiciously applied with due refer - ence to age and health and habits and condition of life .

		The psychology is mainly concerned with the mental activities during sleep ; the direction of the attention ; the subdued but not perfectly passive senses ; the alert lower centres , and the operation of the mind in dreams .

		The dream-world , however individual and fantastic , yet has its laws and prin - ciples .

		The light of psychological research has penetrated into the recesses of the sleeping soul , and to a certain extent has shown what stuff our dreams are made of .

		Perhaps the day is not distant when we shall pay as much attention to the formation of good habits of sleep as of good habits during our waking hours , and the determination of what is wholesome in the one case as in the other can come only as the result of a comprehensive study of our mental and bodily activities .

		A valuable introduc - tion to such study is furnished by this well-written volume .

		Its value is further enhanced for English readers by copious additions to the English edition , including mainly those due to the ingenuity and industry of English and American workers .

		One of the most universal tendencies among clever people is a leaning toward private theatricals : almost everybody , indeed , has something of it .

		It is true that in most cases the feeling never comes to any sort of realization ; but it comes to realization often enough to make it a little curious at first thought that there are not more good amateur plays than there are .

		Second thoughts , of course , inform one that the reason is that in this matter the universal desire of the amateur is to be professional .

		Ama - teur companies are apt to prefer rather difficult plays from the real stage , society comedies of the day , for instance .

		At any rate , since half the fun lies in being professional , amateur plays are not much sought after .

		We think , however , that there are many who may find in '' The Charm , and other Drawing-Room Plays , '' by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	and Mr.
Walter H. Pollock	PERSON	, some little things that will be quite as good to give as many that are much more ambitious .

		Drawing-room plays these are called , and they depend , therefore , more on costume than on scenery and more on dialogue than on situation .

		Two or three of them are costume plays which give excellent opportunity for exquisite and careful preparation .

		But there are half a dozen which need no more than the costume of the day For private theatricals .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 and the opportunities of any drawing-room .

		They are all short and well within the reach of any set of amateurs who are not absolute beginners .

		Absolute beginners should confine themselves to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		We do not know that it is much to the purpose to comment on the literary characteristics of these plays , but it may not be out of place to remark that they have not the slightest reminiscence or flavor of present literary conditions .

		Ibsen ,
Hauptmann	PERSON	,
Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Pinero	PERSON	, might never have existed so far as these sketches indicate .

		They continue the traditions of the British Drama of twenty-five years ago .

		The average amateur may not object to this point : technically , the plays are clever and suited to their purpose ; that may be enough for him .

		But we do not see why , in a period of considerable dramatic ferment , the amateur as well as the professional should not be aware of cur - rent movement in his art ttudyof Anarctiitm .

		Mr - E - V ;
Zenker	PERSON	's book on
Anarch	PERSON	- ism , published by Messrs.
Putnams	PERSON	, deserves particular attention .

		The author has dealt with a very obscure and strange theory , and with conflicting phases of that theory , in a sane and orderly way .

		He gives sufficient biographical , historical , and economic information to make the subject clear to any intelligent reader , and he has inserted authoritative statements from original sources at critical points , so that the book may be used as evidence .

		It can hardly be said that his discussion of the greatest leaders is adequate and final , though it is a good sketch .

		The conclu - sion is moderate in tone and free from all elements of panic .

		The author thinks that a policy of sup - pression of discussion and of unusual and special penalties is not desirable .

		The criminal law is , as
Lord Koseberry	PERSON	said , amply sufficient to cope with the '' party of action . ''

		Some phases of truth have been brought out by Anarchists , and the criticism of existing society can best be met by more compe - tent theory and by practical measures of ameliora - tion .

		`` We therefore demand for the Anarchist doctrine , as long as it does not incite to crime , the right of free discussion and the tolerance due to every opinion , quite without regard to whether it is more dangerous , or more probable , or more practic - able than any other opinion . ''

		The social function of Anarchism is in its criticism of Socialism as the tyranny of the majority over the individual , and in its criticism of a social system which neglects the least influential members of society .

		We are not wholly in favor of col - lections of already-published stories by well-known novelists , nor of the essays of by-gone years by well-known men of let - ters , nor , by anybody , of the weekly or monthly contributions to some page or column .

		But when a man eminent in some other respects gathers together such work as he has had time to do in letters , the re - sult is apt to be interesting .

		Thus , the president of a great university makes a selection from his occa - sional articles of twenty-five years , and the result has value ; or a great preacher publishes the non - clerical addresses or essays he has had time to write , and the result again has value .

		In like manner Mr.
Henry Cabot	PERSON	Lodge 's '' Certain Accepted He - roes '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a book which stands a little aside from the ordinary collections of essays .

		Books of this character always have , besides the intrinsic value of their contents , a sort of additional value in the known position of their author .

		It is , however , rather interesting to look at this book without any recollection of what we really know of the author .

		Here are three or four essays on literary subjects , three which are chiefly political , and two which are historical .

		Or , again , we have two which would reverse current conceptions , two which would show that in some directions we are as good as the En - glish , two which have a full-blooded interest in public affairs , two which are the result of disinter - ested curiosity , and one other .

		The book is written by a man of wide range of interest , a man who believes in public life and in
America	LOCATION	too , a man who has the curiosity of the scholar , as well , per - haps , as a certain amount of the current pleasure in removing ancient landmarks .

		It may be that we have here enough criteria to identify at once the junior Senator from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps he will not thank us for having hinted that the field of literature is not that in which he is most at home .

		But he can not find fault with us for considering his essays better than some work we have seen by writers who are more definitely thought of as men of letters .

		A notable publication , by Messrs.
D. C.	PERSON	contribution to
Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of the second part of Goethe study .

		Goethe 's Faust , '' edited , with Intro - duction and Notes , by Professor
Calvin Thomas	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, is a noteworthy event in the history of Goethe study in
America	LOCATION	.

		We had sev - eral editions of the
First Part	ORGANIZATION	before that by Pro- fessor
Thomas	PERSON	, though none so good ; and in the present volume he has been guided by the same idea that characterized his former work .

		He em - phasizes the value of '' Faust '' as literature : not as didactics or philosophy or allegory , but as a work of art .

		The editorial matter shows abundant evi - dence of sound linguistic scholarship and of thor - ough familiarity with the more immediate depart - ment of Goethe philology , but it is the literary aspect of the work that renders it distinctive .

		In an Introduction of some seventy pages , Professor
Thomas	PERSON	goes into a careful study of the genesis of the poem .

		He traces the idea of the division into two parts : the growth of the
Helena	ORGANIZATION	episode , and its connection in completed form with the first and second and with the last two acts .

		More briefly , the Second Part as a whole is considered ; and fin - ally some critical observations are added .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	has no occult interpretation to urge , is not even concerned to explain away the inconsistencies 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, of the work or to argue a unity that the poet never imagined that he had given his work .

		His study has been , rather , a labor of love that has found its own highest reward in the spiritual assimilation of the master 's thought , and that seeks to open to the student the same rich treasure .

		The hundred and twenty pages of notes discuss real difficulties , ex - plain allusions that might he unfamiliar to the ordi - nary reader , present the results of the best and most scholarly criticism , but do not pretend to be ex - haustive or to discuss the pros and cons of disputed interpretations .

		The work makes it possible for the student interested in
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's poetry to read and enjoy his greatest work .

		Its result should and doubtless will be to promote the study of '' Faust '' in our colleges and by the intelligent and reading public .

		At first glance Mr.
Arthur Hassall	PERSON	's A handbook of Hand-book of European History , European history ... o _ .

		.

		, _ * ... '' 476 to 1871 -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- seems superfluous , since there already exists the hand - book of Floetz , with an English translation .

		But on examination one finds in Mr.
Hassall	PERSON	's work a much fuller and more complete array of facts , cov - ering a much less extended field .

		The book is therefore not without its reason for being .

		The arrangement is also an improvement , and a vast improvement , on that of
Ploetz	PERSON	.

		If we could add that the work was perfectly accurate , or even reasonably so , there could be no higher praise .

		But , unfortunately , it is not accurate ; and thus the one eminent virtue of a hand-book of dates is wanting .

		Opening the book at random , one discovers on care - ful examination that there are six errors on pages 146 and 147 .

		The
Synod of Dort	ORGANIZATION	is said to have met in
1618	DATE	, while the correct date is
1619	DATE	; the deposition of Ferdinand of
Bohemia	LOCATION	is given as taking place in
April , 1619	DATE	, instead of
August	DATE	.

		The battle of the
White Hill	ORGANIZATION	is placed in
1621	DATE	, while it was fought in
1620	DATE	; the
Protestant Union	LOCATION	was dis - solved in
April	DATE	, but this compilation says the month was
May	DATE	; it speaks of the Four Articles of
Perth	LOCATION	, but there were Five , and it gives the date of their enactment as
August 25 , 1618	DATE	, instead of
August 27	DATE	.

		Errors so numerous and so inexcusable render the work of but small value .

		A new
Life of William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	.

		The world 's interest in the great leader in the Dutch War for Inde - pendence , like that in our own
Washington	LOCATION	, seems to grow rather than abate , and thus each has met successfully the final test of greatness .

		Last year we welcomed the scholarly and fascinating volumes of our American student ,
Miss Ruth Putnam	PERSON	; now the veteran English scholar and author , Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, has put out another study of the great Dutch patriot in the '' Foreign Statesmen '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's life of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	has been recog - nized as a model of its kind : a brief political bi - ography that is clear and impartial , yet with the vitality and interest that come from deep interest in the subject and profound study of it .

		He has the ability to see the faults in his hero , and yet see them subordinate to that hero 's great qualities .

		This new book is a worthy companion to the former , and portrays a character in many ways like that of the great Puritan .

		The author 's knowledge of the sixteenth century is so intimate that he is able to put before the reader in brief compass the complex situation of European affairs , not attempting to fol - low its tangled threads , but to show the leading motives that shaped the conduct of English , French , German , and Spanish rulers in their relations to the desperate struggle of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	for political and religious liberty .

		And the frank disclosure of the weaknesses of
William	LOCATION	, his prevarications , sub - tlety , and occasional wrong-headedness , only fur - nishes the contrast that makes his steadfastness , his complete self-sacrifice , his far-seeing statesmanship , and his broad religious toleration in an exceedingly narrow age , the more resplendent .

		The busy man can come to know the real
William	LOCATION	through this little book ; while the historical specialist will be grateful to the author , for it is a fresh study from the sources .

		Pleasant studies out of doors .

		Mr.
Charles M. Skinner	PERSON	's latest vol - ume gives a hint of his piquant way of putting things in its title , '' With Feet to the Earth '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by which is meant the attitude necessary to the pedestrian .

		Mr.
Skin	PERSON	- ner is a lover of Nature , and is never in better mood than when he is with her or talking about her .

		She sets his thoughts at work , and the pen puts down the results in serious , humorous , and always choice phraseology .

		The ten sketches which make up the present volume relate the author 's experience in a series of rambles in the city and the country , at different seasons of the year and varying hours of the day and night .

		There is no particular study of animal or plant life apparent , but there is a keen and broad appreciation of all that lives out of doors , and much apt and suggestive reflection upon the mani - fold phases of earth and sky , and upon the human life which gives interest to the scenes of earth .

		The titles are : '' Ex - travagance at College , '' '' Brains and Brawn , '' `` Hazing , '' `` Theatre Manners , '' `` Woman 's Dress , '' '' Tobacco and Manners , '' '' Newspaper Ethics , '' etc. .

		In point of precept , the book is an excellent one for young readers especially ; though we doubt if the college-bred youth of to-day will have much patience with the Queen-Anne mannerisms and old-time arti - ficialities and conceits of style generally with which Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	thought fit to stucco over much of his '' Easy Chair '' moralizing .

Clarence Moores	PERSON	Weed , recently published under the title of '' Life Histories of American Insects '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Its entire aspect is engaging , from the large open type , handsome page , and abundant illustrations , to the curiously pied cover besprinkled with bugs and beetles on an underground of leaves .

		Twenty-six species or groups of species are figured in the book , and their stories told in clear and explicit terms .

		In many respects the story of insect life is the story of human life on a diminutive scale .

		Tbe instincts and appetites are strong and crude , the sagacity and artifice manifested are astonishing , and the whole history , from egg to imago , shows the mani - fold resemblances between man and the lower grades of animal life .

		It is `` a companion book for students and travellers , '' running into upwards of six hundred pages , and richly illustrated with maps , diagrams , and photographic plates .

		The work is made useful in every imaginable way , and has , of course , the additional advantage of being entirely op to date .

		We may at the same time mention the publication of '' The Christian Monuments of
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Black -RRB- , by
H. M. and M. A. R. T.	PERSON	, which is the first part of a '' Handbook to Christian and Ecclesiastical

		The entries run nearly up to six thousand , and are , of course , selected from a much larger possible number .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	notes an advanced demand for French writers of the eighteenth century , and sustained values for works on English literature , sport , and early gardening , as well as for Americana , and extra-illustrated volumes .

		On the other hand ,
Cruikshankiana	PERSON	and Kelmscott books show some signs of a tendency to go out of fashion .

		We noticed in these columns a few months ago a very helpful book on Latin Manuscripts .

		The same class of readers to whom that book appeals advanced students and teachers will have reason to thank Mr.
W. M. Lindsay	PERSON	, of
Jesus College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, for his '' Handbook of Latin Inscriptions '' just issued from the press of
Allyn & Bacon	ORGANIZATION	.

		After stating very lucidly , in the introductory paragraphs , some of the fundamen - tal principles of form changes in
Latin	LOCATION	, the author gives a collection of inscriptions in illustration of these changes from the earliest period down to '' Imperial and Late Latin . ''

		For long years to come , as in the past , a large proportion of Latin teaching preparatory to college must be done by those who have not had the advantages of graduate study and have not the means to secure for themselves the published results of classi - cal research .

		For these teachers , whose embarrassing position is their misfortune and not their fault , such handbooks as this are an inestimable boon , and the friends of classical study may well work and pray that their number may increase .

		That the '' reader '' still holds its own as an educa - tional device is evident from the many publications of this description that continue to issue from the press .

		But the crusade against the fragmentary reader of the traditional sort is having its effect , and some degree of unity is usually aimed at by the modern compiler .

Brambles	ORGANIZATION	, '' has been engaged on a novel , and that it is to be called `` A Lady 's Sword '' ; that the title of ''
George Egerton	PERSON	's '' long story is to be '' The Wheels of God '' ; that
Menie Muriel Dowie	PERSON	has written a rival to her `` Gallia '' ; and that Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	, whose '' American Wives and English Husbands '' is almost delivered by the binders , has ready another novel , a sort of companion to this , to be entitled '' The Great Black Oxen . ''

		Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's new romance will deal with the suppression of brigandage in
Apulia	LOCATION	.

		I find that Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	's story is to be called ''
Elissa	PERSON	, '' and Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's '' The Changeling . ''

		All this I need not have retailed , no doubt ; but even old news requires reviving occasionally , just to keep us in mind of what it may often be very necessary not to forget .

		Now-a-days , one hears of coming events so far ahead of their happening that when they do occur they come as a surprise .

		I may , however , add , by way of apology for referring to these writers and their works , that '' The Wheels of God '' will be well worth reading .

		It is Mrs.
Claremont	PERSON	's first essay at a long story , and its theme is sure to interest and fascinate .

		Mr.
Frank Mathew	PERSON	is an able story-teller , and his new book is said to be even better than his last .

		We have living in
London	LOCATION	a very charming and very facile young widow , who writes under the name of
G. Colmore	ORGANIZATION	.

		She has already written a volume of poems , and one or two novels ; but none have made much im - pression .

		I have had occasion , lately , to read the proof sheets of a new book of verses she is passing through the press , and I confess their contents have astonished me not a little .

		The poems are collectively called '' Points of View , '' a title which seems to give no clue of any value .

		Therefore I shall say that the '' points of view '' refer to the excuses for '' the conduct of life '' which various individuals have to offer for their partic - ular sins of omission or commission .

		The writer shows a remarkable facility for versifying ; but the chief strength of her work is in the keen-sighted sympathy it everywhere displays .

		If the book does not get talked about , then it must be either that I am an easily im - pressed person , or that the world of readers is become sadly blase .

		You will be glad to hear that
Burton	PERSON	's masterpiece in travellers ' tales , '' The Pilgrimage to Mecca and Me - dinah , '' is at last to be published in a cheap and handy form .

		It will be remembered that the copyright of the first edition of this great work expires in the present year .

		In
1879	DATE	, however , a third edition was issued in which the late Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	included many revi - sions and alterations .

		This edition , under the editor - ship of Lady
Burton	PERSON	, was issued about four years ago in two volumes .

		Now the copyright of this last issue has been acquired by Messrs.
George Bell	PERSON	& Sons , and the two volumes with all the illustrations will soon form part of that firm 's ''
Bohn	PERSON	's
Standard Library	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		When published , they will make the most remarkable two - dollars ' worth of reading in any language .

		We are promised the completion of the printed cat - alogue of the books in the British Museum , early in the twentieth century .

		This catalogue has been a good many years in the making , and when it is finished a se - ries of supplemental volumes will have to be started immediately ; but had it never have been begun one would have wondered where on earth the officials in charge of our
National Library	ORGANIZATION	would have placed the manuscript-catalogue .

		When the printing commenced , the MS. volumes numbered 3,000 ; what they would have amounted to now , it would be difficult to say .

		Even in the printed form , the reference set in the reading-room , which has blank leaves for additions , will make a goodly row of a thousand volumes .

		Two or three new publishers are about to appear in
London	LOCATION	, but what they are going to publish is not yet known .

		One of them , Mr.
Gerald Duckworth	PERSON	, learned his business with
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, so that we may expect prettily got up books , at any rate ; but whether he is to publish new works , or will follow the advice of the Authors ' Society , and re-make the old books , I can not say .

		Another new-comer , Mr.
John Long	PERSON	, has set himself the task of catering for the novel - reading public , and already , I learn , he has in the press stories by Mrs.
Lovett Cameron	PERSON	,
Miss Esmd Stuart	PERSON	,
F. W. Robinson	PERSON	, and Dr.
Gordon Stables	PERSON	.

		At this rate our
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	will become a wealthy body ,
fifty-two dollars	MONEY	per member , per annum , soon mounts up .

		But what are they going to do ?

		``
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	, '' the other day , made a speech on `` Local Patriotism '' ; by way of illustration he related the following experience : '' Not long ago I was travel - ling from
Aberdeen	LOCATION	to
Perth	LOCATION	.

		A man sitting opposite studied me for a minute , and then , evidently being con - vinced that I had average intelligence , and could appre - ciate a great sight if I saw it , he said , ' If you will stand up with me at the window , I will show you something in a minute ; you will only get a glimpse suddenly and for an instant . '

		I stood .

		He said , Can you see that ? '

		I saw some smoke , and said so .

		That 's Kirriemuir , ' he answered .

		I sat down , and he sat opposite me , and watched my face to see that the fact that I had had a glimpse of
Kirriemuir	LOCATION	, or rather of its smoke , was one I thoroughly appreciated , and would carry in retentive memory for the rest of my life .

		Then I said , ' Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	was born there . ' '

		Yes , ' he said , ' he was ; and I was born there myself . ' ''

		Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	, the mountaineer , has come back from his expedition to the
Andes	LOCATION	, and is being interviewed right and left .

		Of course , his adventures are to be embodied in a book , for which , I need hardly say , the younger publishers have competed not a little .

		The fortunate firm is now ready , and announces the work for the coming autumn , to be issued in such elaborate fashion as to make the handsomest book of travels ever published .

		Well , I hope they will make a success of it .

		But I can not , for the life of me , see what benefit is to be got by paying a writer a price which forbids a profit on the publication of his work , unless the work prove a phenomenal success .

		No doubt , Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	's book
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 will be hailed `` the book of the season '' ; still , it will require much more '' booming '' and puffing ere the money speculated find its way back to the speculator 's pocket .

		Mr.
W. E. Norris	PERSON	has been airing his opinions on the chances of success of new writers .

		He declares snch chances to be practically not given , because of the enormous success of a few novelists .

		There is much in this ; but not everything .

		Mr.
Norris	PERSON	forgets that with the increase of success has come a keener competition for snch writers among publishers , and also an increase in the number of publishers themselves .

		Since , how - ever , all the publishers can not have the few who are assured of popularity , many new writers are eagerly sought for by the expectant few who are left waiting , and these live for the purpose of '' discovering '' a rising genius , and in the hope of nursing and advertising him into fame ; so that the the new writer never had a bet - ter chance of a hearing than he has to-day .

		There never was a time when there were so many really clever journalists and literary workers , and the publisher knows it .

		Then , too , there is a tendency toward cheaper forms of publications ; and we shall eventually arrive at the form of the French yellow-back brochure , and issue our light literature at two-and-sixpence , or three-and - sixpence .

		The time shall be when an author may truly call himself popular , since he will count his readers by hundreds of thousands .

		It goes withont saying , that such a method of publishing will send the `` subscrip - tion library '' to the wall .

		Well , there is not much to regret in that possibility .

		The subscription library in this country has served its purpose , and must of ne - cessity be extinguished , or die of want of support .

		People who want to read books they can not afford to buy will go to our public libraries , when these are as excellently served and managed as are yours .

		Then the bookseller will have his chance , and will have no cause to complain of poor business and no '' living wage . ''

		So far , I have heard not a word from your side of the water which would lead me to believe that you have seen the publications of the
Vale Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		I think you ought to have them .

		The books are published by
Messrs. Hacon & Ricketts	ORGANIZATION	from type specially designed by Mr.
Charles Ricketts	PERSON	, and with illustrations drawn and cut on wood by the same artist .

		The editions are very small , and must soon find their way into the libra - ries of collectors .

		Personally , I prefer the Vale type to the
Kelmscott	LOCATION	it is more in accordance with the best traditions of printing .

		The new weekly which is to rise out of the ashes of '' The New Review '' is being '' made ready '' as fast as money and good brains can make it .

		It is to be a sort of three-penny '' Spectator '' with more space to be de - voted to literature , art , and the drama , than to politics and '' questions of the day . ''

		We are to have the first number some time in
February	DATE	.

		Goodness alone knows if it is coming to stay .

		We have tried here again and again to make successful rivals to our older weeklies ; but somehow or other , they do n't keep long .

		`` The Realm , '' `` The British Review , '' `` The National Ob - server , '' are among such sorrowful examples .

		I am beginning to be dogmatic on the matter of new journals , and to say that even the most richly backed can stand no chance of life , without it come with quite a new pur - pose to fulfil , a new aim to achieve , and a new expres - sion with which to captivate and convince .

		Red covers of the most lurid hue envelope the new edition of '' A Man and a Woman , '' by Mr.

$ 1,721,474 $ 1,307,675	MONEY	Total for entire country , 1,806,476 1,373,230 It will be seen that nearly all of the printed matter imported is entered in the eleven dis - tricts above given , and the first noticeable fact revealed by inspection of the figures is that very few books pass through custom-houses west of the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	.

		Less than five per cent of the whole is specifically unaccounted for in the above table , and of this five per
cent	MONEY	about one-fifth comes to
California	LOCATION	ports of entry .

		These facts do not mean , of course , that few books from abroad find their way into the trans -
Mississippi	LOCATION	section of the country , but rather that our foreign printed matter , which naturally comes across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, is mostly entered at
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	ports , and afterwards distributed by importing booksellers and library agents .

		It must also be remembered that the claim of
New York	LOCATION	to three-fourths of the total importation by no means indicates that all of these books are intended for local consumption .

		Still , it is only natural to expect that
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	should be , in about this order , the four chief ports of entry for 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, printed matter .

		Chicago gets more free books than
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, but the difference is more than compensated for by the larger dutiable importation of the latter city .

		One is at once struck by the discrepancy between the free and the dutiable importation of several of the ports included in the list .


St. Louis	LOCATION	, for example , with a ratio of twenty-four to one ,
New Haven	LOCATION	with a ratio of nearly thirty to one , and
Providence	LOCATION	, with a ratio of over sixty to one , are the most noticeable instances .

		A moment 's reflection , however , will explain this anomaly , since the three cities named are university and library centres , and without their free books for these institutions , would sink into insignificance as book importing com - munities .

		It is evident , also , that the exemp - tion from duty of all books purchased by pub - lic libraries and educational institutions permits nearly sixty per cent of our importations to come in without paying tribute to the modern robber-barons of the custom-house .

		For this relief much thanks ; and yet , when we scan the footings-up of the columns , it is clear that a still more important moral remains to be pointed .

		For what do these figures signify , after all , in their bearing upon our attitude as a nation toward scholarship and enlightenment ?

		Simply this : that for a paltry addition of one-third of a
million dollars	MONEY	to our revenue , we submit every scholar in the country to a petty exaction , if not to a great personal annoyance , whenever he needs for his work some book not `` made in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Not only do we levy this tax upon consignments of books , but we even ransack the personal luggage of the returning traveller , and , pettier still , tear open the wrappings of everything like a book that comes from abroad by post , for fear that some poor teacher or stu - dent or man of letters should find it too easy to pursue his calling , or that the rising gener - ation should be lured away from material pur - suits by the too manifest delights of the schol - astic ideal .

		The notion that the paths of cul - ture should be smoothed rather than made rugged by public initiative has not yet pene - trated into theconsciousnessof the average legis - lator , and the tax upon knowledge still stands , and probably will stand for another generation , as a complete refutation of the pretence that as a nation we care seriously for the interests of culture .

		We have no intention of repeating upon this occasion the well-worn arguments against the tax upon imported books .

		They need no iteration for intelligent people , and they are quite meaningless to '' statesmen '' of our fav - orite type .

		But the amazing folly of such a tax is something that it may be possible , by dint of persistent hammering , to drive into the heads of the politicians who are responsible for the perpetuation of this form of barbarism .

		The tax is supposed to be laid in the interests of protection , although it would be a topsy-turvy logic that could show any industry to be pro- tected by such an import , but do its supporters realize that it creates in every scholar and lover of books an implacable enemy of the policy of which it is so unwisely held to be a part , of any policy , indeed , that could possibly be turned to so perverse a purpose ?

		A third of a
million dollars	MONEY	is added to our revenue say one fif - tieth of the amount that might be added by a barely perceptible increase of the tax upon beer , and for this an artificial barrier is built up against the intercourse of thought , an obstacle is set in the path of every seeker after culture , a proclamation is made to the civilized world that our country imposes a penalty upon learn - ing .

		We are well aware that there is no pros - pect for years to come of the abandonment of this foolish and ignorant policy , but it can never be quite unseasonable to hold it up to scorn , for it is only by aiding in the slow growth of a more enlightened public opinion upon subjects which , like this , do not appeal to the selfish interests of the masses , that it can ever become possible for the cultured `` remnant '' to make an effec - tive exercise of its beneficent influence upon the stolid democracy of which it is a part .

		FRENCH GENIUS IN CRITICISM .

		Last year there came to our shores one whom I suppose we may call the foremost literary critic of
France	LOCATION	; and if that position is justly his , then we have had the honor of entertaining the leading critic of our day .

		In that statement I do not ignore the literary excellence of the critiques of Mr. An - drew
Lang	PERSON	, Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, or Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	.

		Bat these men are , to a cer - tain degree , exotic in that brilliant generalization which characterizes and has always characterized the French genius in criticism .

		In
M. Ferdinand Brune	PERSON	- tiere , however , we have the traditions of his race at work in genetic exegesis .

		The modern science of criticism had its birth in
France	LOCATION	; and while there have been as many shades to its critical taste as are to be found on the paint - er 's board , yet through canons of taste logically derived , or through its wide-reaching influence , it
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 stands supreme in modern criticism .

		The French mind is de natura critical ; the intellectuality of that country is preeminently systematic .

		Criticism , to have the permanency of art , must be synthetic ; there must be order , precision , lucidity ; the mind must be exact and mathematical .

		Whenever the motley array of disorganized thought comes under the direc - tion of such a power , there must necessarily be the orderly march of ideas .

		This has been the living force of the French mind in the progress of the world .

		It has given a continuity to its own litera - ture such as no other modern literature possesses ; and , further , it has crystallized and generalized , in the modern development , the mass of data which the reverie of the North and the metaphor of the South have placed at its door .

		I do not mean to say that the other modern literatures have not had critical periods in which to stop and think , and thus , with the elimination of insignificant detail , to catch the spirit of their drifting , and to prepare themselves anew for that utterance which is but the voice of their age .

		If we look at this closely , however , it seems to me that we must certainly see that with the Teutonic race the periods of profitable criticism are the exception .

		In the '' Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes , '' which is nothing but the struggle of tem - peramental forces in literature and in life , we find all sense of proportion and perspective lost to
England	LOCATION	and to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Leasing stands a monument to the refutation of that statement ; and if a man were not known by the company he keeps , I should be inclined to include
Addison	PERSON	.

		It may be thought strange that Pope is not included here ; but to me it seems that in his attempt to lie on the bed that
Boileau	PERSON	laid for him he is another example of a spirit out of his time too shallow or too expedient to serve as true critic .

		The critics of
America	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, or the continent , who hold to-day the ear of the people , are those that have drank deep and copious draughts at the in - spired fount of French criticism :
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	, Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	; Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, whose '' HauptstrOmungen in der Litteratur des XIX .

		Jahrhunderts '' has been epoch - making throughout
Germany	LOCATION	and
Scandinavia	LOCATION	.

		The claim for the superiority of French criticism does not ex necessitate speak for the intellectual superiority of the race , quite the contrary .

		The abandon of untold riches which characterizes the Teutonic race may be preferred to the orderly arrangement of limited wares ; our sympathy may be with the Goth , but we can not refuse our admi - ration to the classic poise and hauteur of the effete Latin , with his blood tingling with the despair of the Vandal and the impetuous ardor of the Celt .

		It is merely the question of creation or exegesis : Jesus Christ will always stand for more than
Strauss	PERSON	or Renan .

		As said above , it is the love of synthesis , of orderly review , that is characteristic of French life in letters .

		I know of no nation that is so fond of recapitulation and of inventory of stock in trade .

		As early as the middle of the sixteenth century , we stand not infrequently in the presence of such books as '' Receuil de 1 ` Origine de la Langne et
Poe	PERSON	` sie Fran - gaise , '' in which we have extracts and the glimmer of critical generalization which is so brilliant with them now .

		It was the same love of order and epi - tome that caused the epigrammatic French to con - ceive the first newspaper in the modern sense of the word , the '' Gazette de
France	LOCATION	, '' which appeared at the beginning of the seventeenth century under no less a sponsor than
Cardinal Richelieu	PERSON	, whose devo - tion to centralization is typical of all which that idea stands for ; it is the animus of the French Acad - emy , where the validity of censorship in literature is vested in its constructed models ; it is what makes practicable the sovereignty of kings , with their motto of I ` etat , c'est moi incised on a background oi fleur-de-lis ; and , above all , it is the reason that , despite the intellectuality of individual French Pro- testants , the creative period of the nation has been under the influence of Holy Church , whose theme and purpose is centralization and synthesis .

		Coordination and the harmony of related parts is what the French mind has sought , and according to which it has worked .

		There has always been sym - metry of the various faculties .

		Eclecticism , to the exclusion of one , has indeed , in this sweep of years , occurred ; but , from the `` Principes de literature '' of
Charles Battenx	PERSON	, which were derived from the study of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	, and , in connection with
Winckel	PERSON	- mann 's `` Gesehichte der Kunst des Alterthums , '' may have influenced
Lessing	PERSON	's '' Laokoon , '' to Vic - tor Cousin 's '' Le Vrai , le Beau , et le Bien , '' there are but sporadic suggestions of it .

		This explains to us why those most picturesque historical summaries of the French have treated of revolutions at times of storm and stress ; why the historical genius has sought mediaeval themes at times of Romantic unrest ; why , during periods of classical reaction , it has sought its inspiration in sunny
Greece	LOCATION	.

		In explanation of this I am tempted to cite the revolutionary themes of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	, of
Tocqueville	LOCATION	, of Mignet , of
Michelet	LOCATION	, of
Edgar Quinet	PERSON	; but I refrain , through length of titles , from doing so .

		Suffice it to say that the revolutions of
England	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	have received at least fair treatment in their hands .


Victor Durny	PERSON	's classical histories , which are now so popular throughout
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, were made possible through the quiescent Romantic fervor , which , just preceding it , had seen the advent of his - tories of the Crusades and of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		The philosophy and science of
France	LOCATION	have been no exception to this agreement .

		Momentary aber - rations in philosophy , such as the Port Royal letters of
Pascal	LOCATION	, which were directed against the
Jansen	PERSON	- ists , with proper perspective , receive proper value .

		And its science may yet have to declare , au fond de ses creusets , as
M. Paul Adam	PERSON	says , the discovery of the divine principle in art , '' music , painting , and poetry , as the triple reflection of one central light . ''

		138 THE DIAL -LSB-
March	DATE	l r A COMPLETE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SPORT .

		* Sportsmen , of whatever class or predilection , can scarcely complain that their interests have been neglected of late years by book publishers .

		The literature of sport has grown apace ; and we are now called upon to chronicle the appear - ance of what may be regarded as the outcome of the first serious effort to produce an ade - quate Encyclopaedia of Sport .

		When com - pleted , the work will stand without a rival in its peculiar field .

		It at once supplants its only considerable predecessor ,
Elaine	PERSON	's ''
Encyclo	PERSON	- pedia of Rural Sports , '' which first appeared in
1840	DATE	, and which ran through many editions between that date and
1870	DATE	.

		Elaine 's book was a good one in its day , but its day is past .

		Certain favorite sports football and cricket , for instance have been fairly revolutionized since
Elaine	PERSON	wrote ; while some others now in vogue have been introduced or popularized since his time .

		With the classic work of the scholarly
Strutt	PERSON	, whose '' Sports and Pastimes of the People of
England	LOCATION	'' mirrors a not unim - portant phase of the history of the Anglo-Saxon race , the one now before us hardly enters into competition .


Strutt	PERSON	's book is valuable mainly as a mine of antiquarian lore , and has little pretension to encyclopaedic scope or fulness .

		Between the present work and its two prede - cessors there is another important point of dif - ference .

		Strutt , and in the main
Elaine	PERSON	, worked single-handed ; while the volume we are now considering is the result of expert collaboration .

		The editor , the Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire , states that , in answer to his appeal for special articles , leading authorities on every branch of sport have placed their services at his dis - posal .

		Glancing over the table of contents one finds that the articles , for instance , on Angling ,
Archery	ORGANIZATION	,
Boxing	LOCATION	, Fencing ,
Lacrosse	LOCATION	, Broad - sword , and Canoeing , are from the pens of Messrs.
John Bickerdyke	PERSON	and
William Senior	PERSON	, Col.
W. Walrond	PERSON	, Messrs.
B. J. Angle	PERSON	,
Canaille Prevost	PERSON	,
E. T. Sachs	ORGANIZATION	,
A. Hutton	PERSON	, and
W. Baden-Powell	PERSON	, respectively .

		Under generic and comprehensive titles , such as Hunting , Big Game , Camping Out , are groups of specific papers , each the work of a specially qualified writer .

		The heading Athletics , for example , * THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SPORT .

		Edited by the
Earl of Suffolk	ORGANIZATION	and Berkshire ,
Hedley Peek	ORGANIZATION	, and
F. G. Aflalo	PERSON	.

		Vol - ume I. , A

New York	LOCATION	:

C. L. Lock	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , Long Jumping -LRB- C. B. Fry -RRB- ,
Pole Vault	LOCATION	- ing -LRB-
Reginald Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Walking -LRB- Fred Cotton -RRB- , Weight Putting -LRB-
G. S. Robertson	PERSON	-RRB- , and so on .

		The less important and unsigned articles have been submitted to expert revisal , and the glossaries under each subject should be especially helpful to the inquiring tyro .

		The scope of the work is wide , and intelligent sports - men will welcome the inclusion of special arti - cles full of practical hints and suggestions on such germane and important topics as First Aid ,
Taxidermy	ORGANIZATION	, and Veterinary Work .

		Natural history -LRB- mainly , of course , from the sportsman 's point of view -RRB- has not been neg - lected , and American readers will be glad to note that Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	is a leading contributor in this department .

		The important articles on Cycling -LRB- Mr.
H. Graves	PERSON	and the Countess of
Malmesbury	LOCATION	-RRB- and Golf -LRB- Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- den
H. Smith	PERSON	-RRB- occupy thirty pages and eigh - teen pages respectively .

		The former article is perhaps open to the criticism from the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can point of view that it is addressed too exclu - sively to English readers .

		A half-dozen or so pages on American '' wheels '' and '' wheeling '' would , we think , be a decided improvement in a work manifestly intended largely for circula - tion in this country .

		We may add in this con - nection that elsewhere in the volume a desire on the part of the editor to meet the special needs of American sportsmen is apparent .

		American angling and hunting are not neglected ; a table of Best
American Amateur Records	ORGANIZATION	is given under the head of Athletics ; there is a well - written generally descriptive article on Base - ball ; Mr.
J. Turner Turner	PERSON	writes on Ameri - can Camping Out ; and Mr.
Caspar Whitney	PERSON	discusses
American Football	ORGANIZATION	in his usual thor - ough and readable way .

		We hope to find in the forthcoming volume adequate papers on American Rowing and Yachting ; and we ven - ture to suggest that for the treatment of the former topic no better man could be selected than that veteran oarsman and loyal Yale coach , Mr.
Robert J. Cook	PERSON	.

		Such an article by Mr.
Cook	PERSON	might well be supplemented by a few pages from the pen of Mr.
R. C. Lehmann	PERSON	, the famous Oxford and '' Leander '' coach and beau-ideal of the English '' gentleman ama - teur . ''

		Even the warmest adherents of the Cornelian or the Light Blue must feel a lurk - ing sympathy with Mr.
Lehmann	PERSON	in his present chivalrous undertaking at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		A brief resume by Mr.
Lehmann	PERSON	of his impressions of
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 American rowing and rowing men should prove a welcome and instructive addition to the pres - ent work .

		Thus far the various articles seem to be as a rule reasonably full and explicit , when we con - sider the necessity the editor and publishers are under of attaining a due degree of compre - hensiveness of range and treatment without expanding the work to an unconscionable num - ber of volumes .

		The term '' sport '' is a very elastic one , and it would not be at all difficult to swell a sporting encyclopaedia to the formid - able dimensions of a
Dictionary of National Biography	ORGANIZATION	.

		No man is more enthusiastic , and on occasion more fondly loquacious in praise of his particular hobby , than the genuine sports - man .

		Your golfer or '' wheelman , '' for instance -LRB- as so many know to their cost -RRB- , will go on cheer - fully for hours together on their respective pet topics when once the tide of their eloquence is fairly set flowing ; and we have no doubt that the
Earl of Suffolk	ORGANIZATION	and Berkshire has found his volunteer contributors very much less diffi - cult to secure than to restrain .

		In one import - ant respect , of course , the volume gains by the manifest zeal of the writers and their personal interest in their several themes .

		It is unusu - ally readable throughout , for an encyclopaedia ; and the perfunctory note of the mere hack writer is seldom manifest .

		On the score of insufficient and superficial treatment of an important topic , we have but one special complaint to enter .

		Mr.
A. Alex	PERSON	- ander 's article on Gymnastics seems to us sur - prisingly brief and meagre in view of the general thoroughness of the volume .

		In the entirely inadequate space of two pages and a half he briefly defines his general term , and then proceeds to string together some sixteen necessarily indefinite paragraphs on Greek , Swedish , German , Danish , Russian , Spanish ,
American	ORGANIZATION	, English , and Finn gymnastics , and the Educational ,
Recreative	LOCATION	,
Acrobatic	LOCATION	, and Medical systems .

		We may note in passing , by way of showing the disproportion ateness of Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	's essay , that the writer on Croquet has devoted five pages to that simple and mori - bund game ; while even that mild form of the chase , Butterfly and Moth Catching , comes in for over a page and a half of animated descrip - tion , at the hands of the same authority .

		So we think Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	may justly be charged either with injudiciously attempting to cover too much ground in the scanty space allotted to him , or else , if in the matter of space he was left to his own discretion , with underrating and slighting a very important subject .

		As thirty - seven pages are given to Cricket , twenty-three to Football , twenty-five to Cycling , and twenty - three to Angling , we should say that fifteen pages to Gymnastics would have been some - thing like a proper allotment .

		Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	is usually accurate , so far as he goes ; but in one instance we think he has made a strikingly erroneous statement .

		In comparing the Swed - ish gymnastics with the Finnish , he animad - verts upon the `` jerky '' style of the former school .

		Now if our conception of the theory of the excellent system of Preiuebungen known as the Swedish Movements be measurably cor - rect , '' jerkiness '' is about the last quality to be predicated of them . ''

		Do n't jerk ! '' ''

		Do n't move too fast ! ''

		is the constantly repeated injunction of every teacher of the Swedish exer - cises who has mastered even the alphabet of the system .

		The plan of publication of this work , in parts , has been adopted , the editor says , in the '' con - fident expectation that those who buy the ear - lier numbers will never rest satisfied without the complete series . ''

		The initial volume cer - tainly goes far to warrant this belief .

		Mechan - ically it is one of the handsomest productions of the kind we have ever had the pleasure of handling .

		The illustrations , comprising twenty full-page photogravures and a great number of vignettes , serve well the dual purpose of adorn - ment and instruction .

		It is a really sumptuous work , possessing uses and attractions that sportsmen and lovers of fine books generally will find hard to resist .

		THE XEW ENGLAND PRIMER .

		* Mr.
Ford	PERSON	does not succeed in impressing his weight as an authority upon his history of `` The New England Primer , '' in spite of a formidable array of facts and evidences of con - siderable study .

		Both seem to be of too recent acquisition for thorough assimilation , while the writer himself is not in sufficient sympathy with his subject .

		Yet there is no doubt of his con - scientiousness , and this , with the part played by the little book in the formation of our national character , makes the work one of much interest and considerable importance . ''

		The New England Primer , '' this treatise discloses , was the combined reading book and * THB NEW EKGLAXD PKOTKR : A
History of Its Origin and Development	ORGANIZATION	.

March 1	DATE	, religious manual placed in the hands of every young American in the North from the time of its first publication , about the year
1690	DATE	, until its practical supersession a hundred and
fifty years later	DATE	.

		During this time , Mr.
Ford	PERSON	esti - mates , not less than three millions of copies were printed for use in
America	LOCATION	alone , at the rate of twenty thousand a year .

		Every copy contained an Abecedarium , a Syllabarium , and an illustrated Alphabet containing such familiar verses as
Young Obadias	LOCATION	,
David	PERSON	,
Josias	PERSON	, All were Pious .

		Zacheus he Did climb the Tree His Lord to see .

		These were followed by the '' Exhortation unto His Children , '' attributed to
John Rogers	PERSON	, to be referred to later in this article ; a Cate - chism ; and , sometimes , the Lord 's Prayer , the Apostles ' Creed , and the
Ten Commandments	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most notable original contribution of the Primer to literature is found for the first time in a
London	LOCATION	edition dated
1781	DATE	, given anony - mously and without punctuation , as follows : Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep If I should die before I wake I pray the
Lord	ORGANIZATION	my soul to take which , having been included in all subsequent reprints , came to assume something of the importance of the
Lord	ORGANIZATION	's Prayer itself .

		The word primer is derived by Professor Skeat from Prime , the first of the canonical hours , by the addition of the English suffix er .

		A book of hours would naturally take its name from the first of them , and Mr.
Ford	PERSON	himself shows that in
1490	DATE	'' A larger book of Catho - licism -LRB- sic -RRB- ... was the well-known * Book of Hours ' ; which , translated from the Latin text into English , was called ' The Prymer of
Salis	PERSON	- bury Use . ' ''

		His surmise concerning the word , set forth thus , '' The authorized primers were not school books being rather primary hence * primer ' manuals of church service , '' is an unfortunate and unnecessary guess .

		Etymology aside ,
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		is found authorizing the publication of these little books both for and against the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	, and they were afterward condemned by the
Council of Trent	ORGANIZATION	.

		Until the flight of
James II.	PERSON	, the English mon - archs successively published their own and for - bade the use of their predecessors ' primers .

		About the year
1686	DATE	, one
Benjamin Harris	PERSON	, having embroiled himself with the British gov - ernment by printing some ultra Protestant pamphlets , came to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		He it was who had published , according to one authority , '' The Protestant Tutor '' before his flight , and Mr.
Ford	PERSON	also gives him the distinction of bringing out the first American newspaper called '' Public Occurrences , '' and suppressed by proclamation almost before it was made public .

		The first edition of '' The New En - gland Primer '' was printed for
Harris	PERSON	; it bears strong resemblance to the other work from his hand ; he was such a writer and rhymester as would be likely to deliver himself of the con - tents of the two books ; and there seems to be no reason for disputing his authorship of the latter .

		The Primer filled a want in the life of
New England	LOCATION	.

		The Puritan , as Mr.
Ford	PERSON	points out , sought book-learning chiefly for the sake of reading The Book '' the single book , '' as
Lowell	PERSON	says , '' with whose language he is inti - mate . ''

		To this end , the mingling of spelling , reading , and dogmatic theology in the Primer contributed in the safest and most practical way .

		Its popularity was both immediate and endur - ing , as has been shown .

		But the editor here misses a golden opportunity , in not giving some notion of the geographical extent of its influ - ence .

		He mentions , casually enough , that it made its way into parts of
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Whether the Primer penetrated into the other colonies , and what , if any , influ - ence it had there , is not set forth , nor is there anything to show that any investigation was made in that behalf .

		Still , its circulation was so great that it is a matter for surprise that not more than forty examples of all the impres - sions made during the seventeenth and eigh - teenth centuries have come down to us .

		All that are known to be extant are described in this book , and their prices , running into the hun - dreds of dollars , given in detail .

		There seems to be no possible reason for not mentioning the price they commanded at the time of their pub - lication as well .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	attributes the scarcity of these early examples to the natural destructiveness of childhood and '' the slight value set by adults on children 's books of their own time . ''

		A more potent factor would be their '' slight value '' in the most literal senses their exceeding cheapness , commonness , and flimsiness ; for
New England	LOCATION	thrift can be de - pended upon to prevent the destruction of any - thing costly , now as then .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's errors of detail are many , and most conspicuous on the side of religious terms .

		On one hand , he is addicted to the use of the offensive word '' Romish '' ; on the other , he insists not only upon confounding Puritans and
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 141 Separatists , but upon treating the terms as absolutely synonymous .

		Then , though the Puritans of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	were unquestionably members of the Church of
England	LOCATION	, he goes on to style them `` the dis - senters of
America	LOCATION	, '' a most astonishing de - scription of men who held to a church estab - lished by law , and persecuted all who did not come within it .

		By way of completing the cycle , the Church of
England	LOCATION	is styled '' Epis - copalian , '' even in ante-Revolutionary times .

		A more excusable blunder makes
George II	PERSON	.

		father to
George III.	PERSON	, instead of grandfather .

		But the commentator goes wrong again in speaking of the familiar and highly orthodox couplet , Whales in the sea God 's voice obey , as containing a `` somewhat difficult rhyme . ''

		If knowledge of scores of similar rhymes in
Harris	PERSON	's day does not suffice , Mr.
Henry Sweet	PERSON	's statement is authoritative : that sea and obey were perfect rhymes until '' the middle of the 18th cent. , '' and , as a matter of course , until a later day in the colonies .

		The division , in the Syllabarium and elsewhere , of words like '' be - ne-fi-ci-al '' and '' temp-ta-ti-on , '' should have shown the writer that he was dealing with the pronunciation of another day than his own .

		There is no good reason , at the present day , for wasting sympathy over the Puritan babes who had to learn by rote the tremendous doc - trines and uncouth doggerel of the Primer ; but it is a serious matter , nevertheless , and Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's continued sprightliness of manner jars from page to page .

		Most unfortunate is the collection of ancient doctrinal jests on pages 52 and 53 , used as a climax to the '' Introduc - tion '' and quite unworthy the dignity of both book and writer .

		It is a pleasure to turn to Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's better manner , as an example of which his treatment of the fables clustering around
John Rogers	PERSON	, first of the
Marian	PERSON	martyrs , may be cited .

		The `` Exhortation unto His Children '' of the Primer is prefaced by the time-honored statement that '' His wife , with nine small children , and one at her Breast , follow 'd him to the Stake , '' the ambiguity of which phrase gave rise to a con - troversy , some centuries in duration , over the number of the offspring , some engravers group - ing nine and some ten children about their devoted mother .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	shows that the verses were not written by

Robert Smith	PERSON	, another martyr ; he quotes Foxe to prove that
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's wife and children were not witnesses of his execution , and settles the number of the progeny by a further quotation from the martyrologist wherein the children are said to be '' eleven in number , ten able to go , and one sucking at the breast , '' reconciling this with
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's own testimony that he had ten children by showing that the eleventh came into the world unknown to him after he had been shut up tight in jail .

		The feature of chief interest in the work , particularly for those who have seen but do not possess the original Primer , is the faithful reproduction of its rude typography , paper , and woodcuts , the latter so extremely crude that in some cases the picture of a king , used as a frontispiece to the Primer , was not only made to serve for his successor , but , the Revolution intervening , a portrait of
George III	ORGANIZATION	.

John Hancock	PERSON	!

		And as a proof of the innocency of our forefathers , the cut of a Queen from a pack of playing cards '' the Devil 's picture-book '' was used as an illus - tration in one edition of the Primer without rebuke , and presumably without intention .

		Mechanically , the work of Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's volume is admirably done throughout .

		* The concluding volume of Mr.

		The comments already made in THE DIAL | are therefore applicable to it ; the various essays differ widely in originality and style , and there is a certain amount of repetition as a result of treating each department of social life in sever - alty : some of the writers have burdened their pages too heavily with bare statements of fact , instead of giving the vital conclusions which they had drawn from scientific study , while other writers have omitted the facts necessary to sustain their propositions properly ; some - times a tone of authority pervades an essay , * A HISTORY OF SOCIAL LIFE m ENGLAND .

		142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, and in other instances the subject-matter is left in a clearly incomplete condition ; there are even contradictory statements made by the writers of different essays .

		Yet the work is excellently well done in the main ; even better than in the earlier volumes with the possible exception of the articles on Agriculture by Mr.
Bear	PERSON	, and three out of fo , ur of Miss
Bateson	PERSON	's essays on Manners and Customs .

		The real social life of
England	LOCATION	the condi - tion of the vast mass of the population and the progress of democracy is as sparingly treated in this as in the other volumes ; and this be - comes a more serious defect in the volume which deals with recent times .

		There is lack - ing , indeed , that unity of purpose which alone is consistent with the diversity of plan involved in a work of such composite character as this one .

		There is needed , first , a clear statement of the facts which will show in a tangible man - ner the way in which present conditions and institutions differ from those of an earlier pe - riod ; and second , an explanation of the reasons why certain results have followed particular causes .

		Such is the plan which alone will justify the rewriting of history , and such a plan is wanting in the present volume as a whole .

		It is followed out , however , by Professor Mon - tague in an essay which is a gem of its kind on the History of Law .

		Miss
Bateson	PERSON	's ac - count of educational progress in the present century is also planned on the same lines .

		The central feature of the nineteenth cen - tury , beyond all question , is the material prog - ress , particularly of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and in a less degree of the world in general .

		The present volume of '' Social England '' should therefore have given this fact its due promi - nence ; and the various articles written each by an eminent specialist , on trade and agricul - ture , art and architecture , language and liter - ature , public health , morals , manners , the de - velopment of jurisprudence , the church , the army , the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, science , education , religion , and so forth , should have shown the relation of industrial forces to the other departments of social life .

		In a word , all the contributors to this volume should have had clearly in mind a definite theory of social progress , and it should have been their purpose to explain the action and reaction between the different elements of our civilization .

		In this way their efforts would have directly contributed to the solution of the social problems of the day and to the establish - ment of real democracy , both in
England	LOCATION	and his country .

		Mr.
Eiddell	PERSON	should have at least enumerated some of the '' many social and eco - nomic as well as inventive '' forces which resulted in the development of the textile industries -LRB- page 69 -RRB- , and have explained why the indus - trial revolution was most marked in these in - dustries , as well as why it antedated all others by nearly a generation .

		Professor
Symes	PERSON	should have told us why it was that '' as lately as
1796	DATE	England adopted a system which , in less than forty years , reduced almost all agri - cultural laborers to a position of pauperism '' -LRB- p. 219 -RRB- , why `` the Poor Law authorities of
London	LOCATION	began carting off waggon-loads of pau - per children to Lancashire , '' and why these and other children were '' swept into factories when they could hardly walk '' -LRB- p. 217 -RRB- .

		Dr.
Colville	PERSON	states -LRB- p. 243 -RRB- that before the close of
1833	DATE	Scotland secured her Municipal Cor - porations Bill , in advance of
England	LOCATION	; but some one of the contributors to this history of
England	LOCATION	in the nineteenth century might prop - erly have given more than half a dozen lines to the problems of city life and administration , and to their influence on civilization .

		These instances are taken at random , but they will serve to show the class bias and the political affiliations of the writers in Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's company .

		In his excellent history of law to which reference has been made , Pro- fessor
Montague	PERSON	not only sets an example to his colaborers , but he imposes on them a duty which they entirely fail to perform .

		He em - phasizes the fact that the nineteenth century is a period of direct legislation , and that a great part of our modern statutes has been concerned with what it is convenient to call public law ; and he goes on to consider those enactments which have altered the constitution of the courts of justice and the forms of procedure , have transformed ancient courts , multiplied new ones , amended rules of procedure , and more than once revised the whole administration of justice .

		He states , what everyone knows , that old departments of administration have been reorganized , new departments established , and the entire system of local government been recast ; but he adds , almost facetiously -LRB- p. 470 -RRB- , that enactments relating to subjects of this class , '' such as the New Poor Law , the Municipal Corporations Acts , the
Public Health Acts	ORGANIZATION	, and so forth , are touched upon in other chapters of the present volume . ''

		Certainly no movement has been more vital to the social life of the people of
England	LOCATION	in this century than that for the reduction of the hours of labor ; but the subject is barely
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 '' touched upon '' in a paragraph of a dozen lines -LRB- p. 423 -RRB- .

		The Christian Socialists are dismissed with even less , and
Henry Hunt	PERSON	is not even mentioned .

		The Chartist movement fares a bit better , receiving nearly two pages ; but its nominal leader is spoken of as an empty braggart -LRB- p. 115 -RRB- , and a typical demagogue of great physical prowess and considerable ora - torical gifts -LRB- p. 224 -RRB- .

		This hardly indicates a critical examination of the relation between cause and effect hi social life , or a scientific explanation of the social progress
England	LOCATION	has been making in this century .

		Indeed , there is but little in the body of the work to justify the titles to two of the chapters at least , '' The Rule of the Middle Class '' -LRB- 1846-1865 -RRB- , and `` The Succession of Democracy '' -LRB- 1865-1885 -RRB- .

		Why the population of
England	LOCATION	has trebled during the century , while that of
France	LOCATION	has remained stationary ; what has been the actual increase in national wealth , and how this enor - mous increase in the supply of the comforts of life has been distributed ; why some other dis - tribution has not occurred , or could now be brought about ; what were the peculiar features of middle-class government , and why they were not permanent , but were succeeded by demo - cratic '' influences and tendencies '' ; how we are to secure the blessings of democracy and at the same time avoid its dangerous tyrannies ; what relation there is and should be between the church and the army , and how far physical conflict hinders moral elevation ; what are the limits of public and national education as a socializing force and a power for uplifting man - kind : what are the present benefits of muni - cipal ownership , and what the necessary limits of state activity in industrial enterprises ; these and similar subjects are the ones on which a reader will seek for guidance in the succes - sive volumes of '' Social England , '' and more particularly in the closing volume of the series .

		There is one all-important social truth which the disjointed character of this work helps to enforce , namely , that there must be a certain correlation of parts in all social progress : our morals must match our money matters , or both will go wrong .

		Slavery , and even serfdom , are quite incompatible with large factories ; they can not exist side by side .

		Poverty and democ - racy are equally strangers : if we would have the one we must abolish the other .

		If we would preserve to mankind the blessings of great wealth which the material progress of the nine - teenth century has placed at our disposal , not only our laws of property but our notions of right and wrong and our ideals of life and con - duct must be elevated to a far higher level .

		It is not necessary to mortify the flesh , and clothe the body in sackcloth and ashes , because lux - urious living tempts a few to abuse the bless - ings of wealth ; the higher intellectual tastes and aesthetic pleasures should be developed .

		The use of wealth in beautifying the home , surrounding it with flowers , filling it with books which inspire , and making it a joy to the pass - ing wayfarer as well as to the welcome guest ; the use of wealth in cleaning the streets , ex - tending the parks , erecting pleasant school buildings , and making the city an attractive as well as a safe abiding place , these , and others like them , are the conditions of progress in the twentieth century .

		* The second volume of
Ratzel	ORGANIZATION	's important work on '' The History of Mankind '' -LRB- the first volume of which was noticed in THE DIAL for
August 16 , 1897	DATE	-RRB- treats of the Americans , the Arctic Races of the Old World , and the peo - ples of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The discussion of the American populations has for us , naturally , the chief interest .

		The author appears to admit the unity of the American peoples , but suggests that this unity '' may be based either on com - munity of descent or on long isolation and con - sequent assimilation . ''

		It is not easy to deter - mine to which of the two explanations Mr.
Ratzel	PERSON	inclines .

		Personally , we feel that any discussion which emphasizes unity , either in type or origin , is faulty .

		Does not every ad - vance in the study of the physical anthropology of our native tribes show diversity of American types ?

		Not two types , which , as
Ratzel	ORGANIZATION	says , `` found support mainly from Topinard and Quatrefages , '' but more than two original types , are to be investigated .

		It is inherent in the character of a work like this that the material must be condensed .

		A single paragraph must contain matter that might easily be expanded into pages .

		Partly as a result of this condensation , but also partly through the fault of the writer or translator , the statements are frequently obscure or badly framed .

		Thus , in connection with Abipone marriages , we are told : '' The ceremony is often *

		What are we to make of such a sentence ?

		It is , however , a fair example of the frequently faulty style .

		Without , however , criticising small points of detail , we may say that the dis - cussion of Americans is as good as so condensed a statement can be expected to be .

		Ratzel 's description of African populations is probably the most important in our language .

		The light-skinned and low-statured peoples of Central and

Hottentots	ORGANIZATION	, Dwarf Races .

		Then come the Negro races of

		The discussion is not easy reading .

		The move - ments of the herding and agricultural pop - ulations have been numerous and confusing .

		Cultures have been modified in a thousand ways .

		Tribes subdued to-day may be conquerors to-morrow .

		Names have changed and strange mimicries and masqueradings have been in - dulged in .

		To disentangle the confused skein has been a difficult task , but one , on the whole , well done by our author .

		To the student who is not a specialist in African ethnography , this book will be of great importance for reference .

		The illustrations are especially to be commended .

		They not only handsomely adorn the work , but are of high value for study .

		There is probably no other popular work which contains so many fine illus - trations of race types and ethnographic objects .

		Judging them by the purpose of the author as expressed in the several prefaces , and in the light of her modest disclaimer of either ability or desire to go below the surface and discuss the deeper forces that have brought about the movements she describes or the profound pro- blems suggested , as well as by the needs of the '' general reader '' whose ignorance of contem - porary European history is hardly relieved by his knowledge of the names of a few of the *

		foremost statesmen and monarchs and generals , the present endeavor is to be pronounced suc - cessful .

		The specialist will find many points where from his knowledge of underlying forces he can criticize both the form and the substance of the statements made .

		Both the books give mainly pictures of the court life of the several countries , descriptions of the personal charac - teristics of kings and ministers and leaders of revolution , and accounts of the superficial aspects of the changes of government of which the century has seen so many ; and for work of this sort the writer is well equipped by personal observation , wide reading , and a pleasant style .

		The many who only care for , or will take the trouble to acquire , this degree and this kind of acquaintance with the affairs of the century , will find these books easy reading ; while , it is to be hoped , some will be led on by them to the sources of a deeper and truer knowledge of the wonderful developments of the century .

		The volumes of the series vary in value , that on the opening of
Africa	LOCATION	, and the present volume on
Spain	LOCATION	, being the most useful , because they furnish what can not be easily got together from other works .

		The volume on
Spain	LOCATION	is especially timely , as it gives that insight into Spanish character and history which is necessary to the very beginning of an appreciation of the Cuban question .

		Spanish history during the last hundred years can hardly be called inter - esting to any but the student of social and pol - itical forces .

		It is a tangled maze of tyranny , intrigue , and revolution .


Spain	LOCATION	, until very recently , has been back in medievalism ; and so far as the average Spaniard 's thought and belief go , one can not say that the country has yet emerged very far from that condition .

		This is illustrated many times in the present work .

		Spanish pride and ignorance and superstition and bloodthirstiness have combined to prevent economic progress and to make a real popular government impossible .

		These same qualities have caused the loss of
Spain	LOCATION	's other American possessions , and the ruin of
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		Yet Spanish pride will sacrifice without limit , rather than give up this last token of past imperial greatness .

		The sketches given in this work are of such interesting characters as Godoy the Prince of the Peace ,
Joseph Bonaparte	PERSON	,
King Ferdinand	LOCATION	,
Queens Christina	LOCATION	and
Isabella	LOCATION	,
Don Carlos	PERSON	, and General

		THE DIAL 145 MODERN PHASES OF The most modern of the distinctively modern group of volumes before us is an exposition of '' The New Psychology , '' by Professor Scripture of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The newness of things is , or soon comes to be , a relative matter : New College at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is many centuries old , and the
Pont Neuf	ORGANIZATION	is by no means the most recent of Parisian bridges .

		How - ever defective as a description , the term '' New Psy - chology '' is at least distinctive , and prepares the reader for finding within these covers something very different from the traditional matter or treat - ment of the '' Psychologies . ''

		In the present instance , moreover , we have presented not only a survey of recent investigations , and an account of the methods and equipment of the modern experimental psy - chologist , but we have these presented from a novel point of view .

		There are other more or less recent treatises covering a similar ground , and equally imbued with the spirit of exact science and with the discipline of the laboratory ; but never before has this domain been described from so thoroughly and consistently an objective standpoint .

		The volume may be characterized as an `` objective '' psychology : the mental processes and activities are viewed wholly from without , not from within .

		The result - ing treatment is much like that of a text-book on physics ; the physiological side is nearly as little represented as the introspective , and the genetic and comparative aspects of the subject and these , too , are certainly new find little mention .

		The attempt to present such an original and objective study of the facts of mental science , whether successful or not , is in itself a notable event .

		However much future contributors to this field may differ from Professor Scripture in conclusion and in point of view , in perspective or in design , they are certain to be guided and stimulated by his pioneer effort .

		The importance of the volume is increased by reason of the necessity for removing the prevalent false impression of the interests and purposes of the mod - ern psychologists .

		Much as we may deplore the fact , it is none the less true that the appreciation of the services of the modern psychologist suffers from a confused notion of his work .

		It can not be said too emphatically that he is not a dealer in the oc - cult , nor an expositor of personal peculiarities , nor a physiologist in rather poor disguise , nor an unsci - entific controversialist and theorizer . ''

		The New Psychology '' will do much to counteract this con - ception ; it will do this because it exhibits the rigidly * THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY .

		scientific character of method and research indis - pensable to true progress ; it emphasizes the tech - nical character of the training and attainments necessary to qualify one to follow this pursuit ; it in no way encourages a dillettante interest in and ap - plication of undigested material ; it shows clearly what psychology is not .

		In all these ways , as well for its intrinsic merits , the book is both notable and useful .

		The volume is divided into five parts : the first gives an account of the methods of psychology , and describes the importance of observation and experi - ment , of measurement and statistics , in the investi - gation of mental processes .

		This portion of the work brings to the foreground the close kinship between the methods of psychology and those of other sciences , the importance of quantitative deter - minations , the necessity for watchfulness in detect - ing and overcoming sources of error ; in brief , it shows that a sound logic of method and design is as essential to psychology as to any other science .

		The last portion of the book is devoted to an his - torical retrospect of the origins and growth of the new tendencies in psychology , and to an account of the general outlook and the present provisions for the advancement of psychological knowledge .

		In this prospect a very creditable position falls to the share of cis -
Atlantic	LOCATION	psychologists .

		The three inter - mediate portions make up the body of the work ; their titles are
Time , Energy	ORGANIZATION	, Space , titles hardly suggestive of psychological activities .

		As , however , our reactions to the material world in which our bodies move and our minds live necessa - rily appear as responses to the various forms of physical energy , which are again essentially deter - mined by temporal and special conditions , it cer - tainly becomes possible to prepare under these rubrics a systematic account of the nature , limita - tions , elaborations , interpretations , and applications of such responses .

		For time relations we begin with the fundamental fact that all activities , mental as well as others , require time .

		The times needed for the initiation and development of a sensation ; for the innervation and execution of an act of will ; for interpreting the nature of a stimulus , its dis - tinction from others , its symbolic or artificial signi - ficance ; for recalling familiar bits of knowledge , or making simple inferences are all determined with as much exactness as the nature of the pro- cesses will permit .

		Our own estimates of the pass - ing of time ; our sense of rhythm ; the waning of memory-images as time goes on ; the flow of ideas in temporal succession , these form additional chapters which may be grouped about the '' time '' rubric .

		The methods by which we acquire a knowledge of space are similarly treated .

		The natural divis - ion is here followed , taking up in turn the space information derived from the movements of our body in space , from the impressions of touch , and from the varied movements and impressions of vision .

		Energy is represented in all our move - 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ments , and hence the nature of muscular contrac - tions , the characteristics of fatigue , the perceptions of movement , the sensations of resistance and weight as well as of sound and color , may all he grouped under the term energy ; to which is added , although not very consistently , a chapter on pain and one on the feelings .

		Such , in outline , is the plan of this work .

		The manner of treatment is selective ; there is no attempt at comprehensiveness .

		Under each head a group of observations that seems likely to convey most clearly the nature of the methods and results is selected and fully described ; preference being always given to results in quantitative form .

		Many of the experi - ments are original , and show much ingenuity both in the settling of problems and in technical device .

		The unfortunate personal tone of the author 's '' Chautauqua '' volume on '' Thinking , Feeling , Do - ing '' is largely , although not wholly , avoided ; while but little exception can be taken to the prominence given to the studies from the
Yale Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	, and the passing-by , owing to limitations of scope , of many important facts and observations .

		While recording one 's appreciation of the schol - arship and the originality of the compiler , and the general success of the compilation , the fundamental question as to the possibility of a rigidly objective psychology forcibly presents itself .

		Does not a psychology that deals , not with sensation and per - ception , not with memory and association , not with distinction and choice , that discards the help of care - ful self-observation , that instead of these deals with time and space and energy , does not such a psychology proclaim its own insufficiency ?

		Is not this classification one of appearance and not of re - ality , objective in the sense of outside and not in - trinsic ?

		Is there not as much danger of turning psychology into physics as into metaphysics ?

		These are the queries that accompany the critical reader from chapter to chapter .

		As a matter of fact , the mental processes of perception , memory , discrimi - nation , association , and the like , are touched upon ; the objective treatment is frequently abandoned , de - signedly or otherwise ; none the less the dominant tone and perspective is unpsychological as the term is currently understood .

		Whether it is really so or whether its newness is an anticipation of future trends , may be more wisely questioned than asserted or denied .

		The rigidly scientific psychology , the psychology of experiment and observation , the psychology of growth and development , has come with the close of the century as a permanent contri - bution to the circle of the sciences .

		Whether the particular phase of it selected by Professor Scripture is to be in the future the dominant phase can not yet be determined ; but that it will always be a promi - nent factor , both in determining the spirit and the content of psychological research , can hardly be questioned .

		Under these circumstances , so able and useful a compendium as this must be welcomed as an important aid to students of all shades and grades .

		The '' Subconscious Self , '' by Dr.
Louis Wald	PERSON	- stein , is a thesis in applied Psychology ; and the thesis is admirably maintained and its lessons vig - orously enforced .

		This thesis is based upon the recognition of two elements in our mental make-up .

		The conscious side is that generally recognized as ourselves , the self that selects the impressions upon which we feed , that regulates our conduct , that guides and controls our lives .

		The sub-conscious is the sum of the impressionable , receptive tendencies that creates our likes and dislikes , that engenders our moods and aspirations , that gives shape to our peculiarities , our temperament , and character .

		We are very much more than and very different from that which we designedly intend to be ; and it is this duality which is expressed and elaborated as the conscious and the sub-conscious self .

		There is cer - tainly a little danger in this creation of two selves : the danger of conceiving them as separate entities with independent powers and natures .

		In the hands of a less judicious writer than Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	, this conception would be readily abused , and unwar - ranted inferences and implication on the part of the reader might counteract the wholesome effect of the conscious recognition of that less tangible but potent factor of our mentality .

		The practical side of the thesis emphasizes the importance of early associations and environment , because childhood and youth are the impressionable ages when we absorb much more than we consciously imbibe , when we learn much more than we study , when the sub-conscious tendencies are strongest .

		Hence `` the surroundings in which the child is taught are of more importance , in relation to the ultimate degree of culture to be attained , than the lesson ; the manner of the teacher than the substance of his teaching . '' ''

		For culture depends upon the impulse , not upon purpose . ''

		On the side of health , Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	maintains that many forms of nervous ills are rather in the nature of evil mental habits , dependent upon more or less original weakness and a disturbance of the normal relations between the conscious and the sub-conscious .

		The mental appeal in cases of hysteria and neurasthenia must be in the line of a re-establishment of the control of conscious effort , to dip down deep and reconstruct the under - currents of thought and feeling .

		The change of scene , the absorption in new occupations , the rest from conscious strain , and , still more , the relief from worry which is so infinitely more wearing than work , are effective as they supplant morbid introspective moods and feelings by wholesome altruistic interests .

		In the elaboration of his thesis , Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	appeals to the evidence of suggestion and hypnotic action ; to medical experience and educational exam - ples , to the revival of old and apparently forgotten memories , to the suggestiveness of certain organic and less specialized sensations , for the illustration of the nature and importance of the sub-conscious self .

		Some of these illustrations are rather dubious ; but on the whole , the argument is moderate and the appli - cations suggestive .

		It is at once a stimulating and

		THE DIAL 147 a safe volume , and well adapted to the needs of the general but intelligently interested reader .

		Whatever one 's opinion of its intrinsic importance , there can be no doubt that Psychical Research '' forms a conspicuous feature in modern mind-lore .

		The term has really been given a technical meaning , and serves to distinguish a somewhat heterogeneous group of topics , most of which , but not all , have some bearings upon psychological principles .

		There is , for instance , nothing psychological about the mys - terious ringing of bells and tumbling about of wall ornaments , or the tying of knots in an endless cord , or the insertion of slips of paper into an apparently sealed box , or the alleged miraculous transfer of let - ters and documents through space , all of which procedures the devout psychic researcher must ex - amine and explain , unless it be the contribution to the psychology of deception and credulity which the description of the true modus operandi of these interesting performances reveals .

		On the other hand , researches into the nature of hypnotic phe - nomena , of automatism , of secondary forms of consciousness , of illusions and hallucinations and kindred more or less abnormal forms of mental ac - tion , are definitely psychological in scope and signi - ficance .

		The strand that binds the sheaf together is , however , the interest in the unusual , the apparently miraculous , the possible exception to recognized physical laws , the possible discovery of means of transcending the limitations of this mortal coil .

		This extreme interest in the supernatural is prob - ably not to be ranked as amongst the most cultured or worthy of civilized interests , and yet its exist - ence must be distinctly recognized and met .

		There is , therefore , a place , and by reason of its power to influence opinion , an important place , for a book that describes plainly but critically the status of the chief forms of nineteenth century supematuralia .

		Such a book is Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	's '' Studies in Psychical Research . ''

		The phenomena of spiritualism are described with rare and commendable patience ; the excessive super - stition , the absurd logic or want of it , the looseness of so-called test conditions , the petty deceits and gross frauds , the pitiable credulity of victims and the boldness and originality of mediums , are por - trayed as calmly as the description of so many natural history specimens .

		The spiritualists '' who would be capable of testifying , if their preposses - sions happened to point that way , that they had seen the cow jump over the moon , '' and would refer for corroborative evidence to the archives of the nursery , as well as the learned professors who invent apparatus for demonstrating the power of the me - dium to modify the laws of gravitation , are alike given a hearing ; and the resulting verdict is fraud , eked out by some hallucinations .

		One can not help feeling as
Faraday	PERSON	felt when investigating similar phenomena forty years ago , that ' in the present age , and in this part of the world , it -LSB- such investi - gation -RSB- ought not be required . ''

		Theosophy meets a similar fate at the hands of the examining expert ; but in spite of exposures and confessions , the cults continue to be practised .

		The exposures are ex - plained away , new doctrines and new ' signs '' are devised to satisfy the appetite of the curious . ''

		With such men and against such a contention , argument is no longer even possible .

		Decipiantur . ''

		Ghosts and haunted houses , premonitions and clairvoyance , poltergeists and obsession , are passed in review ; and after a typical citation of cases and analysis of results , the conclusion is reached that the known laws of nature , the demonstrated possi - bilities of cleverness and conjuring , the varied pos - sibilities of error and prepossession , are sufficient in their entirety to account for the phenomena so far as an account may be legitimately demanded .

		These form an admirable illustration of the workings of the popular mind in matters occult , and they point a moral and adorn a tale frequently quite different from what the narrators of the experiences had in mind .

		But the crucial instances where , in the opinion of Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	, as well as of other well versed and learned investigators , science must at present bend the knee and acknowledge the sovereignty of an - other power , are telepathy and Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	.

		Tele - pathy , or the transference of thought from mind to mind by other channels than the recognized avenues of sensation , Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	insists has been demon - strated by experiments , and receives a valuable con - firmation in the premonition of deaths , in dreams that come true , in strong verdical impressions , and the like .

		So perfectly established does the author regard this principle , that he uses it freely in ex - planation of baffling cases of other forms of psy - chic phenomena for which a negative conclusion has been reached .

		The impressions made by the chapters on telepathy upon the present reviewer are quite similar in logical force to those made by the evidence for the phenomena described in the other portions of the work ; the need of an ultra-scientific hypothesis seems as undemonstrated in the one case as in the other .

		Here is debatable land ; and from one who has exhibited such patience and care , as well as insight and experience , as has Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	, it is proper to differ respectfully but none the less firmly .

		Telepathy has not as yet been returned as a member of the parliament of science , and , in the opinion of many , indeed , of most , of those whose opinions are entitled to carry weight , has but a slight and constantly decreasing prospect of occupy - ing the desired seat .

		As for Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	, she is simply a mystery ; her specialty is to reveal in trance condition a knowl - edge of the sitter 's private affairs astounding in its intimacy and correctness .

		The ignorant and the cultured , the lowly and the mighty , the skeptic and the believer , old and young , have sat at Mrs.
Piper	ORGANIZATION	's feet and had the innermost recesses of their per - sonal biography revealed by the mysterious '' Dr.
Phinuit	PERSON	'' who is the trance informant of Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	.

		Her trances furnish the most important evidence 148 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, which the
Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	has yet adduced for the existence of something beyond tele - pathy , and afford a sufficient justification , if any were needed , for the labors of the past fifteen years . ''

		Whether in due time the halo that now radiates from Mrs.
Piper	ORGANIZATION	's head will fade away as a more powerful search-light is focussed upon it , or whether those who come to scoff will stay to pray , may safely be left for the future to determine .

		Enigmas have been solved again and again , and psychology has other and more important problems immediately before it than the illumination of the illusive mate - rial of '' Psychic Research . ''

		Of greatest importance is the necessity of preserving a rational perspective , of not confusing Psychology with tales of ghosts and table-rappings , and of estimating these alleged supranormal phenomena as Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	's volume will help one to do at their proper value both as regards their truth and their significance if true .

		Professor
Ribot	PERSON	's volume , '' The Psychology of the Emotions , '' takes us into quite a different sphere of mind-lore , the region not of the intellect but of the feelings .

		Here experiment must give way to observation and analysis , and in place of quantitative determinations there are variable and illusive quali - tative changes .

		Different - as is the material and treatment , the psychology of the emotions quite clearly reflects the influence of modern conceptions and investigations .

		Professor
Ribot	PERSON	's reputation is that of an eminently successful expositor ; though not himself an experimentalist he encourages experi - mental work in others , and appreciates fully the importance of all the various trends of modern psy - chological activity .

		He brings to his writings a wise enthusiasm , a clear critical judgment , and an unusual originality of composition and generalization .

		Of all his monographs this certainly represents the work of greatest complexity and difficulty ; in successful achievement , in originality of treatment , and in general utility , it equals , and indeed surpasses , the standard of his previous contributions .

		It may be recommended as one of the most attractive and profitable means of approach to an interesting and important group of psychological problems .

		The work falls into two divisions , the first dealing with the general psychology of emotion , the second with the special psychology of the emotions .

		One of the main problems of the first division is the deter - mination of the nature of feeling .

		Is it a primitive fact , sui generis , coordinate with the simplest ele - ments of the intellectual group , sensation and per - ception ?

		or is it a mere accompaniment of the latter , an epi-phenomenon ?

		Are pleasure and pain merely supplementary conditions of sensation , or are they equally primordial , and independent of the intellect - ual content of the sensation ?

		Professor
Ribot	PERSON	takes his stand with those who maintain the fundamental importance of the feelings , the '' emotionalists '' as opposed to the '' intellectualists , '' and devotes many chapters to the support of this doctrine .

		In this investigation the relations of feelings to sensations , of feelings to the modes of their manifestation , of feelings to movements , of pleasure and pain , and of a wide range of allied factors , are fully discussed in the light of their origin , their development , their morbid manifestations , and their utilitarian function .

		Biology , anthropology , and pathology contribute facts to the normal psychology of the emotions and prevent the undue attention to the processes of the adult , educated , and cultured member of the genus homo , to which may be ascribed so many of the misconceptions of the older psychologists .

		Along with this richness of method and material have come new problems as well as new ways of looking at the old ones .

		Is the expression of the emotion essential to the emotion , or is it something accidental and su - perfluous ?

		Shall we say with
James	PERSON	that we are sad because we weep , we are afraid because we tremble , and are angry because we strike or feel an inclina - tion to do so , or can we feel all these emotions without their motor accompaniment ?

		Is pain a distinct sen - sation with perhaps a special nervous mechanism , or is it an adjunct of other forms of sensation ?

		What is the place of feeling in the development of the in - dividual and of the race ?

		What is the origin of the expression of the emotions ?

		What is the place of emotion in the intellectual life ?

		These are some of the general problems which must be discussed as an integral portion of the study of emotion .

		Such dis - cussion has nothing of finality about it ; it is fre - quently a statement of opposite views with little indication of a preference for one or the other ; it is not infrequently a confession of ignorance or the discovery of gaps in our knowledge .

		None the less the discussion is profitable ; a preliminary survey is far better than none , and one can not expect the equipment that comes from long periods of occupa - tion in the exploration of the darkest regions of psychology .

		The special emotions may be treated more defi - nitely .

		Certain types of emotional manifestation are primitive and fundamental ; they appear in the lower forms of animal life and in the early months of in - fant experience ; they remain in the decadence of old age and combine with other forms of feelings and ideas to form the sentiments .

		Such instinctive emo - tions are those connected with self - conservation , fear , anger , sympathy .

		These give place , under con - ditions of increased intellectual development , to the social and moral feelings , to the religious , aesthetic , and intellectual sentiments .

		Recent investigation along the lines of animal study and child study , as well as a more intimate acquaintance with the thought-habits of primitive peoples , make it pos - sible to sketch the main characteristics of the sev - eral emotions with considerable definiteness ; and Professor
Ribot	PERSON	utilizes this type of information with great skill .

		In conclusion he attempts a clas - sification of characters , both normal and abnormal , a contribution to the science of ethology which
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	suggested , which
Bain	ORGANIZATION	attempted to in - augurate , and which has recently engaged the atten - tion of French psychologists .

		The result , however 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 interesting , is hardly scientific ; none the less , pro- gress has been made , misconceptions have been removed , and the importance of a true psychological method of classification has been recognized .

		In the modern world , with its endless opportuni - ties to acquire information , and the continuous ne - cessity to keep up with the times , there is consider - able danger of getting too much information and too little education , too much brain and too little heart .

		It is a wholesome tendency in modern psy - chology , and one well represented in this work of Professor
Ribot	PERSON	, that along with the study of the processes of intellectual acquisition it emphasizes the importance of the emotions in the foundations of character .

		JOSEPH JASTBOW .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		The natal The remarkable series of papers in which
Captain A. T. Mahan has United	ORGANIZATION	statet .

		from time to time expressed his views on most questions of American naval and for - eign policy are now issued in a handy volume of some 300 pages entitled '' The Interest of
America	LOCATION	in
Sea Power	ORGANIZATION	, Present and Future '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	, and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The titles are : `` The United States Looking Outward , '' ''
Hawaii	LOCATION	and Our Future Sea Power , '' '' The Isthmus and Sea Power , '' '' Possi - bilities of an
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
American Reunion	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Prepared - ness for Naval War , '' '' Strategic Features of the
Caribbean Sea	LOCATION	and the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		With these magazine papers many of our readers are doubtless already acquainted , and we need scarcely say that they are well worth reproducing in book form .

		They form the most considerable and author - itative literary contribution to the general discus - sion in question , and their influence upon current opinions has been such that .

		they are not unlikely to prove a potent factor in shaping the future history of this country .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	is the most con - vinced , the most logical , and , with thinking people , the most influential exponent of the view that the time has come for the abandonment by us of the
Washington	LOCATION	!

		an policy of diplomatic isolation which '' befitted our national infancy . ''

		It is time , he thinks , for us to assume our share of the '' travail of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' of the `` work of upholding the common interests of civilization . ''

		As to the particular point whence those interests are especially threatened , Captain
Mahan	PERSON	is rather non-committal ; but he hints vaguely at the '' teeming multitudes of central and northern
Asia	LOCATION	, '' against whom the '' only bar - rier will be the warlike spirit of the representatives of civilization . ''

		We had rather thought that this particular bogey of a new Mongolian invasion -LRB- which so disturbed the prophetic soul of Mr.
Pear	PERSON	- son -RRB- had been effectually laid by the disclosures as to the real state of
China	LOCATION	resulting from the Chino Japanese war ; and , indeed , it might be urged that it is now the chiefs of the Western and Christian world , and not those of the Asiatic steppes , that incline to the eole , of the
Genghis Khan	PERSON	, and the barbarous gospel of the `` mailed fist . ''

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's fancy , however , it seems , still admits the possibility of future Attilas and Tamerlanes .

		He views our modern civilization -LRB- like the old Roman one -RRB- as '' an oasis set in the midst of a desert of bar - barism , '' and ultimately dependant for its safety , '' not upon its mere elaboration of organization , but upon the power of that organization to express itself in a menacing and efficient attitude of physical force , sufficient to resist the numerically overwhelm - ing , but inadequately organized hosts of outsiders . ''

		Such being the plight of modern civilization , it would of course be the clear duty of
America	LOCATION	to furnish its quota toward the common defence .

		This particular argument of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's in support of militarism seems to us to rest upon a somewhat vague and fanciful hypothesis ; and we are inclined to think that it is in its internal and domestic Goths and Vandals , '' capitalistic '' as well as '' proletar - ian , '' that modern civilization finds its real and immediate foes .

		As to the expediency for this coun - try of maintaining at all times a reasonable degree of '' preparedness for war , '' a degree proportional to the current general average of political conditions that in our case make for war , we heartily agree with Captain
Mahan	PERSON	; but we are by no means ready to admit the wisdom of a policy of territorial expan - sion or diplomatic intermeddling , tending to trans - form war from a comparatively remote contingency into a constantly impending danger .

		The menace to our form of government that lurks in such a pol - icy is evident .

		Militarism and popular institutions are fundamentally at odds ; and cogent arguments are not lacking to show that the first serious depart - ure from the traditions and maxims that have so long and so happily governed our relations with the outer world may still prove to be the beginning of the end of the old political order in this country .

		On the whole , we think our fellow countrymen will do well for the present to close their ears to the per - suasions of the sirens of annexation , and lay to heart Speaker
Reed	PERSON	's recent aphorism , `` Empire can wait '' Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	's essays have .

		lon g been * > weU ^ own that it would come near impertinence to give a naive account of them .

		It will be interesting to her many readers , however , to learn that in her latest volume , '' Varia '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , she has shown what may be properly called a new method .

		We think that she now succeeds in getting more of herself into her essays ; and this we regard as an advan - tage .

		In her earlier work she was content to mag - netize a title or an idea and insert it into her library and draw it forth encrusted with quotations .

		That was not a bad thing to do :
Emerson	PERSON	used to do it .

		except that he put the magnetized title into a commonplace book and drew it forth encrusted with original epigrams .

		Miss Repplier does not yet avoid 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, quotations , nor does she shun her library ; and this is well , for her quotations are well-made and her reading is wide and reputable .

		But , unless our memory deceives us , these things occupy a some - what different place in the economy of her essay : or , looking at it from another point of view , her essays have gained , we take it , character and struc - ture .

		Instead of fantasias on different wandering themes , we have in this volume a number of his - torical rsum6s of different elements in civilization , as , women of thought and action , diaries , drinking - songs , fiction .

		This kind of essay is perhaps sim - pler than the other , but it usually has more real merit , unless its author be one of the few great essay-writers of the world .

		Hence Miss Repplier , whose power consists in ready assimilation and a sound discrimination and appreciation , but yet not much strength of original -LRB- if not analytic -RRB- think - ing like Montaigne 's , for instance , or
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's , Miss Repplier finds here a better instrument .

		In her previous volume we commended her sane judg - ment and unruffled common-sense .

		Both qualities may be seen here , and each is of great value in dealing with such subjects as the eternal feminine , novel-reading , Sunday-school stories .

		These essays are quite as agreeable to read as Miss Repplier 's earlier work -LRB- singular it would be if , in the case of so devoted a student of style , it should not be so -RRB- , but they have much more body to them .

		One thing we take exception to : we do not think Miss Rep - plier a good person to deal with the subject of bac - chanalia .

		We allow that she writes agreeably on the matter , but hardly to the real increase of good thinking on the topic .

		This , however , is a small matter : perhaps it may come from a purely theo - retic standpoint .

		We must add that in this volume Miss Repplier leaves her library and goes to Con - stantinople and
Cairo	LOCATION	by way of
Douai	LOCATION	and Syra - cuse .

		We do not recollect that this has occurred before , although Miss Repplier has several times looked out of her window and seen something .

		We hope the result of her present travels will not dis - courage her , although it would seem as if the things that she had experienced had been rather a source of annoyance to her than otherwise .

		The works of Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	offer an excellent opportunity for the selection of elegant extracts , for the reason that those who like Miss
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	's works are apt to like elegant extracts too .

		We have not often met Shakespearean students who longed for a '' Beauties of Shakespeare . ''

		We do not think that the volume of selections , from
Meredith	LOCATION	, published some time since , was ever a delight to lovers of Meredith .

		Nor has '' The Good , the True , and the Beautiful , '' we imagine , been wholly satisfactory to the Ruskinites .

		But the '' Beauties of
Marie Cor	PERSON	- elli , '' compiled by Miss
Annie Mackay	PERSON	and published in
England	LOCATION	by Mr.
George Red	PERSON	way and in this coun - try by
Messrs. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	, can not be so criticised .

		We think that
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	students will be glad to have
Mus Corelli	ORGANIZATION	at seen in elegant extracts .

		the book lying on the marble-topped tables of their pensive citadels , and that Corelli lovers will give it a prominent place on the buhl Stagbres of their lux - urious boudoirs .

		It has also a further use .

		Those who have never read the works of
Miss Corelli	LOCATION	, and never mean to , may find here what those works are like , at the expense of very little time and trouble .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	thought that
Wordsworth	PERSON	gained with the general reader by being presented in selec - tions ; and when he saw how much
Wordsworth	PERSON	gained , he was tempted to make selections from
Byron	PERSON	also .

		So with
Miss Corelli	LOCATION	; only the
Corel	ORGANIZATION	-
Hans	PERSON	should try to read her in toto .

		We do not , however , think that Miss Corelli should be compared with
Byron	PERSON	or Meredith , or even with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		She would not herself invite such comparison , nor would this book justify it , save in the superficial manner that we have pursued .

		Miss Corelli , in our judgment , comes a little below
Ouida	PERSON	in the scale of authors , and considerably above Miss
Julia Edwards	PERSON	.

		Perhaps Miss
Mackay	ORGANIZATION	will find time to provide us with selections from the works of those well-known ladies .

		If she do so , we recommend her to follow her present plan of arrangement , in which extracts are arranged according to the novels from which they are selected .

		Another way would be to group under one head let us say Art all the extracts bearing on Art ; and so on .

		But that plan , we think , would be dangerous .

		We would also suggest that instead of the term '' Beauties '' in the title , it might be better to say '' Extracts , '' or perhaps '' Elegant Extracts . ''

		TWO new books Compilations of American literary on American history for the use of schools are of Literature .

		i ate multiplying apace .

		Within the past two years we have had excellent manuals of the subject published by Mr.
F. L. Pattee	PERSON	and Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, and two other text-books of about the same compass are now before us .

		One of them , bearing the simple title '' American Litera - ture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is the work of Miss
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	, and contains a gracefully written narra - tive treatment of the subject , running to upwards of three hundred pages , and adorned with over a score of portrait illustrations .

		Miss
Bates	PERSON	has determined to be readable , at whatever cost of condensation or scientifically ordered array of facts , and has pro- duced a book which is primarily entertaining , although we by no means intend to imply that it is not also trustworthy .

		What we often miss , how - ever , in these attractive pages , is that scrupulous weighing of every critical epithet employed that should characterize a text-book for youthful stu - dents .

		Some of the judgments expressed have a random quality , if not an unhappy one ; and we come at times upon absolute futilities of phrase that might far better have been omitted .

		From the standpoint of historical scholarship , as illustrated by its echo of traditional opinion in dealing with such matters as the Pocahontas yarn ,
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	and witchcraft , or
Ethan Allen	PERSON	at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, the
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 151 book mast be pronounced superficial .

		Mr.
Henry S. Pancoast	PERSON	's `` Introduction to American Litera - ture '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , the other text mentioned at the be - ginning of this paragraph , finds the critic prepos - sessed in its favor by the admirable '' Introduction to English Literature '' prepared by the author , a year or two ago .

		We gave high praise to that book when it appeared , and find in the volume now before us the same well-chosen diction , sobriety of judg - ment , and sense of perspective that characterized its predecessor .

		We should say that no better book had yet been produced for use in our secondary schools , and few that come anywhere near its stand - ard of excellence .

		Mr
Gotte	PERSON	' t f - wr ^ te tne history of English lit - shon hittory of erature within the compass of some English literature , f our hundred duodecimo pages is a task from which the wisest of students might shrink ; it has been done so many times already and fairly well done at that , while the style of an archangel could hardly make a manual of the sort good for continuous reading .

		But this is an age of serial compilations of knowledge , and the Procrustean tyranny of the series styled '' Literatures of the World '' left the editor no escape from contriving to have the story of English letters told to scale once more .

		The editor has undertaken the tale himself , and , being Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		has of course pro- duced '' A Short History of Modern English Litera - ture '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- which is as nearly entertaining and readable as it is possible for any such work to be .

		He has also made his task somewhat more tolerable by beginning with
Chaucer	PERSON	, thus leaving the '' archaic section '' of our literature for treat - ment in another volume by some other hand .

		He has endeavored , to quote his own words , '' to give the reader , whether familiar with the books men - tioned or not , a feeling of the evolution of English literature in the primary sense of the term , the dis - entanglement of the skein , the slow and regular unwinding , down succeeding generations , of the threads of literary expression . ''

		The element of biography is almost wholly dispensed with , making the interest strictly critical and philosophical , and the work has , in comparison with its numerous rivals , whatever advantages may flow from original and epigrammatic turns of expression , quotations of the unhackneyed sort that show a man to be fresh from the reading of many of the authors discussed , and the general charm of manner that attaches to every - thing that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	writes .

		Celebrated law-trialt in
America	LOCATION	.

		Encouraged by the success of his interesting work entitled ''
Extraor	PERSON	- dinary Cases , '' which was noticed in our columns a twelvemonth or so ago , Mr.
Henry Lauren Clinton	PERSON	now issues a second and similar volume , '' Celebrated Trials '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , containing sketches of other noted cases with which the author has been professionally connected during his forty years of active practice at the
New York	LOCATION	bar .

		Mr.
Clinton	PERSON	defended , for instance , Mrs.
Cunningham	PERSON	in the celebrated Cunningham-Burdell case , and Rich - ard
Croker	PERSON	against the charge of murdering
John McKenna	PERSON	; and he was of counsel in the Tweed and the
Kelly	LOCATION	vs.
Havemeyer	PERSON	cases .

		The
Cunningham	PERSON	- Burdell trial occupies nearly half of the volume , and Mr.
Clinton	PERSON	's account of it is as engrossing as one of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's tales .

		This Burdell mystery has never , we believe , been unravelled .

		Other trials recounted by the author are : the case of Dr.
E. M. Brown	PERSON	, of
Watson	PERSON	and
Crary	PERSON	, of
Robert J. Gamble	PERSON	and Ma - tilde Hujus , of
Isaac Van Wart Buckhont	PERSON	, of
A. Oakey Hall	PERSON	-LRB- tried for neglect of official duty -RRB- , of
Favre vs. Monvoisin	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The book is brimful of striking and sensational incidents , of examples of ingenious shifts of legal practice , of searching judi - cial analysis , and of impassioned flights of forensic eloquence .

		The author 's style is manly and direct , and he sensibly refrains from gilding his narrative with the rhetorical flourishes which he evidently finds it advantageous to use in addressing a jury .

		Mr.
Clinton	PERSON	's second volume is , like his first , one that members of the bar should greatly relish ; while to the lay reader with a taste for romantic fiction it offers the allurements of o'er-true tales steeped in the atmosphere of mystery and crime .

		The book is well made , and it contains several portraits of lead - ing legal lights , including one of the author .

		Actuated by a common friendship for
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	and a certain kinship between their own natures ,
John Sterling	PERSON	and
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	exchanged letters at more or less frequent intervals during the latter part of Sterling 's life .

		Though never meet - ing face to face , each found in the other a stimulus and an attraction which makes the volume of their correspondence now published -LRB- Honghton -RRB- well worth the reading .

		The editor , Mr.
Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, has done his modest work well , prefacing the letters with a brief sketch of the delicate and short-lived man to whom
Emerson	PERSON	wrote , `` Thou - sands of hearts have owed to you the finest mystic influences , '' and of whom
Carlyle	PERSON	said , '' He was a brilliant , human presence , honourable and lovable amid the dim , common populations . ''

		The book is a small one , less than a hundred pages , yet it gives us pleasant glimpses of both men , the one whose name and thought has permeated all literature , and the one whose gifts promised so much and yet who was permitted to accomplish so little .

		Krtiger 's `` History of Early
Chris	PERSON	- tian Literature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a compound of biographical and biblio - graphical material .

		It covers not only the authors and works of three centuries , but the later literature which has grown up around them .

		The books of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the apocryphal lit - erature , are claimants for a place in this thick vol - ume of over 400 pages .

		There is a feeling of satis - faction , as one takes up this book , that he has in Literature of three centuriet .

		152 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, hand a fairly exhaustive European bibliography of every important author and work included within its compass .

		The apostles and church fathers of three continents , of all shades of Christian belief , of variant degrees of scholarship , have their niche in this literary edifice .

		It is gratifying to find so many valuable personal facts about the great churchmen of that age .

		In the same section are cited the orig - inal works of each ancient author , in its different editions , and in immediate connection the later works which have been built on those originals .

		We should have highly prized a word now and then by the distinguished author on the special value of some of the literature referred to .

		Enough , how - ever , is cited on each subject , he says , '' for a thor - ough study of that subject . ''

		At the end of the book is a valuable chronological conspectus , which por - trays the gradual progress of literary productivity in the several provinces of the Empire .

		This , with a full round index of authors and works , gives the volume such a bibliographical completeness , except as to American works , as will be a delight and a treasure to every scholar who delves into this important period of the growth and spread of Christianity .

		The American student desirous of becoming acquainted with the lan - guage of
Norway	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	has hitherto been unable to secure the help of a suitable grammatical manual .

		None of the books hitherto published in this country has been altogether ade - quate to the needs of the student , and there was a real demand for such a work as Prof.
Julius E. Olson	PERSON	's '' Norwegian Grammar and Reader '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which has just been published .

		We are glad to note that the author carries the courage of his convictions far enough to style his book a '' Norwegian '' grammar , in defiance of the pedantry which would insist upon the term ''
Dano	PERSON	- Norwegian , '' and of the impossible contention that such writers as
Herr Bj	ORGANIZATION	& rnson and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	do not use the Norwegian language .

		Rather less than half of the work is devoted to the grammar ; the rest consists of well-chosen selections , with notes and a vocabulary .

		The extracts range all the way from Eventyr by
AsbjOrnsen	ORGANIZATION	and Moe to examples chosen from the Dioscuri of contemporary Norwegian lit - erature and lyrics from the Maalstrcever .

		They make up a singularly attractive collection , and the student who masters them all will have made a good start in his acquaintance with the Norwegian lan - guage , literature , and history .

		It is a task well worth undertaking for anyone who knows German to begin with , since it offers an unusually great reward for an unusually small amount of effort .

		For students of Norwegian and Danish .

		Miss
Mary Gay Humphreys	PERSON	's life of
Catherine Schuyler	PERSON	forms the sixth and final volume of the excellent little set of biographies of '' Women of Colonial and Revolutionary Times '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which we have A notable matron of the Revolution .

		already had more than one occasion to commend .


Catherine Schuyler	PERSON	, wife of General
Philip Schuyler	PERSON	, was a daughter of Colonel
John Van Rensselaer	PERSON	, son of
Hendrick	ORGANIZATION	and grandson of
Killian	PERSON	, the first
Patroon	LOCATION	, whose estate was at
Claverack	LOCATION	, about forty miles from
Albany	LOCATION	, and a few miles back from the present town of
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		Thus by virtue of blood and marriage , at least , Mrs.
Schuyler	PERSON	was , although personally of a retiring and domestic turn , a repre - sentative figure among the matrons of the Revolu - tion .

		Her life embraced a momentous and stirring period in our national history , including , in its mil - itary aspect , the French , and Indian , and Revolu - tionary Wars , and , in its political , the transitional colonial period and the beginnings of
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the student of manners , the story of Mrs.
Schuy	PERSON	- ler 's life is instructive , and the author tells it simply and literally .

		It abounds in vivacious pictures and incidents illustrative of the social and domestic life of the time , and affords a glimpse or two of Dutch colonial life at
Albany	LOCATION	.

		There is a well executed portrait of Mrs.
Schuyler	PERSON	.

		The publication of the personal let - rant .

		* ers p f prominent men results often in disappointing those who believe the verdict of history will be materially changed thereby .

		Sources are now so available and so uni - versally used that the fruits of the letters remaining unused are little more than the pleasure derived from a knowledge of the friendships of great men .

		The Hon.
Elihu B. Washburne	PERSON	was for many years so close a friend of General Grant that the publica - tion of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's `` Letters to a Friend '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- gives pleasant glimpses of the friendship between the two , but adds little of historic value .

		The most interesting letter is the one in which Grant refuses to listen to the suggestion that he should declare himself not a candidate for the Presidency in
1880	DATE	under any circumstances .

		Gen.
James Grant Wilson	PERSON	contributes an introduction to the attractively pub - lished little volume .

John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , and con - tains some twenty-two pleasantly fancied rustic sketches , the fruit of the sentimental holiday ram - bles of a young Londoner among the green lanes and by-paths of
Cornwall	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
H. D. Lowry	PERSON	is the editor , and Mr.
E. Philip Pimlott	PERSON	has furnished a half-dozen acceptable etchings .

		Most of the papers have appeared in English periodicals , but they de - serve their present setting .

		The writer makes no pretence of being an observer of the
Thoreau	PERSON	- Jefferies order , but he evidently has the jaded '' cit 's '' keen delight in the things of the country , and his raptures are unfeigned .

		There is a mild vein of adolescent sentimentality throughout , and the
Cornish	PERSON	types are not ill-drawn .

		The volume will form a delightful companion for a vacation ramble .

		THE DIAL 153 As the volumes on the '' Ten Epochs n e Age of the of Church History '' -LRB- Christian Lit -
Renascence	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		J ^ .

		erature Co. -RRB- appear , one by one , it is discovered that not all of them are , in fact , church histories .

		This may be said of the seventh volume , in which Mr.
Paul Van Dyke	PERSON	tells the story of '' The Age of the Renascence , '' aided by an Introduction furnished by his brother , the Rev.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	. ''

		An outline sketch of the History of the Papacy from the return from
Avignon	LOCATION	to the Sack of
Rome	LOCATION	-LRB- 1377-1527 -RRB- '' can only be regarded as
Church	ORGANIZATION	history upon the theory that the Church and the
Papacy	LOCATION	were identical at that time ; and as the book is written from an ultra - Protestant standpoint , it holds no such theory .

		And as a history of the Renascence , it is disappointing in so far as it passes over the artistic revival which was such an impor - tant feature of the Renascence , and barely touches the development of university life .

		These omissions are apologized for in the Introduction .

		Still , what is told us of the Humanists is well told ; the book is readable , and it will no doubt be found to fur - nish an admirable preparation for the volume on the Age of the Reformation , which is to follow .

		It is , however , regrettable that the author should so often descend from the dignified style in which seri - ous history should be written , and use such modern terms in writing of events in the Middle Ages , as the '' middle-of-the-road policy , '' '' Judge
Lynch	PERSON	, '' ''
Kentucky	LOCATION	feuds , '' etc. .

		Studies of Slate Mr ' Ja .

		me f
Schoulep	PERSON	' a Volume of and Federal '' Constitutional Studies '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- Constitution * .

		contains some valuable work .

		It is written , to some extent , with the marvellously infe - licitous exuberance of rhetoric so familiar in the author 's '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		But with all that , the facts are gathered with care and grouped with judgment .

		Part I. treats of '' Early Charters and Constitutions , '' Part II .

		of `` The
Federal Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' and Part III .

		of '' State Constitutions since
1789	DATE	. ''

		Especially valuable are Chapter IV .

		in Part I. , dealing with '' Early State Constitutions '' -LRB- 1776-1789 -RRB- , and the whole of Part III .

		Too little study has been given to the Constitutions of the States , and one of the wholesome signs of an awakened political consciousness is the fact that such studies are beginning to appear .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Volume V. of the '' Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature , '' issued by
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, through the publishing house of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a '' Child Memorial Volume . ''

		It was already planned as a greet - ing to the late Professor Child , in celebration of his fiftieth year of teaching in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, completed in
June , 1896	DATE	, but his death in the following
September	DATE	changed the greeting into a memorial .

		Following the Latin dedication -LRB- left unchanged -RRB- of Professor Green - ough , there are no less than sixteen papers , mostly con - cerned with the minuter part of scholarship , but given a distinct literary flavor by the inclusion of such contri - butions as '' The Text of
Donne	PERSON	's Poems , '' by Professor
C. E. Norton	PERSON	; '' The Influence of
Emerson	LOCATION	, '' by Pro- fessor
A. S. Hill	PERSON	; '' The Ballad and Communal Poetry , '' by Professor
F. B. Gummere	PERSON	; '' Who Was Sir
Thomas Malory	PERSON	? ''

		by Professor
G. L. Kittredge	PERSON	; and '' The German Hamlet and the Earlier English Versions , '' by Mr.
John Corbin	PERSON	.

		We have received from the
Hamburg	LOCATION	publishing house of
Herr Leopold Voss	PERSON	, two works of much value to the student of dramatic literature and art .

		One of them is a '' Beschreibung des Geistlichen Schauspiels im Deutschen Mittelalter '' by
Herr Richard Heinzel	PERSON	.

		It is a volume of over three hundred and fifty pages , crammed with erudition , and as unreadable as a produc - tion of German scholarship can contrive to be , which fact does not prevent it from being a work of much learn - ing , and a contribution of great importance to the liter - ature of its subject .

		The other publication to which reference is made is a study of ''
Der Dramatische Monolog	ORGANIZATION	in der Foetik des 17 .

		and 18 .

		Jahrhunderts und in den Dramen Lessings , '' by
Herr Friedrich Diisel	PERSON	.

		It is a brochure of about eighty pages , possessing rather an sesthetical than a historical interest .

		The master historian of
England	LOCATION	under the Stuarts , Mr.
Samuel Rawson Gardiner	PERSON	, has published a volume of two hundred pages entitled '' What Gunpowder Plot Was '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The book , he tells us , grew out of a conviction that the late work of Father
Gerard	PERSON	upon the same subject had not removed all the difficulties .

		The latter attempted to break down the truth of the traditional story by testing it with the evidence .

		In this he not only urged that many of the government 's declara - tions were inconsistent with the evidence and pointed to falsification , but went beyond that to argue that part of the evidence was inconsistent with physical facts .

		His eminent services are admitted by Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	, but after his own exhaustive investigation Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- diner 's conclusion is mainly in favor of the traditional story .

		`` Not to furnish booksellers and bookbuyers with an exhaustive catalogue of books , but to make the material which is most useful for the study of municipal history more accessible to historical students , '' is the avowed intention of Professor
Charles Gross	PERSON	, of
Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , in his '' Bibliography of British Municipal His - tory . ''

		The 432 pages needed for this purpose show the vast extent of the material thus noted for the stu - dent in this important field of local institutions .

		The volume is number five in the '' Harvard Historical Studies '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Mr.
Thomas Benfield Harbottle	PERSON	is the compiler of a '' Dictionary of Quotations -LRB- Classical -RRB- , '' just published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and designed to accompany the previously issued dictionary of English quotations pre - pared by
Colonel P. H. Dalbiac	PERSON	and a forthcoming volume of quotations from modern
Continental	ORGANIZATION	writers .

		The Latin and Greek sections of the present work are distinct , and each quotation is coupled with an English translation , literary rather than literal , the works of the standard translators being annexed in the majority of cases .

		There are three subject-indexes , in
Latin	LOCATION	,
Greek	LOCATION	, and English , respectively , which might have been made fuller than we find them , but which pro- vide a fairly adequate key to the contents of this use - ful volume .

		154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .

		~ ~
London	LOCATION	,
Feb.	DATE	.

		IS ,
1898	DATE	.

		Each season brings its own fashion ; and whether it be in hats or blouses , collars or jackets , pictures or books , it serves to interest a blase society , if only for the few months when
London	LOCATION	is having what is called its '' season . ''

		The art of the sartor has its own special critics , and , no doubt , these are able to wax eloquent and enthusiastic enough , without the aid of their brethren of the stage or of literature .

		The art of the painter or the writer is always sure of exponents and even of satirists .

		Indeed , so numerous are they grow - ing , these writers on writers , that we are threatened with a new plague .

		A perfect host of critics is swarm - ing the corridors of the offices of Fleet Street and
New Grub Street	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latest fashion , in which one dare not now be igno - rant , is
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	.

		I have already told you of the new translations which are in preparation ; but it would astonish you not a little were you aware of the many that are being laid down , in the breasts of the aspiring scribblers , who , without even a rudimentary knowledge of the Persian alphabet , yet hope to achieve immortality by a sublimation of the essence of what has already been accomplished by such scholars as
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	,
McCarthy	PERSON	,
Heron Allen	PERSON	,
Nicolas	PERSON	, and
Boden	PERSON	- stedt .

		Our
Omar Khayyam Club	PERSON	is on the war-path , what it intends to accomplish , only its members know .

		What it will accomplish , it would not be very difficult to prophecy .

		Well may a wearied bookseller exclaim '' There was an old person of Ham Who wearied of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	. '

		FitzGerald , ' said he , ' Is as right as can be ; But this Club , and these '' versions '' O dam I ' '' Then , further , it is '' the thing '' to be wise and look silent eloquence about
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		The Mere - dithian cult has passed through the gestative period , and it is now nibbling at the egg-shell , previous to stalking abroad in all the nakedness of a brave gosling .

		The brotherhood of the pen have hailed him , on his seven - tieth birthday , with a gorgeous illuminated address , to be followed soon by the regulation '' Society , '' founded for the purpose of studying the scintillating corusca - tions of his epigrams , to see wherein lies the wit , and to publish volumes of researches in the shape of '' transac - tions . ''

		Paradoxes are gone with the snows of yester - year , epigrams are in , and green with the green of youth .

		Lately , one might admire the Shakespearian brow ; now , we must swear by the beard of Meredith .

		Ah , yes !

		that Shakespearian brow is elegant .

		It reminds me of a little tale , which I believe to be true as well as ben trovato .

		You are , of course , aware that this special brow is not extinct it is in our midst to-day .

		Well , the story goes that a leading novelist met an equally leading poet at a party , and , apparently , the two '' got on '' very well .

		Some time after , a friend asked the '' leading '' novelist what he thought of the '' leading '' poet .

		`` Oh , '' was the reply , `` a charming man , and a very gifted writer .

		Yet to the eye he did not impress one as I had expected .

		He lacked the great brow of a Shakespeare . ''

		The friend looked at the `` leading '' novelist , and smiled .

		We are all in a muddle .

		First , the author swears he is going to turn publisher ; then , the bookseller threatens to boycott the author ; then , the publisher threatens to damn both ; and now , the author , publisher , and book - seller are hopelessly mixed up .

		Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	sells his own wares ; Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	writes his own plays ; and a publisher announces that not only will he sell his own books , but he will open shops all over
London	LOCATION	, and sell everybody 's books .

		Not that anything matters much now-a-days ; but I have no doubt the publisher-bookseller will manage to do better than either the author-publisher , or the publisher-author , or the bookseller-publisher .

		When one is a successful author , like Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	, one may take to amateur publishing by way of amuse - ment .

		When one is a successful publisher , like Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	, one may indulge in the gentle art of mak - ing plays , just to show the world that there is more in a publisher than meets the unsophisticated observer .

		But why should it be necessary for the successful publisher to become a competitor with poor and unsuccessful booksellers ?

		It is almost impossible to send you news of new pub - lications , now that '' Literature '' has remodelled its '' Notes '' columns .

		For in those columns you will read , not of what publishers are actually doing that 's a very small affair but of what authors are going to do , or are just engaged in doing , or are hoping or expecting to do .

		The plan is very simple : the editor of the '' Notes '' section is in personal communication with au - thors , from whom he obtains the necessary information , which , with a little deft pruning , is made ready for the press , and there you are .

		It does not always follow that what authors are doing or are hoping to do will see publication day ; but that is a matter for settlement be - tween other parties .

		In the meantime , I had better tell you at once , or the author will let it out before me , that there is to be a new guide to
London	LOCATION	.

		When I say '' new , '' I mean it .

		Absolutely , it will have no rival , and the curious part about it will be that Londoners themselves will buy it eagerly .

		Also , we are to have a great book on mezzotint engraving , fully illustrated , with all sorts of '' tips '' for the collector .

		Also , a big work on the history of the modern stage in
England	LOCATION	, with quite a crowd of portraits and illustrations .

		Then will come a new and prettily-printed series of books , including all the best classics of all literatures , in uni - form size , fit for carrying in the waistcoat pocket , and as elegantly bound as are the most respectable of prayer-books .

		I hear of a new novel which Mr.
William O'Brien	PERSON	, late a member of the Irish Nationalist party , has just completed .

		It deals with
Western Ireland	LOCATION	, and has a picturesque amazonian character of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's day .

		The ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' edition of the books of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	is to have yet another volume .

		In re - sponse to a widely expressed desire , so runs the infor - mation , it has been decided , at a conference held
last week	DATE	, to include the '' Juvenilia . ''

		These will consist of
Stevenson	PERSON	's early and curious ventures in literature .

		In particular may be mentioned a poem illustrating two plates , and the long lost introduction to '' The Master of
Ballantrae	LOCATION	. ''

		The volume is intended to be a surprise to subscribers , so that further particulars are not forth - coming .

		In a few weeks , however , these will have had the volume delivered , and , no doubt , they are now eagerly waiting for it .

		Mr.
Unwin	PERSON	has started his '' Library of Literary His - tory . ''

		It is on quite different lines to the two similarly named series issued here by Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	and Messrs.
Blackwood	PERSON	; but it is only fair to Mr.
Unwin	PERSON	to say that his series had been planned and the volumes laid down long before the rival publications were announced .

		It deserves success .

		Still another series of histories of literature is an - nounced .

		Mr.
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	, who planned the '' Story of the Nations '' series , will publish the '' Library of Literary History , '' to be made up of volumes upon lines similar to those of the earlier series . ''

		With the

A. E. Keet	PERSON	, formerly editor of '' The Forum . ''

		The contents and illustration of this magazine are of a high character , and it promises to become a formidable rival to our own magazines of the first class .

		The
Burton Society	ORGANIZATION	, recently organized in
Denver	LOCATION	, proposes to publish , for the benefit of subscribers only , a reprint of
Burton	PERSON	's `` Arabian Nights , '' copied after the
Benares	LOCATION	edition of 1885-88 .

		The sixteen volumes of this work will cost the first hundred subscribers ninety dollars each , after which the subscription price will be raised to
one hundred dollars	MONEY	.

		A '' double section '' of the '' Xew English Diction - ary , '' extending from Frank-law to Gain-coming , edited by Mr.

		This carries Volume IV .

		Mr.
Richard LeGallienne	PERSON	's tame and superfluous paraphrase from the English translators of
Omar Khay	PERSON	- yam is published by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	in a volume of such charming workmanship as to soften in some degree the feeling of resentment naturally occasioned by Mr.
Le	PERSON	-
Gallienne	PERSON	's impudent performance .

		It makes a pretty book , however insignificant as literature .

		A book-club has recently been organized in
Gonver	LOCATION	- neur ,
New York	LOCATION	, under the title of '' Brothers of the Book . ''

		As an outlet to their enthusiasm they are issu - ing , in pretty brochure form , that summing up of Pater 's philosophy to be found in the '' Conclusion '' of '' The Renaissance . ''

		The Scrivener , Mr.
L. C. Woodworth	PERSON	, will be glad to furnish book-lovers with further partic - ulars regarding the publication .

		The '' Science Series , '' announced by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , will discuss , in a series of independent monographs , the more important aspects of contempo - rary scientific knowledge . ''

		The Stars , '' by Professor
Newcomb	PERSON	; `` Earth Structure , '' by Professor Geikie ; '' General Ethnography , '' by Professor
Brinton	PERSON	, and '' The History of Science , '' by Mr.
C. S. Pierce	PERSON	, are a few of the score of books already arranged for and announced .

		The managers of the
Chicago City Press Association	ORGANIZATION	have compiled an invaluable little '' Reporter 's Note - Book , '' the object of which is '' to call attention to those errors most frequently found in reportorial copy . ''

		While the work is therefore primarily addressed to the newspaper reporter , its concisely - written chapters could be read with profit by anyone who writes for publica - tion .

		The book is published by Mr.
C. A. Whitney	PERSON	, La Grange , 111 .

		That
Cabeza de Vaca	ORGANIZATION	, in his long wanderings from somewhere on the coast of
Texas	LOCATION	to very near the
Cal	LOCATION	- ifornian
Gulf	LOCATION	, touched
New Mexico	LOCATION	in
1536	DATE	, was be - lieved only so long as investigation of the matter was unscientific .

		Mr.
Bandelier	PERSON	, who has no near rival in critical knowledge of the documentary '' sources , '' the ethnography , and the physical geography involved , years ago established the general itinerary of the long-suffering Spaniard , and proved definitively that he never saw any portion of what is now
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Two students of
the University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Miss
Brownie Ponton	PERSON	and Mr.
B. H. McFarland	PERSON	-RRB- attempt , in the
January	DATE	'' Quarterly '' of
the State Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, to establish a more northerly route .

		There is a certain plausibility in some of their surmises as to unimportant parts of the march in
Texas	LOCATION	; but the crux of the matter is merely `` Did Vaca touch New Mexico ? ''

		Without personal knowl - edge of the Territory , and with scant erudition in its eth - nology and its Spanish chronicles , they satisfy them - selves that he did ; but the theory is untenable to more critical investigators .

		For the determination of a ques - tion which is one of the most recondite in early Amer - ican history , there needs years of documentary training , of dangerous and difficult exploration , and of ethno - graphic field-knowledge , all temporally impossible to any college undergraduate .

		Mr.
W. G. Collingwood	PERSON	has recently printed the fol - lowing interesting item : '' I am glad to say that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's health is much as it has been during these later years .

		He still takes his daily walks , sees his personal friends , and spends much time in reading .

		But it does not seem to be understood by the public that his com - parative health depends upon his being kept from all unnecessary work .

		He directs his own business , but is obliged to decline correspondence , and can not reply to 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, the many letters which still come asking for his inter - vention in public matters , or for private advice and assistance . ''

		Canon
Rawnsley	PERSON	, who never misses an op - portunity to pen a sonnet of the anniversary or memorial sort , has just published the following tribute to Mr.
Kuskin	PERSON	, upon the occasion of the seventy-ninth birthday of the great art-critic and ethical teacher . ''

		Born in our monster
Babylon	LOCATION	, to decree The blasting of all Babylons and ordained To be her avant-conrier who has reigned Longest and best we give God thanks for thee .

		Tho ' conquering hosts encompass land and sea , And men of arms her Empire have maintained , Thou art her mightiest warrior , thou hast gained By power of wisdom wider sovereignty .

		Wherefore to thee , for whom this day has brought The golden crown thy eightieth year shall wear , We bring the tribute of our love and praise , And borne from far-off centuries we hear Proud acclamation of the seer who wrought Undying splendour for Victorian days . ''

		With the expansion in recent years , growing ever more and more rapid , of population and complicated interests throughout our land , '' the cumbersome organization of slower days '' was subjected to a strain it could not bear ; and the adoption of a multiplicity of committees , each intrusted with some department , was the only practical way out of a vast difficulty .

		It illustrates evolution as working in a living , changing political organism , and Dr. McConachie studies its details with great care .

		He writes with no little vivacity , and with a wealth of interesting illustration .

		And probably it will be read with even greater interest , for the solution which it suggests , though certainly not more important than his primitive Christian morality , comes to us with greater freshness , and is in more direct contradiction , not merely to generally recognized practice , but to all modern theories and doctrines openly and universally proclaimed as to the meaning and value of Art .

Five Dollars	ORGANIZATION	.

		THIS volume is the first of a series which aims to present a more accurate and more com - prehensive description of the structure of a typical mammal than has been hitherto attempted .

		This treatise may be , therefore , regarded as a monograph on a typical mammal , and be employed as an introduction to general comparative anatomy ; and inasmuch as in its general scope , in its methods of description , in the prominence given to practical detail and comparison , and as far as possible in its terminology , it is in accord with the standard text - books on human anatomy , it may be confidently used in preparation for the study of human anatomy , especially by those who propose to enter a medical course .

		Although the present volume is the first of a series , nevertheless it is complete in itself , and is an introduction to comparative osteology .

		While it deals largely with general principles , it is mainly an exhaustive study of the skeleton of a typical mammal , the cat , followed by close comparisons with the human skeleton .

		It is based entirely upon original investigations extend - ing through many years , and is illustrated with a wealth of new and original engravings .

		Un - usual prominence is given to the explanation of all technical terms and to such practical sug - gestions for study as will enable a student to grasp the subject without previous anatomical training .

		Peculiar features of the work are : the description and classification of all recorded variations and anomalies ; the introduction of rules for making comparative measurements ; the identification of the processes of development in skeletons of animals of known ages ; and the determination of the exact attachments of the muscles .

		Many details of the subject , which are not usually considered in works on osteology , such as the bony labyrinth of the ear , the nasal cavities , the nasal bones , and the teeth , are treated with great fulness .

		The author 's long experience with elementary classes has led to the adoption of those methods of instruction which are best calculated to train the powers of observation and to stimulate the interest of the student .

		200 THE PLIGHT OF THE BOOKSELLER .

		For some months now a three-sided discus - sion of the most heated and acrimonious sort has been going on in
England	LOCATION	with regard to the mutual relations of the author , the publisher , and the bookseller .

		Not only are the trade - journals and the periodical organs of the spe - cial interests concerned filled with pleas and arguments upon the several phases of this com - plex problem , but the debate has established a firm foothold in the columns of the daily news - paper and the pages of the popular magazine .

		It is indeed a question in which the general public has a legitimate interest , for in these days of common school education we are all readers to an extent of which our forefathers never dreamed , and the average man , who is neither author , publisher , nor bookseller , feels instinctively that his own notions of what is proper should count for a good deal in any matter which places the cost of books at stake .

		In this respect , as in so many others , the great public is apt to disregard the nicer ethical con - siderations involved in the discussion , and to insist upon the cheapest books he can get re - gardless of the ways in which they may be cheapened for him .

		In our own country we had abundant opportunity to realize the force of this sentiment during our long struggle for the embodiment of common honesty in the copy - right laws , and just now we realize it anew in contemplation of the opposition to which an important reform in our postal regulations has had to succumb .

		The English agitation of this question takes its origin in the sufferings of the bookseller , from whom there arises a bitter cry of lessened pro- fits and lowered prestige .

		It all comes from the current discount of twenty-five per cent from the published prices of books , a discount forced by keen competition and now so firmly established by custom that it seems like a part of the English Constitution .

		We will cheer - fully give you two pence in the shilling , says the aggrieved bookseller , but to give
three pence	MONEY	is to take the bread from our mouths .

		Striking figures are presented in behalf of this plea , as in the case of one respected represen - tative of the trade , who shows that an annual turnover of three thousand pounds with a two penny discount will yield a greater profit than a turnover of ten thousand pounds under the conditions now existing .

		The publishers , for their part , claim that they would gladly help the booksellers to a decent living , but are quite helpless to do so , since the large dealers are satisfied to allow a three penny discount , and the small dealers are forced to follow suit .

		But no , say the boooksellers , just see how they do things in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In that happy land , deal - ers are forced to accept a discount based upon an equitable consideration of the interests of both parties , because the publishers would cut short the supplies of any bookseller who should violate this agreement by underselling his fel - low-tradesmen .

		Our safety is in the trust and 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, the boycott , and we call upon you to aid us in fastening these beneficent limitations upon our trade .

		Very well , say the publishers , only we must get the assent of the authors also , for with - out them our efforts would prove futile .

		The author is thus dragged into the dispute , but , to the dismay of the bookseller , proves recalci - trant .

		What I want , he says in substance to the bookseller , is the largest possible sale for my works , and so does my publisher , since his pro- fit and my royalty are in strict proportion to these sales .

		You , on the other hand , given your additional penny , would be better off , on your own showing , were you to sell less than half as many books .

		I know that I am tra - ditionally incompetent in matters of business , but I am not so guileless as all that .

		The pres - ent arrangement suits me quite well , and in en - deavoring to upset it I should be working against my own interests .

		In this seemingly hopeless impasse the discussion stands .

		In our own country , the problem is slightly different , although in its essentials much the same .

		With us , the authors , for lack of any organization corresponding to what obtains in
England	LOCATION	, do not form a third party to the dis - cussion , which is thus reduced to a struggle between publishers and booksellers .

		The bug - bear of the latter is not the regular discount allowed everywhere by honest retailers , but the department store with its cut prices , its prompt turnover , and its efficient organization .

		The very striking statement was recently made that one of these stores , on account of its advantage over the ordinary bookseller in the concession of from two to six per cent for short time pay - ments , could afford to retail an invoice of books '' for the net cost of the bill and still leave a profit . ''

		At such a statement the mere book - seller may well hold up his hands in despair , and look for some other means of making a living .

		Practically , he is forced to do one of two things : either retire from a business sub - ject to this sort of competition , or himself be - come a department store on a small scale by adding bicycles , and cigars , and patent medi - cines to his stock in trade .

		The public is to some extent at fault for this state of things , and the principle that every act of purchase is freighted with ethical and social responsibilities is no doubt a sound one ; but consumers ' leagues and other devices for bet - tering the condition of production and exchange do not seem likely to accomplish very much , and rarely convince purchasers who are not more than half convinced already .

		The '' shop - per '' will continue to watch for '' bargains , '' whether in books or in fine raiment , and is not easily persuaded to pay more for a given article than he must , or to contemplate the indirect consequences of his purchase when the direct and tangible advantage is so evident .

		More - over , the modern book-buying public is to a considerable extent a new public , created by the department store and the bargain counter .

		It would never have found its way at all into the real bookstore , and its acquisitions in the way of literature are made in delightful ignor - ance of the commodity which it is buying .

		It will proudly bear away its purchases of gaudy fabrications in cheap paper and muslin entirely unconscious of the fact that these things are not books in any real sense of the term , and will joy in the possession of , say , the '' works '' of Goethe -LRB- five volumes , price
$ 1.79	MONEY	-RRB- without the least suspicion that the '' works '' of Goethe do not exist in the English language .

		To the book-lover , on the other hand , and to the book - buyer of the old-fashioned sort , these things and the marts in which they are dispensed by unlettered counter-jumpers are an abomination .

		He , at least , knows the difference between books made to read and keep and books made , like the spectacles in the familiar story , '' to sell '' ; he also knows that the cut prices of books in the dry goods stores are not -LRB- with an occasional excep - tion -RRB- cut so very much after all , and that in such stores the books that the serious reader really wants are never by any possibility to be found .

		The bookstore , then , may be said still to re - tain the greater part of its old clientele , but the fact remains that it ought to attract the new class of book-buyers also , yet that somehow it does not attract them .

		The elementary eco - nomic forces by which society is swayed are pulling hard against the self-respecting book - seller , and more and more placing at a disad - vantage the intelligence which he seeks to re - tain in the conduct of his business and the con - science which the self-respecting publisher puts into the manufacture of his product .

		Now these economic forces are hard things to fight against ; they are certainly not to be combated success - fully by repressive legislation , as some book - sellers foolishly seem to wish , while such com - binations in restraint of trade as are here and there suggested are likely either to prove simply futile or so to outrage the moral sense -LRB- exhib - ited in our notions of fair play and freedom of individual action -RRB- as to defeat their own pur - pose .

		Measures of the first class surely can not be countenanced by intelligent persons , while
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 measures of the second class embody a wisdom almost equally dubious .

		What then remains ?

		The answer may not be a very satisfactory one , but it seems to be the only one left .

		Economic forces all have their origin in the mind , and flow from the ideas and desires of human beings .

		It is hopeless to oppose them by violent means , but it is not impossible to transform them by educational processes .

		The advance of civiliza - tion does react upon these forces to very de - cided effect , and every year finds more and more minds prepared to receive the important truth that the cheapest ways of doing things are not always the most desirable ways .

		This truth once realized , its translation into eco - nomic action is a comparatively simple matter .

		Its concrete application to the case now in hand may be stated very briefly .

		A good book-store , stocked with serious literature , and conducted by people who know something of the books they sell , is a civilizing agency of the highest importance to every community .

		It ranks with the public library and the local high school or college .

		That such a book-store should be found in every sizable town and that every great city should have a number of them are propositions that win without argument the assent of all in - telligent people .

		That it is difficult if not im - possible for them to exist under the conditions of present competition and of present public sentiment is a statement sadly true .

		That arti - ficial measures for the rehabilitation of the old - time bookseller are foredoomed to failure is the outcome of all sound ethical and economic rea - soning .

		We must then look for a better state of affairs , on the part of the public , to a more genuine popular education , a broader enlighten - ment concerning the usefulness of books , a greater willingness to bear small burdens for the attainment of large ends ; and , on the part of the bookseller , more patience under adverse influences , a broader view of the economic prob - lems with which he is confronted , and a greater alertness to impress the public with the need - fulness of his own peculiar social function .

London	LOCATION	,
March 1 , 1898	DATE	.

		The season has commenced with a rush , and business is moving in dead earnest .

		Publishers are now engaged in preparing their '' Spring Announcement '' lists ; and although these are not all yet to hand , I think I can give you sufficient information now to put yon on a foot - ing of equality with ourselves in that respect , by the time this reaches you .

		Of course , a few of the more important works of fiction have already been issued , such as Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's ''
Simon Dale	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Stan	PERSON	- ley
Weyman	PERSON	's ''
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	, '' and Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's `` Tragedy of the Korosko '' ; but much yet remains ere the holidays come on .

		So that yon may be better able to study the titles , I give them classified , with our pub - lishers ' names in parentheses .

		In Theology we have nothing supremely important .

		A great talk is being made of the new translation of the
Bible	LOCATION	, called the `` Polychrome Bible '' ; but as the work is edited and sub-edited by two of your own scholars , yon will , no doubt , know all about it .

		Al - ready three volumes have been issued .

		One curious part about the publication of it is that two firms , Messrs.
James Clarke & Co.	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
David Nntt	PERSON	, are both ad - vertising it largely , the latter not so much as the former .

		Messrs.

		THE DIAL 177 Soaks .

		AN EXPONENT OF PRE-RAPHAEUSM .

		* It is many years since Miss
Francesca Alex	PERSON	- ander first became known in the art world as a person of pen-and-ink importance .

		So far back as
1855	DATE	, Mr.
Motley	PERSON	admired her draw - ings with some extravagance of statement ; and much later , when Mr.
Buskin	PERSON	chanced to meet her in
Florence	LOCATION	and saw her work , he made haste to place her among the immortals with
Holman Hunt	PERSON	and others of the Pre-Raphaelite faith .

		The immediate cause of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's admiration was a portfolio of 109 drawings in pen-and-ink , illustrating and decorating the songs of the Tuscan peasantry .

		He took these drawings with him to
England	LOCATION	, talked about them in his Oxford lectures , presented a num - ber of them to the university , to
St. George 's Museum	ORGANIZATION	, and to other schools where he lec - tured .

		Twenty or more of the plates were photographed at the time , and , with Miss
Alex	PERSON	- ander 's translations and Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's editorial comments , they made up the book of
1884	DATE	called '' Roadside Songs of
Tuscany	LOCATION	. ''

		Since then , photographic processes have been so much improved that it has been possible to reproduce all of the original plates line for line .

		This has been recently done in photogravure , by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the result is the complete and very handsome quarto of
1897	DATE	called '' Tuscan Songs . ''

		For the songs themselves , and their transla - tion by
Miss Alexander	PERSON	, there is little now to be said except in praise .

		The poetry of them their lyric element is not great ; but they are the records of faith , hope , and sentiment among the Tuscan peasantry , and Miss
Alex	PERSON	- ander has brought them together believing that the best of them should be preserved .

		The ex - amples given are but the siftings from many hundreds of songs heard and remembered in
Tuscany	LOCATION	, where
Miss Alexander	LOCATION	has spent the greater part of her life .

		Some of them were taught her by
Beatrice Bernardi	PERSON	of Pian degli Ontani a local improvisatrice and others came to her at odd times and in strange ways .

		The music to them was written by
Signora Ses	ORGANIZATION	- tilia
Poggiali	LOCATION	; and
Miss Alexander	PERSON	, after the task of translation , put her pen at work beautify - ing the pages with initials , borders , and full-page * TUSCAN SONGS .

		Collected , translated , and illustrated by
Francesca Alexander	PERSON	.

		One hundred and nine photogravures from the original designs .

		illustrations .

		What artistic quality the work possesses lies in the illustrations ; and it is with them that popular interest will be chiefly con - cerned .

		One may as well acknowledge at the start that
Miss Alexander	PERSON	has done her work with sincerity , and that she has spared neither time nor labor to make it beautiful .

		The spirit she brought to it was conscientious and sympathetic .

		Indeed , Mr.
Rnskin	PERSON	thought her peculiar art gift was sympathy '' the gift of truest expres - sion of feelings serene in their Tightness . ''

		The frontispiece drawing to the '' Story of Ida , '' one of Miss
Alexander	PERSON	's earlier books , shows infi - nite tenderness and feeling , and it is not to be wondered at that one of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's faith should be allured by the spirit of the worker .

		Still , he was not wholly blinded .

		He admitted that Miss
Alexander	PERSON	had faults , but thought them more than atoned for by the virtue of sin - cerity .

		And that is quite true ; but Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin was hardly the right one to say it .

		For the faults of Miss
Alexander	PERSON	's drawing were of his planting .

		It was his writing and teaching that led her into error .

		He says evidently intend - ing it in commendation that her work is '' dis - tinguished by the faculty and habit of realiza - tion which belongs to all Pre-Raphaelism . ''

		Yes ; and what a pity !

		That is the error of it the error of Pre-Raphaelism , and Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin , and
Miss Alexander	LOCATION	.

		And it all came about from a misconception of the early Italian paint - ers the painters before
Raphael	PERSON	.

		It was dis - covered -LRB- let us say , for the sake of argument , by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	-RRB- that these painters had a won - derful charm of sincerity and honesty in their paintings , that they convinced one by their truth , their frankness , their earnestness of statement .

		It was also discovered that they did everything , from high to low , with an ex - acting detail , making much of flowers and grasses , and dwelling long upon such things as patterns , brocades , and jewels .

		Immediately the conclusion was jumped at that the fine spirit of a
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	or a Carpaccio was the re - sult of a '' loving care '' in the handling of de - tail .

		Then it was further concluded that the spirit could be regained by the moderns if they would but take up the detail with the same '' lov - ing care . ''

		The result was Pre-Raphaelism in
England	LOCATION	, with
Holman Hunt	PERSON	,
Millais	PERSON	, and Ros - setti as disciples , Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	as prophet , and , far on the outside of the circle , such people as Miss Alexander taking an impulse from the movement .

		CJfflW The early Italians , it may be said , painted 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, in detail , not necessarily because they loved detail as such , but because they could not by any chance paint in any other way .

		It is char - acteristic of youth that it sees things in the part before it grasps or comprehends them as a whole .

		Every beginner paints the leaves upon the tree before he understands the mean - ing or significance of the forest .

		In other words , the power of generalization is not given to either the youthful painter or the youth - ful race .

		The fifteenth century Italians painted in a small way because they were immature .

		When the race and the art reached an apo - gee with Titian at
Venice	LOCATION	, the manner of see - ing and painting was wholly changed .

		Nature was summarized and synthesized ; the great truths were given , and the small details were subordinated .

		But Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	has never recognized the immaturity of the detail view , and he has more than once scolded himself red in the face over the studio doctrine of subordination .

		As for his disciples , most of the Pre-Raphaelites aban - doned the brotherhood and its small realism at an early day ; and from those , like
Kolman Hunt	PERSON	, who have clung to the faith , there has resulted only incomplete work .

		This was to be expected .

		For all art movements that try to turn the world backward by reproducing past art usually seize upon the shortcomings and mannerisms of the imitated .

		Pre-Raphaelism was no exception .

		It persistently grasped at the detail and consistently lost the ensemble .

		This is Miss
Alexander	PERSON	's crying fault , and yet , paradoxical as it may sound , it is her technical virtue .

		Detail is not objectionable in such things as a branch , a flower , a vine ; and Miss Alexander shows us by the spray of blossoms in the half-title to her book how really beautiful it may be when set apart by itself .

		But a car - rying out of this detail in a tree would result in something of metal-like rigidity having no possible relation to the earth , air , or sky .

		And Pre-Raphaelism insisted upon carrying out the principle of detail in every kind of composition .

		Miss Alexander shows it to us in
Plate 84	LOCATION	, representing the Child lying upon a heap of hay .

		The hay is drawn line upon line with minute precision , and as a result it has no elas - ticity about it .

		It is , in fact , as hard as wire .

		In Plate 29 , showing the
Madonna	PERSON	and the Rich Man , there is no end of detail lavished upon the pots and the plants at the right ; but the relation between the foreground , middle distance , and background , is lost .

		The hair and the head of the Rich Man are minutely done , but the head does not fit the body , and the figures do not fit the courtyard where they are supposed to be standing .

		Of course
Miss Alexander	PERSON	, like her master , scorns all the studio teachings of subordination , of values , of the relations of light and dark .

		She is seeking truth , not studio devices ; but does she attain it ?

		Yes ; she gains the small truths of leaf and wrinkle and eyelash , but she loses the great truth of unity .

		One might go on , and suggest that in Plate 33 she has given figures and a room , but not a room with figures ; that Plate 42 shows figures and a landscape , but not a land - scape with figures .

		In almost all of the larger compositions the insubordinate prominence of the petty features hurts the unity of the mass .

		Notice the wall under the window in Plate 61 , how it comes forward out of the picture ; and in
Plate 88	LOCATION	, how the whole room falls to pieces to give place to the figures .

		There is an imp of compensation that follows minute realization .

		You may gain the surface but lose the sub - stance , gain a figure but lose the room , gain a bush but lose the landscape .

		And yet , when one has had his fling at Pre - Raphaelism he may be very far from thinking the work of its exponents wholly worthless .

		One may find fault with Miss
Alexander	PERSON	's drawing for its want of knowledge or its abund - ance of bias , and yet see much to be admired in her book of illustrations .

		Certainly its best quality is the spirit with which it is imbued ; but , aside from that , there are many small decorative features of much beauty .

		The flowers , stems , and vines woven between the lettered text are excellent in every way , and remind one of the fine illustrations by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	made so many years ago for '' Modern Painters . ''

		In themselves these are quite suffi - cient to carry the book and give it more than a passing interest .

		The frontispiece , showing a single portrait figure , is also exceptionally vital ; and there are a number of large illus - trations , such as Plates 59 , 91 , and 101 , of unusual charm .

		One may differ with the prin - ciple upon which the work is done without ques - tioning either the spirit or the ability of the worker .

		Pre-Raphaelism was both a success and a failure .

		It started on a wrong principle , but worked out its own salvation by dint of native ability and industry .

		The same thing might be said of both Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	and his pro- tegee ,
Miss Alexander	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 179 A FRENCH CRITIC 'S STUDY OF WORDS - WORTH .

		* In his preface to '' The Excursion , '' Words - worth alludes to a previous , though unpub - lished , poem of his own as '' biographical , and conducting the history of the author 's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for enter - ing upon the arduous labor which he had pro- posed to himself '' -LRB- in writing `` The Recluse , '' of which '' The Excursion '' was to stand as the second portion -RRB- .

		Hesitating to lay before the public anything which dwelt at such length with his own experience , until such time as his apparent self-glorification should have been justified by the completion of `` The Recluse , '' the poem alluded to '' The Prelude '' although written in its author 's prime , was not published until after his death ,
fifty years later	DATE	.

		In general , critics have assumed the reader 's knowledge of this unique autobiographical poem .

		A Frenchman ,
Monsieur Emile Lego	PERSON	- uis , believing that its import has not been suffi - ciently recognized by
Wordsworth	PERSON	's own coun - trymen , finds in the poem the material for a more intelligent understanding of Words - worth 's character and inner life than has before been made .

		He undertakes to give as com - plete an account of it as direct quotation , sup - plemented by analysis , can convey ; to explain or amplify it by means of all the obtainable evi - dence in the shape of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's other poems , together with his own and his friends ' correspondence ; to determine the allusions , and to assign to each particular fact its full impor - tance by giving a suitable account of its relations to history .

		A few chapters in conclusion are given to an analysis of the work of Words - worth 's maturity ; but in the main the work is , as its title indicates , devoted to `` The Early Life of
William Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' ending with his twenty - eighth year , the period covered by `` The Prelude . ''

		It is a highly interesting study , is ably translated by Mr.
J. W. Matthews	PERSON	, and makes a volume of nearly five hundred octavo pages .

		Scarcely any English poet has been the sub - ject of so frequent or so voluminous criticism as
William Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Beginning with DeQuincey , most of these have agreed in assign - ing
Wordsworth	PERSON	's optimistic habit of mind to * THE EARLY LIFE OF
WILLIAM WORDSWORTH	PERSON	, 1770-1798 .

		A Study of '' The Prelude . ''

		By
Emile Legouis	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		his exceptionally favored lot in life .

		M. Le - gouis , however , reminds us that
Wordsworth	PERSON	's lot was not in itself propitious , but the reverse ; and reveals to us that his happiness and optim - ism were due to the conscious action of the will , and to deliberate choice , that , indeed , he affords a most conclusive example of the power of the will over the formation of ideas and the ordering of existence .

		Having resolved to be happy , and having arrived at a clear perception of the necessary means ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	held with invincible tenacity to that line of life and thought which in his opinion must lead to hap - piness .

		In order to attain this end , he employed all his individual gifts , his rare powers of mind , his genius even , and his insight into nature ; and to this extent there is an incommunicable element in his method .

		But it is the effort , the unflinching resistance to despondency , that con - stitutes the great moral lesson of his life ; a lesson which , in spite of differences in individ - ual capacity , is of general applicability .

		From a literary point of view , also , the work is in - structive as explaining
Wordsworth	PERSON	's isolated position amidst a murmuring and rebellious generation .

		Reviewing the well-known facts of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's life , our critic finds them melan - choly rather than enviable . ''

		Can a man be reckoned a favorite of fortune when he has lost his mother during his eighth year , and his father at sixteen ; when he has been arbitrarily deprived of his inheritance , has had to endure a humiliating exist - ence under the roof of stern and narrow-minded grand - parents , and for years has been coldly treated by his relations on account of his indolence , his obstinacy , and his refusal to embark upon any of the safe careers sug - gested to him ; when he is kept apart from the sister he loves beyond everything else , apparently from fear that she may become contaminated by his disobedience and his subversive opinions ; when he entrusts all his dreams of happiness to the French Revolution , only to see them borne under in the tempest , and loses not only his respect and love for his native country , but all hope of progress as well ; when , meanwhile , his existence is so straitened , so penurious even , and so utterly without promise for the morrow , that he is compelled to pospone indefinitely his union with his sister 's friend , that maiden , chosen long ago , and now beloved , whom he knows not whether he can ever make his wife ? ''

		The real theme of '' The Prelude , '' according to
M. Legouis	PERSON	, is the wonderful way in which the man contrived to profit by circumstances in themselves either indifferent , or favorable and unfavorable by turns , so as to attain to a joyous harmony of all his faculties .

		It is less a nar - rative than a study of origins ; less the history of a man than a philosophy of a mind .

		Far from being egoistic , it is broadly human ; the poet chooses himself for hero simply because he 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, can fathom no other soul so deeply , because there is no other from which he could derive so many fresh and indubitable truths .

		Moreover ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	's biography becomes almost an inward history of his generation .

		To learn how , in his case , manhood was developed out of early youth , is to learn how the nine - teenth century was born from the eighteenth , so different , yet with so manifest a family likeness .

		The moral crisis of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's life came , as it did for so many of his contemporaries , in connection with the progress of the French Revolution .

		The visions of approaching uni - versal happiness which flashed before men 's eyes in
1789	DATE	were speedily converted into dis - cord .

		Elements which it had seemed possi - ble to reconcile were discovered to be radically opposed : humanitarian faith was superseded by pessimism .

		The tranquility of his old age came out of such storm and stress ; the stages of recovery from the blight of the years between
1792	DATE	and
1795	DATE	were slow but sure .

		The prin - cipal remedial agents were , first , the combina - tion of circumstances which restored him to a country home and to an atmosphere of nature where alone he could breathe freely ; and , sec - ond , the companionship of his sister
Dorothy	PERSON	, the being he loved best in the world .

		With such protection and support , gradually he recovered what he had lost a moral equilib - rium as perfect as any poet has ever enjoyed .


Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	was something more than a companion whose affection is merely soothing .

		She had a measure of genius pecu - liar to herself , at once active and alluring .

		She was not content with a mere passive admiration of her brother .

		With all her faith in him , the greatness which her wishes as well as her fancy anticipated for him was of a particular kind .

		Very early she decided in her own heart that he would be a poet , and made up her mind also as to the sort of a poet he would be .

		Indeed , it is vain to attempt to distinguish the share each had in their mutual observations of na - ture .

		On every page of
Dorothy	PERSON	's journals are touches of description which give rise to some of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's best lines .

		To the maiden who saw with , and sometimes for , the poet , yet left to him the glory of immortalizing the image which she had discovered as soon as or earlier than he , a large share of admiration must be accorded .

		Besides
Dorothy	PERSON	, the only person by whom
Wordsworth	PERSON	admitted himself to have been deeply influenced was
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		The intimacy which began between these two men while both were in their early twenties was as opportune as it was beneficial .

		It was
Coleridge	PERSON	who provided , or rather assisted ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	to find the only thing still needful to make him the poet he finally became , namely , a philosophy .

		Soon the two young men felt that each was necessary to the other , and they established residences within easy walking distance , for the sake of daily intercourse .

		The story from this on is more familiar , yet some fresh insight is to be gathered even here .

		Coleridge , in his Bio - graphia
Literaria	LOCATION	, has already made us famil - iar with the principal incidents which led to their attempts and failures at collaboration .

		M. Legouis shows that notwithstanding their utter inability to work with each other , each worked best/or the other , or rather each felt the spur and stimulus of the other 's mind with such force that the effect was of the happiest on both natures .


Wordsworth	PERSON	's realism asserted itself through being brought into conflict with
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's preference for the fantastic .

		The impos - sibility of keeping step with
Coleridge	PERSON	, and the discomfort of feeling his natural progress thwarted , were to
Wordsworth	PERSON	a decisive and imperious revelation of the inevitable tendency of his own poetic genius .

		Henceforth his pecu - liar province should be the common .

		Wherever selection was possible , he held it his duty to borrow nothing from those elements of the world which are marvellous and unusual .

		But when he has thus thrown to the winds all the customary auxiliary resources of poetry , what was left to prove his claim to the title of poet ?

		There remained a powerful imagination directed upon common objects and upon the simple in - cidents of life .

		His imagination sees accu - rately , but because its vision is powerful it sees what has never been seen , or sees better and more clearly the objects which are displayed before the gaze of all men .

		It is indeed an illumination from the soul , '' the gleam , The light that never was on sea or land , The consecration , and the Poet 's dream . ''

		THE DIAL 181 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS IN MANY LANDS .

		* The care which many of us use when some fav - ored friends of ours become engaged to marry , in offering our best wishes to the woman and in congratulating the man , is interesting .

		But it is something more .

		It is significant of the time when the woman was not won as she is to-day , but was the booty of a successful foray or the gift of the father and owner .

		This custom of our day is good enough , and we would not change it ; but if we think of it a moment we shall see that we congratulate the man because he is supposed to have been striving for a prize which he has at last won , and our best wishes to the woman mean sim - ply that we hope she may be happy .

		One who leans a little toward cynicism is sometimes inclined to reverse this social formula , on the ground that the woman is really the more for - tunate of the two , and that it is the man for whose happiness we should be hoping .

		Whatever be the facts so far as present con - ditions are concerned , there was once a time to which this courtesy of ours points when there would have been in it a genuine literal - ness which it lacks to-day .

		When a young man , having decided that he must have a wife , gathered a few ^ of his friends about him , set out for some neighboring tribe , seized and brought home the most attractive woman whom he could find , he might well be congratulated .

		He had won a prize .

		With quite as genuine a feeling could one offer the maiden his best wishes that she might be happy if it could so be .

		This rude method of securing a wife was somewhat improved when a man came to apply to the parents or to the father of a girl whom he wanted .

		The proprietorship of the father was recognized , so it was his consent that needed to be gained rather than that of the girl herself .

		But as truly again had the prize been won , and with a deeper feeling of sympathy than before might one hope for the happiness of her who had been literally given away .

		We need not look far back of us in time , nor to very distant parts of the world , to see this cus - tom still alive .

		We , it may be , have wandered farther from these old-time ideas than have many peoples , retaining ourselves traces of them only traces which have become almost mere forms .

		If we were able to know the marriage cus - * MABBIAGE CUSTOMS IK MANY LANDS .

		By the Rev.
H. N. Hutchinson	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	,
F.Q.S. New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		toms in all lands , we should find everywhere old practices still surviving , or at least exist - ing in rudimentary forms , but all pointing back to a time when the beliefs of the people made necessary these practices either to ward off evil spirits or to secure good fortune and abundance to the young man and his bride .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	still the bride stands close to the groom during the service , '' that there may be no room for the
Prince of Darkness	ORGANIZATION	to come between them . ''

		Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	, the author of '' Marriage Customs in Many Lands , '' has brought together from many sources descriptions of a great va - riety of marriage customs .

		His object is '' not to discuss scientific questions connected with the origin of marriage and the human family , '' but '' to present to general readers a careful account of quaint and interesting customs , derived from information scattered through innumerable volumes . ''

		The value and interest of the book certainly would be much increased if we could learn from it not merely what vari - ous marriage customs people have , but why they have them .

		It is perhaps too much to expect in a single volume , and we can hardly complain since it was not the author 's purpose to explain but only to relate .

		Attention is mainly given to those countries with which we are least familiar and where old and curious customs remain most tenaciously .

		Southern
Germany	LOCATION	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	, and
Tyrol	LOCATION	are full of survivals of old-time customs , the mean - ing of many of which is forgotten ; while
China	LOCATION	is illustrative of a people among whom an elaborate ceremonial in connection with mar - riage retains in large part its original signifi - cance .

		The barbarous peoples of
Africa	LOCATION	, of
America	LOCATION	, and of the Islands of the
South Pa	LOCATION	- cific , furnish curious customs similar in many cases to those of more advanced people .

		If in reading Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	's book one is able to bear in mind the customs found in dif - ferent countries , he is struck with the frequent recurrence of certain practices .

		We are not ourselves very familiar with marriages or be - trothals arranged by parents or friends , but we notice among peoples as widely separated as are Chinese , Turks , Basutos of
Africa	LOCATION	,
Samoans	LOCATION	, Scandinavians , and Magyars , the go-between is an important person .

		With some the duties of the matchmakers are merely formal ; with others , they really bring about the marriage .

		But even when the duty is a formal one it is without doubt a relic of the time when the father owned the daughter and disposed of her 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, on the best terms possible .

		Look where we may , the world over , we find these traces of former customs .

		Our own custom of giving away the bride is a direct descendant of the practice of the father or other male rela - tive giving away the women of the family as wives .

		It is well worth while to read a book in which one finds so many old customs described .

		And when we are amused by the curious , and , as they seem to us , foolish beliefs of many peoples , we shall do well to bear in mind that we ourselves have not as yet outgrown the age of superstition .

		Many of our prettiest customs are but survivals from a superstitious past , de - serving , however , to be retained for their pic - turesqueness .

		Yet there is no doubt that to many they are of real importance , though not understood .

		We may hope that in marriage , as in other matters , we may in time outlive our belief in signs and wonders , that we may feel a marriage is complete if no rice is scattered about , even though for picturesque effect we continue to throw the rice and the old shoe .

		A word may be added with regard to the general appearance of the book .

		It is very attractive ; the illustrations reproduced from photographs and paintings are unusually good .


MERTON L. MILLER	PERSON	.

		WORLDS NOT REALIZED .

		* Until the publication of `` Le Tresor des Humbles , ''
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	was known to the reading public as a philosophic man of letters .

		Every serious author is more or less philo - sophic : he has something to say of the general principles of life ; he can hardly avoid having some kind of philosophy , although he may make no effort to state it systematically or even directly .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has now , however , become a literary philosopher ; and in his latest book he sketches for us the outlines of his theory of the universe .

		It is not remarkable that
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	should have a philosophy : the re - markable thing is that he should try to express it , for it had been previously understood that the main characteristics of the deep truths which his work has heretofore embodied were such that nobody could give them utterance .

		* THE TREASURE OF THE HUMBLE .

		By
Maurice Maeter	PERSON	- linck .

		Translated by
Alfred Sutro	PERSON	, with an Introduction by
A. B. Walkley	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , indeed , this last principle is the basis of the present formulation .

		In '' The Treasure of the Humble , '' then , we have
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	as a philosopher ; not a very systematic philosopher , it is true , not academic , arid , accurate , but still a philosopher for all that .

		There will be many who have been interested in his plays who will like to turn to them again with these more definite statements in mind , and see how far they can discern , in what was enigmatic , the forms more or less vague which are a little more plainly drawn in this book .

		Such readers will turn at once to the essay on '' The Tragical in Daily Life , '' where they will certainly find some things of a good deal of interest concerning the manner and the matter of '' The Princess Maleine '' and the other remarkable dramas .

		We prefer , how - ever , to consider the book by itself for the mo - ment , or , rather , for itself .

		It offers us coun - sel on life and not on literature , and we prefer to take it as it offers itself .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	is a philosopher of a known school , and his work has a place in a known tendency of our time .

		Let us see , if we can , what he adds to what has been already common property .

		When we speak of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	as a phil - osopher of '' a known school '' we mean that he is a mystic .

		That is a very vague name , and comprehends people as far apart as Plotinus and
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mystics are really not much farther known than as they are known to be mystics .

		Still the word gives us , in a way , some idea of a standpoint : it means , for in - stance , that one proceeds by intuition rather than by the reasoning powers .

		As a nineteenth century mystic ,
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	will be con - nected in our minds with a movement of some interest in contemporary
France	LOCATION	.

		He is not a Neo-Christian , as the term is or was , but in so far as his thinking comes from
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	he partakes of the thought that has influenced the Neo-Christians .

		Being a Bel - gian , however , it is not remarkable that there should also reappear in him the German strain , somewhat diversely apparent in
Eckhard	LOCATION	,
Boehme	PERSON	, and Novalis .

		All this is a very tame way of dealing with a great genius , of course ; but , tame or not , we see no other way so simple or so efficacious of giving the general idea of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's philosophy .

		Set him down as a mystic , and you know something of him .

		He deals with the secret of Life ; he deals with matters not apprehended by the ordinary senses or the intellect ; he endeavors to see through the hith -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		183 erto barrier of ordinarily-accepted human pow - ers .

		He is looking along '' the wall of life in search of the crevices through which God -LRB- and , let us add , Man -RRB- may be seen . ''

		It is possibly foolish to attempt to give any account of the ideas of one who begins his work by declaring -LRB- entirely in earnest -RRB- that '' It is idle to think that , by means of words , any real communication can ever pass from one man to another . ''

		Certainly it is not an encouraging beginning ; we can not understand
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck without refuting him , for this point is cardinal .

		But the reader must pass over the dilemma ; without accepting the paradox he can not even begin .

		Indeed , he will perhaps remember that the great moments of life are silent moments .

		Here
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, very scientifically and unmystically , makes his start .

		Mystic though he be , he begins with a defi - nite fact which anyone may verify .

		There are certain moments in the life of everyone which are different from all other moments , in which life stands still and is eternal , while or - dinary existence runs through sixty , seventy , or six hundred seconds of time .

		Such moments people experience in different ways : some in love , some in sport , some in religion , some in work ; but all have them .

		People explain them in different ways , or else they do not explain them at all , or perhaps they do not even wholly appreciate that they have them .

		Such moments have conventionalized themselves in literature as the period of '' thoughts too deep for words . ''

		For these moments are certainly moments of silence : but it is in them , proceeds
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck , in them only that we know .

		In such moments we are conscious of our brethren ; * then there is an instinct of truth in us : then existence lies bare .

		When do we know such moments ? ''

		At a home-coming , on the eve of a departure , in the midst of a great joy , at the pillow of a death-bed , on the approach of a dire misfortune , '' although it may be at no such crisis ; it may be at any time .

		Now , of such moments some people have more and some less ; some seem to have a great many .

		Three or four years ago , writing of Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	and
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, we spoke of their subjects as being '' indefinite hopes and fears , imagin - ings of spiritual accompaniment , premonitions almost occult , faint ripplings of emotion , the little wavelets that skim over the waves of pas - sion . ''

		But in saying so much and no more , we failed to penetrate entirely the idea of
M. Mae	ORGANIZATION	- * Here , as often in what follows , I use a phrase or a word of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's without quotation marks .

		terlinck , if not of Mr. Sharp .

		* For now it is clear that it is as the awakening of the soul that
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	regards these questions '' of a presentiment , of the strange impression produced by a chance meeting or a look , ... of the secret laws of sympathy and antipathy , of elective and instinctive affinities , of the over - whelming influence of the thing that had not been spoken . ''

		In these silent moments of life , our souls may know each other ; and for many reasons
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	believes that our souls know each other more now in our daily life than in other ages .

		There have been such periods in history before ,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, the centuries of Mediaeval Mysticism ; there have also been periods in which souls were shut away from each other .

		Such was the case in the eigh - teenth century ; but now these great silent mo - ments are moments of more interest .

		On this theory is the book based .

		In certain great silent moments of life do we know the souls about us , do we become aware of fate , do we realize God .

		The essays are hardly consecu - tive : they depend on the first and the second , and have a certain connection with each other , but they do not make an interdependent system .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has noted a change in our ideas of morality .

		There are moments when we feel , more deeply than did our fathers , that we are not in the presence of ourselves alone , and in such moments our conscience judges without much influence from '' conventional '' morality .

		In such moments do '' the gods from whom we
spring	DATE	'' manifest themselves in an invisible goodness which , more than anything else , brings our soul into contact with other souls .

		The true working of life , the true fate , does not lie open ; it is hidden from most of us .

		Some per - ceive it more than others , most of all , those few whom the gods love and have destined to early death : more than men , women , who have preserved the sense of the mystic in the earth to this day .

		Such is the merest hint at
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's theory of Life : it can be seen to be a very inter - esting one .

		We have not here a mysticism like that of
Eckhard	PERSON	, who strove to express the relation of God with any individual soul ; or even like that of Ruysbroeck , who sought to indicate a way by which the soul could return to the divine from which it had sprung .

		We have here a very practical matter , not handled Somewhat more happy , perhaps , were we in speaking of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	as one of the '' antennae . ''

		He uses the same figure himself in speaking of Novalis , '' nn de ces etres extra - ordinaires qni sont les antennes de Tame humaine . ''

		184 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, in a very practical way to be sure , but still a matter not for saints alone but for anyone and for all .

		Everybody can recognize the moments when he becomes conscious of the true life , and everybody can increase his power of appreciat - ing such moments .

		`` This much at least is abundantly proved to us , that in the work-a - day lives of the very humblest of men , spiritual phenomena manifest themselves , mysterious direct workings , that bring soul nearer to soul . ''

		It is this possibility of true life that
M. Mae	PERSON	- terlinck thinks of as '' The Treasure , '' and it is more common in such lives as lack the ordi - nary circumstance of this world , namely `` The Humble . ''

		We have spent so much time in trying to express
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's views that we have no room left for criticism .

		But criticism of such a theory of life is hardly a matter for a period - ical devoted to current literature .

		It will come in time , and in a different way .

		It is a pity , however , that we can not indicate the aesthetic bearing of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's philosophy : that we can not point out the way in which this theory of '' the moment '' is developed in application to the drama , and indicate some further appli - cations .

		But such matters must be passed by .

		The English version of this book is a good one .

		Despite some small inaccuracies and inelegancies , it is rather remarkable in convey - ing the meaning and the character of the orig - inal .

		We rather regret the omission of the essays on
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Kuysbroeck	PERSON	, and Novalis .

		They do not really belong to the others -LRB- although they are included in the French edi - tion -RRB- , but they are very useful in an effort to understand our author .

		Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	's Intro - duction seems to us good : not by any means the last word of comment , but still such as to give the reader who turns to it after he has read the book a good deal of help in accom - modating new ideas to old ones .

		It is a curious book , written in a charming style , and persuasive .

		One feels somehow as though
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	had almost a right to answer anyone who can not see anything in it with the repartee of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	, namely , Do n't you wish you could ?


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	,
JK	ORGANIZATION	.

		r THE popular '' Story of the Nations '' series , published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , now numbers fifty volumes already published , besides several others in preparation .

		A new cloth cover has been designed for the series , which gives it a more dignified appearance upon the library shelves .

		SOME RECENT FOREIGN FICTION .

		* Foreign fiction is represented in the recent pro- duct by a number of books , among which six at least must have a few words of praise or dispraise , as the case may be .

		Nothing but praise , surely , is the desert of the stout volume which contains a half score of tales and sketches by Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, translated , like the author 's other books , by the increasingly skilful hand of Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	.

		The au - thor of the great Polish trilogy has now obtained such a vogue that whatever may bear his name is sure of an audience , and we are no longer called upon to do the missionary work that it gave us so much pleasure to do a few years ago .

		Two small volumes of short pieces by this writer have for some time been familiar to English readers , and seemed to give slight earnest of his tremendous powers when working with sufficient elbow-room .

		Taken by them - selves , those two volumes gave indications of little more than a graceful talent .

		The new volume , en - titled `` Hania '' from its longest story , is of a dif - ferent quality , and seems to us quite worthy of the genius which we know the author to possess .

		It is , to be sure , very uneven , and several of the sketches attain nothing more than mediocrity , but the others touch a very high watermark indeed , and exhibit much the same combination of raciness , vitality , and artistic restraint that makes the minor writings of Tourgue ` nieff supreme in their kind . ''

		Hania , '' '' Tartar Captivity , '' and '' Charcoal Sketches '' are certainly masterpieces in miniature , and not un - worthy of comparison with '' First Love '' and the '' Annals of a Sportsman . ''

		Some of the other pieces are of comparatively slight value , and two or three of them are no more than chalk drawings for the great canvasses by which the author is chiefly known .

		Why Dr.
Max Nordau	PERSON	should have thought him - self capable of writing a novel , is a dark mystery .

		As an illustration of his own hobby of ''
Degenera	PERSON	- tion , '' such a production as `` The Drones Must Die '' may have a possible warrant for existence , but we can conceive of no other .

		The book has neither wit nor penetration nor shrewd observa - tion nor strength of any sort .

		Its movement is truly elephantine , and its invention is limited to the well-worn story of the poor man who seeks to en - rich himself by speculation and finds himself caught in the net of the spider .

		THE DIAL 185 effective treatment of la haute finance ; Balzac ac - complished it , and Zola has the power to do it again , but Dr.
Nordau	PERSON	is too pitifully equipped for this or any other novelistic enterprise to be deserving of the slightest attention .

		The ponderous romance entitled `` Andronike , '' which Professor
Grosvenor	PERSON	has translated from the modern Greek of Mr.
Stephanos Theodores Xenos	PERSON	, is a chronicle history of the Greek revolution of
1821	DATE	, and covers the happenings of the three event - ful years that ended with the sea-fight at
Navarino	LOCATION	.

		It proves to be more interesting as history than as romance , for the author is too minute and pains - taking in his endeavor to record the facts to make a successful novelist , and the work on the artistic side is at once nawe and crude .

		Yet there are thrill - ing episodes , described in a spirit of exalted patri - otism , which have power to stir the blood and to reproduce the emotional tumult that was translated by
Shelley	PERSON	into the pure poetry of '' Hellas . ''

		Many unfamiliar incidents are woven into the web of the romance , besides those things long familiar to all English readers the devotion and death of
Byron	PERSON	, the adventures of Trelawney and
Odysseus	ORGANIZATION	, the heroism of
Marco Botsaris	PERSON	, the defense and fall of
Misolonghi	LOCATION	, the sinister careers of All and Ibrahim .

		The book is at least good history , and so embodies the spirit of modern Hellenic nationalism that we can easily understand the high esteem in which it is held by the people of whose contemporary liter - ature it is said to be '' the greatest romance . ''

		The picturesque figure of AH
Pasha	PERSON	is one of the most interesting in the Greek novelists ' gallery of historical portraits , and the desperate villany of his career long ago inspired the foremost among Hun - garian writers of fiction to weave a romance about '' the Liou of
Janina	PERSON	. ''

		This romance , translated into English by Mr.
Nisbet Bain	PERSON	, has just been pub - lished , and serves once more to illustrate the orien - tal imagination and the artistic irresponsibility of its prolific author .

		The story is moulded about a skele - ton of historical fact , but has in reality no more hold upon life than an Arabian tale .

		One can not help being attracted by the invention and the glitter of such books , but it is not easy to take them as serious examples of modern fiction .

		The publication of
M. Zola	PERSON	's ''
Paris	LOCATION	, '' complet - ing the trilogy of `` Les Trois Villes , '' is not only an event in the literary sense , but derives much adven - titious importance from the author 's recent cham - pionship of a cause unpopular with his fellow-coun - trymen .

		However his part in that unfortunate af - fair may have aroused the animosity of social and official
France	LOCATION	, there is no doubt that it has com - pelled the admiration of the disinterested public out - side , and that he has won for himself a new and en - thusiastic following among lovers of justice and fair play everywhere , whether given to the reading of books or not .

		If not , many of them will make an exception in favor of a novel published at just this time by
M. Zola	PERSON	, and the fortunes of the book are assured , as far as the general European and
Ameri	PERSON	- can public is concerned .

		Report comes from
Paris	LOCATION	that the hatred of this writer is so widespread as to lessen the probable sale of the new novel .

		But we doubt if human nature in
Paris	LOCATION	is so unlike what it is elsewhere as to have this effect .

		Even those who dislike the author the most will have a natural curi - osity to become acquainted with his final deliberate verdict upon the civilization which he has so taken to task in his
defense of Captain Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	.

		That ver - dict is embodied in the earnest and passionate pages of ``
Paris	LOCATION	, '' and must be reckoned with as the pro- nouncement of one of the most acute and vigorous intellects of the time .

		It is a many-hued picture with which the book presents us , a canvas with strong effects of chiaroscuro and lurid coloring , with start - ling contrasts between the base and the heroic , be - tween social shams and social realities , between the heartless indifference of the wealthy and the des - perate frenzy of the proletariat .

		There is much bit - terness of feeling in the criticism of the existing or - der , and a note of fine indignation rings through the whole work .

		Yet the purport is not pessimism , although many will no doubt dismiss the book with that easy epithet ; it is rather the impatient and passionate idealism of the clear-sighted philosophi - cal observer , who says to society `` thou ailest here and here , '' and does not shrink from laying bare the plague-spots of the present , knowing that by such service the permanent interests of society are best to be furthered .

		No ,
M. Zola	PERSON	is as distinctly an idealist as is Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	; to charge such men with pessimism is to display ignorance of the very mean - ing of that term .

		We wish it might be said that the art of
M. Zola	PERSON	was commensurate with his idealism .

		But the fact is indisputable that most of the literary graces are denied him ; there is in the best of his work little animation or brilliancy , little of the light - ness of touch to which art owes most of its effects , little of the calm that is so much more persuasive than the most turbulent display of emotion . ''


Paris	LOCATION	'' is not as dull as `` Lourdes , '' or even as ``
Rome	LOCATION	, '' but it is nevertheless dull , except in episodes , and much conscientiousness is needed to read it without omission .

		The intellectual evolution of the Abbe Froment is the thread which unites the three sec - tions of the trilogy , and in the end we leave him , en - nobled and strengthened by much suffering , brought to full acknowledgment of the claims of the intel - lect , and prepared to substitute a rational theory of conduct for the incoherent fabric , now hopelessly shattered , of his long cherished illusions .

		The in - troduction of his brother
Guillaume	PERSON	, a chemist who has invented a new explosive of extraordinary power , makes it possible for the author to give to anarchism of the bomb-throwing type a conspicu - ous place in this ''
Paris	LOCATION	'' section of the work , and the destruction , planned but not executed , of a great basilica , is one of the most exciting episodes to which our attention is directed .

		In this book we doubtless have the final word of
M. Zola	PERSON	's philoso - phy and of
M. Zola	ORGANIZATION	's art .

		And the fundamental questions raised by his total activity are these two : 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Is the philosophy that toward which the currents of enlightened thought are irresistibly flowing ?

		Is the art of such a nature that to the future observer , looking back upon our epoch , the books that bear the name of
Zola	ORGANIZATION	will appear as the books of Bal - zac now appear to us , as the lasting embodiment of the life and thought of their age ?

		To the first ques - tion we may with some degree of confidence make an affirmative answer , but to the second the reply must be in the negative .

		The future historian of literature will not be able to neglect the immense work of
M. Zola	ORGANIZATION	, but will be constrained to deal with it as we now deal with the work of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		In other words , it will be dealt with not as a per - manent possession of literary art , but as a literary force for the most part spent in the period that was responsible for its generation .


M. Pierre de Coulevain	PERSON	's `` American Nobility '' is a novel that we have read with great interest , and if we can not give it our unqualified approval we can at least pay tribute to its skilful construction and its obvious sincerity of purpose .

		It is , briefly , the story of a French gentleman of distinguished ancestry , who , finding the family fortunes impaired almost to the point of destitution , seeks to restore them by marriage with an American heiress .

		The marriage is duly brought about , and the wedded pair are happy for a time ; but the inevitable intrigue pres - ently makes its appearance , and shatters the dream of the confiding wife .

		After a period of great emo - tional stress for all concerned , the other woman dies , practically by her own act , leaving husband and wife to patch up a sort of reconciliation , and try to save from the wreck of their happiness enough to make their continued existence tolerable if nothing more .

		This plot is so hackneyed that its bare state - ment seems to put the book in the list of common - place and insignificant fictions ; but the author has acted from a serious artistic motive , to which credit must be given .

		His book is to a considerable ex - tent the embodiment of a thesis , to the effect that such marriages as he describes must inevitably fail to result happily , since there are spiritual depths in the soul of a Frenchman which no Anglo-Saxon woman can sound , spiritual needs in his nature which only women of Latin race and Catholic train - ing can satisfy .

		There is thus found a sort of justi - fication for the conduct of the hero , who is by no means represented as a vulgar libertine , and who clearly enjoys all the time the qualified respect and the entire sympathy of the writer .

		Let those who will call such a book immoral in its tendency ; we rather prefer to take from it the lesson of the essen - tial incompatability of temperament existing be - tween the two races , and are willing at the same time to concede that the author has told the story with perfect honesty from his own point of view , that he has done his best to be fair to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	character , and that the fatal defect of his argument proceeds from a limitation of sympathetic insight - of which he himself is absolutely and bliss - fully unconscious .

		RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL .

		*
Mark Twain	PERSON	's recent account of his around-the - world lecture tour , which he entitles '' Following the Equator , '' is a first-rate specimen of that eminently sagacious mixture of sense and nonsense which is so characteristic of him .

		To many refined people he may seem the vulgar buffoon , entirely unrespectful , unconventional , irreverent ; but this aspect is but his surface aspect .

		He reverences what is essentially worthy of reverence , as is evident from many a page in this volume .

		His remarks on reverence , indeed , show eminent sense and insight , as when he says : '' The reverence which is difficult , and which has per - sonal merit in it , is the respect which you pay , without compulsion , to the political or religious attitude of a man whose beliefs are not yours .

		You can not revere his gods or his politics , and no one expects you to do that , but you could respect his belief in them if you tried hard enough , and you could respect him , too , if you tried hard enough .

		But it is very difficult ; it is next to impossible , and so we hardly e-ver try .

		If the man does n't believe as we do , we say he is a crank , and that settles it .

		I mean it does nowadays , because we can ' t burn him . ''

		In truth , the dominant note in this book is not jest but earnestness , moral and humane , an earnest desire for sincerity and genuineness , but tearing sham to pieces and flinging it to the winds .

		If Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	had not been
Mark Twain	PERSON	, he might have been
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		But we have not space for exemplifying fully either the wisdom or the wit in this book .

		However , we mention the common Hindoo impression of the
United States	LOCATION	, as
Mark Twain	PERSON	gives expression to it .

		When this country is named to the average Hindoo , '' Two torches flare up in the dark caverns of his mind , and he says , ' Ah , the country of the great man Wash - ington ; and the
Holy City Chicago	LOCATION	. '

		For he knows about the
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	, and this has enabled him to get an erroneous impression of
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		THE DIAL 187 desultory ; yon never know on what continent the next page will land you .

		Altogether , we have a most brilliant and varied jumble of wit , humor , information , instruction , wisdom , poetry , irony , and jest .


Mark Twain	PERSON	is continually stepping from the sublime to the ridiculous , and vice versa .

		As soon as he suspects he is getting eloquent , he at once jumps into outrageous farce .

		As
Mark	PERSON	warns off the reviewer who shall attack him for padding , we will only say that his skill and brilliancy can almost redeem the plentiful padding in this book .

		As a book of travel , this work stands very high by reason of its incisiveness and vividness ; and the inveterate travel-reader will mark the day he fell in with it with red-letter .

		Altogether , we find here that rara avis , a real book , full of thoroughly original char - acteristic impressions characteristically expressed , and thus intensely enjoyable to the real reader .

		Mr.
W. A. Paton	PERSON	's '' Picturesque Sicily '' is a general and popular account of scenery , antiquities , and modern life , in that sunny isle .

		In the course of a three months ' sojourn he visited the principal cities
Palermo	ORGANIZATION	,
Catania	LOCATION	,
Messina	PERSON	, and
Syracuse	LOCATION	; and also
Segesta	LOCATION	,
Selinus	LOCATION	,
Girgenti	PERSON	, and other places of antiquarian interest , all of which are de - scribed in an enthusiastic and pleasant vein .

		He is surprised at finding in
Sicily	LOCATION	more ruins of Greek temples than in all
Greece	LOCATION	, and he gives large space to his observations on these ruins .

		The Sicily of to-day he finds to be in the main poverty-stricken and beggar-ridden .

		He is harried from the most charming views by crowds of loathsome beggars .

		The Middle Ages still linger in
Sicily	LOCATION	, as is shown by the prevalence of saint-worship and superstition , and the lawlessness of secret associations like the
Mafia	LOCATION	.

		At Cefalu he happens on a true descend - ant of the mediaeval minstrel who recited from the '' Chronicles of the Crusaders . '' ''

		Daring his recitations he stood as if wrapped in thought , bareheaded , forgetful of the weather , and , seemingly , of our presence .

		The performance was not a mere repetition of lines by rote , for , although there was very little variation in accent or tone , he seemed to speak as if his mind was fixed on the ideas he was ex - pressing .

		The tale of the Crusade finished , we gave him whatever it may have been , and again requested our guide to ask him to recite other numbers of his repertoire .

		Informing us that he would give us the story of the ' Landing of Ruggiero and the building of the Cathedral at
Cefalu	LOCATION	, ' he began in a louder and more inspiring tone , and repeated the lines more vigorously and with finer expression , using certain modest gestures .

		The tale of King
Roger	PERSON	was longer than either of the other two recitations , and , when he finished it , the old man , pointing eagerly in the direction of the town , told our guide to say to the strangers that ' There , there , was the very city
King Ruggiero	PERSON	had visited , there the cathedral he had built in honor of the Christ . '

		How were the mighty fallen !

		From the shoulders of the disciples of Ciullio d'Alcamo , the favorites of the kings , the pets of fortune , the mantle of minstrelsy had fallen on the bowed shoulders of this starved and woe-begone old man whom we found on a bitter Sicilian winter day cowering under the ruins of an ancient Norman keep . ''

		Books on
Sicily	LOCATION	are indeed few , but when Mr.
Paton	PERSON	says that '' the
Norman	PERSON	conquest of
Sicily	LOCATION	has not found its historian , '' he forgets Gaily Knight 's and
Bazancourt	ORGANIZATION	's books on this subject .

		The author 's views are of the impressionist type , and there is much second-hand material .

		As a whole , the work is diffuse and journalistic .

		But while it has not the vital inevitable quality of a book of the first class , it will be found in general readable and useful .

		The appendices are of particular value , but the book has neither map nor index .

		The illustra - tions , though often interesting , are hackneyed in subject , and sometimes poorly done . ''

		Going to War in
Greece	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	, is a
New York	LOCATION	reporter 's account of the recent one-sided little fray a month from start to finish between those two ancient enemies , Greek and Turk .

		Most of the book is taken up with the looking and waiting for the war to begin ; and of the actual war there is little description of operations .

		The childish unmilitary character of the Greek '' Army of the Cafe '' '' is brought out in so strong a light that we suspect caricature .

		The book is writ - ten in jaunty style , and contains numerous rather indifferent illustrations , but has no map .

		Commander
R. H. Bacon	PERSON	's book with the strik - ing but not unjustifiable title , ''
Benin	LOCATION	, the
City of Blood	ORGANIZATION	, '' is a straightforward military account of the British expedition , in
1897	DATE	, to
Benin City	LOCATION	,
West Africa	LOCATION	, to avenge the massacre of the English mis - sion .

		As a narrative of one of
England	LOCATION	's innum - erable little wars , and as throwing light on African savagery and bush - fighting , it has considerable interest .


Benin	LOCATION	was deserted at the approach of the British , and was found steeped in human blood , '' smeared over bronzes , ivory , and even the walls . ''

		The evidence of crucifixions and human sacrifices was found everywhere . ''

		Every person who was able , I should say , indulged in a human sacrifice , and left the remains in front of his house . ''

		Com - mander
Bacon	PERSON	's account shows clearly that the most pernicious element in savagery is a cruel religion .

		The book contains also some interesting details on the method by which the British fought their way along the narrow paths in the dense forest .

		In ad - vancing along these paths where savages might lurk unseen within a few feet , '' precautionary volleys '' from rifles and Maxims were fired on all sides every few minutes .

		Sometimes rockets were used to intim - idate the natives . ''

		The most weird feature of the whole fighting is the rarity with which the enemy is seen .

		Shots are fired , yells , whoops , and shouts are heard , men fall wounded and killed , yet not a sign of the enemy himself , except just the shiver of a moving bush and the half doubtful view of a dusky figure . ''

		The book is furnished with a rather inade - quate map and a few fair illustrations .

		Dr.
J. H. Barrows	PERSON	's '' A World Pilgrimage '' is a collection of letters of travel which originally appeared in the '' Chicago Record '' and in '' The Interior . ''

		Herein Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	discourses , in his 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, vein of general optimism , of his doings and observ - ations on the usual world-trip , and everywhere he maintains a large , humane , and catholic view of things and men .

		While this is in no wise a very notable book , it is readable and suggestive .

		His lecture-tour naturally gives rise to more extended remarks on
India	LOCATION	than on other countries , and these ten chapters will have special interest for missionary circles .

		The illustrations are only pass - able .

		We regret to notice that the title-page is de - faced by a mangled quotation from
Keats	PERSON	.

		Another cosmopolitan book of travels , but of a somewhat different order , is Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's '' A Year from a Reporter 's Note-Book . ''

		It treats of war in
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	, of glory in the Coronation of the Czar , of the Inauguration of Mc -
Kinley	PERSON	, of the Queen 's Jubilee , and the Millennial Celebration at
Budapest	LOCATION	.

		All these events are de - scribed in that clear , crisp , graphic style , and with that slight trace of cynicism , which we have been accustomed to expect from Mr.
Davis	PERSON	.

		Perhaps the best of these '' Notes '' is that on the Coronation , wherein the author gives a quite vivid impression of the Czar-worship and the mediaevally deep , sombre , unthinking religiousness of the great mass of Russians .

		However , the most quotable page is in the
Budapest	LOCATION	article , a description of
Berkes	PERSON	, the greatest of Hungarian violinists . ''

		His violin seems to be just as much a part of him as are his arms or his eyes or his heart .

		When he plays , his body seems to stop at the neck , and he appears to draw all of his strength and feeling from the violin in his hands , the rest of him being merely a support for his head and instrument .

		He has curious eyes , like those of a Scotch collie sad , and melancholy , and pleading , and when he plays they grow glazed and drunken-looking , like those of an absinthe drinker , and tears roll from them to the point of his short beard and wet the wood of his violin .

		His music probably affects different people according to their nerves , but it is as moving as any great passage in any noble book , or in any great play , and while it lasts he holds people absolutely in a spell , so that when the music ceases women burst into tears , and I have seen men jump to their feet and empty the contents of their pockets into his lap ; and they are so sure to do this that their ser - vants take their money away from them when they are dressing to dine at some house where
Berkes	PERSON	is an - nounced to play .

		One night a Frenchman dipped a two-thousand-franc note into a glass of champagne and pasted it on the back of the man 's violin , and the next day
Berkes	PERSON	sent it back to him again , saying that to have this compliment paid him by a foreigner in the presence of his countrymen was worth more to him than the money . ''

		These brief reportorial sketches we feel to be too often over-done , too conscious , too blunt , and too lacking in real grace , beauty , and technique , to be literature of any high order ; yet they certainly have a value and interest , and a measure of real but mostly suggested power . ''

		Afloat on the
Ohio	LOCATION	, '' by the well-known historical writer , Mr.
R. G. Thwaites	PERSON	, is a pleasant though not especially interesting account of an uneventful canoe voyage down the
Ohio	LOCATION	to
Cairo	LOCATION	.

		In diary form it gives useful historical and descriptive notes on the places passed and people met , and in particular is valuable as throwing some light on the river-life of house-boats and fishermen ; but we feel at the end that we should choose some pleasanter , if less his - toric , stream than the
Ohio	LOCATION	for a canoe trip .

		The book contains two appendices , '' Historical Outline of
Ohio Valley Settlement	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' Selected list of Journals of Previous Travellers down the
Ohio	LOCATION	'' ; but it has no map .

		Mr.
H. L. Willoughby	PERSON	's `` Across the
Everglades	LOCATION	'' is an account of a journey into that unknown part of
Florida	LOCATION	where the Seminoles were driven in the Indian War . ''

		It may seem strange , '' our author remarks , '' in our days of Arctic and African explor - ation , for the general public to learn that in our very midst , as it were , in one of our
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast states , we have a tract of land one hundred and thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as much unknown to the white man as the heart of
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		We learn that the
Everglades	LOCATION	is not a dense swamp , as often supposed , but a vast grassy lake with water but a few inches deep , and oc - casional islets a few feet square .

		It is inhabited by Indians , deer , otter , snakes , and birds .

		Mr.
Willoughby	PERSON	found that the saw grass was the great barrier to Everglade travel . ''

		It pays better to go twenty-five miles around than half a mile through .

		What makes this grass so formidable and so much dreaded is the saw-like edge with which it is armed on three sides .

		If you get a blade between your hand and the pole , it will cut you to the bone , with a jagged gash that takes long to heal . ''

		Mr.
Willoughby	PERSON	met with no remarkable adventures , but his story , though attaining little literary quality , is simply and directly told , and will be found espe - cially readable by all who find pleasure in outdoor life .

		The first half of the work is introductory , giving some account of previous expeditions into the
Everglades	LOCATION	, and of his preparation for his trip .

		He finds the real crocodile as well as the alligator and has some interesting remarks on this matter , though we must regard his long list of species as padding .

		The book has a serviceable map and illustrations , and as appendix a Seminole vocabulary . ''

		Servia , the Poor Man 's Paradise '' is the attrac - tive title of an enthusiastic book on that little known country , by
Herbert Vivian	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	, an ardent ,
High Church	ORGANIZATION	, conservative Englishmen , travelled for some months in
Servia	LOCATION	, and gives a glowing and attractive picture of this seldom visited Balkan province , which has only of late completely freed itself from the Turkish rule .

		He says : '' I rejoice to have explored Servia before she is com - pletely given over to the exigencies of progress .

		Already she has lost very much of the Oriental glamour which travellers encountered even ten years ago , and ten years hence she may be fashioned entirely upon modern West - ern lines .

		The picturesque squalor of Turkish times is being rapidly expropriated by the ugliness of the useful .

		Still , I know no country which can offer so general an
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 impression of beauty , so decided an aroma of the Mid - dle Ages .

		The whole atmosphere is that of a thrilling romance .

		Conversation is larded with accounts of hair - breadth ` scapes and deeds of chivalry and all as if they were everyday occurrences , the most natural in the world .

		At each turn I met heroes who had performed prodigies against the hajdutsi , swashbucklers who had led irregulars against the Turks , popes who had smelt powder when fighting for the national cause at the head of their flocks . ''

		The style is spirited and good , though we think the oft-used '' state-stroke '' is rather clumsy for coup d'6tat .

		As a whole the book , though not particularly well-considered and thorough , is an interesting and useful sketch of
Servia	LOCATION	, past and present , in its polit - ical , ecclesiastical , and industrial aspects .

		The work is provided with a good map .

		Captain
Younghusband	PERSON	in ''
South Africa	LOCATION	of To - day '' republishes letters and telegrams to the Lon - don '' Times , '' whose special correspondent he was during the recent disturbances in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.

		The author has studied the subject at first-hand and gives a fair , able , and interesting account of the cir - cumstances that led up to the
Jameson Raid	PERSON	, and of the events immediately following .

		He regards the
Transvaal	LOCATION	as the richest section of
South Africa	LOCATION	, and destined to become the most populous .

		The Boer question certainly gives great solicitude to the English .

		Indeed , the enterprising , energetic En - glishman , continually running against a stone wall of stolid , crafty Dutchmen , is almost nonplussed and dismayed .

		While most of the book is given up to the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, there are also chapters on
Rhodesia	LOCATION	and
Natal	ORGANIZATION	.

		Altogether , the volume , if not as compre - hensive and luminous as Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's recent account , is in many ways a closer study , and will repay care - ful reading .

		Mrs.
Isabella Bird Bishop	PERSON	's ``
Korea	LOCATION	and her Neighbors '' is an up-to-date handbook on
Korea	LOCATION	, and contains also some information on neighboring
Manchuria	LOCATION	and
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Bishop	PERSON	familiarized herself with the country and people during an ex - tended residence at treaty ports and during two jour - neys to the interior .

		She found the
Koreans	LOCATION	under a most oppressive government , limp , lazy , dependent , poverty-stricken , but the Korean colonists in
Siberia	LOCATION	under Russian rule very thrifty and prosperous .

		One marked characteristic of
Koreans	LOCATION	is an am - bition to eat much and often . ''

		They eat not to satisfy hunger , but to enjoy the sen - sation of repletion .

		The training for this enjoyment begins at a very early age , as I had several opportuni - ties of observing .

		A mother feeds her young child with rice , and when it can eat no more in an upright posi - tion , lays it on its back on her lap and feeds it again , tapping its stomach from time to time with a flat spoon to ascertain if further cramming is possible .

		The Ko - rean is omnivorous .

		Dog meat is in great request at certain seasons , and dogs are extensively bred for the table .

		Pork , beef , fish , raw , dried , and salted , the in - testines of animals , all birds and game , no part being rejected , are eaten a baked fowl , with its head and claws , and interior intact , being the equivalent of ` the fatted calf . '

		Cooking is not always essential .

		On the Han I saw men taking fish off the hook , and after plung - ing them into a pot of red pepper sauce , eating them at once with their bones . ''

		Mrs.
Bishop	PERSON	writes with the air of the professional traveller , and in a business-like way conveys a vast amount of information clearly and impartially .

		She throws a side-light on the Chino - Japanese war , and is particularly full on the political and industrial aspects of the people at the present time .

		`` This feeblest of independent kingdoms , rudely shaken out of her sleep of centuries , half frightened and wholly dazed , finds herself confronted with an array of powerful , ambitious , aggressive , and not always over - scrupulous powers , bent , it may be , on overreaching her and each other , forcing her into new paths , ringing with rude hands the knell of time-honored custom , clamoring for concessions , and bewildering her with reforms , sug - gestions , and panaceas , of which she sees neither the meaning nor the necessity . ''

		The illustrations , maps , and appendices add to the value of this book .

		HIBAM ^ STANIJ5T .

		A very candid irish traveller in
America	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		American readers will not feel alto - gether flattered when they look in fo e m i rror held up to them by the Hon.
Martin Morris	PERSON	, an intelligent Irish traveller , in his thoughtful little book of essays entitled `` Transatlantic Traits '' -LRB-
Elliot Stock	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	is of a reflective turn , and he gives gen - eral conclusions rather than raw impressions .

		He is by no means an ill-natured or on the whole un - friendly critic , but he is a very candid and dispas - sionate one , and he clearly has no notion of curry - ing favor with his cis-Atlantic readers by the cheap expedient of tickling their national vanity .

		On the other hand , it must be said that his book is quite free from the tone of patronizing jocularity which European travellers so often see fit to adopt towards this country .

		The author is altogether too sensible a man to affect to regard the
United States of America	LOCATION	as a huge joke , and he has evidently made a conscientious effort to comprehend us clearly and exhibit us fairly .

		Like most cultivated foreign trav - ellers , from De Tocqueville to Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, Mr.
Mor	PERSON	- ris finds us on the whole somewhat commonplace , immensely energetic and capable in every calling which has for its supreme end the accumulation of money , but correspondingly lacking on the aesthetic and intellectual side .

		We accumulate vast fortunes , invent miraculous machines , conduct great business enterprises ; but we are seemingly incapable of add - ing to or even of duly appreciating the world 's ar - tistic and intellectual treasures .

		In short , ``
America	LOCATION	is the land of the hoipolloi with a vengeance .

		Noth - ing rises above the common level but some gigantic buildings and ' the Elevated ' in
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	naturally thinks rather meanly of our art , and 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, we fear his stay at
Chicago	LOCATION	was marred by a glimpse of the alleged statue of
Columbus	LOCATION	recently removed out of deference to a growing sentiment of public disapproval that threatened in time to lead to a pop - ular outbreak .

		European travellers as a rule , after having damned with faint praise the '' evidences of our material prosperity '' of which we are so justly proud , are apt to grow rhapsodic on the theme of American women .

		Not so Mr.
Morris	PERSON	.

		Even here he is , as Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	said of his French critic on Goethe , '' candid and cool , perhaps a little cold . ''

		He grants the American woman a certain smatter - ing superiority in point of attainments over her busy dollar-getting husband ; but he finds her some - what shrill , noisy , lacking in feminine charm .

		He agrees with Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	that '' one feels her presence too much as a sound '' a vox et prceterea nihil , we suppose , like
Wordsworth	PERSON	's cuckoo , or the classic nightingale .

		It need not be inferred from our citations that Mr.
Morris	PERSON	found here nothing to admire and praise .

		He has a good many kind and cordial words for us , which are the more grate - ful in that they are evidently sincere and well - weighed .

		He does not deal in what is known in popular parlance as '' taffy , '' and he is one of those useful friends who tell us of our faults .

		There are three essays `` At Sea , '' '' On Traits in General , '' and '' American Traits '' together with a '' Fore - word '' and an `` Aftword . ''

		Two of the papers were written originally for the '' Nineteenth Cen - tury '' and the '' New Review , '' and they now ap - pear in a considerably enlarged form .

		A '' confession , '' as the word is com - c * .

		monly used , is an avowal of matters somewhat prejudicial to one 's char - acter and reputation .

		A collector , then , rightly uses the word `` confession '' for a statement of his deeds qud collector .

		We do not , however , consider Mr.
Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	's '' Confessions of a Collector '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- to be more than verbally prejudicial to the author 's reputation .

		It is true that it is a literary , an artistic sin to love books as a collector loves them ; but there may be extenuating circumstances .

		Some men can not help being drawn toward collecting .

		Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	was one of these .

		He is , of course , by no means unknown to the general reader , and these bibliographical memoirs will be opened by many with a good deal of pleasant anticipation , which will not be in vain .

		We have been greatly pleased at them , recalling no other such book that is so good , always with a reservation in favor of
Burton	PERSON	's '' Bookhunter , '' which we have not read for years and so may prize too highly .

		Strictly speaking , however , Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	was not a book-collector : that is to say , his chief dealing with books was not col - lecting for himself ; to use his own words , he was not a pure amateur but a commercial speculator in books .

		He began with the idea of a collection for himself , but later in life he was chiefly occupied as informal agent for others .

		The turning-point in his career was , we should say , when he sold Mr.
Huth	PERSON	a little seventeenth-century tract for five shil - lings , and discovered that cheapness was no recom - mendation with that gentleman .

		After this discov - ery , Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	assisted very largely in the increase and completion of the
Huth Library	ORGANIZATION	, much to the benefit of all concerned .

		We regard a commercial speculator in books as a superior person to a book - collector .

		Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	was destined by nature to have dealings in books : * his bibliographical knowl - edge and feeling made him a very exceptional purchasing-agent ; we will own to a feeling of respect for him at never becoming a mere book-collector .

		It must be confessed , however , that while his deal - ings with books were of a very proper character , he was unable to withstand the passion for collecting something .

		At one time he collected postage-stamps ; he speaks of the matter with some regret : '' a new weakness , '' '' a foolish passion , '' he rightly calls it .

		More seriously did he devote himself to the collec - tion of coins , and we think he makes out a fairly good case in favor of the coin - collector .

		And yet , curious at first , though on consideration natural , his very intelligent views on coin-collecting caused him to be regarded by the esoteric as a presumptuous layman .

		In fact , we can not regard Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	as a true collector .

		He was a student , an antiquarian , in letters and in other directions too , as everyone knows ; but we can not think that he was a true col - lector .

		He had really too broad views , too wide interests , too keen feelings , to be satisfied with col - lecting .

		Indeed , had he been a collector in the strict sense of the word , he could hardly have written so entertaining a book as the present one .

		Mr.
F. Anstey	PERSON	is already well known Mr.
Jabberjee	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	in scholarly circles for his skill in logical development from a funda - mental hypothesis .

		He is a most successful follower of the great originator of formal logic , who held that fiction was more philosophical than history on account of its aiming at general rather than partic - ular truth .

		Minor matters of fact have no great import to the reason : hence the positive value to the human race of the thorough plausibilities of '' Vice Versa '' or '' The Talking Horse . ''

		Mr.
Anstey	PERSON	appears now , however , to have abandoned -LRB- temporarily we hope -RRB- the field of logic to exhibit his mastery in the domain of the linguist . ''

		Baboo Hurry Bungsho Jabberjee ,
B.A.	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a work of many excellences , but its chief value ap - pears to us to lie in its being written in the care - fully studied lingo of a '' highly educated Indian university man '' who has for some time lived in
London	LOCATION	.

		Even a person who has never seen one of the species can see that the language must be good .

		Mr.
Jabberjee	PERSON	has learned something of the literary language at the university , and has learned much modern slang in
London	LOCATION	.

		He incorporates in his conversation all the incongruities possible to one who knows our inconsistent language but par - tially .

		His speech will repay the closest study , for every strand of the variegated thread is natural ,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 191
Clark Rutteirt	PERSON	even necessary , to one under his circumstances .

		Columbus showed how easy it is to do a thing when you know how : many users of the English language will here learn how difficult a thing they do every day without knowing anything about it .

		This work will find a place beside the famous `` English as She is Spoke . ''

		Useful , then , in a great degree to the linguistic student , the book will not be more wearisome than others of Mr.
Anstey	PERSON	's books to the more general reader .

		Mr.
Jabberjee	PERSON	is of the opin - ion -LRB- not unknown in this country -RRB- that the letter - press of '' Punch '' is not such as can be read with pleasure by a cultivated person .

		He offers his serv - ices to raise the general tone , and contributes ac - counts of his adventures .

		These are at first some - what disconnected , but as they proceed they knit into a narrative that finally comes to a great cli - max in the breach of promise suit of Mankletow i-s .

		Jabberjee .

		Mr.
Anstey	PERSON	's labors are recommended and elucidated by the work of his illustrator , whose presentations of the learned barrister are most deli - cate suggestions of nationality and character .

		^ r > ^ '
Clark Russell	PERSON	contributes his mite to the now subsiding
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	revival , in the shape of a volume of '' Pictures from the Life of Nelson '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The articles appeared originally in the '' English Illus - trated Magazine , '' and the author has added to them , out of quantitative considerations mainly , as we judge , a lengthy and somewhat rambling preface , together with some twenty-six pages of remotely relevant supplementary matter touching Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- sell 's old grievance , the elimination of Englishmen from the merchant service and the consequent dry - ing up of the fount whence the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	has always drawn its seamen of the storied national and traditional type .

		The competition of the foreigner and what Mr.
Russell	PERSON	evidently thinks the quasi - traitorous greed of the ship-owners are fast draining British forecastles of British sailors .

		The breed will become extinct ; and then , Mr.
Russell	PERSON	asks , what is going to become of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	?

		Now , we are inclined to think that '' cheapness '' is not the sole ground on which the Dutchman , the Scandinavian , or even the '' Dago '' is preferred to the Englishman in English shipping offices .

		Besides being '' cheaper , '' the foreigner is nine times out of ten thriftier , so - berer , trustier , and -LRB- above all -RRB- more tractable than his British competitor .

		Would Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, in the light of his own experience in the Merchant Ser - vice , deny that ?

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	babbles a good deal of the virtues of '' poor Jack '' his '' characteristic simplicity , '' his '' childlike nature , '' and so on .

		But how many '' Jacks '' of this legendary and conven - tional sort has Mr.
Russell	PERSON	ever actually met in the flesh , afloat or ashore ?

		The hard fact is that ''
Jack	PERSON	, '' and especially British ''
Jack	PERSON	, '' is in general much what his calling naturally tends to make him , a pretty tough customer , who gives his .

		tutelary '' cherub that sits up aloft '' and '' looks out '' for him no end of unnecessary trouble in getting him A critic not to be desired .

		out of scrapes of his own making .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	naturally looks to the legislature -LRB- everybody looks to the legislature for everything nowadays -RRB- to mend his grievance .

		He cites approvingly the old
Navi	PERSON	- gation Laws , under which the shipping of foreign seamen in British ships was narrowly restricted ; and seems to want something of the kind enacted now .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's Nelsonian pictures are graphic and spirited , and contrast favorably in this regard with Professor
Laughton	PERSON	's recent rather tame , if accurate and severely critical , '' Life . ''

		The bulk of the narrative is devoted to the famous sea fights ; but there are readable chapters on
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's boy - hood , his rather numerous erotic experiences , bis characteristics , etc. .

		The exasperating Lady
Hamil	PERSON	- ton episode is given no more than its due share of prominence .

		The book is neatly made and contains several full-page plates , portraits and battle-pieces , of excellent quality .

		The recollection of earlier essays led us to turn to Mr.
F. P. Stearns	PERSON	's `` Modern English Prose Writers '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- with pleasant anticipation .

		There is op - portunity for a good book on this subject , and we hoped to get it .

		We regret to say that we are much disappointed .

		The essays composing the book are written in a supercilious tone on superficial knowl - edge , and that is a pretty bad combination .

		If Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	knew his subject thoroughly one need not mind his manner , or if he wrote less ex cathedra one would not mind a few errors .

		As it is , however , one can not help noticing both .

		We do not know which are the most foolish , his brutal and untrue remark that
Ruskin	PERSON	's father '' fortunately died in time to give his more gifted son an opportunity for the work he was destined by temperament and inclination to perform , '' his idea that '' Modern Painters '' was written at a '' tender age , '' his igno - rance that '' Aratra Pentelici '' was one of
Ruskin	PERSON	's Oxford lecture courses ; or his fancies that
Arthur	PERSON	in '' a book ... called ' Schooldays at Rugby ' ' represented
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, that
Arnold	PERSON	was Pro- fessor of Poetry for nearly twenty years , laboring all the time throughout '' the whole academic year , '' that '' very few of the external facts of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's life have been made public '' ; or his opin - ions that all European languages are the progeny of the parent Indo-European , that
Max Midler	PERSON	is the most distinguished scholar living , and that '' the grand results of comparative philology '' were '' de - termined by Oriental Societies . ''

		A few minor errors like these do not necessarily amount to much .

		But we read this book till we had endured thirty or forty of them , and , as in that time we had not come upon any criticism of value , we then gave it up .

		It is remarkable that a man should write such a book .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	says , rather contemptuously , of
Ruskin	PERSON	that '' he never learned that a writer should confine himself to those subjects with which he is best ac - quainted . ''

		He implies that
Macaulay	PERSON	was enabled by means of the '' handle to his name '' to '' obtain 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, publication for any amount of trash . ''

		He calls
Taine	PERSON	's account of Thackeray a rigmarole , and adds that '' it seems a shame to apply this word to the work of so amiable a writer , but there is no other that suits the case . ''

		These remarks will suggest to the reader a sufficient criticism upon the work that contains them .

		Another attractive bird-book .

		A fresh help to an acquaintance with our feathered tribes is presented by Miss
Florence A. Merriam	PERSON	, in '' Birds of Village and Field '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Miss
Merriam	PERSON	has enjoyed unusual advantages for the study of birds from her childhood , in the field in various parts of the
United States	LOCATION	, and through the writings and the companionship of our most noted ornithologists .

		She has been trained to careful and systematic habits of observation , and the re - sults she offers upon any points pertaining to her theme are to be accepted as having authority .

		In her class-work with students she has felt the need of a simple '' bird-book for beginners , '' and with unquestioned intelligence has set herself to the task of supplying the want .

		Her attempt is limited to those birds which are most common , ' and there - fore the first and readiest to catch the eye and ear that are open to the sights and sounds of nature .

		The book is meant as an initial stepping-stone in the acquisition of bird-lore , and is therefore simple in every particular .

		There is no attempt at scien - tific classification , there are no technicalities ; but there are plentiful helps in the way of color-keys for the identification of 154 species of our more familiar birds , and in choice illustrations and lucid and attractive verbal descriptions .

		Miss
Merriam	PERSON	has much interesting knowledge to convey , original with herself or received at first-hand from bird - lovers who have bestowed painstaking attention upon the subject .

		She has given particular promi - nence to the usefulness of the birds in their relation to agriculture , in the majority of cases mentioning the noxious insects or small mammals on which each species chiefly subsists , thereby showing explicitly the incalculable service it renders to the farmer and the market gardener .

		Although one of many bird books lately published , it is by no means a repeti - tion of what has gone before .

		It has a fresh flavor which will be appreciated by the novice as well as by those who know most of the matter it treats .

		Mr.
William S. Pelletreau	PERSON	, editor of ''
Southampton Records	ORGANIZATION	'' and author of a history of
Putnam County	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, is well known to students of local history , who will now rise up and call him blessed for the sumptuous volume of '' Early Long Island Wills '' which his scholarly zeal , cooperating with the artistic tastes of Mr.
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	, his publisher , has put into their hands .

		The work is an unabridged copy of the manuscript volume known as the ''
Lester Will Book	PERSON	, '' and is the record of the Prerogative Court of the County of
Suffolk	LOCATION	, N. Y .

		In En - gland until recent years wills were probated in an ecclesiastical court of the archbishop of
Canterbury	LOCATION	; and when , in
1686	DATE	, in the Province of
New York	LOCATION	, the probate of wills was reserved to the Governor , the name of the court out of which this secular jurisdiction arose was retained .

		This record-book of a public court passed out of the county clerk 's office with the retiring clerk in
1811	DATE	, and was for many years lost to the public among the papers of his family , until in
1871	DATE	it was restored to its official resting-place .

		Mr.
Pelletreau	PERSON	has edited this valu - able collection with his usual accuracy , and has en - riched it with genealogical and historical notes , and fairly exhaustive indexes of persons and localities .

		The true historian does not fail to appreciate the value of such work as this .

		The publication , in accurate reproduction , of such portions of family history as our courts preserve in their records of marriages , probates , and even litigation , will aid in an important side-study of the social and domestic life of our forefathers , through which we can best come at the very `` form and pressure '' of their age .

		Perhaps it would have been better not to claim that the indexes are exhaustive , as such a claim puts the critic on his mettle .

		A verification through the twenty-six references under '' Halsey '' and the one hundred and six under ''
Howell	PERSON	'' dis - covers two wrong references and five omissions .

		This proves only that perfection is not to be ex - pected .

		Monuments of Some months ago -LRB- THE DlAL ,
July	DATE	ruined cities 16 ,
1897	DATE	-RRB- we reviewed the first part of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		of Prof w H
Holmes	PERSON	's `` Archjeo - logical Studies among the Ancient Cities of
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' issued in the Anthropological Series of the
Publica	LOCATION	- tions of the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second part , now out , continues this valuable work .

		The area studied is not so full of striking ruins as Yuca - tan , but presents some most important and interest - ing results .


Palenque	LOCATION	,
Mitla	LOCATION	,
Monte Alban	ORGANIZATION	,
San Juan de Teotihuacan	LOCATION	, are all well-known names .

		All but
Monte Alban	ORGANIZATION	have been frequently described .

		Professor
Holmes	PERSON	, however , brings out some points of interest which are either new or but little known .

		One or these is the locality of the quarries whence the stones for the buildings at
Mitla	LOCATION	were taken , with an account of the mode of work pursued .

		As in
Part I.	LOCATION	, special stress is laid upon constructional features .

		The series of panoramic views is con - tinued .

		The matter regarding
Monte Alban	ORGANIZATION	, though admittedly fragmentary , is probably greater than has before been printed by any student .

		This mighty mass of constructions is one of the most significant in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Within easy walking dis - tance of one of the largest cities of the
Republic Oaxaca	LOCATION	where several diligent collectors live and where an important scientific institute is located , it is yet surprisingly little known .

		From Dupaix to Bandolier it was practically neglected .

		Mr.
Ban	PERSON	- delier made a hasty sketch-map and some notes ; later Professor
Starr	PERSON	added a few items .

		Mr.
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 193 A pot-pourri from
Profettor Max Miller	ORGANIZATION	.

		Holmes gives the best ground-plan so far presented , with a striking panorama .

		Much remains to be done at this interesting site .

		The latter part of Professor
Holmes	PERSON	's work describes a number of fine specimens recently secured by the
Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	from the Mexican area .

		The Museum is to be congratulated upon so creditable a beginning in anthropological publication ; and commiserated upon losing at this time the services of Professor
Holmes	PERSON	, who has been a most competent official .

		It is related of
Neander	LOCATION	, the
Church	ORGANIZATION	historian , that , being ordered to
Carls	PERSON	- bad for rest under his physician 's express injunction to take no books with him , he pleaded so earnestly for some mitigation of his sen - tence that he was at last grudgingly allowed one work wherewith to soothe the tedium of exile .

		The Professor accordingly selected the Fathers , a cart - load of whom were found at his door by the dis - mayed doctor the next morning .

		In a case gener - ally similar to the foregoing one , Professor
Max Muller	PERSON	seems to have recently had some notion of carrying the '' Rig Veda '' with him to a dull water - ing-place to which he had been banished , by way of arming himself with a little congenial light reading against the ennui of enforced idleness .

		Other coun - sels prevailed , however , and in lieu of books he con - tented himself with a plentiful supply of pens , ink , and paper .

		The outcome of this expedient is a pleasant little volume of memories of ''
Auld Lang Syne	PERSON	'' a `` small portion , '' as the author says , `` of the panorama of life which has passed before his eyes . ''

		The text is divided into '' Musical Recollec - tions , '' `` Literary Recollections , '' '' Recollections of Royalties , '' etc. , and the narrative begins with a retrospect of the writer 's childhood in that nest of musicians ,
Dessau	LOCATION	, wheref rom we learn , by-the-bye , that the distinguished philologist was himself then regarded as an '' infant prodigy '' in the musical way , and that in this character he used to be hoisted upon a table to warble
Handel	PERSON	's ''
Schnell	PERSON	wie des
Blitzes Strahl	PERSON	, '' and other trying arias .

		Among Professor
Muller	PERSON	' s musicians are
Hiller	PERSON	, Mme.
Sonn	PERSON	- tag ,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	,
Weber	PERSON	,
Jenny Lind	PERSON	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	,
Schu	PERSON	- mann , and others .

		His list of literati is a long one , comprising such names as
Heine	LOCATION	,
Rtickert	LOCATION	,
Tenny	PERSON	- son ,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Froude	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	LOCATION	,
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Hux	PERSON	- ley ,
Faraday	LOCATION	, etc. .

		With royalty , Professor
Muller	PERSON	has come in frequent and agreeable contact , and he managed to survive the ordeal even of a meeting with the
Consecrated Person of Germany	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		One of his most cherished memories is that he once won a sixpence from the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	at whist .

		Professor
Muller	PERSON	assures us that on this occasion , a disputed point of play arising , `` I held my own , and actually appealed to General Bruce ! ''

		This was true courage .

		The Professor has the sixpence yet .

		We may say in passing that we forgot to include
Thackeray	PERSON	in the list of the author 's literary peo - ple .

		Of Heine the Professor had but a fleeting glimpse .

		It was at
Paris	LOCATION	in
1846	DATE	, and the poet was then nearing his final state of hopeless physical collapse .

		Says the writer : '' One afternoon as I and my friend were sitting on the
Boulevard	LOCATION	, sip - ping a cup of coffee , ` Look here , ' he said , ` there comes Heine ! '

		I jumped up to see , my friend stopped him , and told him who I was .

		It was a sad sight He was bent down , and dragged him - self slowly along , his spare greyish hair was hang - ing round his emaciated face , there was no light in his eyes .

		He lifted one of his paralyzed eyelids with his hand and looked at me .

		For a time , like the blue sky breaking from behind grey
October	DATE	clouds , there passed a friendly expression across his face , as if he thought of days long gone by .

		Then he moved on , mumbling a line from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, in a deep , broken , and yet clear voice , as if appealing for sympathy : ` Das Maulthier sucht im
Nebel	PERSON	seinen
Weg	PERSON	' '' A moving picture !

		Professor Mul - ler 's book -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is an entertaining pot-pourri compounded of pen-pictures of eminent people and the club-corner chat of a man of the world and of letters .

		The frontispiece portrait of the author is well-made but why should this venerable
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	professor have thought fit to pose before the cam - era in a gala costume that seems about midway be - tween a full-dress naval uniform and the toggery of a marshal of an Orange parade ?

		The '' Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is supposed to present studies of men and of national con - ditions , written in a style both scholarly and popular .

		The latest addition , `` The Cid , '' by Mr.
H. Butler Clarke	PERSON	, is without doubt a scholarly work , but it will be read with difficulty by persons not familiar with the period of Spanish history under consideration .

		The stories of battles , single combats , guerrilla expe - ditions , and trials by battle , in which the Cid or his companions engaged , while told in a way that leaves no doubt of the writer 's familiarity with his author - ities , do not form any connected whole , and become wearisome by the repetition of the details of petty fights .

		The Cid , a soldier of fortune , while prefer - ring to use his abilities in the employ of his native prince , served all masters as opportunity offered , and was equally at home in the camp of the Spaniard or the Saracen .

		The best portion of the book is that relating to the service rendered by the Cid to
Mohammedan	PERSON	rulers , and is a clear statement of conditions existing in the various
Saracen King	PERSON	- doms , and of the relations between a ruling
Moham	PERSON	- medan and a subject Christian population .

		Under the title '' The Sacrifice of a Throne '' -LRB-
Bonnell , Silver & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
H. Remsen Waterhouse	PERSON	has written a book which purports to narrate the events leading to the brief occupancy of the Spanish throne by Amadeus , second son of
Victor Emanuel I.	PERSON	, King of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Events there are in plenty , accurately stated in painstaking detail , yet leaving the reader A hen of Old
Spain	LOCATION	.

		An abdicated Spanish King 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, quite in the dark as to the author 's opinion of their relative importance .

		No interpretation of them is given , nor is there any statement of the conditions in
Spain	LOCATION	which caused the fall of the Bourbons and made impossible the success of Amadeus 's govern - ment .

		In one chapter only is there any approach to a true historical method ; and even here the chief value is to be found in the translation of documents , and of speeches by the
King	ORGANIZATION	and members of the Cortes , in reference to the abdication .

		The author worships his hero , and endows him with all the virtues , physical courage in particular ; but fails to show him possessed of either statesmanlike qualities or governing ability .

		As an historical monograph on an interesting epoch of Spanish history , or as a character study , the book does not meet the require - ments of the case .

		Yet for those who are interested in a prince per se , and care to read petty personal characteristics , the author , in somewhat pompons style and with a lack of connectiveness which is often exasperating , has furnished some interesting matter .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The '' comic history '' is a dreary sort of fooling at its best , and we can not give a very cordial welcome to the latest example of that species of humor .

		Mr.
Charles M. Snyder	PERSON	is the author , and his book is a '' Comic History of
Greece	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The sort of thing he gives us to the amount of four or five hundred pages may be illustrated by a specimen taken at ran - dom : '' The soil of
Greece	LOCATION	was principally the result of contact with the Persians , who soiled everything on which they laid hands .

		Very little could be raised upon it except levies and a particularly violent species of
Cain	PERSON	. ''

		Of such cheap journalistic wit is this volume all compact , and the illustrations are as cheap and vul - gar as the text .

		Mr.
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	, with a certain amount of specialist collaboration , has produced in '' Garden-Making '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- a complete vade mecum for the amateur who is fortunate enough to have a cultivable plot of ground about his house .

		The little book is simply packed with information about the treatment of flowers and orna - mental shrubs , of fruits and vegetables , all extremely practical in its form of statement , yet having an eye constantly fixed upon the aesthetic side of the subject .

		A more useful book of its sort we have never seen , or one more indispensable to the amateur gardener .

		The same writer 's '' First Lessons with Plants '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an equally admirable work , being addressed to teach - ers of very young people , and designed as a help in what it is the fashion of the day to call '' nature study '' in the elementary schools . ''

		The Miniature
Oxford Horace	PERSON	, '' just published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, includes the complete works of the poet , edited by the
Dean of Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	, in one small vol - ume of pocketable size .

		There is not a word of En - glish anywhere in or about the book .

		Annotation is reduced to a minimum , being confined to an occasional variant reading , but the text is printed upon writing paper with margins wide enough to permit the owner to make his own notes .

		ANNOUNCEMENTS or SPRING BOOKS .

		THE DIAL presents herewith its annual list of books announced for
Spring	DATE	publication , and believes it will be found as comprehensive and full of interest to book - buyers as any yet published in these columns .

		It con - tains over 600 titles , 100 more than last year 's list , and represents 68 publishers .

		It is intended that no book published prior to
March 1	DATE	be included in this list , and all the books here given are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

		A list of announcements of the English publishers is given in the English correspond - ence -LRB- page 175 -RRB- .

Ernest D. North	PERSON	, was one of the most in - teresting things to be seen in
Chicago	LOCATION	during
the first week of March	DATE	.

		Among the books displayed were a Chaucer of
1598	DATE	, formerly owned by
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, the '' Poems by Two
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' first editions of many En - glish classics , and examples of the
Kelmscott	LOCATION	and Gro - lier Club publications .

		The bindings offered a selec - tion from the best French and English artists , with a sprinkling of Americans .

		The long-pending '' Loud bill , '' for the correction of alleged abuses in the transmission of periodicals and other second-class matter through the mails , has been beaten by a very decided majority in the
House of Repre	ORGANIZATION	- sentatives .

		This defeat will prove a real good if it shall lead to the step that ought to have been taken long
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 ago the creation by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of a commission to over - haul the whole mass of our postal laws and rulings , and report a bill which shall cover the subject completely , and not partially , as did the Loud bill .

		Abuses , injus - tices , and needless inconsistency and confusion , exist in our postal service ; but the evils are of too long stand - ing , and too intricate , to be treated by the ` prentice hand of any Congressman , however zealous and well - meaning .

		They must be handled by experts , and the best experts obtainable .

		The dean of English poets died with
Frederick Ten	PERSON	- nyson on the twenty-seventh of
last month	DATE	.

		Born in
1807	DATE	, two years before the most famous of his brothers , he had lived to the ripe age of ninety years , and done good service to English letters .

		His poems have never been appreciated at their full value , for the affections of the reading public seein to have had room for but one poet of the name , and the considerable achieve - ments of
Frederick Tennyson	PERSON	suffered partial eclipse his whole life long .

		From the famous '' Poems by
Two Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' which his own contributions really made `` Poems by
Three Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' to the publication of `` Poems of the Day and Year '' in
1895	DATE	, he put forth at intervals collections of verse distinguished for their grace , melody , and classical mould .

		Perhaps the best known of his work is contained in the '' Day and Hours '' of
1854	DATE	, the `` Isles of
Greece	LOCATION	'' of
1890	DATE	, and the ''
Daphne	PERSON	and Other Poems '' of
1891	DATE	.

		Unlike the late
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, he lived many years away from En - gland with his Italian wife in
Florence	LOCATION	and
Pisa	LOCATION	, and for a long time in the
Island of Jersey	LOCATION	, although he made frequent visits to his native country .

		The
Caxton Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has hit upon a happy selection for the latest of its Publications , '' Some Let - ters of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	to
E. H. N. Patterson	PERSON	, of
Oquawka	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, with Comments by
Eugene Field	PERSON	. ''

		The
Poe	PERSON	letters are four in number ; the first is dated
April 1849	DATE	, and the
last August 7	DATE	of the same year just two months before
Poe	PERSON	's death .

		They have not before -LRB- says a foot-note -RRB- been printed in book form ; they are highly interesting and characteristic , and relate to a singular literary project that of establishing a pretentious national magazine at
Oquawka	LOCATION	, to be edited by
Poe	PERSON	and published by Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	, an enterprising and educated young man living in that remote Missis - sippi river town .

		The project seems so grotesque , though treated in the letters with such apparent serious - ness , that we might almost think the whole thing one of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	's literary pranks .

		But the letters from
Poe	PERSON	seem real enough , and they are given in a marvel - lously executed facsimile which is one of the most nota - ble features of the book .

		There is a facsimile , also , of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's drawing for the title-page of his projected maga - zine , '' The Stylus . ''

		The volume is a thin quarto , beau - tifully printed , and is highly creditable to the
Caxton Club	ORGANIZATION	and to its printers ,
Messrs. R. R. Donnelley & Sons	ORGANIZATION	.

		With so much to praise , we '' may be allowed two criticisms .

		The first is on a typographical detail the arrangement of the title-page with an unsightly division of
Poe	PERSON	's name , ''
Edgar Allan	PERSON	'' appearing in one line and '' Poe '' in another : a whimsy of typography which seems particularly out of place in a work of such severe and classic elegance .

		The other matter is more serious the statement in a foot-note that
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	'' played a trick '' on
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1887	DATE	.

		The note , it is presumed , is Field 's ; but the club might well have suppressed a note so mistaken in fact and so little cred - itable to the writer of it .

		IN THIS OUR WORLD .

		By
CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON	ORGANIZATION	.

		With a Photogravure Portrait .

		16mo , cloth , ornamental ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Mrs.
Stetson	PERSON	's verse , which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has called the best civic satire since the ''
Biglow Papers	PERSON	, '' is known to the public only through the paper-covered editions which have appeared on the
Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		This new volume , revised and greatly enlarged , may be expected to bring her work , for the first time , into general notice .

		Certainly the vigor , the verve , the deep moral earnestness , the delightful humor and extraordinary talent for satire displayed in these poems have hardly been surpassed .

		WOMEN AND ECONOMICS .

		By
CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON	ORGANIZATION	.

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In writing this book it has been Mrs.
Stetson	PERSON	's purpose to point out , explain , and justify the changes which are now going on in the relations of women to society .

		In brief , the position taken is that women have for centuries been eco - nomically dependent upon men ; that as a result they have become more and more feminine and less and less normal mem - bers of the human race .

		The argument is extended to every branch of social activity with remarkable originality , and in a manner to stimulate the interest of every one .

		It may safely be said that hardly any book of recent years has treated a confused subject with so much real intelligence and in an attitude so singularly fair and high-minded .

Hovey	PERSON	's THE QUEST OF MERLIN .

		Of the new '' Leaves of Grass '' the

		Edited , with an introduction , by
Oscar Lovell Triggs	PERSON	, Ph.D. , of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		With a frontis - piece portrait .

		Crown 8vo , cloth ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		An adequate selection of
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's writings has long been called for , and it is here furnished .

		Dr.
Triggs	PERSON	has suc - cessfully attempted to make a book which should be representative of the many-sidedness of Whitman 's genius , and at the same time attractive to the general reader .

		Both as a book of selections , pure and simple , and as an introduction to the study of Whitman , it should meet with a welcome from all those interested in the growing fame of the Poet of Democracy .

		THE WOUND DRESSER .

		A series of letters written from the hospitals in
Washington	LOCATION	during the War of the Rebellion by
WALT WHITMAN	ORGANIZATION	.

		Edited by
Richard Maurice Bucke	PERSON	, M.D. With two Portraits .

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Without doubt the most intimate and vivid account of the hospital life of the Civil War ever put in print .

		According to the Chap-Book , the letters are '' * human documents , ' without which and the like of which the world were poor indeed . ''

		They form , says the
Brooklyn Eagle	ORGANIZATION	, `` a tale that is unique in character and without precedent in literature '' ; while the Literary World speaks of '' their profound sympathy with the suffering and dying , their minuteness of detail , so that by their light yon see the cot and the operating-table , and the sunken cheek and the glazing eye , their reproduction of the very colors of the tragic movement of which
Washington	LOCATION	was the centre from
1861	DATE	to
1865	DATE	. ''

		FIFTH THOUSAND OF FREE TO SERVE .

		A Tale of Colonial
New York	LOCATION	.

		By
E. RAYNER	PERSON	.

		Price ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.


CLINTON ROSS	PERSON	says in The Chap Book : `` The proof of a long book is in the reading of it ... The author , an artist , never once ob - trudes her personality .

		The life of the actors is cleverly real , but the high distinction of ' Free to Serve ' is its realization of humanity .

		It 's a notable book so much better than
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	' that if the publishers ' claim for that book be true this novel is greater it is certainly one of the American novels of the year .

		And Dutch America has no better presentation than
E. Rayner	PERSON	's in ' Free to Serve . ' ''

		THE
BOSTON	LOCATION	TRANSCRIPT says : '' The book is not the work of a novice ; it is fascinating , strong , and of the highest moral tone ... The characters are finely delineated , the varied and rapidly shifting scenes are pictured with the skill of an artist , and the pure moral tone is car - ried through the whole like a golden thread .

		We advise all to read the book . ''

		THE
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	CALL says : '' It does for the life and fashions of old
New York	LOCATION	what
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's '
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	' did for
Philadelphia	LOCATION	... There is plenty of action in the transition from chapter to chapter , some strongly drawn character-etching , and an intense vein of human interest .

		Few will pick up the tale without feeling the charm of its style and the subtle fascination of its subject matter . ''

		Price ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		In this book Mr.
Flandrau	PERSON	has departed widely from the usual college story .

		He has , in a series of short , vivid sketches , drawn the modern '' Harvard Man '' as he if , not as he hat been , or as he ought to be , but truthfully as he is .

		The book does not , naturally , detail all sides of the present complex Harvard life , but for the side which it does treat , the typical , prosperous , happy side , it does the best thing tells the truth , and tells it in a most delightful fashion .

		We feel sure that so accurate a picture of modern college life has not yet been drawn , and that all col - lege men will appreciate this and heartily welcome the book .

		BRIEFER MENTION 235 LITERARY NOTES 235 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 236 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 236 THE PROBLEM OF THE ADEQUATE .

		Our attention was called not long ago to a programme outlined for an afternoon session of a woman 's club in a certain Western city .

		It was evident that this organization was inspired with a praiseworthy ambition to assim - ilate the whole of culture within as brief a period as possible , and to demonstrate that art , in spite of the ancient dictum , was not so very long after all . ''

		A Resume of
Greece	LOCATION	'' was to be the general subject of the afternoon 's en - tertainment , and the special subjects of Greek politics , literature , philosophy , and art were to be considered in essays extensive enough , pre - sumably , to occupy ten or fifteen minutes each in the reading .

		Two songs and a recitation were to relieve the strain of a too protracted concentra - tion of thought upon themes so serious , and the audience was to depart in edified mood , cheer - fully prepared to make similar resumes of
Rome	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	in the near future .

		Such attempts to compass culture without any real effort are being made all over this country by thousands of literary clubs , and Chautauqua circles , and other organizations of earnest people banded together for purposes of self-improvement .

		The illustration of this sort of intellectual stir which we have given above is doubtless an extreme one , but it serves us all the better for that , since it brings into a clearer light the typical features of a tendency which is well advised in its aims , if hardly in its methods , and which , if but wisely directed , might do much for the advancement of our intellectual life .

		It is well to acquire a little knowledge of even the largest subject , if only the acquisition be made in a properly humble spirit , and without self-delusion .

		One 's own horizon must not be taken for the boundary of thought , but rather as a narrow circumscription marked out from the infinite , to be widened with every addition to one 's own intellectual elevation .

		A little learning is not a dangerous thing unless it create a mood of smug self-sufficiency , thereby deadening the life that it ought rather to stim - ulate to a larger growth .

		The varied extensions of intellectual activity so characteristic of our age have made short cuts to knowledge an absolute necessity even for scholars of the most serious purpose .

		No earlier period can show anything comparable to the present-day production of manuals , and compendiums , and condensed surveys , and ele - mentary monographs in series .

		These books , which both in numbers and in quality outdo everything of the sort produced in earlier peri - ods , are the outcome of a genuine need , and offer the older ideal of culture its only possible defence against the swelling flood of specializa - tion .

		The day has long passed when a man could hope to take all knowledge for his prov - ince , and the scholars of towering intellectual stature who , from
Bacon	LOCATION	to
Humboldt	LOCATION	, domin - ated the thought of their respective epochs , 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, belong to a hopelessly vanished race .

		Mr.
Her	PERSON	- bert
Spencer	PERSON	probably comes as near as anyone now living to that old-time ideal , but the weak places in his intellectual armor are made evi - dent enough when tested by the searching schol - arship of the modern specialized type .

		Yet men are loth to give up altogether the wide prospect of an earlier time , and our books of condensed science make it possible for a scholar of to-day to learn all that a Humboldt could have known , and more , with a far greater econ - omy of effort in the acquisition .

		We have , then , no quarrel with the book which deals upon a small scale with a great subject , provided its writer have the authority and the literary art needful for the perform - ance of his task .

		Professor
Freeman	PERSON	used to say that the only way to write a small book was to write a big one first and then condense it : a procedure which he applied with great success to the history of the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's small manual of English literature will occur to many minds as an ad - mirable example of the proper treatment of a great theme within narrow limits .

		The litera - ture of the essay affords excellent illustrations of the same sort of achievement .

		There are essays by such men as
Walter Pater	PERSON	, Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, and Mr.
Frederick Myers	PERSON	, which are entirely adequate to their subjects , and produce the impression of exhaustive treatment although the number of their pages is small .

		This does not mean that they say all that there is to say , but rather that , given their limits , they say the most important things in the most felicitous way possible .

		To introduce a metaphor , we may remark that a narrow stream will suffice to carry a great volume of water to the sea if only the channel be well embanked , and the current restrained from spreading aimlessly abroad .

		The thesis may indeed be maintained that it is theoretically possible to treat fittingly of any subject within any limits , however contracted , provided one has a proper sense of the perspec - tive of ideas , and does not bring into a brief discussion such matters of detail as would be out of place in anything less than a whole his - tory .

		This ' is not a plea for the ingenuous amateur who attempts to write about '' Nature '' or `` History '' or `` The Aim of Life '' in a thousand words , or the innocent college grad - uate who , during the few minutes allotted to the delivery of his commencement part , dis - courses upon the destinies of nations or the enlightening mission of genius .

		But it does justify the master of a subject in the work of selection and arrangement whereby the ripest fruits of his enormous intellectual toil are brought within the compass of an essay or a book of pocketable dimensions .

		When the really great writers devote only a few pages or even words to the consideration of some vast theme we do not complain that their treatment is inadequate , but accept thankfully their gifts .

		In fact , the most hopelessly inadequate books are apt to be the big ones , the so-called monu - ments of scholarship and literary industry , thus styled , perhaps , because their weight has crushed all the life out of their subjects .

		But an
Emerson	PERSON	can write adequately of `` History '' or '' Art '' or '' Civilization '' within the space of a single brief paper , and we do not feel that the discussion is defective .

		A
Lowell	PERSON	may ask '' Will it do to say anything more about Shake - speare ? ''

		and prove that it will do , for a
Lowell	LOCATION	, to discuss '' Shakespeare Once More , '' even with the limitations of the essayist upon him .

		Or , to take a still greater exemplar , did not Shakespeare himself , upon hundreds of occa - sions , give entirely adequate expression to vast ranges of thought in as many pithy and preg - nant and divine flashes of his all - comprehending intellect ?

		Is there not a whole philosophy of love in the lines , '' Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising , Haply I think on thee , and then my state , Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth , sings hymns at heaven 's gate , '' a whole philosophy of life in the words , '' Men must endure Their going hence even as their coming hither ; Ripeness is all '' ?

		SAITH THE STAR . ''

		Heart that craves another heart , Weary of this life apart From all kindred , '' saith the star ; '' Be thyself thine own best place , Learn of me , ensphered in space , Solitary and afar . ''

		In my loneness I am free To explore infinity , All the calm and silent night .

		Heart aflame with wild desire , Look to me , quench fire with fire , Plunge within my liquid light . ''

		Had I sought some alien sphere , Loth to shine sequestered here , '' Saith the star reproachfully ; '' I had left , like stars of old , To one fleeting track of gold All my crystal purity . ''

		WALTER
FRANCIS K ENRICH	PERSON	,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 217 IN REGARD TO POETRY .

		The critic who to-day lifts up his voice for poetry is a good deal like
Roland	PERSON	sounding his trumpet to call
Charlemagne	PERSON	back to Roncesvaus .

		Charle - magne may come he will come , but he is like to find the critical Roland dead npon the battle - field .

		The Muses are certainly temporarily in exile ; and the poets those votaries who by their intro - duction got admittance into the company of the gods , and so knew the secrets of things which they communicated to uninspired mortals , '' mingling incorruptible rivers of fire '' with the blood of men , these Vates , Seers ,
Makers	ORGANIZATION	, are out of employment , glad of any odd job .

		They even write criticism .

		At the best , they cut up the old forms of art , as Medea dismembered her father , and plunge them into the cauldron of the Novel some day , it is to be hoped , to emerge fresh and vigorous and in their early bloom .

		I make no count of lyric poetry in my diagnosis or prognosis .

		This has always been most plentiful in the most barren periods of literature .

		It is the brush - wood that springs up when the giant pines are felled .

		The ages of the Anthologists , the Troubadours , the Minnesingers , the Meistersingers , the ballad - writers of
Spain	LOCATION	, were ages when the poetic energies of the races were either spent or were gathering for a concentrated effort .

		We have been , of Lite , pass - ing through a period of lyrical activity ; yet there are not wanting signs to show that it is nearly ended .

		The little leaves of song do not flutter so plentifully from the autumnal boughs of the maga - zines , and nothing is more certain than the indiffer - ence of the public to collections of them herba - riums of pressed emotions .

		It is yet possible that the great goddess Design may rear her head again and revive the works of men .

		Modern thought is unquestionably hostile to great poetry .

		In religion , it has withdrawn men from ideas of the Creator to rest in the creation ; in phil - osophy , it has descended from the whole to the parts ; in science , it has rejected abstract ideas for prac - tical inventions ; in sociology , it has substituted an equalized democracy for great central figures .

		All this means that the spontaneous , the particular , and the immediate have absorbed the attention of man - kind ; and the lyric is the expression of the spon - taneous , the particular , and the immediate .

		However true or necessary all this specialized business is , it is not going to permanently satisfy men 's souls .

		There is implanted in us an idea of the whole as well as of the parts .

		We experience only the imperfect and transitory ; but we know that the perfect and eternal exist .

		We bruise our shins against the real ; but the ideal beckons us on , and on we go .

		The innate ideas of goodness , splen - dor , happiness , live in us , like the Sleeping Beauty and her court behind the o'ergrown hedge , and only the kiss of Experience is needed to make them rise and ring with life .

		At bottom , literature is an intoxicant .

		It trans - forms us , takes us out of ourselves .

		Life is toler - ably dull , and it adds little to our liveliness to be told that argon is a most powerful centre of force , or that everything in nature has its ratio of vibra - tion .

		If the flying-machine is perfected , the globe - wanderer will be as bored on his tenth voyage as he is to-day .

		If we reach Mars , we will find we have not escaped our own personalities .

		Science on the whole has not made life any better , nobler , more delightful , or more amusing .

		But man is eternally interested in his own traditions , his own deeds , his own fate .

		The talk about books is the one profes - sional talk which is not '' shop , '' because it is a talk about life itself .

		How instinctively we feel that the best society the world has known has been in those circles of men of intellect whose interest was in the humanities the Mermaid group ,
Johnson	PERSON	's club , the circle about Molie * re .

		The mass of men read little enough , but they have an equivalent for liter - ature in gossip and the swapping of stories .

		Con - versation is a continual , though for the most part decent ,
Decameron	LOCATION	.

		If all this is true , it may be urged that the novel can satisfy all our intellectual needs , as , indeed , for the present it seems to do .

		There is no actual rea - son why a novel may not be a great work of art , except that the extent of the average story makes it difficult to take it all in at once .

		Our aesthetic vision is not f ocussed to survey such near-lying and prodi - giously extended masses .

		We are like Gulliver making love to the fair
Brobdignagian	PERSON	, and can only get acquainted with her nose or her hand at one time .

		Yet in spite of this defect , ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' and '' Tristram Shandy '' and
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' rank with the great poems and dramas of the world .

		The real weakness of novels is their enormous dilu - tion , the detail and commonplace by which they seek to mirror life instead of interpreting it -LRB- as if they could , even with the vision of Asmodeus and the pen of the Recording Angel , give all the facts of existence -RRB- , and the ease with which they seem to be done .

		If there were only two or three or a dozen novels , we might prize them as rare birds .

		But in their interminable multitude they are as the plague of locusts .

		I am inclined to think that the whole vast novel literature of the world will some day be as obsolete as the tomes of the
Fathers and School	ORGANIZATION	- men .

		It is not that there is not magnificent read - ing in
St. Augustine	LOCATION	or
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	, but they and the multitude of their rivals and scholars picked the bones of dogma dry ; and , similarly , our novel - ists have worn human nature , in its ordinary mani - festations , threadbare .

		Besides , all great wit is dif - ficult difficult to do , and difficult to appreciate .

		And this leads me to one advantage of verse .

		Being hard to get at of course I mean good verse by both author and reader , it achieves a concen - tration that fastens on the memory .

		Its symmetry and numeric recurrence of sound and motion help it to a permanence which the looser members of prose can hardly hope to attain .

		It is discipline against the mob .

		Besides , this verse is a device , 218 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, like the frame of a picture or the raised platform and footlights of the stage , which lifts a piece of literature above the ordinary level of life and en - velops it in an atmosphere of its own .

		I suppose everyone has felt a slight shock at the beginning of a theatrical performance ; the break with life is apparent for a few moments ; we say to ourselves , '' This is not real . ''

		But if we surrender ourselves to the impressions of the stage , the illusory scene is quickly accepted , its convention and make-believe are forgotten .

		In the same way , if we yield our - selves to the raised utterance and rhythmical accents of verse we soon forget that it is not the proper and natural language of life .

		Indeed , who shall say that it is not our proper and natural language that its ordered harmonies are not those which are most deeply impressed upon the universe ?

		As
Schiller	PERSON	puts it , '' By a wonder we must enter into wonderland '' ; and verse is a very potent key to that ideal world we are all striving , consciously or uncon - sciously , to reach and possess .

		The compact and polished marble of verse is a better material for the hand of the designer than the clay of prose .

		At least it keeps its edge and lustre longer .

		Above all , it lends itself to the ex - ception .

		That which would be unnatural in prose is entirely easy to its sonorous mouth .

		This is pain - fully felt , I think , in such set pieces of prose as De Quincey 's '' Ladies of Sorrow '' and '' Vision of Sud - den Death , '' or even in
Milton	LOCATION	's lofty rhapsodies .

		They are finely done , but one feels that they could be done better in verse .

		It would need a good deal of argument to per - suade people to-day that the great , the rare , the exceptional , are , after all , the best subjects for lit - erature .

		The opposite opinion , which began to take root about the middle of the
last century	DATE	, has got so firm a hold that it will take an earthquake to dislodge it .

		Diderot and
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	described or sang the lowly lives and humble hopes of the poor .

		The whole art of Millet and his group is based upon the almost brute struggle for existence .

		More yet !

		man is discov - ered to be not only a brother of dragons but a cousin-german to the rocks and clouds .

		In all pre - vious ages he looked aloft , he walked with the gods , he made images of and adored the shining ones of the earth .

		In the
last century	DATE	and a half he has reversed his gaze .

		He looks down and finds him - self kin to the animals and the earth itself .

		He vitalizes the phenomena of nature , not by means of human personifications as among the ancients , but in their own proper exhibitions .

		In
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's `` Toilers of the Sea , '' the ocean is the sentient antagonist of the man ; and in
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's '' Return of the Native '' the moor is the real pro- tagonist of the piece .

		This is all very well , and if trees and rocks and oceans read books we could imagine them clapping their hands at being so cel - ebrated .

		But man alone is concerned with art , and the highest poetry vanishes when he is made a sub - sidiary agent in its domain .

		The mood that makes him such is a passing one .

		Simplicity and humility furnish too narrow a room for his aspiring spirit to flourish in .

		His natural inclination is to '' rise and help Hyperion to his horse , '' rather than to trail after the hoe of the potato gatherer .

		Corot is a mightier master than
Millet	PERSON	.

		Splendor and domin - ion and profundity are not in widest commonalty spread , and these are the things that man most ad - mires and by which he is most moved .

		We may thrill at the sight of a pump on the stage , or the representation of a plain farmer 's home , but these things are not going to displace Orestes and Mac - beth .

		Even in the work of the
last century	DATE	, as the foot-hills withdraw and the peaks emerge , we can see that they are haunted as of old by the Spirit and the forming Word .

		The '' Intimations , '' the '' An - cient Mariner , '' '' Hyperion , '' the '' Ode to the Gen - estra , '' De Mussel 's '' Nights , '' '' In Memoriam , '' `` Tristan and Isolde , '' these works have little to do with the low levels of life .

		But while the de - mand for simplicity and commonplace lasts , it is destructive to poetry .

		If the plain people get it thoroughly established in their heads that they are as good subjects for literature as kings and heroes and poets , that pumpkin-pies and pitchforks and blue-jean blouses are just as important as wit and philosophy and divine exaltation , there will be no venturing verse or great designs until a new gener - ation appears upon the scene .

		There is a fair average of the stock '' stuff , '' and when one has said that , one has said all that may be said .

		The much-heralded and much-advertised novels have almost all made their ap - pearance Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's ''
Simon Dale	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's `` The Incidental Bishop , '' Mr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's '' The Tragedy of the Korosko , '' Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	's `` Shrewsbury , '' Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	's `` The Vintage , '' and the rest ; and they all betray the debili - tating effects of assurance , born of an unrestrained self - consciousness of popularity .

		They constitute , in effect , work done to represent royalties .

		One wonders what becomes of all the novels manufactured , and one wonders still more what will be thought of them ten or twenty years hence .

		At present the '' libraries '' stock their shelves with them , and a sober population , which pays the annual guineas as subscriptions , read them .

		Then a few days or weeks elapse , the demand slackens , and
Mudie	PERSON	or
Smith	ORGANIZATION	enters them in their '' selling off '' lists at half price , or less .

		And so the seasons come and go .

		But where will they be after several seasons ?

		One shrugs one 's shoulders , and asks one 's self Where ?

		THE DIAL , 219 There is a pessimistic wail heard lately , from one or two of our magazines and weekly journals , intended to elicit our sympathy on behalf of the novelist who has , to use the meaning expression , '' written himself out . ''

		A writer in this week 's '' Speaker , '' commenting upon an article in the '' National Review , '' speaks of this con - dition , so terribly pictured by Mr.
George Gissing	PERSON	in '' New Grub Street , '' as a condition which is '' beyond the pale of common humanity . '' ''

		To be without money , food , or a decent coat , is an affliction intelligible to all ; but a literary man in want of ideas can not be taken seriously even by the most tender-hearted . ''

		Well , with all pity for such a literary man , is it not , after all , a happy play of the fates that a novelist can not go on for - ever ?

		How could we ever hope to cope with the enor - mous output , if things were otherwise ?

		Surely , we should require to begin to read with the insucking of our mother 's milk !

		And , in all seriousness , the child of to-day is precocious enough .

		The trouble , perhaps , is not in the writer 's losing his ideas , but in his over - anxiety to make money as quickly as he can , giving no regard for the art he is expressing , and no thought for the dignity of his work .

		It is the inevitable consequence of a literature which is in the hands of a `` profession . ''

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	also , on a kindred matter , delivers himself , in '' The Author , '' of a belief in the decay of authority in literary criticism . ''

		It is , '' he says , '' im - possible perfectly impossible by any conceivable rate of pay , to get a reviewer to read a book which he has to discuss in a dozen or twenty lines .

		The result is often a weak stream of generalities , with a word of fault - finding , a thing quite easy for any book ever written , whether it be read or not and only vague words of praise , because praise if it is sincere must be based on actual reading . ''

		And yet how much praise there is to be found in our critiques !

		Even if Sir
Walter	PERSON	be right , and there is not a little to prove him in the wrong , on whom is the blame for this decay ?

		Is it not to be found in the large number of books written and pub - lished ?

		If the founder of the Author 's Society be really anxious for the preservation of authority in criticism , would he not convince us of his sincerity , to some pur - pose , were he to preach to his fellow-members the wis - dom of writing less and writing better , and not from the text of the '' literary profession '' ?

		Let a truly fine piece of literary work come up for valuation , and , ten chances to one , it will not miss appreciation .

		There never was a better time for the aspirant to literary fame , and he has never had more opportunities , than he has now .

		Otherwise , one can not explain the evil of the age the success of mediocrity .

		And Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	knows this .

		To turn from discussion , which , be it never so charm - ing , is yet of less importance than facts , I have to inform you that there are still a few items which have escaped the '' Notes '' editor of '' Literature . ''

		One is , that Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	is busy preparing a handsome library edition of the novels of
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		For the present , this edition will consist of ten large crown octavo vol - umes , printed in the same type and on similar paper as were lavished on the ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' edition of
Steven	PERSON	- son 's works .

		Each novel will occupy two volumes ; and there are but five volumes '' out of copyright . ''

		The other two , which are owned by Messrs.
Bentley	PERSON	, must wait Mrs.
W. K. Clifford	PERSON	has nearly finished a long novel to be published by our newest publishing house ,
Messrs. Gerald Duckworth & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in the
summer	DATE	.

		The story which Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	has had in type for so many years , and about which Mr.
Coulson Kernahan	PERSON	has been writing lately , is at last to be issued to the public .

		I can not say when , but it may be ex - pected in the autumn .

		The new edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	's works , which
Messrs. Smith , Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have had in preparation for many months past , is to make its appear - ance shortly with '' Vanity Fair , '' in one volume , with illustrations , and with an introduction by Mrs.
Anne Thackeray Ritchie	PERSON	``
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	'' has finished another novel , to be issued serially in ''
Harper	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine . ''

		It is said to be an historical romance founded on the story of '' Locrine and
Gwendoline	PERSON	. ''

		Seven trans - lations and sublimations of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	are going about begging , from publisher to publisher Mr.
Jer	PERSON	- ome
K. Jerome	PERSON	is passing through the press a volume of essays after the style of his `` Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow . ''

		We are hoping that the years of industry through which he has passed since the publication of that book will not have touched the '' new humorist '' to grosser influ - ences .

		M.
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	's last story , '' The Hope of the Family , '' is to be published in its English translation by Messrs.
C. A. Pearson	PERSON	.

		An author , unknown to fame , is writing a pamphlet with the following title : '' A Proposal Humbly offered to the Ch-nc-11-r of the Exch-q-r , For the better regulation of the Publication of Books , and for bringing within modest bounds the pride and vanity of authors , as well as the arrogance of publishers . ''

		He has taken his text from Horace : '' Insani sanas nomen ferat , sequas iniqui , Ultra quam satis est , virtutem si petat ipsam . ''

		I can not tell you whether the tract will ever be pub - lished or not A new publishing house is to startle the world , in the autumn ; it has been feeling its way , lately , with a magazine called '' The Dome . ''

		But '' The Uni - corn Press '' is coming on , all the same .

		The '' New Vagabonds Club '' is not dead yet ; out of nearly three hundred members who forgot to pay their subscriptions , more than half sent their postal orders , and the
Club	ORGANIZATION	is now flourishing .

		The rumor to the contrary was circu - lated by some evil-minded member , and an influential committee is now '' sitting on '' him .

		Fifteen hundred and forty-nine lady novelists have ready for the press three thousand and ninety-eight long stories .

		A well - known financier is busy establishing a syndicate for their publication , in the late autumn .

		Should the libraries refuse to subscribe , it is within the powers of the syndi - cate , as laid down in the articles of association , to open one thousand shops , in
London	LOCATION	and the provinces , for the sale of these novels .

		Our art critics are busy buy - ing new steel pens , to be ready for use when the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	opens its exhibition this
spring	DATE	.

		They have been busy with other matters lately , and only found time to abuse old masters Since the publication of '' Liter - ature '' there has been issued but one other periodical devoted to books , the '' Journal '' of the
Bootle Free Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		If yon can not find
Bootle	PERSON	on the map , I can only say your map is out of date .

		For your bet - ter guidance , I may tell you that it now has a Town
Hall	PERSON	of its own , and the mayor is not borrowed from
Liverpool	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Stanley Lane-Poole	PERSON	has written an introduction to the new copyright edition of Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	's '' Pilgrimage to Meccah , '' to be published by Messrs.
George Bell & Sons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	is too busy anent the new university for
London	LOCATION	; but he will not fail to have a new novel ready later in the year .

		Mr.
Copinger	PERSON	, the late President of the English Biblio - graphical Society , has just issued the second volume of his supplement to
Hain	PERSON	's '' Repertorium . ''

		It is not stated that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	will present him with an 220 THE DIAL -LSB-

Copinger	PERSON	is that bibliographer .

		The
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	is still busy publishing books that every - one wants and nobody buys .

		The
Cambridge Press	ORGANIZATION	is busy doing likewise , except that it has issued , in thirteen mighty quarto volumes , the papers of the late Dr.
Cayley	PERSON	, a work , of course , which nobody could buy , try as he would .

		We have had a little talk about The Ballad of Reading Gaol , '' by '' C. 33 , '' and it is likely to lead to some sort of prison reform .

		A great many of us think it good poetry ; a great many others say it is not art ; the rest have not read it 1 hear strange rumors about the poet laureate being engaged on an ode on the new bacon and tea company , '' Liptons . ''

		There may be something in it ; for Mr.
T. P. O'Connor	PERSON	, in '' The Weekly Sun , '' says that '' Liptons '' is the one topic of conversation in the best drawing-rooms of the West End : and he ought to know .

		The celebration , this year , of the '98 movement in
Ireland	LOCATION	is to be a mighty fine affair , and we are to have reprints and new books galore on the subject .

		The committee of management in
Dublin	LOCATION	is busy arranging and organizing and disagreeing on the details and with each other , most delightfully ; but you can be sure of this : that the visitors here , from your side of the water , will have a good time next
May	DATE	.

		There is to be a fine and handsome collected edition of the novels of
Sheridan LeFanu	PERSON	, a writer who deserves more than he ever got .

		The publishers are to be

		Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's ad - mirable biography of Shakespeare as printed in the '' Dictionary of National Biography '' is to be reissued in separate form , as was Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's essay on
Burns	PERSON	.

		Mr.

		He has been reading the matter up very carefully lately , and he has told us all about it in

		In compliance with an Act of the
Legislature of Kansas	ORGANIZATION	, an admirable likeness in marble of Ex-Governor
Robinson	PERSON	has lately been completed and placed in the college chapel of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	at
Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	.

		In thus honoring her first governor and the hero of the forces of freedom in '' the times that tried men 's souls , ''
the State of Kansas	ORGANIZATION	has greatly honored herself .

		The struggle of the slave-masters for the spread of slavery over
Kansas	LOCATION	and the vast regions involved in the issue , was their last and desperate attempt at national su - premacy .

		It was their Armageddon , and they so under - stood it .


James Buchanan	PERSON	was President , and
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	was his Secretary of War .

		As the leader of the
Free State	ORGANIZATION	party , Governor
Robinson	PERSON	had to face the whole power of the national administration .

		He had to hold at bay the organized hordes of border ruffians from
Missouri	LOCATION	and other States .

		And the difficulties of his situation were still further aggravated by factional divisions in the
Free State	ORGANIZATION	ranks , and the menace of rash and reckless leaders whose action would have invited destruction .

		But he was equal to the emergency .

		He was the
Samuel Adams	PERSON	of the
Free State	ORGANIZATION	cause .

		He had coolness , caution , and diplomacy , joined to perfect courage and an inflexible steadfastness of purpose .

		Having the great cause at heart , and loving his country better than he loved himself , he sought to subordinate all minor considerations and compose all differences of opinion and of policy .

		He had the rarest patience and forbearance , and the wise moderation which is born of self-control .

		He held extreme measures in check , and deprecated any act of folly which might place his cause in antagonism to the Constitution and the laws .

		With - out these qualities which he so happily combined in himself , it is difficult to believe that success would have been possible ; and with them he was able to lead the way safely through the labyrinth of lawlessness and dis - order to the final triumph of liberty and peace .

		Not Kansas only , but the nation itself , should cherish his memory ; for his work paved the way for the overthrow of slavery in the
United States	LOCATION	and its abolition through - out the civilized world .

		The bust of Governor
Robinson	PERSON	is the work of Mr.
Lorado Taft	PERSON	, the
Chicago	LOCATION	sculptor , and it was fitly placed in the chapel of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Governor
Robinson	PERSON	was one of the founders of this institution .

		He was its devoted friend and liberal helper while he lived , and he bequeathed to it the bulk of his large for - tune .

		He has been aptly called '' the father of the Uni - versity , '' and I can not better conclude this brief notice than by quoting the words of one of its regents in ac - cepting the bust : '' So long as there remains on the map of the earth a spot called
Kansas	LOCATION	, and so long as there remains even the dimmest tradition that there was a long , heroic , and finally successful struggle there for freedom , and so long as there remains one stone upon another of the stately walls of this
University	ORGANIZATION	, which was the apple of his eye , so long will live the name and the fragrant memory of
Charles Robinson	PERSON	. ''

		`` THE PLIGHT OF THE BOOKSELLER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your article on '' The Plight of the Bookseller , '' in your issue of
March 16	DATE	, you say , '' The statement was recently made that one of these -LSB- department -RSB- stores ... could afford to retail an invoice of books * for the net cost of the bill and still leave a profit . ' ''

		Such a statement , if made in good faith , must have been made by one of the multitude who patronize the department stores , rather than by one familiar with their manage - ment .

		The book department conducted by these estab - lishments is run to make money , as much as any other department , and must meet its share of the expenses .

		When it is understood that an average profit of twenty - five per cent is required to cover the cost of doing bus - iness , such a statement as that quoted in your article will be seen in its absurdity .

		A good book man , in charge of a book department , with the backing of a large capital , has many advantages over the ordinary bookseller .

		The marvel is that the result is so insignificant .

		The only argument urged in behalf of the '' book department '' by the bookbuyer is the one of '' cut prices , '' which you are right in saying `` are not -LRB- with an occasional exception -RRB- cut so very much after all . ''

		Illiteracy and ignorance is the rule behind the counters , and only less frequently is it found
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 221 in front of them .

		It is not an atmosphere of learning , in spite of the tons of '' literature , '' such as you may reasonably expect to find in even the humblest second - hand bookstall .

		But it is doing its work in a rude blun - dering way .

		A love for the beautiful must have been planted in many a heart that hungered -LRB- consciously -RRB- only for a bargain , and got it in a '' classic '' degraded in its outward form as a diamond would be set in brass .

		A large proportion of American book readers are un - educated women who rarely visit bookshops and who frequent dry goods stores .

		There is no serious side to their reading ; it is simply a habit .

		They seldom have the set purpose of buying a book .

		Their wants are hosiery or gloves ; they buy books casually .

		This ac - counts for the book department in the department store and defines its success .

		It can not take the place of the book store until it changes its atmosphere , which it is not likely to do in the immediate future .

		The publisher has it in his power to protect the book - seller and the general good of the trade .

		Class distinc - tions should be abolished .

		By that I mean that ministers and teachers , who form a large percentage of the book - buying class , should not be offered special discounts and invited to purchase direct from the publisher .

		The publisher 's announcement reads , '' For sale by all book - sellers , or sent postpaid on receipt of price , '' etc. .

		I wonder how many publishers there are who `` receive the price '' by mail from a customer living in a town where there is a responsible bookseller , who send the book so ordered by mail to the bookseller , enclose to him the difference between the list price and the whole - sale price , and request that the book be delivered to the person who ordered it ?

		I never heard of a publisher who did such a thing , and yet I believe such a policy would bring great returns to the publisher and result in great benefit to the bookseller .

		First , he would feel that he was the publisher 's agent in a new sense .

		Second , it would enable him to know , and come in touch with , the local book-buying public .

		He could buy more intel - ligently , carry a larger stock with less risk , and build up his business to the point where it would be '' a civilizing agency of the highest importance to the community . ''

		Another thing that the publisher might do to protect the bookseller , and benefit the general good of the trade , is to adhere to the old distinction between '' whole - saler '' and '' retailer . ''

		The manner of disposition of the purchase should be considered rather than the quan - tity purchased .

		The large department store , with an outlet greater , perhaps , than the jobber who sells to the small bookseller , should not be able to buy as cheaply as the jobber ; neither should the small bookseller pay more for the same book than the department store which sells only at retail .

		I think it can be successfully main - tained that the distinction between wholesale and retail selling , once clearly defined , but now apparently lost sight of in the trade , is largely responsible for the pres - ent '' Plight of the Bookseller . ''

		THE BOOKSELLER AS AN EDUCATOR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The '' Book Lovers ' Friend '' is a term which has been justly applied to the bookseller , who , although he makes his daily bread from the profits on sales of good litera - ture , at the same time renders a service , not to be esti - mated by dollars and cents , in calling the attention of his customers to book treasures , new and old .

		He often stands in the place of a literary adviser , ministering with discrimination to the literary appetites of his cus - tomers .

		In this capacity the bookseller is a sort of Professor of Books ; and just so long as the really thoughtful book-purchaser is to be found , just so long will there be an opportunity for the real bookseller to obtain a certain amount of patronage and a fair com - pensation for his services .

		If the statement in the ex - cellent article on '' The Plight of the Bookseller , '' in the last issue of THE DIAL , that '' a good bookstore , stocked with serious literature , and conducted by people who know something of the books they sell , is a civilizing agency of the highest importance to every community , '' be true , it ought to come about that an institution of such economic value will be preserved by the economic forces which , optimistically speaking , work for the ad - vancement of civilization .

		Of course this view of the matter does not give definite consolation to the book - seller who is struggling with present conditions .

		Com - petition in all lines of commerce results in changed methods , and the business of bookselling can not be ex - empt from this law .

		ROMANCE IN
AMERICAN HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THIS DIAL . -RRB-

		In the interest of the romantic element in our history , will you allow me a word of protest against the rather summary fashion in which THE DIAL 'S recent review of Miss
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	's '' American Literature '' pronounces her references to the `` Pocahontas yarn ,
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	and witchcraft , and
Ethan Allen	PERSON	at
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	'' superficial and misleading . ''

		Historical scholarship '' does indeed distinguish , as Miss
Bates	PERSON	has done , between
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's first allusion to
Pocahontas	LOCATION	, given in the '' True Relation '' -LRB- 1608 -RRB- , and the account of her kind offices to the Colonists which he gave to Queen
Anne	PERSON	in
1616	DATE	.

		Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry Cabot Lodge	PERSON	, and Mr.
Alexander Bruce	PERSON	have followed Dean in regarding the tomahawk of Powhatan and his daugh - ter 's entreaties as a picturesque embellishment ; but
Smith	PERSON	has stanch defenders in Mr.
William Wirt Henry	PERSON	, Prof.
John Fiske	PERSON	, and Mr.
Edward Aber	PERSON	.

		The charge of falsehood should always be coupled with the narra - tor 's own assertion that the plea for Pocahontas might have been presented from a '' more worthy pen , '' but not from '' a more honest heart . ''

		As to
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	's share in the witchcraft delu - sion , one has but to read his own '' Memorable Provi - dences '' or '' Wonders of the Invisible World '' to con - clude with Dr.
W. F. Poole	PERSON	, who contributed the chapter on witchcraft in
Boston	LOCATION	to
Winsor	PERSON	's `` Narrative and Critical History of
America	LOCATION	, '' that Mather `` never wavered from a full belief in the reality of witchcraft and diabolical possession , '' although '' his mind was greatly perplexed as to the nature and meaning of the phenomena . ''


Ethan Allen	PERSON	's part in the taking of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	may have been exaggerated by his biographers , but for the authenticity of his famous summons to surrender , quoted by
Miss Bates	PERSON	, we have no less a witness than his own account of the expedition , printed in
1775	DATE	.

		Fortunately for those of us who believe in `` enter - taining '' text-books , historical research is not always iconoclastic , and reference to the sources of our early history may often prove that truth is even more pictur - esque than fiction .

		FRANCE : THE STUDY OF A NATION .

		* Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's ''
France	LOCATION	'' is the most import - ant and suggestive work of its class that has appeared since the publication of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's ''
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In it the author essays to do for the student of political
France	LOCATION	what Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	did for the student of political
America	LOCATION	; and of his pronounced success in the essential part of this needed undertaking there can be no question .

		He has enriched political literature with an admirable specimen of insti - tutional exposition a scholarly product of un - stinted labor and thorough execution that must command the respect even of those least inclined to sympathize with certain fundamental predi - lections of its author .

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's treatment of his subject is a mean between the contrary methods of his famous predecessors ,
Arthur Young	PERSON	and De Tocqueville , whose respective masterpieces serve to exhibit the fundamental diversity of the aptitudes and tendencies of the Anglo-Saxon and the Gallic mind .

		Of the turn for generalization , for detecting the latent strand of connecting principle between facts seemingly disparate , so eminently displayed by the philosophic Frenchman , Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's pages evince no inconsiderable share ; while they are also lit and vivified at intervals by pictures of men and manners such as form the staple of the English traveller 's immortal roving diary .

		The keen-eyed and practical '' Suffolk Squire '' might himself have written the following pass - age , for instance , illustrative of the prevailing indifference of the French nation to politics and politicians an indifference , be it said , that not infrequently borders on contempt , and finds its counterpart in most democratically governed countries of to-day . ''

		It was the home and workshop of a wood-carver , whose skill , famed through the region , had long dis - pensed him the need for manual toil , which he loved with the zeal of a craftsman of old .

		This simple pro- vincial family composed a characteristic French group , the head of it grown grey in intelligent labor ; his wife vigorous and orderly , keeping the books as well as the house ; his daughter , comely as was her mother before the War , lately married to a young cultivator of the neighborhood , also present , who had completed his mil - itary service .

		This room full of contented people con - tained the materials that promote the prosperity and real glory of
France	LOCATION	industry , thrift , family sentiment , artistic instinct , cultivation of the soil , cheerful per - formance of patriotic duty , and collaboration of women *

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in the plan of life , all impregnated with an air of the old Latin civilization , oftener manifest in humble spheres than in the class which ought longest to have preserved it .

		Wishing to learn something of the political tenden - cies of the district , I asked about the rumored retire - ment of the deputy ; but my inquiry only elicited the phrase , often and often repeated to me since then , Je ne m ` occupe pas de politique ,
Monsieur	PERSON	. '

		When the old man said this , there was no anger nor scorn in his tone , such as a reference to the Government of
France	LOCATION	called forth from the occupants of the neighboring chateau which I had left that morning .

		The members of this worthy family had no ill-will for the Republic , nor indeed for any regime which allowed them to pursue their callings tranquilly ; but politics were not to them an occupation for steady and industrious people . ''

		* Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's book is the fruit of a seven years ' sojourn in
France	LOCATION	, the whole of which period was spent in preparation .

		Though not free from occasional Gallicisms and perhaps hardly avoidable adaptations from current con - tinental political writing , the style is in general no less admirable than the matter .

		One gets , too , an impression of a certain studied elegance that recalls by contrast the almost colloquial plainness of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, who with an abund - ance of political philosophy never affects the political philosopher .

		But Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's mean - ing is always clear .

		In fact , we think it would be difficult to name a half-dozen political studies of its class and importance that can be read through so easily and continuously , we may add so pleasurably , as this one .

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	indulges pretty freely in politico - historical reflections -LRB- at times rather question - able ones , as it seems to us -RRB- , and his opening volume is largely an inquiry into the relations of modern
France	LOCATION	with the Revolution .

		The lengthy Introduction is mainly devoted to a general consideration of this topic , after which the writer proceeds to appraise and define the Revolution , and to exhibit the fate in
France	LOCATION	to-day of the ground ideas and fundamental maxims which the apostles of that movement proclaimed amid such unbounded hope and enthusiasm .

		What , for instance , is the stand - ing under the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	of the grandiose motto of the first one : '' Liberty , Equality , Fraternity '' ?

		Is the Frenchman under
M. Felix Faure	PERSON	free comparatively uninterf ered with by his government , and does he prize his freedom ?

		Is he contentedly `` as good as , '' and no better than , his neighbor ?

		Is he , in any considerable humanly attainable degree , his neighbor 's brother ?

		To this triple inquiry * The idea meant to be conveyed by the above passage was tersely expressed in the Assembly , in
1875	DATE	, by
M. Laboulaye	PERSON	: '' We present the spectacle of a tranquil people with agitated legislators . ''

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 223 Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	devotes three searching and rather ironical chapters , with the last of which Book I. closes .

		In Book II. , which concludes the open - ing volume , the author begins the more directly descriptive portion of his work , under the chapter-headings '' The Constitution , '' '' The Chief of the State . ''

		Volume II .

		is devoted to '' The Parliamentary System , '' including '' The Upper Chamber , '' '' The
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	and the Electoral System , '' '' The Composition of the Chamber of Deputies , '' '' Parliamentary Procedure and Practice , '' '' Ministers , Minis - tries , and the Parliamentary System , '' '' Cor - ruption under the Republic , '' and to '' Political Parties , '' including `` The Group System , '' '' The Royalists , '' '' The Plebiscitary Element , '' '' The Rallies , '' '' The Left Centre , '' '' The Op - portunists , '' `` The Radicals , '' `` The Socialist Group . ''

		Incidentally the author touches briefly upon a variety of topics germane to the main inquiry , such as political indifference , the de - cadence of parliament , corrupt practices , min - isterial instability , Republican morals , the army , the
Panama	LOCATION	scandals , and so on .

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's tone , we may say at once , is somewhat reactionary throughout , and indicates anything but an abiding faith in the endurance of the parliamentary system established by the Constitution of
1875	DATE	.

		It is in the union of this later system with the older Napoleonic fabric of close-knit centralization that he sees the potent cause of the pessimism of French political writers .

		Infected himself , perhaps , by this pessimism , Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	is of the discour - aging opinion that the only hope of an improved state of things for
France	LOCATION	lies in the prospect of the voice of the nation delegating its powers to an authoritative hand instead of to parlia - mentary government a prospect which , one would think , the memory of Sedan must serve to render somewhat less seductive to the French imagination .

		The proneness of Frenchmen to the saving course indicated by Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	is amply attested by history , and there is perhaps in the Celtic nature an inveterate yearning for a leader ; but we can not but think that every additional year of the life of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	adds to its chances of permanency , and lessens the likelihood that the French , captivated anew by some strong or showy personality , or yield - ing again to the spell of a name , will once more vote away their hard-won privilege of having , when they choose to exercise it , the controlling voice in the management of their own concerns .

		Indifference to politics , of which Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	makes so much , is by no means -LRB- as we know in this country -RRB- necessarily a sign of indifference to liberty and latent preference for authorita - tive rule .

		It is the sense of freedom , the knowl - edge that one can have one 's say when one chooses , that counts for most with most men ; and the outwardly apathetic citizen who does not take the trouble to cast his vote twice in a decade may nevertheless willingly face death in defence of his right to cast it , if that right be seriously threatened .

		Unless French humanity is radically different from humanity in general , each generation that grows up in
France	LOCATION	under the Republican regime is on the whole less likely than its predecessor to relapse willingly into a sheep-like submission to an autocrat even though he prove to be the bon tyran of Renan 's optimistic dreams .

		The possibility of a despotism resting on a plebiscite grows re - moter , as the French character loses by degrees the impress of the mould of centuries of arbi - trary local and central rule .

		French republi - canism may perhaps again suffer a partial eclipse ; but it is our conviction that it will emerge from the shadow undimmed as before , and that the class represented by Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's indifferent wood-carver -LRB- whose incivisme might well have cost him his head in the fiery days of
' 93	DATE	-RRB- will become in time as proof as its Amer - ican counterpart against the snares and seduc - tions of a
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	or a
Boulanger	PERSON	.

		With Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's view of the French Revo - lution we do not , in the main , find ourselves in sympathy .

		Accepting almost unqualifiedly
Taine	PERSON	's view of that movement , he quotes with implied approval these strangely uncharacter - istic words of Ren an : '' If we turn away from the grandiose fatality of the Revolution , all that is left is odious and horrible : a nameless orgie , a monstrous fray into which madmen , incapables , and miscreants rush , told by their instinct that their opportunity is come , and that victory is for the most repulsive of mankind .

		Every crime and every insanity seem to have united to produce the success of the Days of Revolution . ''

		Those who condemn the Revolution are in general given to '' turning away '' in their ap - praisals of it from all but its bloody episodes and wild sectaries , much as writers hostile to the Reformation incline to '' turn away '' from Luther and fix their eyes firmly on
John of Leyden	ORGANIZATION	and the Munster Anabaptists .

		It is to be regretted that Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	has steeped his mind in
Taine	LOCATION	, to the exclusion of such modi - fying influences as the sane and judicial Mig - net , or , better still , the clear and literal narra - tive of the latest considerable historian of the French Revolution , Professor
Morse Stephens	PERSON	.

		224 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Owing his conceptions mainly to the source indicated , Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's reflections touching the Revolution are sometimes impaired by the as - sumption that the violent and sanguinary course of the movement in its later phases was wholly or essentially due to something inherent in its nature or to the depravity or the incapacity of its leaders , whereas it was in fact largely , and we believe mainly , external danger , real or fancied , and internal dissension , that forced upon
France	LOCATION	the iron despotism and ruthless policy of the Terror .

		It is difficult to set a limit to the right of self-defence ; and when the infant Republic , charged , as its votaries firmly believed , with the highest hopes , not of
France	LOCATION	alone , but of humanity , found itself threatened by treachery and invasion without and by an - archy and treachery within , it threw to the winds its benign theories , suspended its free constitution , and turned
France	LOCATION	into an armed camp , in the midst of which it erected , as a grim monitor to all who might be tempted to swerve a hair 's breadth from the paths drawn in accordance with the new ideals , the guillo - tine .

		In fixing the responsibility for the blood shed by the Republic in its hour of peril , the share therein of reactionary
Europe	LOCATION	, of the recusant priests and the emigres , must not be forgotten .

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	finds that '' the peculiar harsh - ness of Frenchmen to Frenchmen in their po - litical capacity dates from the Revolution . ''

		From what , then , we may ask , dated the pecu - liar harshness of Frenchmen to Frenchmen during the Revolution ?

		In the same vein he moralizes on the psychological results of the daily spectacle of the guillotine at work , and animadverts -LRB- not very profoundly -RRB- on .

		`` a humanitarian philosophy '' that '' led to such depths of inhuman ferocity that to see unfor - tunates sent to execution was a spectacle to which the mothers of
Paris	LOCATION	brought their chil - dren . ''

		Does Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	seriously mean to tell us that the gloating joy of the hags who knitted in the red shadow of the guillotine was born of that '' humanitarian philosophy '' not the least of whose titles to respect is that it raised its voice in fearless protest against the barbarities of the ancient criminal law of
France	LOCATION	?

		A mo - ment 's reflection must have reminded him that it was the Old Regime , and not the Republic , that bred in the French populace a taste for these bloody spectacles .

		To the older habitues of the
Place de la Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, the Republican trage - dies enacted thereon must have seemed compar - atively tame and spiritless , when they remem - bered the prolonged agonies of victims of the wheel or the stake .

		Before the '' humanitarian philosophy '' at which it is the fashion nowa - days to sneer did away with it , the wheel was set up regularly in the principal cities of
France	LOCATION	, and the voice of the crier was heard in the streets as he hawked pamphlets announcing the fate of the victims . ''

		The common people crowded about the scaffold , and the rich did not always scorn to hire windows over - looking the scene .

		The condemned man was first stretched upon a cross and struck by the executioner eleven times with an iron bar , every stroke breaking a bone .

		The poor wretch was then laid on his back on a cart-wheel , his broken bones protruding through his flesh , his head hanging , his brow dripping bloody sweat , and left to die .

		A priest muttered religious consolation by his side .

		By such sights as these was the populace of the French cities trained to enjoy the far less inhu - man spectacle of the guillotine . ''

		*
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	, as a girl , was once startled from her books by the trampling of an excited mob hastening on its way to the
Place de la Greve	ORGANIZATION	, where two youths were to suffer death by the wheel and the stake .

		People were crowd - ing to the house-tops to view the appalling spectacle .

		The future republican , though a true daughter of the
Seine	LOCATION	, shrank from the hideous sight ; but she could not shut out the shrieks of the victims nor the smell of the burn - ing faggots .

		The cries of one of the wretches , who lived for twelve hours on the wheel , rang in her ears throughout the
night	TIME	.

		She writes in her Memoirs : '' In truth , human nature is not at all estimable con - sidered en masse .

		I can not conceive what can thus excite the curiosity of thousands to see two of their fellow-creatures die ... Yes , the pitiless mob ap - plauded the tortures of the criminals as if at a play . ''

		And the same pitiless mob was one day to follow , with jeers and plaudits and greedy an - ticipation , the tumbril which bore her to the scaffold a serene and shining figure that will not soon die in the memory of that '' Impartial Posterity '' to which she made her final appeal .

		The antipathy for the French Revolution of a conservative , somewhat prosaic , Englishman , imbued with a lingering notion of the sacro - sanct character of throne and altar and pre - scriptive titles , is not unintelligible ; but we confess we do not understand how a French - man endowed with a grain of patriotism and a scintilla of sympathy with human progress can in cool blood stigmatize as a '' nameless orgie '' of '' madmen , miscreants , and incapables '' the * From Mr.

		THE DIAL 225 great movement that lightened the burdens and confirmed the civic manhood of two-thirds of his countrymen .

		The French Revolution was assuredly not made , as
Danton	PERSON	said , '' with rosewater . ''

		Those who extol it most deplore its follies and excesses .

		But had the good it wrought been confined to its sweeping away of fiscal inequalities alone , it would not be with - out a fair title to the respect of posterity .

		To the faint-hearted believer in representa - tive democracy , Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's view of the pres - ent attitude of the French towards the terms of the republican device , '' Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity , '' will prove somewhat discour - aging almost as much so as Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's recent lugubrious reflections on the decline of parlia - mentarism in general .

		Whatever may be its faults , we do not see how anything but parlia - mentarism is possible now for that portion of the world that has grown up to it .

		It is hardly conceivable that any intelligent people that has for long exercised the adult privilege of vot - ing its own taxes , speaking its own mind , and generally controlling its own business , could , under normal conditions and in the absence of national decay , suddenly develop a taste for the infantile leading-strings of absolutism .

		It is fair to say that Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's ideal system for
France	LOCATION	is , not absolutism pure and simple , but a hybrid compound of Imperialism and Parliamentarism , an arrangement symbolized by certain beautiful gold coins bearing the revolutionary date '' An .

		XII. , '' which show on one face the legend ''
Napoleon Empereur	PERSON	, '' and on the reverse `` Republique Fran9aise . ''

		Of the instability of the present Republic , or at least of its slight hold on the people , Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	finds signs and symptoms not a few .

		The indifference , bordering on contempt , of the bulk of the French for their legislators , we have already noted .

		But was there ever a gov - ernment in
France	LOCATION	of which the industrial masses took much note except , indeed , when it became especially bad ?

		The phenomenon of political indifferentism is , we venture to say , as common in
America	LOCATION	as in
France	LOCATION	.

		Had Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	visited us and questioned people of the order of his French wood-carver as to their con - gressman , he would unquestionably in many cases have received a reply -LRB- seasoned at times with a robust expletive or two -RRB- equivalent to `` Je ne rn ` occupepas depolitique ,
Monsieur	PERSON	. ''

		But he would have been quite wrong had he inferred from this that events were justifying
Jefferson	PERSON	's dread of '' monocracy , '' and that a King or an Emperor of the
United States	LOCATION	was a looming political possibility .

		Again , Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	lays stress on the unabated thirst of the French for orders and decorations and especially on their unwarranted assumption of nobiliary titles , a practice which has grown to such a pitch lat - terly that dubious counts and barons are as thick at
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- we trust American heiresses will take note of this -RRB- as leaves in
Vallombrosa	LOCATION	, or as civilian '' Colonels '' in
Kentucky	LOCATION	and titular ''
Squires	PERSON	'' and '' Judges '' in old
New England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	deals frankly yet tactfully with what he deems the especially noteworthy and suggestive faults and follies of the time .

		An unpleasant trait of the Republic is its not infre - quent manifestation of intolerance , notably the scandalous readiness of certain soi-disant offi - cial upholders of free thought to borrow a leaf from the book of its one time oppressors by attempting to penalize religious observances and to set up irreligion as a standard of citi - zenship .

		Clearly , the repressions and hatreds of the old regime have cast a still lingering shadow on the new .

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	deplores the levity of that largely ornamental class which rejoices in the imperfectly deserved title of '' la haute societe Parisienne '' its abstention from public affairs and serious interests of any kind , its severance from the class dignified by intel - lect and achievement , its ape-like mimicry of English ways , its seeming effort to transform
Paris	LOCATION	into a mere cosmopolitan city of pleasure and common casino of nations .

		As
M. Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	still more harshly puts it : '' Les hautes classes sout inconsciemment les grands fan teurs da socialisme .

		Lear vie est one predication centre la socie ` te * .

		La frivolit ^ impertinente de la jeunesse de nos salons , 1 ` oisivete ' ridiculement affaire'e de nos ' sportsmen ' et de nos ' clubmen , ' I ` e ` talage outrageant de la debauche e ` le ` gante , quelles lemons poor le pen pie de la roe ! ''

		It is the people of the provinces who , with their silent , sober energy , constitute the real saving force of
France	LOCATION	, and keep her in the front rank of nations , in spite of the follies committed in her beautiful capital .

		And apart from the mass of the people , with their excellent quali - ties of stability and diligence , there are , thinks the author , '' three great but dissimilar bodies in the nation , the virtues of which counterbal - ance the ill done by the conspicuous classes whose words and deeds fill the newspapers . ''

		These are the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and the Clergy .

		On the topic of the comparatively low birth - rate in
France	LOCATION	, the author touches in a rather incidental and cursory way .

		To a philosophic observer it might seem a little odd that a coun - try which has fairly attained that millennial 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, state pictured by Malthusian economists in which prudential checks on population effectu - ally prevent the pressure of numbers on the means of subsistence , should on that account be an object of such general commiseration and dismal prophecy .

		The Napoleonic view that places first among the national virtues the rapid propagation of food for powder evidently survives .

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's book is less comprehensive than Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's , in that it by no means covers the whole field of government .

		Dwelling exten - sively , in his opening volume , on historical relations , he has thought best to limit the scope of the remainder of the work to an account of the Executive and Legislative powers which have operated during the
last quarter	DATE	of the century , reserving for a future and independent volume a study of the jurisdictions of the great interior departments of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, which in
France	LOCATION	survive revolutions and changes of regime .

		Thus , the promised volume will deal with the Centralized
Adm	ORGANIZATION	inistration , the
Church and Education	ORGANIZATION	, the Judicial and Fiscal Sys - tems , and with questions relating to
Capital and Labor	ORGANIZATION	, to the Colonies and the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	's book may safely be pronounced the book of the season , and it should be in the hands of everyone desiring a scholarlike knowl - edge of political
France	LOCATION	of to-day .


E. G. J. HENRY GEORGE	PERSON	AND HIS FINAL , WORK .

		*
Henry George	PERSON	died fighting one of the most corrupt political organizations of the civilized world a sufficient epitaph for any worthy man .

		But he has larger claims to respect and consideration .

		He made a creditable attempt to solve the root-problem of material life poverty , and his just-published posthumous book , '' The Science of Political Economy , '' excites that pathetic interest which attaches to the memory of one who tried to aid his fellow - man .

		He was eloquent , but he was free from the hysteria of demagogy .

		His sympathies , born of bitter vicissitude , were acute , but they were tempered with reason .

		He believed in the equality of opportunity ; but he believed also -LRB- as an American and an individualist -RRB- in the natural inequality of capacity .

		When he saw the industrial evils of the Old World re - appear in one of the richest and fairest parts of the New commercial depression , involuntary * THE SCIENCE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY .

		idleness , wasting capital , pecuniary distress , want , suffering , anxiety , he was startled , and he set about to discover the cause .

		We value him for what he tried to do . ''

		Progress and Poverty '' was an immensely interesting and attractive book on a seemingly sapless science .

		It struck fire from flint , and lifted the author from obscurity to world-wide celebrity .

		Emer - son says that every man is eloquent in that which he understands .

		It would be , perhaps , truer to say that every man is eloquent in that in which he fervently believes , and
George	PERSON	be - lieved that he had given a message .

		To quote his own words : '' On the
night	TIME	on which I finished the final chapter of ' Progress and Poverty , ' I felt that the talent entrusted to me had been accounted for was more fully satis - fied , more deeply grateful , than if all the
King	PERSON	- doms of the earth had been laid at my feet . ''

		No one doubts his sincerity , his intellectual integrity , the cleanliness of his soul .

		His ex - pectations were infinite , his faith simple .

		The poverty of the world lay not in Nature but in a vicious economic system ; and he thought that he had found a '' sovereign remedy '' which would '' raise wages , increase the earnings of capital , extirpate pauperism , abolish poverty , give remunerative employment to whoever wishes it , afford free scope to human powers , lessen crime , elevate morals and taste and intel - ligence , purify government , and carry civiliza - tion to yet nobler heights . ''

		This was , of course , fatuity .

		His suggestion of the confiscation of all ground-rent , as a uni - versal corrective and solvent , has been thor - oughly discredited by political economists ; and he felt this fact keenly .

		The assent of the unthinking multitude did not satisfy him .

		He craved recognition from the technically in - structed , and this doubtless is the inspiration of his posthumous work .

		He complains that : '' While a few of these professional economists , driven to say something about ' Progress and Poverty , ' resorted to misrepresentation , the majority preferred to rely upon their official positions , in which they were secure by the interests of the dominant class , and to treat as beneath contempt a book circulated by thousands in the three great English-speaking countries and translated into all the important modern languages .

		Thus the professors of political economy seemingly rejected the simple teachings of ' Progress and Poverty , ' refrained from meeting with disproof or argument what it had laid down , and treated it with contemptuous silence . ''

		Wishing to justify himself to the specialist , he embraced the mistake of an elaborate , formal treatise on '' The Science of Political Econ - omy . ''

		A duller work has not appeared within a year and a day .

		We look in vain for the

		THE DIAL , 227 dramatic instinct which characterized the com - position of '' Progress and Poverty . ''

		No two books written on the same subject and by the same hand could be more dissimilar .

		And yet the last book is merely a repetition of the first in the sense that it embodies no new important principle .


John Morley	PERSON	says in the preface to his smaller Burke : '' A man may once say a thing as he would have it said he can not say it twice . ''

		In this book
Henry George	PERSON	reiterates that land is not wealth ; that agriculture is not sub - ject to the law of diminishing return ; that
Malthusianism	PERSON	is infatuated pessimism ; that industry is not limited by capital ; that wages are paid out of the current product , and not out of capital ; that , therefore , wages can not be diminished by the increase of laborers ; that wages are low where rent is high ; that rent tends to absorb all profit , and should be con - fiscated as an '' unearned increment . ''

		All of which '' Progress and Poverty '' to the con - trary notwithstanding still await demonstra - tion .

		In his last work , he reserved the elabora - tion of nearly all these propositions to Book IV. , part of which remains unwritten .

		He approaches the arduous task of compre - hensive definition with simplicity of confidence .

		He is impatient with the mistakes of his prede - cessors , and he enters into the usual wrangle over terminology .

		When
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	said that everyone has a notion , sufficiently correct for common purposes , of what is meant by wealth , that we all know that it is one thing to be rich and another thing to be enlightened , brave , or humane , he was hooted for his want of precision .

		He was even heretical enough to say : Whether the skill of a workman or any other natural or acquired power of body or mind shall be called wealth , is a question not of very great importance .

		This '' slovenliness of thought '' made the pedants gasp , and lo !

		and now
Marshall	PERSON	has reformed it altogether .

		In passing ,
George	PERSON	takes a hit at him , which appeals to the American sense of humor .

		He ridicules his `` Occasional bursts of such thunderous sound as ` external - material-transferable goods , ' ' internal-non-transferable goods , ' ` material-external-non-transferable goods , ' and personal-external-transferable goods , ' with all their respective singulars .

		There is in English no singular for the word ' goods , ' and the reason is that there is no need for one , since when we want to express the idea of a single item or article in a lot of goods , it is better to use the specific noun . ''

		George endeavors to identify the laws of political economy with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, and this is not difficult , because everything that exists or hap - pens is natural .

		The primary postulate is not selfishness , but it is that men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion .

		The sci - ence of political economy is concerned , he says , with the permanent , not with the transient .

		It deals not with human enactments or municipal laws , but natural laws , and has no more refer - ence to political divisions than have the laws of mechanics , optics , or gravitation .

		Is this true ?

		Would not the advent of
Bellamy	PERSON	ism , and the consequent abolition of competition , exchange , and money , make modern political economy a hieroglyph ?

		George excludes land as wealth under the following definition : '' Wealth consists of nat - ural products that have been secured , moved , combined , separated , or in other ways modified by human exertion so as to fit them for the gratification of human desires . ''

		But surely land is modified , improved , or exhausted by human labor ; the physical possession of it is transferable , it has value in exchange , and may be sold for the products of human labor .

		Why , then , is it not wealth ?

		Every business man knows that it is .

		Properly considered , the sci - ence of political economy , like the science of astronomy , is an observation and analysis of what is , not of what conceivably might be .

		It is not an ethical precept , and the failure to recognize this vitiates
George	PERSON	's whole treatise .

		He attacks the law of diminishing return in agriculture -LRB- although afterwards he bases his whole doctrine of rent upon it -RRB- , on the ground that it is not benevolent .

		But Nature is not benevolent ; else why should a half million of people have died of starvation in
India	LOCATION	last year ?

		Why is everyone born under a death sentence ?

		Even if space permitted , it would be tedious and profitless to follow him in detailed criticism through his theory of value ; his falla - cious analogies in physical science and pseudo - metaphysics ; his laborious explication of nat - uralism .

		The reader himself will look into the book if he deems it worth while .

		But , save a chapter on money , which is a remarkably lucid account of fiatism , it would seem hardly worth while .

		It is interesting to note that
George	PERSON	disa - vowed socialism . ''

		It takes no account of natural laws , neither seeking them nor striving to be governed by them ... It is a proposi - tion to bring back mankind to the socialism of
Peru	LOCATION	. ''

		And yet
George	PERSON	's scheme of rent con - fiscation leads straight to socialism .

		It is incon - ceivable that four million and a half of farmers 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, in the
United States	LOCATION	, not to speak of city house - holders , could be dispossessed of title without retaliating .

		What would be done with the mortgages on the farms ?

		Would the farmer be compelled to pay them ?

		Would the
State	ORGANIZATION	assume them , or would it confiscate them ?

		Is there not an unearned increment in railway shares , wages , professional fees , and all material personal property ?

		Wherein , too , in the realm of absolute ethics , is the title of a nation better than that of an individual ?

		It is founded on discovery , conquest , or purchase , and is main - tained by force .

		Assuming that there is a land question in a country of limited area , such as
Great Britain	LOCATION	, an equal division of agricultural and ground rent together , apart from the inter - est on capital invested , would give to each per - son there about one dollar a month .

		Would that abolish poverty ?

		In
George	PERSON	's second book , '' Social Problems , '' he hints at the confiscation of the national debt .

		He asks if the pecuniary obligations of one 's great-grandfather should bind posterity .

		Once admit the principle of confiscation , it grows won - derfully .

		In a debate with
Hyndman	PERSON	, the En - glish socialist ,
George	PERSON	said : `` I can understand how a society must at some time become possible in which all production and exchange should be carried on under public supervision and for the public benefit , but I do not think it possible to attain that step at one leap , or to attain it now . ''

		Nevertheless , he helped to blaze the way to it .

		But alas for human nature and for the dream of the socialist !

		There is one place in this im - perfect world of ours and perhaps only one where life is serious and well-ordered , where absolute equality prevails , where production is regulated and labor and reward are evenly ap - portioned , where men live in accordance with the law of wholesome average and hygiene , where they rise early and retire seasonably , where they wear warm and sufficient but not superfine clothing , where they work eight hours a day , where they attend religious services , where there is no luxurious and profitless living , where there is no idleness , no vice , no profan - ity , no dissipation , no extravagance , no money , no gambling , no speculation , no exchange , no swindling , no tricks of trade , no hunger , no controversy , no violence , no crimes , and no mis - takes , in a word , where a few men do what revolutionary socialists would have all men do , and that place is the penitentiary .

		Society is a growth , not a creation ; an or - ganism , not an empiricism .

		It can not be made over by tinkering sciolists .

		Progress is evolu - tion , not revolution .

		Socialism is an intellectual vanity ; an ambitious humanitarianism dis - regardful of the two profoundest instincts in human nature , the sense of personal property and of personal liberty .

		Prediction is labori - ous failure ; the future can not be pigeon-holed .


Nicholson	PERSON	says of Utopias : '' The imagination has very limited powers of construction com - pared with Nature ; on the one side we have a short span of life and a small brain , and on the other eternity and the universe . ''

Hawaii	LOCATION	has of late enjoyed , has afforded her the opportunity of writing the story of her life and presenting to the American public , in a volume entitled ''
Hawaii	LOCATION	's Story , '' her side of an oft-told tale .

		Descended from an ancient chief , a counsellor of Kamehameha I. , the first Hawaiian monarch , the Princess
Lydia	PERSON	was adopted at birth , in accordance with the prevailing Hawaiian custom , into the family of another chief .

		In
1862	DATE	she was married to General
J. O. Dominis	PERSON	, son of an English sea - captain , who died during her brief reign as queen .

		She was proclaimed heir-apparent ,
Liliuokalani	PERSON	, by her brother
King Kalakaua	PERSON	in
1877	DATE	, and from that time took a deep inter - est in the political projects of the king , sympa - thizing with his efforts to aggrandize the crown .

		The death of the king in
1892	DATE	brought her to the throne , where she continued the policy which her brother had inaugurated .

		The story of her early life and education in a missionary family is briefly told .

		Of her musical ability she writes : '' I scarcely remember the days when it would not have been possible for me to write either the words or the music for any occasion on which poetry or song was needed .

		To compose was as natural to me as to breathe ; and this gift of nature , never having been suffered to fall into disuse , remains a source of the greatest conso - lation to this day .

		I have never numbered my compo - sitions , but am sure that they must run well up to the hundreds . ''

		The account of her travels through her own realm , the

		`` Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	has been called ` The Grand Old Man , ' yet this thought was strongly emphasized to me also in the presence of
Lord Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has always appeared to me to be the greater man of the two .

		If his rule has been less popular and more conservative , it has required no less devoted patriotism and lofty abili - ties .

		I attribute the present prosperity of the British Empire very largely to the consummate wisdom and stanch loyalty of Lord Salisbury . ''

		She is quick to recognize with abundant per - sonal mention her royalist friends , and with even greater alertness assails her political op - ponents with covert allusion and insinuation .

		Quite naturally , the bitter resentment which she feels against those who now rule her native land colors her estimate of men and their mo - tives ; indeed , in speaking of the annexation treaty she says : '' I had prepared biographical sketches and observa - tions upon the mental structure and character of the most interested advocates of this measure .

		They have not refrained from circulating the most vile and base - less slanders against me ; and , as public men , they seemed to me open to public discussion .

		But my pub - lishers have flatly declined to print this matter , as pos - sibly it might be construed as libellous . ''

		Her animadversions are not , however , confined to recent times and the '' missionary party , '' but revert to good Queen
Emma	PERSON	, a rival can - didate at the time when the late dynasty in the person of
King Kalakaua	LOCATION	was placed upon the throne by the legislature .

		Her bias is evident in the treatment accorded this queen 's reputed ancestry , and continues even to the account of her burial .

		By reason of the author 's deep personal interest in the events narrated , the book can - not be trusted to give a complete and impartial account of recent Hawaiian history , especially of that part concerned with the long strug - gle between absolutism and constitutional gov - ernment , between the reactionary influences of the recent dynasty and the progressive ten - dencies of Anglo-Saxon civilization represented by the element variously known as the Amer - ican , missionary , and reform party .

		Take , for example , her account of the election of
Kala	PERSON	- kaua in
1874	DATE	.

		She states that his success was due to his popularity among the natives .

		This affair is otherwise reported by
Alexander	PERSON	, who attributes his election to the active support of the American party , who feared the English sympathies of the rival candidate Queen

		The defection in the army and the police , and the riot which followed , are minimized by the queen as `` not an expression of the Hawaiian people ; it was merely the madness of a mob incited by disappointed partisans whom the representatives of the people had rebuked . ''

		Alexander states that
Kalakaua	PERSON	owed his life and his throne to American intervention , and for several years he depended upon the support of the foreign community .

		The queen complains that her cabinets were never given the test of experience , that her ap - pointees were invariably voted out by the legis - lature '' for want of confidence '' without just cause , and she regrets this unpatriotic action of the legislature ; but she neglects to state that this body was overwhelmingly Hawaiian , and that the occasion for these repeated rejections of her appointments was her persistent refusal to appoint men acceptable to the majority .

		By the constitution of
1887	DATE	the cabinet was respon - sible to the people alone , through the legis - lature .

		The queen 's refusal to accede to the time-honored English procedure was thus the occasion for this '' unpatriotic '' action of the people 's representatives .

		One notes with interest her account of the
Hale Naua	PERSON	, or
Temple of Science	ORGANIZATION	, a secret organization of Kahunas or medicine men , whose ritual is a travesty of Masonry mingled with pagan rites .

		It was founded by
Kalakaua	LOCATION	, says
Alexander	PERSON	, partly as an agency for the revival of heathenism , partly to pander to vice , and indirectly to serve as a political machine .

		The queen 's account is as follows : '' Probably some of its forms had been taken by my brother from the Masonic ritual , and others may have been taken from the old and harmless ceremonies of the ancient people of the
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	, which were then only known to the priests of the highest orders .

		Under the work of this organization was embraced matters of science known to historians , and recognized by the priests of our ancient times .

		The society further held some correspondence with similar scientific asso - ciations in foreign lands , to whom it communicated its proceedings .

		The result was some correspondence with those bodies , who officially accepted the theories pro- pounded by the
Hale Naua	PERSON	; and in recognition of this acceptance medals were sent from abroad to the mem - bers highest in rank in the Hawaiian Society . ''

		Her signature to the notorious lottery bill which gave the
Louisiana	LOCATION	company twenty years ' franchise is defended by the ex-queen on the ground that she was compelled to sign it by the '' bayonet '' constitution , made and en - forced by the missionary party , which specifies that the sovereign shall and must sign such measures as the cabinet presents for signature .

		It is , however , safe to say that she spared no effort , political or personal , to secure , and only after months of contest succeeded in retaining , THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, a cabinet which would sanction such a bill .

		The champions of this , and other legislation of similar repute enacted at the same time , were and have been ardent supporters of the queen .

		She further justifies her action : '' We were petitioned and besought to grant it by most of the mercantile class of the city , shop - keepers , mechanics , manufacturers , in fact all the middle class of the people . ''

		It is hardly necessary to state that the Chamber of Com - merce , and the reputable classes of society both native and foreign , were not included with these petitioners for the passage of the lottery bill .

		The queen now renounces her abdication , claiming that it was forced from her while a prisoner , by the threat that certain prominent citizens who had taken part in the uprising to restore the monarchy would be immediately put to death if she refused .

		Furthermore , the name which she was requested to affix to that document was not and never had been her legal signature .

		She also denies the accuracy of Minister
Willis	PERSON	's official reports of his first interview with her looking toward her restora - tion .

		She says : '' It was most unfortunate that the American minister should have so misrepresented me , or that I should have so misunderstood him , or that his stenographer -LRB- if there was one concealed at that interview -RRB- should have blun - dered , or that I should have been so overburdened by the many aspects of the painful situation as to be igno - rant or unconscious of the importance of the precise words read in my presence . ''

		Although , owing to its warped and partial statements , the book has little value as reliable history , it is nevertheless a most important contribution to the literature of the Hawaiian question .

		It is of interest alike to those who condemn and to those who condone the over - throw of the monarchy , for it gives an authentic revelation of the ex-queen 's views of the rights and privileges of a constitutional monarch .

		Hawaii emerged from feudal barbarism in the early part of the present century .

		With Anglo-Saxon help and guidance , an absolute monarchy was established and maintained by the Kamehamehas .

		In
1840	DATE	, the first consti - tution was granted by the king under the ad - vice and direction of his religious teachers .

		In
1852	DATE	, a new and liberal constitution , in whose formation the king , the supreme court , and the legislature shared , was ratified by the latter body .

		This continued in force until
1864	DATE	, when Prince Lot , the first of the monarchs to show reactionary tendencies , promulgated a new constitution upon his own authority which slightly increased the power of the crown .

		This constitution prevailed until
1887	DATE	, when the abuses and corruption of the government under Kalakaua resulted in an uprising which forced upon the king a new constitution that extended the franchise to foreigners and made the cab - inet responsible to the people through the leg - isture .

		To this '' bayonet '' constitution , the queen took the oath of allegiance on her acces - sion to the throne in
1891	DATE	.

		Long before we reach the account of her own reign , we have no doubt as to her attitude toward this consti - tution which had shorn the crown of its pre - rogatives '' which , based upon the ancient cus - tom and the authority of the island chiefs , were the sole guaranty of our nationality . ''

		Early in her reign , a movement for a new constitution received her endorsement .

		In her own words : '' I assented to a modification of the existing constitution on the expressed wishes , not only of my own advisers , but of two-thirds of the popular vote , and , I may say it without fear of contradiction , of the entire population of native or half-native birth . ''

		The desired modifica - tions were not sought in the method prescribed by law , there was never a plebescite upon the subject , and her constitutional advisers , crea - tures of her own , to a man implored her not to promulgate the new constitution , and finally in the face of her determination fled from the palace .

		She further claims that the right to grant a constitution to the nation has been , since the very first one was granted , a prerogative of the Hawaiian sovereigns ; although in the brief period of Hawaiian history there is abundant precedent for other initiative and sanction .

		The American people will look with interest for the queen 's version of the constitution whose attempted promulgation led to her overthrow , but they will look in vain , for the subject is dismissed with a few vague generalities and guarded allusions . ''

		It is alleged that my proposed constitution was to make such changes as to give to the sovereign more power , and to the cabinet or legislature less , and that only subjects , in distinction from temporary residents , could exercise suffrage .

		In other words , that I was to restore some of the ancient rights of my people . ''

		This last sentence has a patriotic ring , but read in the light of early Hawaiian history its true char - acter is revealed .

		The queen has painted a pleas - ing picture of the life of the ancient chief and his retainers , but
Cook	PERSON	,
Ellis	PERSON	, and
Jarvis	PERSON	have used pigments of a more sombre hue .

		Under the ancient feudal system the Hawaiian vassal had no rights to property , real or personal ; his labor , his home , and his very life itself were 1898 . -RSB-

		231 subject to the whim of his chief .

		The subjection of the legislature , the cabinet , and the supreme court to the sovereign , and the banishment of the Anglo-Saxon from political life , would doubtless have done much to restore the spirit of this primitive time in the queen 's realm .

		Liliuokalani 's appeal to the American peo - ple for Hawaiian autonomy is both dignified and pathetic : '' Oh , honest Americans , as Christians hear me for my downtrodden people !

		Their form of government is as dear to them as yours is precious to you .

		Quite as warmly as you love your country , so they love theirs .

		With all your goodly possessions , do not covet the little vineyard of
Naboth	ORGANIZATION	's , so far from your shores , lest the punishment of Ahab fall upon yon , if not in your day , in that of your children , for ' be not deceived , God is not mocked . '

		The people to whom your fathers told of the living God , and taught to call ' Father , ' and whom the sons now seek to despoil and destroy , are crying aloud to him in their time of trouble ; and He will keep His promise , and will listen to the voices of His Ha - waiian children lamenting for their homes . ''


CHARLES A. KOFOID	PERSON	.

		OF GREAT PHYSICIANS .

		* Of the interesting series of biographies of `` Masters of Medicine , '' three have already issued from the press , and others are yet to come .

		Briefly yet clearly they set forth the principal events in the lives of the pioneers in medical science .

		Beginning with
Harvey	PERSON	, we are retrograded into the
sixteenth century	DATE	to the days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and the Invincible Armada .

		During that period of English ex - pansion the future physician was born and be - gan his observation of nature .

		A few years later we find him , the favorite brother of a whole family of successful
London	LOCATION	merchants , enjoying all the scholastic advantages that their wealth could procure attending the lectures of the celebrated
Fabricius	PERSON	, professor of anat - omy in the
University of Padua	ORGANIZATION	, laboriously tracing the channels of communication between arteries and veins , and preparing the way for that demonstration of the circulation of the blood which , announced in after years , made his name forever famous in the annals of sci - entific discovery .

		Then , early in the seven - teenth century , we see the rising doctor , mar - ried , settled in
London	LOCATION	, physician to
St. Bar	ORGANIZATION	- tholomew 's
Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, lecturer on anatomy at the
College of Physicians	ORGANIZATION	, finally reaching the * MASTERS OF MKDICINE .

		A series of monographs , edited by
Ernest Hart	PERSON	, D.C.L. , editor of `` The British Medical Journal . ''

		I. ,
William Harvey	PERSON	; II. ,
John Hunter	PERSON	; III. , Sir
James Simpson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		exalted position of physician to His Majesty ,
King Charles	LOCATION	the First .

		Between the learned doctor and his royal patient grew up the utmost confidence and cordial friendship .

		At the bat - tle of
Edgehill	LOCATION	, while the king charged upon the foe at the head of his cavaliers , his two little sons ,
Charles	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	, sat with their guardian , Dr.
Harvey	PERSON	, in the shade of a hedge upon the brow of the hill that overlooked the field of combat .

		When the royalists were shut up in
Oxford	LOCATION	,
Merton College	ORGANIZATION	was converted into a residence for the queen , and Dr.
Harvey	PERSON	was placed in control as master of the college .

		All through the unhappy conflict between king and parliament , the doctor faithfully followed the fortunes of his sovereign ; but when the war was over he returned to the peaceful occu - pation of his
London	LOCATION	home , where he passed the remainder of his life , dissecting , lecturing , writing , bestowing of his wealth upon the Col - lege of Physicians a martyr to the gout , yet reaching his eightieth year , and dying without pain after an illness of only a few hours .

		In
William Harvey	PERSON	we trace the career of a learned physician , the child of fortune , the man of letters .

		In
John Hunter	PERSON	we make acquaint - ance with a very different type .

		Born in the year
1728	DATE	, a Scotchman , wayward , ignorant , quarrelsome , irreligious , in every respect an unsavory person , yet one of the most enthu - siastic students of comparative anatomy and physiology that ever lived , he became , through sheer industry and force of character , the founder of scientific surgery in
England	LOCATION	, and the leading surgeon of his day .

		The story of his gigantic labors in the formation of the mu - seum upon which out of his professional income he expended no less than three hundred and fifty thousand dollars , leaving his family pen - niless when he died , is one of the most inter - esting and instructive in the annals of medicine .

		In many respects the record of the life of Sir
James Simpson	PERSON	forms the most attractive volume of this interesting series .

		Like Har - vey , Dr.
Simpson	PERSON	was an educated gentleman who charmed his patients by the fascination of his manners , making of them friends rather than clients .

		To his experiments was due the introduction of chloroform as an anaes - thetic ; and through its use in his special line of practice he earned the gratitude of count - less mothers all over the world .

		The story of the discovery of artificial anaesthesia is well told in these pages , and will interest others be - sides members of the medical profession .


HENRY M. LTMAN	PERSON	.

		232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, BRIEFS ox KEW BOOKS .

		The story of the Puritans as pioneers in
New England	LOCATION	has been often told .

		So , too , in a lesser degree , there has been full recognition of the builder work done by Quakers in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and Huguenots in the
Carolinas	LOCATION	.

		Now , at last , another group of refugees , similar in character and purpose to Puritan and
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	and Huguenot , has found its historian .

		The Rev.
Sanford H. Cobb	PERSON	, whose residence at
Richfield Springs	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, has familiarized him with the earlier seats of this people , has made a valuable addition to the record of our Colonial period in his '' Story of the Palatines '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		There are many students of general history who are familiar with the history of the devastation of the Palatinate of the Rhine by the armies of
Louis	LOCATION	the Fourteenth , yet are ignorant of what that province suffered under its absolutist and bigoted rulers of the next two genera - tions .

		These
Palatine	LOCATION	electors emulated that short - sighted French monarch 's treatment of the Hugue - nots , and between
1708	DATE	and
1750	DATE	drove to a refuge in
America	LOCATION	over sixty thousand of their best subjects .

		Many a student of our Civil War who is conversant with the details of that great campaign beginning in '' the Wilderness '' which carried Grant to Rich - mond , is ignorant that its starting-point , the Ger - manna
Ford	ORGANIZATION	through the Rapidan , took its name from a colony of these exiles for conscience ' sake , planted in the wilds of
Virginia	LOCATION	by Governor Spots - wood in
1710	DATE	.


New Berne	LOCATION	in
North Carolina	LOCATION	had become , in the previous year , the seat of another colony from the
Palatinate	LOCATION	, led by the Swiss gen - tleman
Christopher de Graffenried	PERSON	, of the older
Alpine Berne	PERSON	.

		But the great immigration of the Palatines was into
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, beginning in
1708	DATE	, and occupying first the banks of the Hudson in the vicinity of the present
Newburgh	LOCATION	, whose name possibly enshrines a remembrance of the princely house of
Neuberg	PERSON	which ruled over the Pal - atinate .

		But the Palatines were not to find a home on the Hudson , nor in any large numbers even within the colony of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	has well told how the English government , and Governor
Hunter	PERSON	, after doing everything possible to bring these afflicted people to a better land in
America	LOCATION	, turned upon them in their poverty , through disap - pointment as to economic returns which the envir - onment would not produce , and at last drove them despairing to the Indians on the
Mohawk	LOCATION	.

		Even here their sufferings did not cease .

		The stepfatherly care of the government was made more burdensome by the oppressions of wealthy and influential land - grabbers , and so in
1723	DATE	a third pilgrimage brought the far larger number of them to the
Susquehanna	LOCATION	and the
Swatara	LOCATION	.

		Here at last , under the Quakers , was freedom and kindly government ; and during the next twenty years that portion of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	was planted directly from the
Palatinate	LOCATION	with thou - sands of families of sturdy and enterprising farmers the forefathers of the ''
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch . ''

		Thus
New York	LOCATION	lost from her body politic a most valuable element , although enough remained in the original settlements to give
America	LOCATION	the first apostle of freedom of the press in
John Peter Zenger	PERSON	, and to give the next generation that noble soldier of the Oriskany ,
Nicholas Herkimer	PERSON	.

		And so she lost
Conrad Weiser	PERSON	and
Henry Melchior Muhlenburg	PERSON	, and gave to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	those other more famous Muhlenburgs , and
Zollicoffer	PERSON	,
Heintzelman	PERSON	,
Siegel	PERSON	, and the Hartranfts .

		Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	has told his story well , and whilst he has done justice to these worthy pio - neers , he has not been unmindful of the real merits of Governor
Robert Hunter	PERSON	, and of his large ser - vices to the commonwealth where he made some sad mistakes .

		We have always been inclined to a d books called Idle Hours or '' Dozy Hours , '' just as we avoid newspaper columns called '' Saunterings '' or '' Gos - sippings . ''

		And almost everybody , we imagine , is inclined to avoid an essay on
Pepys	PERSON	as instinctively as one avoids pronouncing that gentleman 's name .

		Still , Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	has claims to attention , and thus we were fortunately led to read his '' Idle Hours in a Library '' -LRB-
Doxey	PERSON	-RRB- with more sympathy than we should have supposed from title or table of contents .

		All the essays are not on
Pepys	PERSON	, to tell the truth , only one is ; nor are all the essays to be read in idle hours ; indeed -LRB- the author to the con - trary , however -RRB- we can not easily regard them as having been written in idle hours .

		They are descrip - tive essays , it is true , and descriptive essays , as such , may have been written or may be read in idle hours .

		But one can not imagine Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	idly noting the points which go to make up the essay on
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan
England	LOCATION	; nor can we readily think of a person idly reading the essay on Mrs.
Manley	PERSON	and Mrs.
Behn	PERSON	.

		But we will stop what may seem little more than quibbling about a title ; enough if we make it clear that these essays are not of those dis - continuous ramblings , those roundabout perambu - lations , those familiar idlings , which begin at any subject that comes to mind , or rather that the mind comes to , and wander a happy-go-lucky course at the suggestion of personal association .

		These es - says are '' unacademic , '' it is true ; but each puts before the reader a perfectly definite object .

		They are , we think , different in merit and in interest .

		The essay on
Elizabethan England	LOCATION	is the best , for there is the most in it , and it will be read with pleasure by idler and scholar alike .

		The essay on Mrs.
Man	PERSON	- ley and Mrs.
Behn	PERSON	, on the other hand , is not in sub - ject or in treatment such as to attract or hold an idle interest ; its real interest is for the student , although it is not put in such form as to be most useful to him .

		The essays on
Pepys	PERSON	and on the
Bohemia	LOCATION	of
Henri Murger	PERSON	are the two which come nearest the implication of the general title .

		The first almost led us to break a fixed resolve and read the famous diary , and the second made us glad we had already experienced the
Vie de Boheme	ORGANIZATION	.

		To
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 tell the truth , essays of this character are very hard to write well , and even when well written they remind us of the saying of someone to the effect that '' at no other period than this were there so many people who wanted to know about books with - out reading them . ''

		To such readers , certainly , Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	does not address his work .

		Others , we suspect , would appreciate his critical opinions , and would , indeed , value them more highly than his descriptive reports .

		Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	accomplished such good results when he was busy in a library that relatively one regrets that he allows himself the privilege of idling there .

		The essay on '' Style '' which Mr. ^ alter
Ralei	PERSON	g h has J Q8t Published in the form of a slender and taste - fully printed volume -LRB- Arnold -RRB- is one of the most remarkable pieces of critical writing that we have seen for many a day .

		The author not only has a great many real things to say , but he is also the master of a style of his own that attains high dis - tinction .

		Rather than amplify these propositions in the usual critical fashion , we prefer to fortify them by such quotations as space allows , persuaded that even within the present narrow limits , the book may be made to give adequate testimony in its own behalf .

		Here is a typically beautiful passage : '' The mind of man is peopled , like some silent city , with a sleeping company of reminiscences , associa - tions , impressions , aptitudes , emotions , to be awak - ened into fierce activity at the touch of words .

		By one way or other , with a f anfaronnade of the march - ing trumpets , or stealthily , by noiseless passages and dark posterns , the troop of suggesters enters the citadel , to do its work within .

		The procession of beautiful sounds that is a poem passes in through the main gate , and forthwith the by-ways resound to the hurry of ghostly feet , until the small com - pany of adventurers is well - nigh lost and over - whelmed in that throng of insurgent spirits . ''

		Again , how fine , and at the same time how weighty , is the passage with which the essay closes : '' Write , and after you have attained to some control over the instrument you write yourself down whether you will or no .

		There is no vice however uncon - scious , no virtue however shy , no touch of mean - ness or generosity in your character , that will not pass on to the paper .

		You anticipate the day of judgment and furnish the recording angel with ma - terial .

		The art of criticism in literature , so often decried and given a subordinate place among the arts , is none other than the art of reading and inter - preting these written evidences .

		Criticism has been popularly opposed to creation , perhaps because the kind of creation that it attempts is rarely achieved , and so the world forgets that the main business of Criticism , after all , is not to legislate , but to raise the dead .

		Graves , at its command , have waked their sleepers , oped , and let them forth .

		It is by the creative power of this art that the living man is reconstructed from the litter of blurred and frag - `` For Greekt a blush . ''

		mentary paper documents that he has left to pos - terity . ''

		We should not know where to look for a finer comment than this upon the Buffonian text that is so generally misquoted .

		Nor would it be easier to pack more of truth into a few words than we find in such a passage as this : '' No two words ever coincide throughout their whole extent .

		If sometimes good writers are found adding epithet to epithet for the same quality , and name to name for the same thing , it is because they despair of cap - turing their meaning at a venture , and so practice to get near it by a maze of approximations . ''

		We must close our extracts somewhere , and select for the purpose this solution of a vexed question : `` Ac - cording as they endeavor to reduce letters to some large haven and abiding-place of civility , or prefer to throw in their lot with the centrifugal tendency and ride on the flying crest of change , are writers dubbed Classic or Romantic . ''

		Who has ever made the distinction more subtly than this , or with choicer turn of phrase ?

		Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	's essay deserves a place on the shelf by the side of
Stevenson	PERSON	, almost by the side of Pater and
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		In view of the recent Graeco-Turkish War , Mr.
W. Alison Phillips	PERSON	's '' The War of Greek Independence ,
1821	DATE	to
1833	DATE	, '' is a very timely book .

		The author con - fronts the vital problem of the future of the
Balkan Peninsula	LOCATION	, and asks what aid in its solution can be derived from the history of
Greece	LOCATION	in this century .

		One is surprised to find that Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	still looks with hope to the Greeks as possible regenerators of the peninsula , for his entire book is a logical refu - tation of any such conclusion .

		It represents the Greeks as almost completely destitute of the civic virtues , and even more lacking in the personal ones .

		Such a vivid portrayal of lying , thieving , murder , outrage , assassination , treason , and at times cowardice , joined with a picturesque sentimentality and the most desperate courage , is almost without a parallel .

		In cruelty , the Greek far surpassed the Turk ; in treachery he was preeminent ; and the record of butcheries of men , women , and children , committed after capitulation on promise of personal safety , is revolting .

		To give one instance out of hundreds , we select the following from an account of the slaughter after
Navarino	LOCATION	, an account given by a Greek priest : '' Women , wounded with musket balls , rushed into the sea , seeking to escape , and were deliberately shot .

		Mothers , robbed of their clothes , with infants in their arms , plunged in the water to conceal themselves from shame , and were then made a mark for inhuman riflemen .

		Greeks seized infants from their mothers ' breasts and dashed them against the rocks .

		Children , three or four years old , were hurled living into the sea , and left to drown '' -LRB- page 59 -RRB- .

		After this catalogue of horrors , the author adds : '' The other atrocities of the Greeks , however , paled before the awful scenes which followed the storming of Tripolitza . ''

		The writer informs us that the Turks , on the contrary , 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, were seldom guilty of such outrages .

		The Greeks , not satisfied with butchering the enemy , were a scourge to their own countrymen ; and if neither Turk nor peasant was at hand , these famous war - riors fought with each other .

		In fact , they did this in season and out of season , from the beginning to the end of the war .

		The decades that have passed since the struggle for independence do not seem to have improved the character of the Greek , if we may be permitted to judge from the events of the last war .

		It seems , therefore , that we are justified in surrendering a hope which never had a rational basis , the hope that with the Greek lies the welfare of the Balkan peninsula .

		This does not mean that the Turk is fitted to secure it .

		Against that , the centuries have decided irrevocably .

		The Turk is , indeed , just , moderate , and tolerant ; but he is a failure as an administrator , and his religion stands in the way of progress .

		Consequently , the question is as far from solution as ever .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has consulted the best and most recent authorities , he writes in a delightfully clear and interesting fashion , and his accuracy is unimpeachable .

		Picture * of two volumes , by Mr.
J. Fitzger	PERSON	-
18th century	DATE	aid
Molloy	PERSON	, entitled '' The Romance
Dublin	LOCATION	life .

		of the Irigh stage '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , belong to the class of books whose aim is to bring back actors who long ago strutted and fretted their hours upon the stage .

		At times we wonder if it would not be wiser to leave the graves of these poor mortals un - disturbed .

		In their lives , these actors , through the characters they impersonated , often made men nobler by some pregnant thought that fell from their lips , but , shorn of the form the dramatist gave them , and made to appear in their own naked selves , their ennobling power vanishes like the tinselled frippery of the theatre before the cold light of day .

		Only here and there in the course of many years is a great actor born , and when such a man dies , there is , to use
Hazlitt	PERSON	's words , '' a void produced in society , a gap which requires to be filled up . ''

		Let authors , if they will , try to fill up these gaps with their books , but let them remember also that it takes a very great actor to make a gap which it is worth while to fill .

		If anything will redeem the books before us from the ephemeral existence accorded to most works of the sort , it will in all probability be the vivid and varied picture they give us of the social life in
Dublin	LOCATION	during the eighteenth century .

		That was a time when life in the Irish capital ran high ; when vast crowds thronged to witness scenes of pomp and circumstance like the arrival of the Vice - roy or the procession of the Trades ; when men won and lost fortunes on the cock-fighting on Cork Hill ; when young sparks about town thought no more of fighting a duel than of drinking a glass of claret ; when the narrow streets of the city were filled with routs of hooting children following some malefactor who was being whipped , with coachmen and chairmen fighting for the right of way , with dandies and drunkards swearing and singing coarse songs and jostling each other about ; when robbery stalked abroad at
midnight	TIME	, and beggary was witty and picturesque even in her rags .

		It is needless to say that a work which reflects and reproduces such scenes as these is worth the reading , and it is this reproduction of the life of the time that made Mr.
Molloy	PERSON	's work worth the writing .

		It is a difficult matter for one with The Campaign military training to describe a cam - of Sedan .

		/ .

		.

		paign from a military standpoint and make his details clear to the non-military reader .

		That this can be done , however , is shown by Mr.
George Hooper	PERSON	's '' Campaign of Sedan , '' first pub - lished in
1887	DATE	, and now republished in less expen - sive form as a volume in ''
Bonn	LOCATION	's Standard Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work contains an excellent state - ment of the condition of the armies of
Prussia	LOCATION	and of
France	LOCATION	previous to the outbreak of war , and em - phasizes
Prussia	LOCATION	's advantage at the outset in that she could quickly mobilize her troops .

		The lan - guage is simple yet forcible , and the story of the war itself is so well told that interest is sustained throughout ; while the maps , both of the general field of the war and of particular battles , make it possible to follow , step by step , the progress of the campaign .

		The book ends with the battle of Sedan .

		The introductory chapter , and the succeeding one on the causes of the war , while presented in an en - tertaining fashion , do not show that accurate histor - ical knowledge which marks the remainder of the book .

		Thus , on page 10 , in a reference to the har - mony of Prussian statesmen on the question of war with
Austria	LOCATION	, the statement is made that the famous ministerial council of
February , 1866	DATE	, was unani - mous in the decision for war , when as a fact both
Von Bodelschwingh	PERSON	,
Minister of Finance	ORGANIZATION	, and the Crown Prince of
Prussia	LOCATION	, spoke and voted against the war .

		Such points , however , might easily escape the attention of a writer whose chief interest was in military affairs , and do not detract from the real value of the work the clear exposition of a great military campaign .

		When a master of any art or science or profession takes us into his confi - dence and tells us the true story of his life , we feel it to be a privilege to listen .

		In '' Mar - chesi and Music '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- this service is rendered by the most famous of living teachers of the art of singing .

		In her forty-one years of professional life ,
Madame Marchesi	ORGANIZATION	has known nearly every promi - nent musician of the period , either as friend or as instructor .

		Consequently the book is full of most entertaining and instructive reminiscence of famous persons , ranging from
Nicolai	PERSON	and Men - delssohn -LRB- under whose auspices she made her first important appearance before the public -RRB- to Mas - senet ,
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	,
Ambroise Thomas	PERSON	,
Humperdinck	PERSON	, and other living composers .

		And side by side with these anecdotes of celebrities , these records of artistic tri - umphs and brilliant public events , runs a pleasing 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 thread of personal narrative , showing the `` true - womanly '' side of the illustrious head of the
Ecole Marches !	ORGANIZATION

		.

		The glimpses of everyday life , with its early struggles against poverty , its thwarted aims , its griefs in the loss of beloved children , its simple fireside pleasures , and its domestic companionship , are as well worth noting as the more striking inci - dents .

		Thus the book has an interest for others beside musicians , and furnishes an excellent com - mentary on the words which
Madame Marchesi	ORGANIZATION	announces as her '' motto , '' '' Faith , Labor , and Perseverence . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Volume XI .

		of '' Book Prices Current , '' published in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	, covers the auction sales of the year ending last
November	DATE	.

		The volume is larger than its predecessors , being augmented by exten - sive indexes , as well as by the catalogue notes demanded by the unusual number of scarce and valuable books -LRB- especially in the
Ashburnham	LOCATION	collection -RRB- sold during the year .

		The number of lots catalogued is 37,358 , and the amount realized was 100,259 , a far higher average price than is recorded for any previous year of the pub - lication .

		Mr.
J. H. Slater	PERSON	is the compiler of the work , and gives us the comforting assurance that in book - buying `` just at present there is no great mania to en - large upon . ''

		That noteworthy series of monographs issued under the name of '' The Portfolio '' has long occupied a unique and enviable position among art periodicals .

		In the literary excellence of its text , and the beauty of its illustrations and mechanical make-up , it is unsurpassed .

		The latest issue is an interesting and scholarly essay on
Peter Paul Rubens	PERSON	, by Mr.
R. A. M. Stevenson	PERSON	, author of the monograph on
Velazquez	PERSON	, previously published in the same series .

		The illustrations accom - panying Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's text consist of two finely - executed photogravures and thirty-two plates printed in sepia and black and white . ''

		The Portfolio '' is published in this country by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A volume on `` Astronomy '' is contributed to the '' Con - cise Knowledge Library '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- by the collabora - tion of Miss
Agnes M. Clerke	PERSON	with Mr.
A. Fowler	PERSON	and Mr.
J. El	PERSON	lard Gore .

		There are nearly six hundred pages , illustrated , in this `` popular synopsis of astro - nomical knowledge to date , '' and the text is unusually readable .

		In this connection we may also mention `` A New Astronomy for Beginners '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a high school text-book by Professor
David P. Todd	PERSON	.

		The author has had the laboratory -LRB- not the observatory -RRB- constantly in mind during the preparation of this book , and emphasizes throughout the physical aspects of the science .

		Encouraged , probably , by the success of their excel - lent '' Illustrated English Library , '' Messrs.
G. P. Put	PERSON	- nam 's Sons have begun the publication of a new series on somewhat similar lines , which they inaugurate with
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's '' Lavengro . ''

		The type used in this '' New Library , '' as it is called , is handsome and read - able , the paper of a good quality , the presswork well done , and the binding , although somewhat inartistic , is stout and durable .

		These strong points , combined with the popular price of one dollar per volume , should make the series a success .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		The '' History of the Indian Mutiny , '' by Mr.
T. Rice Holmes	PERSON	, first published in
1883	DATE	, is now issued by the
Macmillan Co	ORGANIZATION	, in a new -LRB- fifth -RRB- edition , thoroughly re - vised , and extended to a thick volume of nearly seven hundred pages .

		Tnrgot 's '' Reflections on the Formation and the Dis - tribution of Riches , '' translated and edited -LRB- we presume -RRB- by Professor
Ashley	PERSON	, is published as an '' Economic Classic '' by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The original of this work is dated
1770	DATE	. ''

		The Diplomatic Relations between
Cromwell	PERSON	and
Charles X. Gnstavus	PERSON	of
Sweden	LOCATION	'' is the title of a doctoral dissertation offered at
Heidelberg	LOCATION	by Mr.
Guernsey Jones	PERSON	, and now published in pamphlet form by the
State Journal Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Nebraska	LOCATION	.

		The
Christian Literature Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of an American edition -LRB- two volumes in one -RRB- of Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	's translation of the twelve classical Upan - ishads , hitherto known as forming a part of the series called '' Sacred Books of the East . '' ''

		The Bible References of
John Ruskin	PERSON	, '' compiled by
Misses Mary	ORGANIZATION	and
Ellen Gibbs	PERSON	, is a recent publication of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work has been done with both intelligence and conscience , and the book is one that both Ruskinians and Bible students will find useful .

		Mr.
Henry Sweet	PERSON	's `` First Steps in Anglo-Saxon , '' published by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, is an even more elementary book than the '' Anglo-Saxon Primer '' of the same author .

		An extremely simplified grammar , some forty pages of text for reading , and as many pages of notes , make up the contents of this little book . ''

		The Artist , '' one of the best of English art period - icals , has recently extended its material and scope , and now appears in greatly enlarged form .

		The
March	DATE	issue contains a number of interesting articles , all of which are profusely illustrated .

		Messrs.
Archibald Constable & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	are the publishers of '' The Artist . ''

		We have already spoken of the first two sections of the bibliography of '' Elizabethan Translations from the Italian '' prepared by Miss
Mary Augusta Scott	PERSON	, and published by the
Modern Language Association of Amer	ORGANIZATION	- ica .

		A third section of this work , including 111 titles of '' miscellaneous translations , '' has just been issued , leaving but one more to appear .

		The
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	memorial park is in danger .

		Of the
$ 35,000	MONEY	needed for the purchase of the
Elmwood	LOCATION	estate only about two-thirds has thus far been subscribed .

		The time of purchase has been extended to
May 1	DATE	, but if the fund is not made up by that date , the trustees will be forced to cut up the land into building lots , and the opportunity to secure Elmwood for public purposes will have been lost .

		The '' Christmas Books , '' in one thick volume , and '' The Old Curiosity Shop , '' in two of less generous dimensions , are now added to the '' Gadshill '' edition of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, and imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		From the same im - porters we also have Volumes III .

		and IV .

		of ''
Fred	PERSON	- erick the Great , '' in the dignified '' Centenary '' edition of the works of
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	.


James Payn	PERSON	, born in
1830	DATE	, died a few days ago .

		He has been for half a century an unwearying literary worker , producing novels , essays , and miscellaneous journalism , in great profusion ; and will be remembered not for any one distinctive achievement , but rather for 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, the varied entertainment that he has provided for two generations of readers .

		A genial temperament , much knowledge and industry , an agile fancy , and a wide ac - quaintance with men and affairs , all combined to make his work acceptable without bestowing upon it the least measure of enduring quality .

		He will be missed and mourned by a host of readers in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The '' Temple '' edition of the Waverley novels , im - ported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , is well under way , thirteen of the forty-eight volumes being now ready .

		In addition to the two volumes of '' Waverley , '' pub - lished some time ago , we have lately received ''
Guy Mannering	PERSON	, '' '' The Antiquary , '' ''
Rob Roy	PERSON	, '' '' Old Mor - tality , '' and '' The Heart of
Midlothian	LOCATION	, '' each in two volumes ; and `` The Black Dwarf , '' in one volume .

		It would certainly be difficult to say wherein this dainty little edition could be improved .

CHRIS TOPELIUS	PERSON	.

		The death of Zachris Topelius , on the thir - teenth of last month , having been passed over in comparative silence by the American press , it appears fitting that we should make some statement , although a little belated , of the sig - nificance of his work , and attempt some sort of summary of his great literary activities .

		The impression seems to be current that , because
Topelius	PERSON	was a Finn , he must have been a light of Finnish literature , and that his work was done in the dialect of the '' Kalevala . ''

		This , of course , is not the case , for , although a mas - ter of his native tongue , and an authority upon the history of
Finland	LOCATION	, he had the wisdom to realize , no less than his great contemporary
Rnneberg	PERSON	, that as the political fortunes of his country had for so long been merged with those of
Sweden	LOCATION	, so the best service he could give to his race would be to cement still closer its spir - itual bond with
Sweden	LOCATION	, the greatest honor he could do his country would be to increase the share of its contribution to the only literature through which Finnish ideals and aspirations might hope to flow into the current of European culture .

		Hence , although '' torn like a bloody shield from the heart of
Sweden	LOCATION	, ''
Finland	LOCATION	has been brought , since the Russian domination , closer in spirit to its old time suzerain than ever before , and it thus comes about that the names of two nineteenth-century Finns are to be reckoned among the greatest in Swedish letters .

		Topelius was born
January 14 , 1818	DATE	, and was educated at
the University of Helsingfors	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1842	DATE	he became editor of the Helsingfors '' Tidningar , '' retaining the connection until
1860	DATE	, and giving to the public through the medium of this newspaper his earlier poems and novels .

		Meanwhile -LRB- 1854 -RRB- , he was called to a chair in his alma mater , where he per - formed the function of a professor of history for nearly a quarter of a century .

		In
1878	DATE	, at the age of sixty , he resigned from the Univer - sity , that he might devote himself exclusively to literary composition , and now , at the ripe age of eighty , he has passed away , after having enriched Swedish literature with a memorable series of works in prose and verse .

		These works are so numerous that we may 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, no more than mention the greater number of them , and that chiefly for the purpose of indi - cating the wide range of the author 's interests and attainments .

		There are the three volumes of poems called '' Ljungblommor '' -LRB-
Heather Blossoms	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , besides two later collections of verse .

		He wrote profusely for the stage , his chief plays being ''
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's Forsta Karlek '' -LRB-
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's First Love -RRB- , '' Ett Skargaardsafventyr '' -LRB- A Tale of the Islands -RRB- , `` Efter Femtio Aar '' -LRB- Fifty Years After -RRB- , `` Regina af Emmerits , '' and '' Princessan af Cypern '' -LRB- The Princess of Cy - prus -RRB- , the last-named work being a fairy-drama , borrowed from the `` Kalevala , '' and written for the inauguration of the national theatre at
Helsingfors	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a writer for children he pro- duced many volumes of '' Sagor '' -LRB- Legendary Tales -RRB- and u Lasning for Barn '' -LRB- Reading for the Young -RRB- .

		His ''
Naturens Bok	PERSON	'' -LRB- The Book of Nature -RRB- has been widely useful in the Swed - ish and Finnish schools .

		His works of serious scholarship include a history of the war in Fin - land , and several books devoted to the descrip - tion of his native country .

		Such a series of books as has above been catalogued would secure a commanding posi - tion for any worker in the field of letters .

		But the most important work of Topelius remains to be mentioned .

		It is the cycle of historical romances entitled '' Faltskarns Berattelser '' -LRB- The Surgeon 's Stories -RRB- that has extended the fame of their author far beyond the bounds of
Finland	LOCATION	and the Scandinavian peninsula , that has , in short , won for him his place in the noble company of great historical novelists that be - gins with
Scott	PERSON	, and ends -LRB- for the present -RRB- with Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	.

		In addition to this great series of tales , Topelius produced a second series , entitled `` Vinterqvaller '' -LRB- Winter Even - ings -RRB- , somewhat less coherent than the former , but having to a considerable extent the same general characteristics . ''

		The Surgeon 's Stories '' form a cycle of bril - liant and vivid episodes from the great period of
Sweden	LOCATION	's history the period of
Grustaf Adolf	ORGANIZATION	and
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		and from the period of her decline during the eighteenth century .

		There are fifteen of them altogether , linked together externally by the personality of the surgeon who narrates them to a group of friends , and internally , not only by the historical se - quence of events , but also by a device which is the invention of the author .

		Alongside with the history of the kings who figure conspicu - ously in the narrative , there is traced for us the history of two families , one of the people and one of the nobility , and of these families some members figure prominently in each tale .

		As the descent of the royal line is traced from one generation to another , the descent of these families is in like manner traced from father to son through the entire series .

		Thus we have all three elements of Swedish society , the king , the nobility , and the people , represented in members of these families throughout the nar - rative .

		And there is still another bond of union in the shape of a ring which is closely connected with the fortunes of the principal characters in these romances .

		So ingeniously is this made to figure in the narrative , that the somewhat questionable device of introducing such an ele - ment of enchantment or superstition may be pardoned , especially as such a device finds hon - orable precedents in romantic literature .

		For this ring has the power of bringing to its owner good-fortune as long as it shall remain in his possession , and he shall not forfeit claim to its protection by perjuring himself .

		And this ring , unlike that famous ring of the Niblungs which brought only a curse to its possessor , is also un - like it in being a thing of no value in itself , a mere bit of copper with a symbolical inscription .

		The standard English translation of this romantic cycle occupies six volumes , of which the first three bring us down to the death of
Charles XII.	PERSON	, that turning-point in Swedish history , while the three remaining volumes carry the narrative on to the closing years of the eighteenth century .

		In the first half of the work we have , then , such episodes as the Battle of Liitzen , the wars with
Poland	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	, a remarkable study of the witch - craft superstition in
Finland	LOCATION	, the Finnish fam - ine of
1697	DATE	, the revolution in land tenure known as the Great Reduction , the plague of
1710	DATE	, the

		with its fatal outcome .

		In the second and less stirring half of the work we have depicted for us the gradual recupera - tion of
Sweden	LOCATION	after the
Peace of Nystad	ORGANIZATION	, the political intrigues of the Hat and Cap parties , the injurious commercial policy of the
King	PERSON	- dom , the academic life of the period , the char - acter and work of the great
Linnaeus	PERSON	, and the vagaries of the Swedish alchemists .

		Topelius does not belong to the archasolog - ical school of historical novelists , and there is no trace of pedantry in his work .

		We do not mean by this that he is open to the charge of perverting historical material or even to that of any very considerable inaccuracy , but merely that he does not allow his imagination to be
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 fettered by a too close adherence to historical details , that he claims for invention the right of full sway in matters which do not concern the essential features of the epoch or the situa - tion to be portrayed .

		In one of the interludes which occur between the tales , the author , speak - ing in the person of the Surgeon , but evidently for himself , thus defends his method : '' I will not dictate anyone 's belief , nor do I deny that all the names and details which I mention will be looked for in vain in the chronicles .

		For my idea about story - telling is that its truth consists in its possibility of being true ; by its agreeing with the essential characteristics of what is to be described .

		I will even go so far as to say , that in this way the reality may sometimes be more clearly shown than by a mere record of events .

		I can , for instance , picture
Napoleon	PERSON	eating a sandwich posito , that I have really seen him eating a sandwich ; can I , therefore , say that I have given a good picture of Napoleon ?

		But suppose I invent about him some great exploit which never really happened , but which is entirely like him ; or that I put in bis mouth some strong word which he never uttered , but which corresponds to a hair with his actual temperament is not that which I have imagined more essentially real than the small sandwich which is real only by chance ? ''

		Topelius has been for many years a teacher of history , and every teacher of history whom ped - antry has not entirely dessicated knows how supremely important to the student is the ac - quisition of those broad general views of past times and events which alone can give meaning to the details , and how valuable an auxiliary he may find in those romances wherein writers of genius have been pleased to interpret and inform with a new vitality scenes and charac - ters typical of past momentous epochs in the history of mankind .

		The beauty of style in these books is at times very marked , and does not always disappear in the translation .

		The following passage , de - scriptive of the last moments of one of the nob - lest among the noble race of the Bertelskjolds , may be quoted by way of illustration . ''

		His beautiful head , surrounded by its once black locks now silvered by time , was still the slumbering wit - ness of a soul noble and sensitive , proud , brave , and heroic .

		He slept , as a past time slumbers in the sunshine of the new . ''

		The sun which now shown into
Abo Castle	ORGANIZATION	was the
evening	TIME	sun of the grand and eventful seventeenth cen - tury , alike gigantic in the spiritual and material world .

		Its night was felt to be near , when , after the setting of the star of
Charles XL	PERSON	, two new and far more powerful and brilliant stars , one in the west , the other in the east , appeared above the horizon .

		The blue rim which Ber - telskjold in vain sought in the icy sea , had now widened into a glittering fjord , where the waves played free ; and now it was
spring	DATE	everywhere in the spiritual realms , and the ice of superstition commenced to melt , and the eternally swelling billows of human thought freely began to seek the infinite beyond the shores of time . ''

		Let us pause here , at the first view of
spring	DATE	.

		The disappearing snow must always remember that it melts before the sun of heaven ; the springing verdure must never forget that the snow-drifts protected its roots from the wintry frosts .

		May the old go out , may the new come in , with love ! ''

		And so ends our story , one evening in
spring	DATE	.

		And God knows when the berries will ripen in the woods . ''

		With these solemn and pathetic words we leave the old century for the new , and are prepared for the brief but brilliant career of
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		Here we undoubtedly have the climax of the entire work ; but it is the fault of history rather than of Topelius that the interest of his story must decline with the death of that great sol - dier .

		Yet the chronicle goes on to the time of the Napoleonic wars , and we would not willingly miss the volumes that cover the eighteenth cen - tury .

		We might indeed wish that the narrative had not ended here , but
Topelius	PERSON	did not have the heart to write of the transformation of his own country into a part of the Russian Empire .

		For he always wrote , although in the Swedish language , as a
Finn	PERSON	, and it is as such that he penned these proud and loving words : '' And the Baltic stretches its mighty blue arms east and north , and folds in its tumultuous embrace a daugh - ter of the sea , a land of the waves which had sprung up from its bosom , and , still increasing , lifts her solid rocks high above her mother 's heart .


Finland	LOCATION	is the best be - loved child of the Baltic .

		To this day she empties her treasures into her mother 's lap ; and the mighty sea la not uplifted by the offering , but draws lovingly and ten - derly back , like an indulgent mother , that the daughter may grow , and every
summer	DATE	clothe with grass and flow - ers new shores laid open to the day .

		Happy the land which lulls in its bosom the waves of a thousand lakes , and stretches a shore of nine hundred miles toward the sea ! ''

		TOLSTOI ON ART AND BEAUTY .

		Will Count
Tolstoi	PERSON	, the great Russian novelist and moralist , revolutionize current conceptions of art ?

		He firmly believes that he is bound and able to effect such a revolution , and he is engaged on a philosophical work dealing with the origin , function , and social mission of art .

		One chapter of this work has been published in a Russian magazine called '' Questions of Psychology and Philosophy , '' and the ideas there expressed have attracted considerable attention in the Russian and French press .

		It ap - pears to me that
Tolstoi	PERSON	has really advanced an important , if not original , suggestion , though bis sweeping generalizations can not be accepted without material qualifications .

		What Tolstoi objects to most strenuously is the assumption of writers on art that there is a close and vital connection between art and beauty , and that the object of art is to gratify the aesthetic needs .

		Is there , 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, he asks , an objective definition of beauty ?

		Has ever a test been formulated which would enable us to draw a distinct line between subjects properly com - ing within the scope and jurisdiction of art , and sub - jects unfit for artistic treatment ?

		Answering these questions in the negative ,
Tolstoi	PERSON	imagines that he has proved the necessity of rejecting absolutely the notion that art ministers to pleasure .

		He denounces this notion as vicious and injurious , and he holds it directly responsible for the decadent tendencies in the various branches of art .

		Indeed , so convinced is he of the soundness and value of his own new theory that he regrets that his great novels were written under the tacit acceptance of the prevailing view . ''

		I should have produced very different works , '' he virtually says , '' had I made my discov - ery at the opening of my career as an imaginative writer . ''

		And what , in brief , is his revolutionary theory ?

		This : That art is one of the necessary conditions of social existence , an essential means of intercourse between man and man ; that all art activity is founded on the psychological fact that a man who assimilates an expression of emotion by a fellow - man is made to undergo the same psychological ex - perience as that of the other man .

		The origin and beginning of art ,
Tolstoi	PERSON	proceeds , may be referred to the moment when man , conceiving the purpose of imparting to others feelings experienced by himself , first reproduces these feelings in himself , and then , by means of signs and symbols , manifests them so as to affect others .

		Where feeling is imparted , and the object is this conveyance , we have art .

		The means are found in movements , lines , colors , sounds , images , and words ; but in every case the purpose is to excite before-experienced feelings and emotions .

		All emotions , the strong as well as the faint , the noble as well as the mean , the significant as well as the trivial , constitute the subject matter of art .

		Take the feeling of self-abnegation and resignation to the decree of fate produced by the drama ; or take the ardent joy and ecstasy of love depicted in romance ; or the enjoyment of nature excited by a painting ; or the inspiration and courage conveyed by martial and triumphal music ; or the infectious gayety of the dance ; or the grati - fication of the sense of humor by an anecdote ; or , finally , the sense of peace and serenity excited by a quiet evening scene what is there essentially in common in these various manifestations of art ?

		The answer is , the reproduction and conveyance of feel - ing .

		And what is the object of such reproduction and conveyance ?

		The promotion of mutual under - standing and sympathy by means of artistic forms of expression .

		Human intercourse would be crude and inadequate if we were confined to the ordinary means ; to convey the more intimate and delicate emotions art is needed music , poetry , painting , sculpture , movement , the drama .

		Instead of orig - inating in the '' play impulse , '' as some scientists teach , instead of affording a channel for the expend - iture of excessive vitality , art originates in the need of perfect intercourse ; hence its transcendent im - portance in man 's intellectual and moral life .

		Since
Tolstoi	PERSON	claims absolute precision for his formula , it may be pointed out that what we know of the methods and ways of artists does not tend to support the reiterated assertion that in every case the purpose of the artist is to reproduce in himself and convey `` before - experienced '' emotions .

		It may be admitted , in a general sense , that when Beet - hoven composed his Pastoral symphony he repro - duced emotions he had actually experienced in the country .

		But take such a work as
Richard Straus	PERSON	's '' Thus Spake Zarathustra . ''

		Can it be maintained that while reading
Nietzsche	PERSON	's strange masterpiece he felt the musical forms in which he embodied , subsequently , the abstract ideas of man 's struggles , changes , and search for the meaning of life ?

		The truth is that
Strauss	PERSON	tried very hard to find musical equivalents to those abstract ideas .

		Whether he was entirely successful or not , his symphonic poem can - not be excluded from any proper definition of art .

		If we refuse to exclude it , we must qualify the Tol - stoi definition .

		This , however , is only in passing .

		The real question arising in one 's mind is what reason
Tolstoi	PERSON	has given for banishing the ideas of beauty and pleasure from his philosophy of art ?

		Granting that he has laid stress on a point of cardi - nal importance , not perhaps sufficiently considered before , though dimly perceived by all thinkers , what necessary antagonism is there between the con - ception that art is a '' condition of social existence '' and an '' important means of intercourse , '' and the conception that art aims to reproduce or represent beauty ?

		That art yields pleasure ,
Tolstoi	PERSON	does not deny ; he merely insists that the pleasure is inci - dental , just as the pleasure from the absorption of food is incidental to the deeper object of sustaining life .

		But
Tolstoi	PERSON	's principle leaves us without a guide so far as the choice of subjects for artistic treatment is concerned .

		Art , as he says , may con - vey low and ignoble emotions as well as noble and high ones ; but what emotions ought the artist to convey ?

		Here , clearly , the old quarrel between the literary realists and romanticists presents itself in a wider aspect .

		The artist has many experiences ; which among them shall he select for reproduction and conveyance ?

		Is not the real answer , which
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	could not escape if pressed , that he is bound to select the finest and most exalted ?

		In other words , is he not to select that which embodies phy - sical , intellectual , or moral beauty ?

		Such an answer would reconcile the
Tolstoi	PERSON	view with that he vehemently combats .

		Indeed , in rightly saying that without art the most intimate and deli - cate emotions could not be expressed at all , does he not imply that the object and value of art lie in refining and elevating human nature by convey - ing the most exalted feelings of which the most sensitive and receptive of us , the artists , are capa - ble ?

		On
Tolstoi	PERSON	's own definition the highest art is necessarily the most beautiful , the truest , the pro- foundest .

		Why , then , is it false and degrading to
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 say that the object of art is to promote the appre - ciation of beauty as a means of spiritual culture and social improvement ?

		Tolstoi abhors the principle of art for art 's sake , but he is wrong in thinking that this principle owes its recognition to the identification of art with beauty .

		It is natural for
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	to contend for the social mission of art , but the utter repudiation of beauty is neither demanded by his own theory of the origin of art nor calculated to strengthen the tendency toward constituting art a handmaid of moral progress , the tendency which
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	would encourage .

		It is interesting to find that even in the Russian press
Tolstoi	PERSON	's philosophy of art has not been sympathetically received .

		It is doubtful whether his complete work will have the effect he hopes for and intends .

		VICTOB ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
April 4 , 1898	DATE	.

		I am afraid the season has proved not a very profitable one for publishers .

		It is , of course , too early to make any final statement ; bat all signs , so far , point to an extremely dull time , and complaints are being murmured of the bad trade .

		As a matter of fact , with the excep - tions of a few novels and
Bodley	PERSON	's '' History of
France	LOCATION	, '' hardly any book has made the slightest stir .

		Of the novels , the most marked attention has been paid to Mr.
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	, for his '' Dreamers of the Ghetto . ''

		The impress of the sixpenny illustrated magazine is on everything .

		Whatever falling off there is in the business of the publishing world may be safely put down to that counter-influence .

		Nowadays , people get in the illustrated magazine all they apparently want in the way of reading ; and they get it tastefully served , and in piquant , small courses ; so that , in addition to the excellent material , there is the charm of variety , and also the advantage of cheapness .

		Messrs.
Newnes	PERSON	and
Messrs. Pearson	PERSON	, and particularly the former , are reap - ing a great harvest of profit .

		Messrs.
Newnes	PERSON	have just brought out another '' monthly '' The Wide World Magazine '' and this again promises to `` catch on '' ; and now we hear brave rumors of another illustrated magazine , this time at threepence .

		The
Harmsworth Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		intend to make this threepenny venture a '' perfect mar - vel '' for the money ; at any rate , that is what we hear .

		Certainly , if anybody can do it , this house can .

		Maga - zines are on everybody 's lips , and another again is on the stocks , in the shape of a great illustrated literary monthly , at one shilling .

		Whether or no anything will come of it remains to be seen .

		Literary magazines , in this country , seem fated for failure .

		Among the really fine books that we are to have will be a glorious edition of the works of Shakespeare ; I do not mean a great , cumbersome , annotated one , filled with antiquarian lore and the grubbings of British Museum work , I mean an edition which , for type and '' get-up , '' from the point of view of the art of the printer , will , without doubt , prove to be the most beautifully printed book of the century .

		It is intended to issue it in fifty parts .

		At present , I can only tell you that the famous Constable firm of printers will be responsible for its appearance , and Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	, who promises to become a rather important influence in the publishing world , is to introduce it to all who love
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and to all who love beautiful books .

		The same printing press is busy with an edition of
Butler	PERSON	's '' Lives of the Saints , '' which is announced by Messrs.
Gerald Duck	PERSON	- worth
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
George Bell & Sons	ORGANIZATION	are getting ready a large and fully illustrated work on
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	; but the edition is to be limited to three hundred and fifty copies , of which Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	will have one hundred for
America	LOCATION	.

		They have also another volume by Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	'' in preparation . ''

		This is to be a series of lectures on the subject of '' Form and Line in Art . ''

		Charmingly printed editions , by the Chis wick Press , of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's '' Sonnets from the Portuguese , '' and
Long	PERSON	's translation of the `` Medita - tions '' of
Marcus Antoninus	PERSON	, will also be issued ; but of these works you will have opportunity to judge in
America	LOCATION	, since you are to have editions .

		Talking of editions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, I hear that
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have commissioned one of our younger Professors of Literature Dr.
Herf	PERSON	ord to undertake a new annotated edition , one which shall take the place of the well-known ''
Cambridge Edition	ORGANIZATION	, '' of which they hold the publishing rights .

		Not that this venture is likely soon to be completed .

		At any rate , the volumes will doubtless form , from time to time , a distinguishing feature in Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	's announcements .

		Towards the autumn , Messrs.
C. A. Pearson	PERSON	will issue the following novels , which have not as yet been announced here : '' The Adventures of Captain Kettle , '' by Mr.
C. J. Cntcliffe Hyne	PERSON	; `` The Phantom Army , '' by Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	; `` Under the Black Flag , '' by Mr.
William Coestall	PERSON	; `` Despair 's Last Journey , '' by Mr.
David Christie Murray	PERSON	; `` Settled Out of Court , '' by Mr.
G. B. Burgin	PERSON	; `` Brothers of the People , '' by Mr.
Fred Whishaw	PERSON	; `` The Seed of the Poppy , '' by Mr.
Clive Holland	PERSON	; and a new novel , the title of which has not yet been fixed , by Mrs.
L. B. Walford	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	will also issue his new volume of stories through the same firm .

		An important series of illustrated histories and guides to our public schools is being prepared , and will be issued by
Messrs. George Bell & Sons	ORGANIZATION	.

		The series is to begin with volumes on
Eton	ORGANIZATION	,
Harrow	LOCATION	,
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	, and , I be - lieve , Rugby and
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	.

		The scheme is an excel - lent one , if only for the reason that no such short and handy works are to be had .

		Let it not be said to our shame that such a man failed to secure a sufficient hold upon the popular mind to make possible so inexpensive and yet so appropriate a monument as the proposed park would form .

		THE VOTE BY STATES ON THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table	ORGANIZATION	, in the very first of those merry caprices with which he adorned the first volumes of `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' says : `` All generous minds have a horror of what are called facts .

		They are the brute beasts of the intellectual domain . ''

		To be sure , a little later he warns the reader to '' con - dition '' and '' qualify '' this remark with a certain amount of '' seasoning '' before making it one of the axioms of practical life .

		We are all of us aware of some minds so '' generous '' -LRB- we use the Autocrat 's euphemism -RRB- that they use none of the suggested seasoning : at least they keep a respectful distance from fact , with due horror of too close an approach .

		But , as he said , '' Logic is logic : that 's all I say , '' so we may urge History is history : when it gets away from fact it is not history .

		It may be well to correct small errors .

		Reviewing lately the ever-interesting story of the adoption of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, I was led , by discrepancies between some of the ordinary books that relate the actions of the several state conventions , to look into ''
Elliott	PERSON	's Debates , '' constantly cited as our chief authority .

		Turning to the vote in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, I find recorded the entire list of voters , man by man , the names of the towns which they represented being given , all arranged by counties , with the footing of each county by itself , and the final footing Yeas 187 , Nays 168 .

		This is the footing given in most historical works ; it is so given as the result in
Fiske	PERSON	's '' Critical Period , ''
Larned	PERSON	's `` History for Ready Reference , '' Harpers ' '' Book of Facts , ''
Schouler	PERSON	's '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' and other books of like excellence .


Hart	PERSON	's '' Formation of the Union '' says 187 to 167 . ''

		Mr.
George T. Curtis	PERSON	, in
Winsor	LOCATION	's '' Narrative and Critical History , '' says the majority was nineteen .

		Now , if one will add the footings for the several counties as given in
Elliott	LOCATION	, he will be surprised to find Yeas 202 , Nays 155 ; a majority of forty-seven .

		But testing the county footings , he finds Essex put down as 38 yeas , 6 nays ; yet a careful count shows it should have been 37 yeas , 7 nays .

		The next county ,
Middlesex	LOCATION	, is footed 17 yeas , 25 nays : it should have been 18 yeas , 24 nays .

		These two errors balance each other .

		The next ,
Hampshire	LOCATION	, is put down as 33 yeas , 19 nays : it should have been 19 yeas , 32 nays , a double error .

		The rest of the counties are footed correctly .

		The final result when these errors are corrected is Yeas 186 , Nays 168 : a majority of eighteen ; not of nineteen , as most have it , nor of twenty , as Professor
Hart	PERSON	has it .

		He has the total vote correct , 354 , which I verified by repeated countings of the names .

		Some writers give the vote of

		A test vote before the final one gave 31 yeas , 29 nays , sixty members voting ; but on the final vote of fifty-seven members the yeas were 30 , nays 27 .

		If the president had voted as he did on the previous day there wouhi have been 28 nays ; but one of each side was ab - sent , and the president did not vote .

		The vote of
Virginia	LOCATION	is also generally misstated , as Yeas 89 , Nays 79 .

		Elliott gives this vote by a list of the voters in the affirmative first , wherein we find
James Madison	PERSON	and
John Marshall	PERSON	, the two who really carried the convention with them by fact and argument .

		Then is given the list of negative voters , where we find noted names , as

John Tyler	PERSON	, and
Edmund Ruffin	PERSON	the latter name made notorious by the man who bore it in

		The clerk gave no numbers at the foot of the lists ; but in the table of contents the vote is stated as usually given , 89 to 79 .

		A glance at the list of noes lets the reader see that these columns are of equal length , which can not make 79 ; each column has twenty-six names , making 78 .

		Eleven majority , not ten , was given in the
Virginia	LOCATION	convention for the formation of the

		While hunting in ''

John Quincy Adams	PERSON	was elected presi - dent by the

		The reason was that the vote was by ballot , and the ballots did not show who cast them .

		Shall I seem invidious if I ask for space to call atten - tion to a defect in a very excellent text-book which I have had the pleasure of examining lately : Dr.
Mead	PERSON	's edition of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	's '' Morte Darthur '' ?

		In the Introduction , the fifteenth century literature of
Scotland	LOCATION	is too slightly mentioned to give a correct idea of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	's position among writers nearly of his time .

		The literary efflorescence at the court of James the Fourth may have had little , if any , effect on other places , but is of real interest in itself ; and a suitable edition of the earlier `` King 's Quair '' would find for that delicious poem the audience of all men who pre - tend to be well-read in English literature .

		A scholar of to-day might like to accost the ghost of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	with the remark : '' Sir , in the fifteenth century the lit - erary centre of
Great Britain	LOCATION	was not in
England	LOCATION	but in
Scotland	LOCATION	. ''

		No doubt the retort would be prompt and vigorous , after the manner of one who tossed and gored .

		THE DIAL 253 A GREAT ROMAS - PRELATE .

		* Mr.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	, when he writes a biog - raphy , is sure of readers .

		His life of his father is a masterpiece .

		It is given to few sons so to paint a father 's portrait that it shall be at once attractive and convincing .

		To be sure ,
William George Ward	PERSON	was a rare personality , suggest - ive of vigorous handling .

		Cardinal
Wiseman	PERSON	was hardly a less remark - able subject for Mr.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	's treatment .

		The biographer 's knowledge of him is naturally less direct and immediate , such as a boy could have of a frequent visitor at his father 's house , who was fond of talking with children .

		The first English cardinal since the days of Pole was likely to make a mark on a boy 's lively imagination .

		The traditional memories would long remain of one who looked and lived the part of a great churchman , and was '' abund - antly endowed with those specially human qual - ities '' which give life-blood to character .

		The grandfather of
Nicholas Wiseman	PERSON	mi - grated from
Ireland	LOCATION	to
Spain	LOCATION	late in the eigh - teenth century .

		His son , a Spanish merchant , married , as his second wife , an Irish lady .

		On
August 2 , 1802	DATE	, the day before
Napoleon	PERSON	's con - sulate for life began , her child was born at
Seville	LOCATION	.

		She laid the infant upon the Cathedral altar , and devoted him to the service of the Church . ''

		The first stratum of his mind was deeply tinged by the soil on which he was born . ''

		There was a hidalgo reserve and grandiosity about him always , in spite of his genial temper .

		The sight of the prize crews ashore at
Cadiz	LOCATION	after
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	may have stirred the young
Spaniard	ORGANIZATION	's modicum of British blood , and pre - pared him for his return , at three years old , to
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		He was presently put to school , to acquire , with or without a local brogue , the English tongue .

		Five years later he was trans - ferred to a Roman Catholic college near Dur - ham .

		It had been an offshoot of Douay .

		As the school of a proscribed class it developed vigor and intensity in its pupils .

		It checked speculation .

		It curbed the restive genius of the young Southerner , half Iberian and half Celt , and cooled without chilling his fervid blood .

		His religion helped to isolate him .

		A papist was under the ban in those days in Prot - estant
England	LOCATION	.

		The boy of ten or twelve was hooted for his creed , as he stood in

		This early experience of intolerance probably stiffened his fibre and made him instinctively more a papist than be - fore .

England	LOCATION	to

		There were alarming tales of brigands , illustrated by recent captures hanged in terrorem by the way .

		The cry of '' Ecco Roma '' rejoiced the weary trav - eller 's ears ; and at the door of the re-opened college the figure of the ancient porter , who stood '' all salutation , mumbling toothless wel - comes in as yet an almost unknown tongue , '' was a joyous vision .

		It was a season of awakening hope , after long years of disaster , for the adherents of the papacy .

		Pius the Seventh had returned from his exile .

		Napoleon was entombed alive at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		The storm had blown itself out , and kings , and pontiffs also , '' crept out to feel the sun . ''

		Let - ters and art began to revive , the art still some - what academic under
Canova	PERSON	and
Oberbeck	PERSON	and
Cornelius	PERSON	, but in the realm of the blind the one-eyed are kings .

		Hand in hand throughout
Europe	LOCATION	went the Romantic Movement in liter - ature and the Catholic Reaction in religion .

		It was a stimulating period .

		The young student at the English College was not wholly engaged with theology and philosophy , but found his recreation in music and Italian art and Roman antiquities and Oriental languages .

		His very walks about
Rome	LOCATION	were fruitful of inspiration and suggestion .

		Nor were they lacking in a spice of adventure , for banditti close to the great capital were not quite unheard of .

		To one familiar with the chill and severity of the Anglican service or the Roman service in
England	LOCATION	at that period , the splendor of Ro - man ceremonial was an impressive contrast .

		It affected the imagination of as stout Protestants 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, as Bunsen and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		The time had not come when a Roman Catholic lady , on attending a certain ritualistic church in
New York	LOCATION	, could tell her protestant friend that the service was beautiful , but she preferred the simplicity of her own , Roman , worship .

		The tropical nature of
Wiseman	PERSON	was profoundly moved by such splendors .

		With scrupulous minuteness of detail and loving tenderness of phrase he described the appearance of the aged Pope at the festival of
Corpus Christi	LOCATION	.

		The page is ablaze with color and ornament .

		It is the sketch of an artist and poet rather than of a priest or student .

		It is excessive in its enumeration of all that met the eye or struck the mind . ''

		A gift for particularization is as precious as a gift for generalization , '' said an able thinker ; and
Wiseman	PERSON	possessed the for - mer gift , even superabundantly .

		When the day came that he must leave these alluring ceremonials and all the kindred fascinations of
Rome	LOCATION	, when duty called him to take up his abode in a less exuberant climate and a paler civilization ,
Wiseman	PERSON	found the change a sac - rifice .

		He yearned toward the scenes of his youth ever after .

		Receiving his doctorate in divinity at the age of twenty-one , he was at twenty-five made Vice - Rector of his college .

		His life was now the life of the brilliant scholar , the student of Ori - ental literature .

		He describes quiet hours in the
Vatican Library	ORGANIZATION	, with Cardinal
Mai	PERSON	for his sole companion , in the great hall of Manu - scripts , glowing with
Zuccari	PERSON	's decorations .

		It is midsummer ; the very copyists are absent on their annual vacations . ''

		The half-closed shut - ters and drawn curtains impart a drowsy atmos - phere to the delicious coolness , while the broil - ing sun glares on the square without . ''

		Tourists familiar with Italian galleries in
August	DATE	may suspect a lack of ventilation as having to do with the drowsiness .

		Wiseman , however , had become essentially an Italian ; and ventilation is not an Italian necessity .

		At all events , the drowsiness did not infect his style or his mat - ter .

		His '' Horse Syriacse '' is still an authority , respectfully noticed by scholars like
Westcott	PERSON	and
Tregelles	ORGANIZATION	.

		His reputation widened , and Germans like
Niebuhr	PERSON	and Tholuck and Bunsen became his correspondents .

		He was presently made Professor of
Oriental Tongues	ORGANIZATION	in the
Roman University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He read widely books that he could not always commend to others .

		The early stages of Biblical criticism for a time dis - turbed his faith .

		He could confide his troubles to no one .

		The struggle went on for years , in which '' he fought his doubts and gathered strength . ''

		Absorbed in spiritual conflict , he found the grosser temptations of his youth pass - ing him by scatheless .

		From
1828	DATE	he was for twelve years Rector of his college .

		He became a noted preacher to the English sojourners at
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Master of half a dozen languages , he could preach freely in Italian , French , and English .

		In the gift of tongues he was second to Mezzofanti only , and had something to say in several languages , which the greater linguist had not .

		He was well read in the literature of
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He was a competent critic in art and music , an authority upon ritual , a collector of old china , and learned in stained glass .

		He ceased to be a cloistered student .

		He mingled more with men , and lived a richer and fuller life .

		With a constitutional shyness which he never quite shook off , and a demeanor that was '' very grave , even a little pompous , '' he was natural and unaffected , a favorite guest , a cordial host .

		A story told at this time across a Roman dinner-table suggests that , even in the patrimony of St.
Peter	PERSON	, life was a little primi - tive , not far removed from the civilization of an American frontier .

		An agent for a great estate in the country is about his work , when he feels a touch upon his shoulder .

		It proves that a native of the region is using him for a gun-rest ; presently there is a report , and the neighbor falls .

		The agent looks around for some expla - nation . ''

		That is nothing , '' says the slayer ; '' He was a bad fellow . ''

		The climate seemed unwholesome , and the agent withdrew without delay to
Rome	LOCATION	, like any `` tenderfoot '' to-day .

		It was in the year
1830	DATE	that
Wiseman	PERSON	began to think that a work lay before him in
England	LOCATION	.

		He dreamed of that fair land as no longer in schism but restored to its Catholic heritage .

		The vision haunted him .

		To realize it became the purpose of his life .

		For this he laid aside his scholarly preoccupations and became the man of affairs .

		The
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	was not yet above the horizon .

		Nine years later , an article of
Wiseman	PERSON	's on
Augustine	PERSON	and the Donatists pierced through a rift in
Newman	PERSON	's Anglican armor wherein he had trusted , and touched his very life .

		For him the cherished via Media was no longer possible .

		Between frank adherence to the Papacy and frank oppo - sition , between '' the Scylla of Yes and the Charybdis of No , '' there was no longer for him any footing .

		The article '' gave me a stomach - ache , '' he said .

		The attack grew chronic , and the patient never rallied .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 In
1840	DATE	Wiseman was elevated to the epis - copate , and set over
Oscott College	LOCATION	in
England	LOCATION	, '' not to educate a few boys , but to be the rallying-point of a yet silent but vast move - ment . ''

		He found much among his fellow Catholics which chilled and benumbed him , but in
Pugin	LOCATION	the architect he discovered one man after his own heart , who shared his fervid zeal and sympathized with his tropical luxuriance of speech .

		Pagin refused to admit that a truly devout soul could pray in a hideous building .

		The least piety would take him out of it .

		The architect 's taste was all for pointed Gothic , and the Bishop 's took more kindly to Roman Re - naissance ; but they could merge such differ - ences in their common enthusiasm for Catholic Symbolism .

		Each superabundantly loved cere - monial pomp and gorgeous vestments .

		Each held dramatic what others pronounced theatri - cal .

		Wiseman saw in splendid '' functions '' a reflection of the Church in its glory , going forth arrayed for conquest .

		To him they were all '' a perpetual feast of nectared sweets . ''

		There are those who can not finish the quotation , '' Where no crude surfeit reigns . ''

		There is somewhat too much in his delight in them .

		We are cloyed while he is unsatisfied .

		Perhaps we are not Celtic , nor Italian , nor Iberian .

		He was all three in one complex personality .

		When '' Tract No. 90 '' was issued , all En - gland was stirred .

		This , said onlooking Oscott , '' means business . ''

		Was it so , indeed , that priests could sign the thirty-nine articles , yet hold all the doctrine of Trent ?

		The Bishops were not of that opinion , nor were the mass of the laity ; only a few of the clergy were pre - pared to go so far .

		Those few were soon to go farther .

		They were already nearing the plunge .

		Their chief held his peace and meditated apart .

		But he could not resist the current .

		There are steep grades where there can be no midway pausing .

		He had adopted premises of which
Rome	LOCATION	was the logical conclusion .

		It was but a question of time .

		Wiseman chafed while
Newman	PERSON	ruminated .

		The Anglican doctor dreamed of Roman concessions , of the reunion of the Papacy and the Church of
England	LOCATION	upon equal terms .

		The Roman Bishop had no terms to offer but those of unconditional surrender .

		The Exclusive Church stood still and calmly waited .

		At last
Mahomet	PERSON	took his step towards the immovable mountain .

		Ward and
Newman	PERSON	'' went over . ''

		Keble and
Pusey	PERSON	, with less severity of logic , stopped on the brink .

		The
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	broke abruptly in the middle .

		It was a tragic history to those racked and rent seekers for authority in religion , but it had its comical episodes .

		Symbolism furnished one of them .

		Towards the close of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's long hesitation ,
Wiseman	PERSON	sent a former curate of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's , a Roman convert , to
Littlemore	LOCATION	, to note any signs of an approaching decision .

		He returned confident that the end was near .

		By what did he judge ?

		What had
Newman	PERSON	said ?

		Scarce a word ; but he had on gray trousers .

		To one who knew his exactness in clerical attire , it was enough .

		Plainly , he held himself no longer to be in orders .

		No wonder that
Wiseman	PERSON	doubted .

		But the trousers had a voice .

		They were prophetic , and soon the plunge was made .

		Naturally ,
Wiseman	PERSON	's sanguine imagination saw half
England	LOCATION	following close upon New - man 's heels .

		He was mistaken .

		Yet he was not without reason for his exultant mood .

		The English Church is stronger to-day than ever .

		Yet what the Roman Bishops especially valued has deeper root on English soil than at any previous period since the Reformation .

		The English Papist no longer suffers from legal or social disabilities .

		The day of Protestant intol - erance of all Catholic uses is at an end .

		The soundest pillar of Reformed doctrine is no longer alarmed at crosses on church gables , at flowers and candles , at a transfiguration or crucifixion on his chancel wall , at a Lord 's supper above the
Holy Table	ORGANIZATION	, at carven saints about the porch , at splendid glass or shining brass or embroidered altar-cloths .

		He may favor broth - erhoods and sisterhoods , he may read and talk of the Lives of the
Saints	ORGANIZATION	, without coming under the suspicion that rested upon
Bishop Butler	PERSON	.

		He may hear confessions , in his study or his chapel , from released convicts or guile - less spinsters , without causing a shudder to his brother clergy .

		He may even pray for the dead and no bishop rebuke his godly liberty .

		It may not be all that
Newman	PERSON	hoped or
Wiseman	PERSON	anticipated .

		It is far more than
Keble	LOCATION	and
Pusey	PERSON	at the outset of the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	could have looked for .

		The
Anglican Church	ORGANIZATION	has wonderfully revived , its life has deepened , its range broadened .

		The expansion has been not wholly Romeward .

		It has gone towards Ger - many also .

		It has turned back towards the day of undivided
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		It has reached for - ward towards the re-united Church of the Fu - ture .

		Above all , it has sweetened and mellowed .

		The hard distrusts , the narrow bigotries , the caitiff panics , are things past .

		If the Anglican Churchman to-day holds out a hand to the ven - 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, erable bishop who sits enthroned in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, he holds out a hand also to the venerable breth - ren who from dissenting pulpits and continental class-rooms are telling of Jesus Christ and throwing their light upon what His Church should be .

		In this large result , both
Newman	PERSON	and
Wiseman	PERSON	bore their part .

		In many re - spects they builded better than they knew .

		It is a worthier
Christendom	LOCATION	for their life and labor .

		Few Catholics to-day indulge their old - time contempt for the Protestant ; few
Puri	PERSON	- tans to-day shiver in dread of the Papist and the Jesuit .

		It were hard to find a churchman to-day who would regret to be too feeble to stick a knife into a dissenter , whether of the Roman or the Sandemanian variety .


Sydney Smith	PERSON	's jest , thanks largely to
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	's manly and sober earnest , has lost its point .

		Men of modern minds are able to conceive of the sur - vival of men of mediaeval minds , and ultra - montanes like Ward indulge a large hope that agnostics like Huxley may be saved by virtue of their '' invincible ignorance . ''

		The hearts of Christian people have been drawn together , and there is an increasing unity of the spirit that links
James Martineau	PERSON	at one end with
Leo XIII	PERSON	.

		at the other .

		No better evidence of its working need be sought than is to be found in this genial and just
Life of Cardinal Wiseman	ORGANIZATION	.

		It in no way resembles that other recent biog - raphy of a Prince of the Roman Church which might be entitled '' Working Specifications for the Construction of an
Ecclesiastical Machine	ORGANIZATION	, by an Expert . ''

		Wiseman had been ten years in
England	LOCATION	, had been advanced from
Bishop to Cardinal	ORGANIZATION	, when in a single moment it seemed as if his pacificatory work was undone and that the cry of '' No Popery '' was to ring out loud and harsh as ever .

		In a pastoral '' from the Flaminian Gate '' he had announced in a tone rashly ex - ultant the reestablishment in
England	LOCATION	of a Roman hierarchy .

		He was to be no longer Bishop in partibus , but
Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster	ORGANIZATION	, with all the land parcelled out into titular districts , beneath his sway .

		His irrepressible enthusiasm at such a step forward at once aroused suspicion .


John Bull	PERSON	went off into a characteristic panic .

		Was the Reform - ation clean forgot ?

		Was the land of
Latimer	PERSON	and
Ridley	PERSON	to be once more a papal heritage ?

		There was not the least ground for alarm .

		There was not one papist more for all the sound - ing titles of the hierarchy .

		The soil was par - celled out by lines as imaginary as the equator .

		But the popular mind was all agog .


Wiseman	PERSON	was at first amazed , then amused , then calmly determined .

		Whoever lost his head , it was not he .

		Boldly he confronted the mobs of gentle and simple that trembled with wrath and indig - nation .

		The religious press , with '' The Times '' and '' Punch '' to lead the fray , was furious .


Wiseman	PERSON	's biographer can heartily laugh at those clever cartoons which lost '' Punch '' henceforth the cooperation of
Richard Doyle	PERSON	.

		We suspect that the Cardinal himself enjoyed them .

		After all , it was not libellous to liken him to
Wolsey	LOCATION	, and it was not
Wiseman	PERSON	who suf - fered most at the caricaturist 's hands , but vacil - lating Lord
John Russell	PERSON	, depicted as a naughty boy who chalks '' No Popery '' on the Cardinal 's door and takes to his heels .

		The Cardinal did not take to his heels , and the tempest proved to be but a passing blow .

		A good many years have gone by since , and the
Papal Aggression	ORGANIZATION	is a forgotten bugbear .

		Not yet is the Spanish Inquisition domesticated under the shadow of the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Those who fostered the preposter - ous panic were not long proud of their work , and the act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	which recorded it was a dead letter from the outset .

		The Cardinal 's later years were embittered , not by any popular opposition , but by feuds and intrigues within his own ecclesiastical house - hold .

		With declining health and failing en - ergy , he found himself called upon to be a vain peacemaker , where rival ambitions came in sharp conflict .

		There is a good deal of human nature remaining in man even after ordination .

		Perhaps celibate man is peculiarly subject to strifes and contentions .

		The '' inevitable wo - man '' who may trouble the married priest is not more perilous than the conflicts of author - ity , the quest for power , that beset those whose church is their only spouse .


M. Fabre	PERSON	has a striking story in which the feminine element is quite absent , and clerical intrigue supplies , very sufficiently , interest to the plot .

		The Cardinal had to deal with two subordinates , men of intense will concentrated upon ecclesiastical affairs .

		His coadjutor , an ecclesiastical mar - tinet , an English Catholic of the old stock , be - came intolerable in his rigidity .

		He had as coadjutor the right of succession to the Arch - bishopric , and conscientiously assumed the duty of perpetual interference in
Wiseman	LOCATION	's lifetime .

		The situation became impossible .

		It grew to be a personal contest between Bishop
Errington	PERSON	, who was in immediate authority as coadjutor , and Dr.
Manning	PERSON	, who afterwards succeeded him .

		Wiseman was naturally by birth and train - ing a Roman Catholic , and took his church pecu -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 257 liarities easily .


Errington	PERSON	, who had belonged to a proscribed class in his youth , and
Mann	PERSON	- ing , who as a recent convert overemphasized his ultramontanism , could not pull together .

		At last
Errington	PERSON	, who had refused to resign , was withdrawn by the intervention of the Pope .

		Manning henceforward had the ascendancy .

		Wiseman , not in judgment and feeling , but in practical conduct , fell more under the control of the stronger , which was not always the wiser , will .

		The Roman organization perhaps gained .

		It is not clear that the Catholic spirit gained equally .

		One seems to discern the outcropping of occasional doubt in this regard in the mind of the biographer .

		When , on
February 15 , 1865	DATE	, after a quarter of a century of authority in
England	LOCATION	, Cardinal
Wiseman	PERSON	went to his rest , his contemporaries of all schools recognized that they had lost a great prelate and a large-hearted man .

		His last days were of protracted suffering , which he had borne with a sweet patience and submis - sion , sustained by undoubting faith .

		The strug - gles of his youth had been forgotten .

		There were no clouds obscuring his spiritual vision .

		He had toiled much , and his work had been crowned with success .

		He had written much ; if it had no permanent quality , yet it had served its purpose well .

		He had been a man of learn - ing , of letters , of affairs .

		Natural as a child , he had been a lover of children , and they re - paid his love in full measure .

		They could not be persuaded that he was ugly ; they only knew that he was their friend .

		So far as this biog - raphy reveals him , women had at no time been influential in his life , though he had been a good son to his mother , who had devoted him to his great career .

		Like all busy men , he had loved idleness , and in talk of books and art and men delighted to roll out his mind .

		He was curious as to all sorts of knowledge , which he drew at first-hand from living experts , and liked freely to impart his new stores in their first freshness of acquisition .

		The variety of his interests , the versatility of his genius , gave him access to many differing minds .

		He was in the best sense a man of the world , a cour - teous , sympathetic gentleman .

		His presence was imposing , with a ruddy face and tall and portly frame .

		In manner he was simple , a little shy and reserved and dignified , at heart sensi - tive and affectionate .

		He hated the drudgery and petty details of office , yet could work prodi - giously with thorough grasp of the whole field .

		He dreaded adverse criticism , and shrank from public controversy , yet needed a crisis to bring him to his best .

		Excited in moments of seem - ing victory , he was always cool under fire , with every faculty at command .

		His imagination was slightly in excess , and sometimes unduly pre - ponderant .

		It made him over-impressionable , and now and then capricious .

		It lent its charm and color to his luxuriant Ciceronian eloquence .

		It made him a ready improvisatore in
Latin	LOCATION	, English , and Italian .

		His verse is loose in text - ure , but flowing and melodious .

		His style lacked compression .

		It could never be said of him , in
Lander	LOCATION	's phrase , that he '' inspissated his yellows into blacks . ''

		There was ever the something too much of facile genius .

		He loved , in diction as in life , splendor for its own sake .

		He liked his state as Prince of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		He graciously vested himself in his official robes to furnish
Charles Kean	PERSON	the correct cos - tume for
Cardinal Wolsey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Servants doted upon him , though one good cook refused to imperil his soul by broiling him a prescribed chop on a
Friday	DATE	.

		He was not insensible to good cheer , and had '' a lobster-salad side as well as a spiritual side . ''

		His was a generous southern temperament , and Spaniards and Italians were more at home with him than the denizens of the chilly North .

		He was rich in humor , which diffused itself through his genial demeanor .

		Above all , he was an honest man , pure and good , a worthy dignitary .

		His spirit was devout .

		His mood was of faith and worked by love .

		The Roman Church may well be proud of giving him birth and nurture , of recognizing his gifts , and setting him in her high places of authority .

		It may be questioned if every Prot - estant denomination could breed just such a man , or would know precisely what to do with him .

		The
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	has its nar - row doors and cramped vestibules , but there seems room and verge enough for those who are fairly inside .

		The air may be a little dense , overladen with incense , and the glass here and there obstructive of light ; but there are no fixed pews to divide the floor , and there are side aisles and chapels for quiet refuges .

		If you do n't insist upon too much ventilation , you can do as well perhaps at St.
Peter	PERSON	's as in
Salem Chapel	LOCATION	, which has restrictions of its own .

		* Judge
Emory Speer	PERSON	, of the
Federal Court of the Southern District of Georgia	ORGANIZATION	, is so well known as a lawyer and a judge , not only of the highest accomplishments but of eminently sound and catholic judgment , that one turns with un - usual interest the pages of a book from him on constitutional questions .

		Of
South Carolina	LOCATION	ancestry , of Georgian birth and life , and speak - ing in these pages originally to law students of a Southern university , the opportunity was a notable one .

		But the very dedication of the book gives the key-note to what follows , and assures the confidence of the reader .

		It runs : '' To my father ,
Eustace W. Speer	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, an exem - plar of the Christian patriot , who early taught his chil - dren that love of our common country he inherited from patriot sires . ''

		This thin volume , so beautifully prepared by a Southern publishing house , is a gratifying pro- duct of that new South which so many this side the
Ohio	LOCATION	are yet loth to recognize .

		Speaking of these lectures in the preface , Judge
Speer	PERSON	'' It is gratifying to believe that after many formid - able assaults and misguiding interpretations , from time to time aimed at the indispensable and inherent powers of the noble instrument to which they relate , its estab - lished efficacy for all the essentials of
National Govern	ORGANIZATION	- ment has won for it lasting popular confidence and the anxious desire of enlightened Americans to master its principles .

		Indeed , there is now known of all men in all sections of our country the priceless value of the truth expressed by
Washington	LOCATION	in his Farewell Address . '

		The
Union	ORGANIZATION	is the edifice of our real independence , the support of our tranquility at home , our peace abroad , our prosperity , our safety , and the very liberty which we so highly prize ; and for this Union we should cher - ish a cordial , habitual , immovable attachment , and should discountenance whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned . '

		The author , engaged for nearly thirteen years with judicial duties largely involving the enforcement of the
National	ORGANIZATION	laws among Southern people , is enabled to certify that this truth is as dear to the intelligent Southern men of to-day as to
Hamilton	LOCATION	, the brilliant projector of the Con - stitution ; to
Madison	LOCATION	, its incomparable advocate ; to
Marshall	LOCATION	, its great expounder ; and to the illustrious
Washington	LOCATION	himself . ''

		This is a high tribute , from a high source , to the sanity of thinking of the intelligent por - tion of the South on a fundamental matter ; and in view of the doctrine of Federal power advanced in the body of the book , we may ac - cept it as impartial and authoritative .

		tainly no judge reared in
New England	LOCATION	of
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eralist ancestors could take firmer nationalist ground than does Judge
Speer	PERSON	in the fifth lec - ture , on the eighteenth and last clause of
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- tion 8 Article I. of the Constitution its En - abling Act .

		That
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	is the final interpreter of questions involving the Constitution , where the individual is concerned , is clearly stated , as follows : '' Wherever the rights of the citizen may be affected by a particular governmental act , whether it be an act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislature , or of an executive or judiciary functionary , either of the
State	ORGANIZATION	or of the
United States	LOCATION	, if it be capable of submission to a court having jurisdiction , the final and common arbiter of the constitutional question is the supreme judicial authority of the courts of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In such cases the final decision of that authority is binding upon all the people , all the states , and all the departments of the general government . ''

		At the same time , it is shown , as a matter of fact , that in many cases the Executive or Con - gress may decide that it is constitutional to act in a certain manner , and so act , when the man - ner of action is wholly outside the purposes of the Constitution . ''

		The constitutional corrective for such wrongs is the vote of the people at the next appropriate election .

		The decision of the executive as to the constitutionality of a measure has been found to be at times practically irre - vocable , even after the decision of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	had pronounced otherwise . ''

		But all this only emphasizes the supreme authority , of both act and interpretation , of the federal government as a whole , subject only to revision by the sovereign people .

		This is good doctrine of the school of
Washington	LOCATION	and Ham - ilton and
Marshall	PERSON	.

		One or two misprints are noticed , as the formation of the
Ohio Company	ORGANIZATION	in
1849	DATE	, and the signature of the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	in
1782	DATE	.

		It is hardly accurate to speak of the Rock ing - ham ministry of
1765	DATE	as a Tory ministry ; and Judge
Speer	PERSON	could not mean to say of the
Quebec	LOCATION	Act of
1775	DATE	, that '' it proposed to make all the
New England	LOCATION	and
Middle States	LOCATION	a part of the province of
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		The range of that famous act stopped on the south and east at the
Ohio River	LOCATION	and
Lake Ontario	LOCATION	.

		One is not so sure of the book on ''
Nullifi	PERSON	- cation and Secession . ''

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	means well , for he says : '' It is my desire to state facts as viewed from a strictly national , rather than from a sectional or partisan , standpoint .

		But it is not without the sphere of legiti - mate history to aid , by such a statement of facts , in creating a more generous national sentiment , and a con - viction on the part of all sections that political right - eousness has not been the exclusive property of any one
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 part of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is time to deal justly by the South , and recognize its full share in the better part of nation-building , while at the same time we do not overlook the diverse obligations that naturally fell upon the complementary sections .

		In writing a history of attempts at nullification and secession , I shall not forget that they are the expressions of that intense individual - ism which was the most potent factor in creating our Republic . ''

		But this author does not always possess that clarity of vision which one who undertakes to create '' a more generous national sentiment '' should have .

		The book is dedicated '' to the South as well as to the North , to the West as well as to the
East	LOCATION	, with a spirit of equal justice to all our common land , our indissoluble Union '' ; and the motto is borrowed from Lin - coln , '' With malice toward none ; with charity for all . ''

		But in the attempt to do justice to the South and to the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	exponents of state-rights doctrine , there is a constant disparagement of those in the North who opposed them , or fell into the same way of thinking when it served their turn ; and the presentation of all the expo - nents of the old Federalism , from
Hamilton	PERSON	down , is tinged with something at least as strong as malice .

		It can serve no useful purpose least of all that of reconciling '' the sections '' to constantly disparage the leaders of thought over large areas of time and of country .

		We are constantly given insinuation and innuendo for history .

		We are told that Otis '' offered a resolution that no foreign-born person should hereafter hold an office in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' and that '' it was probably provoked by the fact that
Gallatin	LOCATION	, a Swiss , at this time was rapidly rising to eminent leadership of the Republi - cans . ''

		One of
John Marshall	PERSON	's decisions is labelled '' this zigzag of facts '' ; and it is added , '' the confusion of trying to distinguish be - tween state governments and the people is absurd . ''

		But history has not assigned confu - sion and absurdity to the mind of
John Mar	ORGANIZATION	- shall .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	knows it to be '' a fact that
Hamilton	PERSON	, together with
Pickering	PERSON	, had on foot a secret plot with
Great Britain	LOCATION	to engage in a joint plundering expedition against Spanish possessions in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Of
Hamilton	PERSON	, we read that '' he quarrelled in turn with every promi - nent man with whom his lot was cast .

		As a mere aid , he had flouted
Washington	LOCATION	, who petted him and humored him as he humored no other .

		He violently assailed and abused
Adams	PERSON	.

		He shamelessly maligned
Jefferson	PERSON	; and
Burr	PERSON	he traduced as a scoundrel . ''

		When
Washington	LOCATION	steadily refuses to appoint
Burr	PERSON	to an important office , we are asked , '' Was this the keen insight of a great mind ; or was it the result of the enmity of Hamilton ? ''

		We learn that '' the irrepressible but detestable
Timothy Pickering	PERSON	bobbed once more into publicity .

		With a her - edity of several generations of self-glorification , in being ' chosen of God , ' he mixed religion and politics with such skill that he could baptize any meanness , and serve the Lord with any dishonor . ''

		We read that
Governeur Morris	PERSON	was '' a fussy creature , who had more influence than he deserved . ''

		We are told that
Jackson	PERSON	'' stole
Texas	LOCATION	, '' but are not given the date .

		One is surprised also to learn of
Charleston	LOCATION	, that `` the religion was Calvinistic and Presbyterian . ''

		It is a pity that Mr.
Powell	PERSON	should be so vituperative , for , apart from its abuse of every exponent of the older Federalism , the book is laid down on sound principles .

		The sympa - thetic view taken of
Jefferson	LOCATION	is in accord with what is becoming more and more a national estimate of that truly great man .

		The portrai - ture of
Calhoun	PERSON	is discriminating , and is well done . ''

		His ideal of life was out of sight beyond that of
Jackson	PERSON	and Clay and
Crawford	PERSON	.

		Nearer akin to Jef - ferson in views and character than any other public man of the era , he wholly lacked
Jefferson	PERSON	's ability to widen with antagonism and expand with age .

		He believed in honesty , economy , and liberty .

		His doctrine of
State Rights	ORGANIZATION	was the doctrine as it had stood in
1798	DATE	.

		He drew back from nationalism ; he drew in from the com - bat at large ... He would yield nothing , bend nowhere .

		Of necessity he dropped down to
State	ORGANIZATION	leadership and
State	ORGANIZATION	rights and
State	ORGANIZATION	institutions .

		To become the champion of slavery because slavery was a State insti - tution was the final lot of a man apparently born to be the greatest national leader of his era . ''

		The State stamp was a deep and indelible one .

		It did not breed nationalists , but it bred its strongest char - acters to look inward instead of outward .

		Nullification was a natural consequence .

		Its association with slavery was an incident , not a provoking cause .

		The deep cause of action in two rebellions was State character . ''

		Having in six chapters dealt with as many attempts to nullify or to secede , from
1798	DATE	to
1861	DATE	, the author does some of his best writing in a concluding chapter on the problems of the period since
1865	DATE	, when the era of faction closed .

		Under the topics , the Negro Problem , the
Problem of Ignorance	ORGANIZATION	, the
Problem of Expansion	ORGANIZATION	, Spoliation of the Rich , Spoliation of the Poor ,
Protection of Special Industries	ORGANIZATION	, Centralization , Failure of Popular Government , he asks some pertinent questions and indicates some present dangerous tendencies .

		Nowhere has a more forcible impeachment of class legis - lation been written than under the sixth head .

		The danger of too much government from 260 THE DIAL -LSB-

Washington	LOCATION	is ever present to many good Federalists to-day who cherish a Nation but fear a Juggernaut , and Mr.
Powell	PERSON	voices the convictions of many a less impetuous mind than his own .

		Yet he should have known that to
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	is due the credit of initiating the policy of withdrawing the Federal troops from the South a policy which Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	approved and carried out .

		Although one takes issue with Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's invective , it is impos - sible not to enjoy intellectually his trenchant and epigrammatic English in an age of much diffuse vapidity .

		General
Wilkinson	PERSON	, the one victim of his trenchant style who deserves nearly all that is said of him , is thus disposed of in a parting sentence : '' He spent his old age on an estate in

		* Sir
Alfred Milner	PERSON	, in his work on '' En - gland in

Evelyn Baring	PERSON	. ''

		The stars were indeed gracious , '' he says , '' when , at the beginning of our greatest troubles , it occurred to the British Government to entrust the conduct of its policy to the hands of Sir
Evelyn Baring	PERSON	. ''

		Under the latter name
Lord Cromer	PERSON	is probably better known to the world at large , as it was only in
1892	DATE	that he was raised to the peerage , several years after the occurrence of those events in
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Egyptian history which first brought his name into general notice , and which now furnish a large portion of the material of Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	's elaborate Biography .

		Sir
Evelyn Baring	PERSON	was born in
1841	DATE	, edu - cated at the
Woolwich Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and served ten or twelve years as an artillery officer ; be - came in
1873	DATE	private secretary to
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	- brook , Viceroy of
India	LOCATION	; was appointed in
1877	DATE	English Commissioner of the Egyptian Debt ; in
1879	DATE	was made joint member with
M. de Blignieres	PERSON	of the
Dual Control	ORGANIZATION	estab - lished for the purpose of inquiring into all branches of the Egyptian public service , with the rank of minister and a seat in the cabinet ; succeeded Sir
John Strachey	PERSON	as Financial Member of the
Council of India	ORGANIZATION	in
1880	DATE	; and in
1883	DATE	was sent back to
Cairo	LOCATION	as Consul - * LORD CROMER .

		A Biography .

		By
H. D. Traill	PERSON	.

		Illus - trated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	.

		General with the rank of minister plenipoten - tiary in the diplomatic service .

		This office , unless we are mistaken , he still holds .

		More than three-quarters of Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's book is devoted to
Baring	LOCATION	's record as Consul - General , for which post his earlier training in the finances both of
India	LOCATION	and of
Egypt	LOCATION	was a valuable preparation .

		The financial situation in
Egypt	LOCATION	has for many years been the one problem in that country pressing for solution , and it is largely due to
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	's mas - terly grasp of the situation and firm insistence on certain wise reforms , especially in the mat - ter of less lavish expenditure , that the country has escaped bankruptcy and is in a solvent condition to-day .

		His service to
Egypt	LOCATION	in se - curing the appropriation by its government , in
1885	DATE	, of a million pounds for the irrigation works , can not be overestimated ; nor can his firmness and wisdom in keeping under such admirable control , with
Lord Roseberry	PERSON	at the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	to back him , the headstrong and petulant youth of eighteen who succeeded
Tew	PERSON	-
fik Pasha	PERSON	as Khedive , in
1892	DATE	, and straightway endeavored to surround himself with a worth - less crew of ministers and advisers .

		Indeed , the entire record of
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	's life in
Egypt	LOCATION	may serve as an argument to convince the skeptical that the mission of
England	LOCATION	in
Egypt	LOCATION	is after all a beneficent one .

		Mr.
Traill	PERSON	tells once more the sad story of General
Gordon	PERSON	's mission to the Soudan , and the criminally timid and dilatory policy of the second
Gladstone	PERSON	administration , to which the world has agreed to ascribe the tragic death of the hero .

		The tale is rehearsed in order to clear of all blame the Consul - General at
Cairo	LOCATION	, who acted as intermediary between
Gordon	PERSON	and the home government , and transmitted to Downing Street those repeated appeals for aid even if it should be only a hundred , only fifty men which came from
Khartoum	LOCATION	day after day and month after month , but were un - heeded until too late .

		Lord Cromer is shown by his biographer to have been technically blameless in the matter ; and yet one is tempted to query whether another man in his place perhaps one far less skilled in diplomacy and less distinguished as a financier might not have taken such positive action , whether offi - cially or unofficially , as to effect
Gordon	PERSON	's res - cue .

		The pity of it all is that
Gordon	PERSON	's sacrifice was so needless , and his relief , even with all the blundering and delay , was so nearly accom - plished .

		The biographer speaks , with reason , of the
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 difficulties in presenting such a subject as he has here undertaken , on account of the personal effacement enjoined by the conditions of the diplomatic service .

		He has , nevertheless , suc - ceeded in putting together a very good chapter Personal Characteristics , '' and in leaving on the reader well satisfied that
Lord Cromer	PERSON	is a man worth reading about .

		The volume con - tains some good portraits and other illustrations .

		REASON AND FAITH .

		* The authority of reason can never be shaken , for we have only reason with which to pluck it down .

		Faith can not be escaped , for reason involves it .

		Our ever-returning confidence in reason , in spite of its inadequate and conflicting results , is an act of faith in truth , faith in our own relations to it , faith in the divinely ordered movement by which it is being reached .

		We see in part , is the formula of life .

		We see : of that we are sure .

		We see in part only : hence these delays and contradictions .

		Many seek - ers , scattered in a dense forest , are shouting to each other , and trying to find the path .

		The confusion is a confusion of order ; the bewilderment is one that is passing away .

		One feels at no other time the magnitude of the spiritual world , in which for the moment we seem to be lost , so much as when he hears the cries , near and far , '' This is the way . ''

		per , '' conceived in the best spirit of the author .

		Professor
Drummond	PERSON	won loving and widely scat - tered attention by his very eager grasp of spiritual things , united with a firm hold on physical facts .

		He gave himself heartily to the true problem of life , the reconciliation of these two .

		In this work , he met with much success ; but this achievement was of chief value because in his own mind and heart he sacrificed nothing of the goal in reaching it .

		The goal was assured , whatever might be determined as to any particular path to it . ''

		The Ritschlian Theology , '' by Dr.
James Orr	PERSON	, is an interesting and well-written book .

		It is at once appreciative and critical .

		It is a thorough presenta - tion of a method of thought that has gained ground rapidly in
Germany	LOCATION	, and is fitted materially to modify questions of proof in matters of faith .

		The view of Professor
Ritschl	PERSON	tends to make the argument for Christianity relatively independent of the historical facts which accompanied its birth and can be restored only partially and with difficulty , and rests it upon Christianity as a present spiritual fact , undeniable in its nature , and which we can judge in its intrinsic force .

		This is a position which deserves the exhaus - tive discussion it receives in the volume before us . ''

		A
National Church	ORGANIZATION	'' is composed of two lec - tures by the Rev.
W. R. Huntington	PERSON	; the first pre - sents the theory of a national church , while the second lecture defends its practicability .

		The book differs from the current discussion which the topic has called forth in dropping down to the more mod - est and less logical purpose of a national , in place of a universal , church .

		The lectures are rhetorical rather than powerful .

		They will encourage those already convinced , but will make no inroad on the refractory .

		The dispersion and division of religious faiths are no unfortunate accident , but are incident to an inevitable and progressive movement the asser - tion of an independent , personal religious life .

		Not till this force has so far expended itself as to leave us ready for a more vital union on a higher plane , shall we begin to rebuild churches in a larger spirit . ''

		The significance of the Westminster Standards , '' by Dr.
Benjamin B. Warfield	PERSON	, is a denominational address to a rigidly denominational audience the Presbytery of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Its character is suffi - ciently indicated by this early assertion : '' In these forms of words we possess the most complete , the most fully elaborated and carefully guarded , the most perfect , and the most vital expression that has ever been framed by the hand of man , of all that enters into what we call evangelical religion , and of all that must be safeguarded if evangelical religion is to persist in the world . ''

		This assertion the author seeks to establish historically and reflectively . ''

		Ministerial Priesthood '' is the product of a vigorous and ardent mind .

		Like most books of this character , it is well worth reading ; if not for con - viction , yet for comprehension .

		To the easy-going Protestant with whom the diversities of churches belong to the accidents of life , the methods of thought which pertain to an earnest churchman are a revela - 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, tion .

		They broaden his spiritual horizon and ex - tend his sympathies .

		The ruling ideas of the book are , that Christianity involves of necessity a com - plete ideal relation between men that organic life which we know as a church ; that the internal power of the church can not be separated from its external form ; that the two , therefore , must inhere in one definite and transcendant product .

		From these premises the author infers that our spiritual devel - opment must lie along a single line of church de - velopment .

		The vigorous enforcement of these ideas will certainly be corrective to many minds .

		The view which has much logical force within itself seems , however , to be constructed in oversight , if not in contempt , of the actual stages of growth in the world .

		The perfect church , like a perfect gov - ernment or a perfect family , is reached through many imperfect ones , with ever renewed selection and re - jection .

		To cling obstinately to the old is oftentimes to aid its demerits in smothering its merits .

		Our church ideal is still in the air like all our other ideals . ''

		Buddhism and its Christian Critics '' is a care - ful and illuminating statement , by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, of the ideas which underlie Buddhism .

		We have no doubt of the essential correctness of the treatise as an exposition of that faith , nor of its fitness to remove much of the disagreement and doubt asso - ciated with previous statements .

		The author has rendered a good service .

		The underlying idea of the system , which the author also entertains , we are not , however , prepared to accept .

		We are quite content to reject the Brahminic notion of a distinct , permanent self , the source of mental phenomena .

		This is doubling a thing : putting a second thing within the thing as a means of exposition .

		We are not , however , shut up to a mere flow of phenomena , a series of forms , as the only counter conception .

		The phenomena which address themselves to the senses or to consciousness carry with them to the intellect , the energy , physical or spiritual , which sustains them .

		The substance and form are insep - arable correlatives the same thing differently re - garded .

		If this were not so , then the chariot and the man a comparison frequently employed in the exposition would indeed stand on the same basis .

		The chariot is made up of its parts , and the man of his parts .

		Suppose the chariot to be suddenly en - dowed with life , to have a spirit in the wheels : it would have suffered no change , under the view urged , as its parts would remain the same .

		As a matter of fact , however , the hidden connections would be totally altered .

		Evolution involves as dis - tinctly that which is evolved , as the forms through which it passes .

		Take the case most favorable to this theory of forms simply , that of the triangle .

		Suppose a given right-angled triangle : enlarge it indefinitely .

		As long as it remains a distinct tri - angle , the relations hold .

		Let it begin to lose its parts for the mind by virtue of magnitude , and their relations disappear with them ; it is by virtue only of a concrete triangle that we hold them fast .

		Just here has arisen the confusion as to what is meant by Nirvana .

		Take away all concrete experience , and what is left ?

		Nothing , says one ; pure form , says another .

		But pure form is inseparable from concrete form .

		It is concrete , or it ceases to be .

		By pursuing an abstraction , by being lost in the last abstraction , Buddhism is infinitely inferior to
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		It partially regains its ground by affirming virtually that pure form is perfect form , and then pursuing perfection as the highest form .

		We think the author is open to the criticism a criticism which certainly attaches to many in our time of making the words science and scientific a kind of fetich .

		His theory of the ultimate nature of things must , like other theories , fight its way through .

		It will prevail or fail according to its simplicity and aptness .

		It is vain to call it scientific , as if science stood for some form of absolute knowledge , and was applicable to the opinions of the author , and not to those of other men .

		Our author has skill as a tax - idermist ; but he is so delighted with it that he turns all the life of the world into a collection of stuffed skins , and then proceeds to pronounce them superior to the original creation .

		We have no criticism on the spirit of the book , but only on the ultimate phil - osophy which underlies it . ''

		The Living Christ , '' by Mr.
Paul Tyner	PERSON	, is a piece of mysticism , loving and tender , but quite away from the world in which we now are .

		The living Christ is to be understood in a literal sense .

		He has revealed himself to the author , and is to be revealed to all .

		The remote , fragile nature of the vision is made both painful and ludicrous , when we are told that the denouement is to take place in
Denver	LOCATION	.

		The infinite conceit of the human mind !

		Like a caterpillar , it steals away into some crevice , spins its cocoon , and thinks the whole world is going through the same change .

		Dr.
Beverley Warner	PERSON	's book on '' The Facts and The Faith '' is the result of a series of discourses on the Apostles ' Creed .

		Its spirit is of the best .

		Its effort is to unite once more in a living faith tradi - tional dogma and growing knowledge .

		The atti - tude of the author is a frank , receptive one .

		He has no fear of eating of the tree of knowledge , or any expectation that the sources of faith will be dried up by its fruits .

		The world , as a divine pro- duct , has such hold on his mind that the method of control and guidance becomes a question of ever - renewed interest and inquiry .

		The work will be helpful to many in making the transition , so often found difficult , from a less adequate to a more ade - quate faith ; from a fixed to a flexible expression of truth .

		It will restore movement to the vital centres of spiritual growth .

		Dr.
Trever	PERSON	's volume of '' Studies in Comparative Theology '' is based on six lectures given at Law - rence
University	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		The present size of the book would indicate considerable expansion of the matter from its first form .

		It treats in three lectures of The Vedic Religion , of Buddhism , of Zoroaster , and
Moses	PERSON	.

		The three following lectures are on '' The Religion of
Abraham	PERSON	's Jft Boyhood 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 Home , '' '' The Sphinx 's Cry for Light , '' `` The Voice of the Gospel to Other Religions . ''

		The book indi - cates wide knowledge .

		It is popular , instructive , and interesting .

		It is likely to bring pleasure and profit to many readers .

		Its spirit is intelligent and liberal .

		The criticisms that one might be disposed to make are secondary rather than fundamental . ''

		Christianity , the World-Religion '' is a replica - tion of Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	's previous work on '' The Par - liament of Religions . ''

		The extraordinary energy shown by him on tbat occasion has made him an institution by himself .

		One of the suggestions of that event has been the lecture course established by Mrs.
Caroline E. Haskell	PERSON	; the lectures to be delivered in
Calcutta	LOCATION	or some other city of
India	LOCATION	.

		The vol - ume before us contains seven lectures delivered in
Calcutta	LOCATION	, repeated elsewhere , and accompanied by many addresses given in the course of an extended tour in
India	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	.

		It also contains a sketch , by the Rev.
Robert A. Hume	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, of
Ahmednagar	LOCATION	, of the visit of Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	to
India	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	gives great magnitude to the ideas which occupy him , and fills full all their spaces with an inexhaustible enthusiasm .

		His style is like his method of activity .

		Many from all quarters are made to contribute to the book in hand .

		Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	's trip was not the opening of a reli - gious bazaar , in which different views and convic - tions might be mingled and exchanged , but a steady enforcement of Christianity as the true world - religion .

		He strengthened the missionaries of the faith who preach it as the especial revelation of God .

		His themes were such subjects as '' The World-wide Aspects of Christianity , '' `` The Universal Book , '' `` The Universal Man and Saviour . ''

		Prof.
G. Frederick Wright	PERSON	's work on '' The Sci - entific Aspects of Christian Evidences '' is one of marked ability .

		It is well fitted to give hesitancy and sobriety to almost anyone 's opinion on the funda - mental data which underlie faith .

		The facile and self-confident methods into which destructive criti - cism so readily falls , meet an extended and just rebuke .

		Yet , on the other hand , we can not but feel that the mind of the author is somewhat too much burdened by the desire to defend the earlier views .

		This appears , however , rather as an under - current than as an avowed object .

		It is one thing to urge the supernatural as an essential ingredient of faith , and another to accept it scrupulously as it offers itself in the Scriptures .

		The book is what it purports to be , a discursive discussion of the grounds of belief involved in Christianity .

		The inquiry is associated with accurate and extended knowledge ; reaches to many and very diverse particulars ; and is instructive and stimulating , whether we do or do not accept its exact conclusions .

		The earlier chap - ters point out with great clearness the fact that the foundations of belief involve the same difficulties , no matter what our starting points .

		The later chapters treat of historical and textual criticisms .

		The book was well worth writing , and hence it is well worth reading .

		INDUSTRIAL , DEMOCRACY , ASD OTHER STUDIES .

		* It is a singular pleasure to accompany such com - petent guides as Mr. and Mrs.
Webb	PERSON	through the complications of English Trade Unionism .

		Before our less highly developed country lie the problems which the wage-workers of
England	LOCATION	have , in good measure , made clear to themselves and to the world .

		In all essentials , we must pursue the same road .

		As manufacturing industry , with its concentration of population , dominates our life and gathers men into factories and cities , we shall require all the wisdom of experience to find our way .

		The authors of this book regard Trade Unionism as the industrial side of democracy .

		Under the title '' Trade Union Structure '' falls the discussion of the evolution of governmental organization in local unions , provincial and national federations , and interunion relations .

		Not a little light is thrown upon the much-lauded schemes of the referendum , initiative , and instructed delegates .

		For a century these unions have been trying experiments with town-meeting government , and as their numbers and territory increased they have been compelled to adopt representative institutions .

		In political gov - ernment the nations have thought out , or groped their way to , the differentiation of professional rep - resentatives for legislation and expert administrators in civil service ; and in trade-unionism a similar evo - lution is discernible .

		The unit tends to be the whole trade and not the local association of craftsmen .

		In connection with the topic '' Trade Union Func - tion , '' the authors treat the methods and the regu - lations employed by organized wage-workers to obtain their ends .

		The methods are classified as mutual insurance , collective bargaining , and legal enactments .

		The regulations cover the standard rate , normal day , sanitation and safety , new pro- cesses and machinery , continuity of employment , entrance into a trade , and the right to a trade .

		Each of these great concerns of the operative classes is treated with great minuteness of detail , keen insight , and apparent impartiality .

		The information comes first-hand from documents and personal observation .

		The severe criticism of the
Trade Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	gives evidence that these sympathetic historians of the moment are not slavish admirers but critical friends .

		The chapter on the Standard Rate should be care - fully studied by those who sincerely desire to under - stand the movement . ''

		Among trade-union regu - lations there is one which stands out as practically universal , namely , the insistence on payment accord - ing to some definite standard , uniform in its appli - * INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY .

		This principle is frequently misrepresented .

		The demand is for a minimum , not for a maximum , rate of wages .

		The employer can pay as much more as he chooses for persons of special skill .

		In some cases the more skillful have chosen to yield higher income for the sake of security , just as investors prefer low interest with good basis of credit to high interest when payment is uncertain .

		Only by main - taining a standard rate is there a possibility of col - lective bargaining .

		The individual workman , with the perishable commodity of day-labor to offer , is helpless .

		Individual bargaining leads straight to bondage .

		The reasons for desiring piece-wages in some occupations , and time-wages in others , are clearly explained .

		In contending for improved appliances for health and safety , the unions have rendered a service to national efficiency , and they have been sustained by instructed public opinion .

		The unions can no longer be justly charged with opposition to machinery ; they are organized to secure their share of the increased product .

		The tragical suffering attending the introduction of new processes is greatly miti - gated by prompt and united action .

		The societies have not succeeded in securing continuity of employ - ment , but they have made headway in preventing the reserve army of the unemployed from sinking all gains by requiring a certain number of hours of work for all who are engaged .

		Those who approve the individualistic decisions of
Illinois	LOCATION	courts in relation to restricting the hours of work by adult women should consider the history of that subject in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- pp. 584-585 -RRB- .

		We seem to be still in a very crude and backward state as compared with
England	LOCATION	since
1847	DATE	.

		The economists are far more favorable to trade - unions than formerly .

		The former wage fund and population theories have suffered great modifi - cation in the light of criticism and of life .

		The authors , though pronounced socialists , declare that the standard of living has steadily improved among capable men .

		Nominal wages are higher ; the goods consumed are cheaper ; hours are shorter ; employ - ment is more constant .

		In this they agree with
Giffin	PERSON	,
Wright	PERSON	, and others who are charged with optimism .

		They see in trade unionism a permanent element in a socialistic state , the legal representative of the operative members of society .

		The darker side of modern life is seen in the Un - employable , a term used to designate the lower grades of laborers who can not earn a full living and merely compete enough with capable men to lower their wages .

		Members of this class should be separated from others and educated to become employable , or , if the defect is too serious , should be kept in farm colonies , and made to earn what they can , but with - out competing with independent laborers .

		This con - clusion agrees with that of the eminent investigator , Mr.
Charles Booth	PERSON	.

		It is a little difficult for one closely related to another in teaching to be exactly critical , especially if he is very proud of his colleague 's achievement .

		A brief statement of the topics of Professor
Vin	PERSON	- cent 's '' Social Mind and Education '' will be enough to show that teachers and social students will be obliged to make acquaintance with the work for themselves .

		The task of the thesis is to bring to bear upon the problem of education certain concep - tions of social philosophy .

		The argument , as summed up in the Introduction , follows these subjects : The psychical products of social evolution , ideas , judg - ments , and desires , react upon individuals and are modified by them .

		Science and philosophy are the product of the efforts of the race to join the phe - nomena of existence in causal connections and a verified system . ''

		Education sets before itself the task of relating the individual intrinsically to the social tradition , so that he may become an organic part of society . ''

		The higher education seeks syn - thesis of the products of previous analysis . ''

		Social life and the student in relation to it form the real centre '' for correlation of studies .

		There is no social brain or sensorium ; but there is social thinking where the members of a group share common thoughts and communicate or agree .

		Philosophy as applied to social phenomena aims to '' afford a view of associated life by generalizing into a coherent conception the sciences which have been differentiated from the experiences of men , to recombine into reality the subjective abstractions of the social mind , to serve as a science of the sciences . ''

		It is in sociology , rather than in physiology , or even psychology , according to Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	, that the various studies are to find their unity and full meaning .

		The present social environment man , nature , and the interaction of these is the unity which must be first broken up for analysis and again integrated in the higher synthesis of an intel - lectual system .

		The various schemes for harmo - nizing and giving order to the various studies are described .

		On the basis of this survey a tentative curriculum for a college course is laid out with some detail of illustration .

		A very excellent apparatus of references , in foot-notes and bibliography , gives increased value to an important discussion of a great theme .

		But these quotations are much more than mere patches of color ; they are the starting-points of independent criticism , and are made to render real service in the expansion of the central theme .

		The whole subject of the relation of sociology to pedagogy is here brought up to date . ''

		Social Transformations of the Victorian Age , '' by Mr.
T. H. S. Escott	PERSON	, is a milestone on the high - way of progress .

		It is written in the optimistic style of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's '' Triumphant Democracy . ''

		With a light and airy motion we are carried over thirty-one chapters in the illuminated story of the Queen 's reign .

		If one side is given undue promi - nence , it certainly is that side which is most agree - able to look upon .

		What so many have won may be possible for many others to achieve , and the advance-guard tells of a host pressing closely in their
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 footsteps .

		Cheerful it is to walk about the mother - country with a well-informed citizen , and consider the growth of wealth , the enlarged power of the democracy , the improved means of education , the fusion of classes in local government , the renewed spiritual life of the ancient universities , the achieve - ments of science and invention , the transfiguration of religions thought and practice , and the reign of law at home and in the colonies .

		Mr.
Wyckoff	PERSON	's interesting articles narrating his experiences as a laboring-man have appeared in book form , and they are well worth reading or re-reading . ''

		An Experiment in Reality '' it was for a soft - handed scholar to take his chances in lanes , high roads , lumber camps , on farms and in ditches , with those inured to hard labor .

		Moneyless , he made his way across
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, hiring out here and there for what he could get for un - skilled service .

		With excellent literary power he makes us see and feel with him and his companions , and to realize the chasm which divides classes in this country .

		Of course there must be something too subjective and partial in this brief trial of a new mode of life .

		The scholar who has not been brought up with laborers can never quite take their point of view .

		But this writer at least brings our fellows of the ditch and the woods closer to our sympathies .

		The characterization of types is sketchy , but bold and strong .

		If anyone is tempted to draw too hasty inferences from these scattered hints of life , and generalize on the basis of mere suggestions , it will not be the author 's fault ; for he is modest in gen - eralizations , and puts us on our guard against taking a story for a philosophy .

HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		An aid to musical vmderttanding , '' What is Good Music ? ''

		is the title of an admirable little book by Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	, which has just been published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	begins by saying that '' the right to like or dislike a musical composition has long been re - garded as coexistent with human freedom , '' and then proceeds to show that this alleged right is of precisely the same character as the right to dislike Shakespeare and like Sir
Lewis Morris	PERSON	, for ex - ample , or to look coldly upon the Venus of Melos and warm up at sight of a
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	group .

		In other words , musical compositions are good or bad without any regard for the tastes of the ignorant public , and the critic is the one who knows the difference be - tween good and bad , and is prepared to advance solid scientific reasons for the faith that is in him .

		To help those who know little of music as an art to form judgments with some approximation to cor - rectness , is the purpose of the book whose keynote is sounded at the outset in the words above quoted .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	writes in a very plain and reason -
Mathtmatical Ptyeholoffy	ORGANIZATION	, to-called .

		able manner , indulging now and then in a bit of satirical comment , and occasionally saying things that are not often heard but can not be said too often .

		One of these things is thus expressed : '' Without musical emotion that can be communicated to the hearer , the most exquisite touch in the world will have no effect .

		Temperament temperament is what we all cry for .

		What is temperament ?

		It is hard to define , but easy to discern .

		We know that
Jean de Reszke	ORGANIZATION	radiates with it , and that
Melba	PERSON	is absolutely without it . ''

		As for the satire , the follow - ing is neatly put : '' You were once persuaded to go to what a friend described as a chamber-music concert .

		There you heard four ghostly persons perform an operation which seemed to you to be the articulation of a symphonic skeleton .

		At that entertainment you became reckless and slept openly in the sight of all men .

		And let me add in strict confidence that if the performance was no better than most of our quartet-playing , I do not blame you for your som - nolence . ''

		We hope that our few words of commend - ation will send a good many non-musical readers to Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book .

		It deserves a large audi - ence , and is sure to help those who are struggling in the endeavor to appreciate musical art , and need to be helped in just this way .

		A volume of a hundred pages with so formidable a title as '' The Math - ematical Psychology of Gratry and
Boole	ORGANIZATION	, translated from the language of the Higher Calculus into that of Elementary Geometry by Mary Everest Boole '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is likely to attract some little attention by its title alone .

		But the mathe - matician will probably pass this bizarre little volume over to the psychologist , and the psychologist will be equally anxious to shift the burden of responsi - bility upon the mathematician ; while the curiosity of the general reader , unless he happens to enjoy something of this flavor , will be satisfied by a very small dose .

		The husband of the translator was Professor
George Boole	PERSON	, an eminent mathematician , and particularly remembered for his original con - tributions to the field of symbolic logic as studied by algebraic methods .

		But the present brochure is as innocent of any account of
Boole	ORGANIZATION	's work as it is of mathematics or psychology .

		There is a liberal sprinkling of mathematical terms distorted into un - usual uses , but no appreciation of the essential prin - ciples of mathematical procedure .

		The task of stat - ing what the book is not is comparatively simple ; to indicate what it really contains is very difficult , for this raises the question on the part of the reader as to whether he really knows or understands what the book does contain .

		There is , however , a con - siderable use of the argument by analogy , and the analogies are very flimsy .

		Because some figures used in the process of multiplication disappear in the conclusion , we have the law of sacrifice ; the geometric diagonal indicates the principle of com - promise ; mathematical thought is inspiration , and habit is the multiplication table .

		Then we have 266 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, disquisitions on vivisection and theology , on genius and insanity , on education and
Newton	LOCATION	, on morals and religion .

		These are all disconnectedly strung together , and leave one with an uncanny sense of puzzlement and incoherence .

		It is possible that the author had some ideas to express , but they are not very apparent , and may just as well come under any other rubric as under that of Mathematical Psy - chology .

		The Blackwood The earl y
Edinburgh Reviewers	ORGANIZATION	, the group of Fraserians , the
Blackwood	PERSON	set , are famous Scots .

		interesting groups in a time now tak - ing to itself the golden tone of romance .

		Their inter - est is now largely historic , or , more accurately speak - ing , largely heroic .

		The men themselves are better remembered than their works : few read
Jeffrey	PERSON	or
Sydney Smith	PERSON	, save perhaps in selections ; the wit and learning of
Maginn	PERSON	and
Mahoney	PERSON	has preserved their writings for a few only ; and we think of the heroes of the '' Noctes '' more as characters in lit - erature than as creators of it .

		A new volume of the '' Famous Scots Series '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is written by Sir
George Douglas	PERSON	, on '' The
Blackwood Group	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It contains sketches , necessarily short , of
John Wil	PERSON	- son ,
John Gait	PERSON	,
D. M. Moir	PERSON	,
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	,
Michael Scott	PERSON	, and
Thomas Hamilton	PERSON	.


Lockhart	PERSON	and
Hogg	PERSON	would of course have been included , were not sepa - rate volumes of the series reserved for them .

		This is right ; but still ,
Christopher North	PERSON	seems a little lonely without
Timothy Tickler	PERSON	and the
Ettrick Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the six authors in question , we incline to think that the only one now read is
Michael Scott	PERSON	.

		The enormous production of
Wilson	PERSON	, the facile work of ''
Delta	ORGANIZATION	, '' the varied extemporizations of
John Gait	PERSON	, are now nowhere ; but ''
Tom Cringle	PERSON	's Log '' may be said still to exist .

		As to Miss
Ferrier	PERSON	's '' Marriage , '' we own to doubts .

		Sir
George Douglas	PERSON	has immense admiration for it and its companions , and speaks of them in very strong terms .

		Indeed , he rather makes one wish to read many a book which we feel sure nobody otherwise would read .

		This we may or may not do ; at any rate , we have here an excellent book for a niche in literary history that was vacant .

		It was once a matter of vexation to Macaulay that he could not under - stand
Kant	PERSON	's '' Critique . ''

		It seemed to him that a man who could understand
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Aristotle	LOCATION	,
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	,
Locke	PERSON	, ought to be able to under - stand the work of a German professor translated by a Liverpool merchant .

		Macaulay was inclined to think that the fault lay with
Kant	PERSON	; but here he was partly wrong .

		In manner something like , are we a little vexed that we have not wholly mastered the story of '' The Statue in the Air '' by
Caroline Eaton	PERSON	Le Conte -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We followed , in our time , the adventures of Endymion ; we got safely to the end of '' The Revolt of Islam '' ; we thought once that we had our hand on
Zanoni	PERSON	, but here we have been baffled .

		We mention the matter more in re - gret than in criticism : an intelligible plot is not the The mystery of '' The Statue in the Air . ''

		one thing needful for a tale ; '' The Statue in the Air '' has doubtless a significance beyond the details of the story .

		Still , it may be remarked that even though wholly possessed by her glorious theme , the author would not have done ill in exhibiting a cer - tain consequence and coherence in the events which she chronicles .

		It will be admitted , we think , that the general reader likes to see some connection be - tween what he is reading at any time and what he has already read .

		The book presents in myth-like phantasietta the doings in some apocryphal pseudo -
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	fairy-land .

		It is a tale of shepherds and prophets , of hollow echoes and flushing apple - blossoms , of gods and harpies .

		It hymns in pulsing obscurities the awful power of Troglodytes and his final destruction by Euphorion , whereby -LRB- in our opinion -RRB- is very mystically shadowed forth the ulti - mate victory over
Evil of Love	LOCATION	through Art .

		Eupho - rian in the first ecstacy of his passion for Leanira strikes on a harp a few pellucid chords . ''

		As though the music wrought like an invisible chisel ... out of the cold air was created a marble child . ''

		The sacred statue was enshrined in the Cave of Love ; but those curious to know the manner , or the reason , or what it had to do with Troglodytes , will do well to study the original text , where they may not only find what they want to know -LRB- a thing always pleas - ant -RRB- , but also enjoy a number of verbal felicities and infelicities which we can not here set down in detail .

		Mysteries of the
Neo-Celtic Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	is already known as the author of poems and stories , and also as one of the foremost represent - atives of that Neo-Celtic Movement which is now sometimes mentioned with bated breath .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is the leader of the
Erse	ORGANIZATION	division of the Gadhelic branch of the
Neo-Celtic Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Gadhels are nowadays a good deal more active than the Cymric Neo-Celts ; in fact ,
Cymric Neo-Celticism	PERSON	is now such an old story that there is hardly any Neo - ness about it .

		It need hardly be said that
Neo	PERSON	-
Celticism	PERSON	has no connection at all with the Scotch and Irish story-tellers that one sometimes hears of at the present day .

		Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	, Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	, ''
Ian Mac	PERSON	- laren , '' are not Neo-Celtic , in fact , they are not even Celtic .

		Miss
Jane Barlow	PERSON	is Celtic but not Neo-Celtic .

		Miss
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, however , is Neo -
Celtic	ORGANIZATION	, has even been hailed as the '' initiator '' of the movement ; Miss
Nora Hopper	PERSON	is also Neo -
Celtic	ORGANIZATION	, although strangely intelligible .

		Mr.
William Sharp	PERSON	is Neo-Celtic in temper though not in topic , and Mrs. Sharp has done great service to the move - ment by her ''
Lyra Celtica	PERSON	. ''

		But Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is the arch Neo-Celticist , and in his last book , '' The Secret Rose '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , he shows forth the tenets of the cult as clearly as any tenets can be shown forth which have ever come into contact with the doc - trines of the
Rosy Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rosicrucianism is to the uninitiated wholly incomprehensible ; and
Neo	PERSON	-
Celticism	PERSON	, except for externals , is very nearly so .

		But if the reader will dismiss from mind any thought of subtle doctrine or tenet , he may find in these tales
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 A ttudy of of people .

		a good deal of pleasure .

		One can easily take them simply as they come , without knowing or trying to know what they may really be about ; and we think that in this way one will enjoy them most .

		As for any pseudo-serious ideas shadowed forth in these stories , we allow ourselves the opinion that they are silly .

		They may come from the Druids , or from the Bound Towers , or from anywhere else ; but if no more valuable thoughts are hidden in the Speckled Book or the Book of the
Dun Cow	ORGANIZATION	, we shall be con - tent if those massive tomes remain unprinted for another thousand years .

		Paying , therefore , no atten - tion to the doctrines of Neo-Celticism , we find in this collection of stories not infrequently very great charm .

		From the archaic legend of Aodh and the
Queen Dectira	LOCATION	, through the curious ancient-modern tales of Hanrahan the Red to the very contempo - rary ''
Rosa Alchemica	PERSON	, '' we are constantly coming across very charming things , usually bits of descrip - tion , which really arouse the imagination .

		The book is by a poet rather than a story-teller , and yet its stories are better than the two or three poems that it contains a paradox which will say much to any - one who fully understands it .

		The second series of the `` American Lectures on the History of Religions '' hag ^ been pa bli 8 hed -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		These courses of lectures are patterned somewhat after the Hibbert Lectures in
England	LOCATION	, and are pre - sented annually at certain
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	cities
Boston	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, etc. .

		A well - known group of scholars is behind the enterprise , which appears destined to be successful .

		Mr.
T. W. Rhys-Davids	PERSON	gave the first course , which dealt with Buddhism .

		The second course , given last season , was by Dr.
Daniel 6	PERSON	.

		Brinton upon the general topic '' Religions of Primitive Peoples . ''

		The courses for
1898	DATE	and
1899	DATE	are already arranged ; they will deal with the religious history of
Israel	LOCATION	, and are to be presented by Dr.
Cheyne	PERSON	and Professor
Bndde	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	is no novice in the field of primitive religions .

		His previous studies , confined chiefly to the American field , have been important .

		In this course of lectures he has touched a more general theme and drawn material from the whole world .

		He begins by outlining methods and defining terms ; then passes to the origin and content of primitive religions .

		Three forms of religious expression are recognized the word , the object , the rite .

		Each is examined in detail .

		In his final lecture the author investigates the influence of their religions upon the lower peoples and the possible development of such religions .

		Every student , even if he may not agree completely with the author , will be glad of this con - venient and proper presentation of this subject .

		As the words '' primitive peoples '' occur in the title of the book , it is a pity Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	did not more nearly confine his discussions to the conceptions of the most primitive peoples known .

		Certainly the Aztecs and the Vedie Aryans are far from primitive , both in life and belief .

		One of the strongest of the many good points of the book is the constant analysis of subjects .

		The separation of primary elements and their clear definition is certainly most important .

		matrimonial consequence of the pretty volume entitled '' The Love Affairs of Some Famous Men '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is fairly indicated by its catchy title .

		The author , or rather compiler , presents a long list of famous authors , painters , musicians , divines , law - yers , statesmen , and so on , and shows us in a chatty anecdotal way how they '' got on '' with their wives and mistresses which was , it is needless to say , in many cases very badly .

		There was
John Wesley	PERSON	, for instance , who married a Mrs.
Vizelle	PERSON	, a widow whose subsequent conduct went far to bear out the theory of the elder
Weller	PERSON	.

		It is credibly related that Mrs.
Wesley	PERSON	was even given to beating her eloquent husband .


John Hampson	PERSON	, one of
Wesley	PERSON	's preachers , we learn , '' told his son that he once went into a room in the north of
Ireland	LOCATION	where he found Mrs.
Wesley	PERSON	foaming with rage .

		Her husband was on the floor .

		She had been dragging him about by his hair , and still held in her hand some of the locks that she had pulled out of his head .

		More than once she laid violent hands upon him , and tore those venerable locks which had suffered sufficiently from the ravages of Time . ''

		No wonder a man so afflicted could hold the view of things embodied in his expressive lines , '' A point of life , a moment 's space , Removes me to that heavenly place , Or shuts me up in hell . ''

		The volume is pleasantly written , and the author has ranged over a wide field in gathering his ex - amples .

		_ Some years ago , Professor
A. S. Cook	PERSON	, of
Yale Diversity	ORGANIZATION	, published an en - tertaining little book on '' The Bible and English Prose Style , '' in which he says that ' from
Caedmon	ORGANIZATION	's time to the present the influence of Bible diction upon English speech has been vir - tually uninterrupted . ''

		In his latest and more im - portant work , '' Biblical Quotations in Old English Prose Writers '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , beginning with the well-known Hymn of
Caedmon	LOCATION	, Professor Cook pre - sents an admirable conspectus of old English bib - lical versions from the seventh to the tenth century , embodying a summary of the best critical results of modern scholarship .

		The biblical scholar interested in the history of English versions , as well as the professional student of English , will hardly find else - where a more accurate survey of the field than ia here presented .

		The body of the book is taken up with extracts containing biblical quotations , from
King Alfred 's Version of Gregory 's Pastoral Care	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 60 pp . -RRB-

		, the
Laws of King Alfred	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 8 pp . -RRB-

		,
King Alfred 's Version of Bede 's Ecclesiastical History	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 6 pp . -RRB- '

		an d
Aelfric 's Homilies	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 182 pp . -RRB-

		, all with the Latin originals printed at the foot of the page .

		Of these the most interesting , perhaps , are the ex - tracts from the Laws of the good king , closing with 568 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, the quotation : '' And thaet ge willen thaet othre men eow ne don , ne doth ge thaet othrum mannum -LRB- quod toobis non vultis fieri , non faciatis aliis -RRB- , '' which forces the reflection that , after a thousand years , we are not yet near the Golden Age .

		To one familiar with
Latin	PERSON	, the acquisition of a reading knowledge of Anglo-Saxon could not be made easier .

		The book contains two complete indexes on '' Biblical Passages '' and on '' Principal Words . ''

		Ambrose Pare ' , surgeon to three kings A surgeon to o f
France	LOCATION	, i 8 the subject of an excel - Ihree kings ... , i lent monograph by Mr. otephen Paget -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Pare * , though wholly devoted to bis profession , lived in the midst of such stirring events that his personality and his position at court are often used by writers in presenting a picture of the times .

		Thus ,
Balzac	LOCATION	, in ''
Catherine de Medici	PERSON	, '' makes Pare * the central figure in a dramatic story of the death of
Francis II.	PERSON	, an incident merely referred to by the present author with the statement that the surgeon was accused by rivals of using means to prevent the recovery of his patient .

		That Pare * was a keen observer is shown by quotations from his '' Journeys in Diverse Places , '' and these , with a chapter of explanatory notes , furnish the most inter - esting reading in the present work .

		His ability in surgery , says the author , lay not so much in the invention of new methods as in the improvement of old ones .

		The vexed question of Park 's religion is decided in favor of Catholicism , although his hu - manitarian sentiments made him openly disapprove of the civil wars and gave opportunity to his ene - mies to charge him with being in secret a Huguenot .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
Henry P. Johnston	PERSON	, of the College of the
City of New York	ORGANIZATION	, has made an exhaustive study of a local engagement of the Revolutionary War .

		True , it was a minor engagement , and yet one which for the first time gave some confidence to the crude Continen - tal soldier , because he saw there a retreating red-coat .

		The result of the study has been admirably given to the public , with many maps and present-day photographs , in a monograph entitled `` The Battle of Harlem Heights '' -LRB-

		We can only say of such pub - lications that for those who like this sort of thing the present volume is undoubtedly the sort of thing they will like .

		The observation is trite , but one can hardly be expected to take seriously , except for their relation to the history of human thought , the works of
Cornelius Agrippa	PERSON	or any other writers of his general type . ''

		Its method is essentially that employed by Mrs.

		In other words , Mrs.

Parsons	PERSON	gives us a flora , prac - tically complete for practical purposes , of the region which includes

		Mr.
W. M. Griswold	PERSON	, whose annotated lists of books are so useful to librarians and readers in general , has sent us a catalogue of '' The Novels of

		Sometimes the review in question is boiled down into one expressive epithet , as in the following entry : ``
Annunzio	PERSON	, G : d' , ' Triumph of Death , ' Rich. : loathsome , D. , 11 . ''

		Mr.
Griswold	PERSON	's pamphlets offer , with their scientific classi - fication and absolute accuracy , an excellent illustration of how this sort of thing ought to be done .

		The present pamphlet also shows how it ought not to be done , by re - printing the '' Library Journal 's '' review , severe but not unjustifiably so , of a recent bibliography of prose fiction which made a most amazing display of inaccuracy and slovenly workmanship .

Boston	LOCATION	, has begun the pub - lication of a series of selected short French stories for students and schools , with English notes by Professor
Alphonse N. Van Daell	PERSON	of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes will be
twenty-five cents	MONEY	each .

		Messrs.

		One of the best of the many '' newspaper catalogues '' which are issued annually by the leading advertising agencies , is that prepared by
Messrs. Danchy & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The
1898	DATE	edition of this work is now ready , and forms a handsome volume of over seven hundred pages .

Canada	LOCATION	.

		We have received from Mr.
S. Burns Weston	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the American agent for the publication , several early numbers of a new English weekly called '' The Ethical World . ''

		Mr.
Stanton Coit	PERSON	, long asso - ciated with Dr.
Adler	PERSON	in the ethical movement in
New York	LOCATION	, is the editor of this paper , which offers an attrac - tive list of contents , by no means as narrowed in theme as one might at first suppose .

		It is true that ethical ideas underlie all of the contributions , but they range for all that over a fairly wide field of politics , sociology , and literature , and provide reading at once thoughtful and interesting .

		Each number of the paper has sixteen pages of `` Spectator '' size .

		The enterprise deserves hearty encouragement , and we are glad of the oppor - tunity to say these few words in its behalf .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons have now ready for publication the first of the four volumes to which their new '' Dictionary of the Bible '' will extend .

		The num - ber of articles will be about fifteen thousand , mostly signed , and the work will be sold only by subscription .

		An `` American Explorers '' series , edited by Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	, is announced by Mr.

Jacob Fowler	PERSON	's travels to the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	in
1821-22	DATE	, and the second will be '' Forty Years a Fnr Trader on the
Upper Missouri	LOCATION	, '' by
Charles Larpenteur	PERSON	.

F. Max Miiller	PERSON	, is devoted to Part IV .

		of Mr.
Julius Eggeling	PERSON	's translation of The Satapatha-Brahmana . ''

		Volume XL VII .

		in the same series is a continuation of Mr.
E. W. West	PERSON	's translation of selected '' Pahlavi Texts . ''

		These works , as we hardly need to add , are published by the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
1898	DATE	volume of that useful compendium , ''
Haz	PERSON	- ell 's Annual , '' being the thirteenth annual volume , is imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The num - ber of new articles included is , as usual , considerable , among them being the
Behring Sea Question	LOCATION	, the Re - public of
Central America	LOCATION	, Local Taxation ,
Foreign Navies	ORGANIZATION	, and biographies of Messrs.
John Hay	PERSON	and
Gil	PERSON	- bert
Parker	PERSON	. ''

		A History of the English Poor Law , '' by the late Sir

1860	DATE	, and has long been the standard authority upon its subject .

		A new edition of the work is now put forth by
Messrs. G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , in two stout volumes , edited by Mr.
H. G. Willink	PERSON	, who has supplied an extended biography of the author , besides incorporating with the text the many revisions made before his death .

Edinburgh	LOCATION	are the publishers of a neat paper-covered set of the shorter stories of Miss
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	.

		There are three volumes , in a box , and they are respectively entitled '' Spiritual Tales , '' '' Barbaric Tales , '' and '' Tragic Ro - mances . ''

		The volume of Miss
Macleod	PERSON	's work is now considerable , comprising , as it does , six other volumes in addition to these collections of short pieces .

		An
International Congress of History	ORGANIZATION	will be held at
The Hague	LOCATION	next
September	DATE	, organized under the au - spices of Her Majesty the Queen , and presided over by
His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and by
M. de Manlde la Claviere	ORGANIZATION	, General Secretary of the
Society of Diplomatic History	ORGANIZATION	, of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will be composed of diplomatists , histo - rians , and men of letters .

		Each nation may use its own language in the discussions and in the papers presented .

		Ladies may become members .

		The subscription is fixed at twenty francs , or four dollars .

		The papers read be - fore the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will be printed and distributed to the members .

		All questions relating to reduced rates of transportation and to accommodation of members , as 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, well as to receptions that will be given them , will he regulated by the local committee under the presidency of

Baltimore	LOCATION	,
Md.	LOCATION	-RRB- , of the
Society of Diplomatic History	ORGANIZATION	of
Paris	LOCATION	, has been appointed to organize , and to preside over , the section of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		That sprightly illustrated magazine , '' The Land of Sunshine , '' published at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, announces in its
April	DATE	issue some interesting plans by which it is to be made still more distinctively '' the magazine of Califor - nia and the West . ''

		Its capable and aggressive editor , Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, himself an entertaining and authoritative writer , has rallied to its support many well - known Western writers , or writers on Western subjects , among them Mrs.
Mary Hallock Foote	PERSON	, Mrs.
Margaret Graham Collier	PERSON	, and others .

		The magazine is to be stronger than ever in '' local color , '' but it is to be the color of the West rather than of
California	LOCATION	only .

		In Mich a scheme it is much to know that the colors are real , and applied by skilful hands ; and this we may count on , under Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's management .

		It would seem that the magazine has a field all its own , and is likely to fill it successfully and well .

		This entertaining book is a distinct addition to the personal side of Revolutionary literature , and it is peculiarly valuable because of its presentation of American life and of the fathers of the Republic as seen by a French visitor .

		The hero 's stormy youth and his adventurous and varied career give his reminiscences an intimate interest rarely to be found in historical fiction , while their historical value is obvious .

		His recollections include his association with
Washington	LOCATION	,
Hamilton	PERSON	,
Burr	PERSON	, and other conspicuous figures .

		Studies of Good and Evil .

		By Prof.
JOSIAH ROYCE	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The unity of this interesting and important book is derived from the author 's application of his theories of philosophic idealism to relatively practical pioblems .

		He shows bow his philosophical theory may be applied to the study of various issues relating to good and evil .

		The ' ' problem of evil '' as illustrated in Job , the case of
John Bunyan	PERSON	, '' Ten - nyson and Pessimism , '' together with various suggestive and illuminat - ing studies of self-consciousness , and some discussions of special issues , among which is the `` Squatter Riot of
1850	DATE	in
Sacramento	LOCATION	, '' are among the themes which are treated in a way that illustrates the intimate rela - tion of every fragment with the whole in the universe as idealism con - ceives it .

		The original thought and acute observation of the author find most striking phases of expression .

		302 A NEW THEORY OF BIOGRAPHY .

		Every reader is familiar with
Wordsworth	PERSON	's statement that in the sonnet '' Shakespeare un - locked his heart , '' and with
Browning	PERSON	's charac - teristic comment : '' Did Shakespeare ?

		If so , the less Shakespeare he . ''

		The controversy , although not narrowed to a simple question of Shakespearean interpretation , is older than either
Wordsworth	PERSON	or
Browning	PERSON	, and is likely to survive as long as literature itself .

		Does the poet indeed reveal himself in his work , or does he , in Olympian majesty , '' Sit as God holding no form of creed , But contemplating all '' ?

		It is not surprising that
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	- ing should have answered the question in dif - ferent if not opposite ways , for the earlier poet was essentially of the introspective type , while the later was as essentially dramatic , and the subjective aspect of thought was as sure to be emphasized by the one as its objective aspect by the other .

		The problem is no doubt an inde - terminate one , with something to be said for either solution ; but we are inclined to think that the dramatic solution has been taken a little too much for granted , and that a finer method of analysis than critics have been wont to apply will disclose personal elements in the most im - personal of utterances .

		If even the style be of the man himself , as Buffon once remarked , and as most of us are willing to allow , how much more should the style and its content taken to - gether prove a reflection of the poet 's individ - uality , and supply an intimate revelation of most that is really worth knowing about his life . '

		This question , as far as it relates to the baf - fling personality of the greatest of poets , has recently been taken up in certain critical quar - ters , and reopened for discussion in a way that must attract attention .

		The editor of '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' has published a series of subtly critical papers upon '' The True Shake - speare '' as he may be found in the deepest and most characteristic of the plays , while the col - umns of '' The Athenaeum '' have found room for the following strong deliverance : '' A poet , howsoever artistic , howsoever dramatic the form of his work may be , is occupied during his entire life in painting his own portrait .

		And if it were not for the intervention of the biographer , the reminiscence 282 THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, writer , or the collector of letters for publication , our conception of every poet would be true and vital accord - ing to the intelligence with which we read his work .

		This is why , of all English poets ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is the only one whom we do thoroughly know unless perhaps we should except his two great contemporaries ,
Webster	PERSON	and
Marlowe	PERSON	... We know how
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	confronted every circumstance of this mysterious life we know how he confronted the universe , seen and unseen we know to what degree and in what way he felt every hu - man passion .

		There is no careless letter of his , thank God !

		to give us a wrong impression of him .

		There is no record of his talk at the Mermaid , the Falcon , or the Apollo saloon to make readers doubtful whether his printed utterances truly represent him .

		Would that the will had been destroyed !

		then there would have been no talk about the ' second-best bed ' and the like insane gabble . ''

		The authority of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	also supports this view , and his recent study of Shakespeare con - tains nothing more significant and memorable than the passage which thus closes the work : '' It is the author 's opinion that , given the possession of forty-five important works by any man , it is entirely our own fault if we know nothing whatever about him .

		The poet has incorporated his whole individuality in these writings , and there , if we can read aright , we shall find him .

		The
William Shakespeare	PERSON	who was born at
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, who lived and wrote in
London	LOCATION	during her reign and that of
James	PERSON	, who ascended into heaven in his comedies and descended into hell in his tragedies , and died at the age of fifty-two in his native town , rises a wonderful per - sonality in grand and distinct outlines , with all the vivid colouring of life from the pages of his books , before the eyes of all who read them with an open , receptive mind , with sanity of judgment and simple susceptibility to the power of genius . ''

		Is there not in these passages more than a suggestion of a biographical method more prom - ising than that with which we have been con - tent hitherto ?

		In other words , when all has been said that may be gleaned from the most painstaking search of the records wherein the external aspects of a great writer 's life are re - vealed , do we really come to know him half as well as we might learn to know him from a rev - erent study of his works ?

		Who is there that , having once felt the glow of spiritual commun - ion with a beloved poet , does not become chilled when he seeks to supplement this intimate ac - quaintance by ferreting out accidents and triv - ialities of the poet 's everyday life ?

		Do we know such a man in the best sense when we merely know how he looked , and who were his associates , and how he earned his living , and what were the circumstances by which his ca - reer was shaped ?

		It may be well enough to know these things , but we must guard against claiming for them an undue significance .

		With the man of action , such things are all that are given us to know , but how much richer is the leg - acy left us by the man of thought !

		Do we often know a man 's life , however amply-documented , as we know the life of
Amiel	PERSON	, for example , and do not the works of every great writer un - consciously supply us with a '' Journal Intime '' which we may read if we will ?

		Of what sub - ordinate importance becomes '' chatter about
Harriet	PERSON	'' when we have the poems of Shelley ?

		And with the essays of Montaigne to reveal to us the soul of that worthy
Gascon	PERSON	, how little are we concerned with the Mayor of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	?

		It is occasionally said of a man that the study of his life shows him to have been greater than his works .

		This is sometimes true in the lit - eral sense , as in the case of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, whom assuredly '' The Rambler '' and '' The Lives of the Poets '' could not endear to us as he is en - deared by the journals of his faithful biographer .

		But this is a quite exceptional case ; and then , who knows how many other men , now little more than historical names , might loom up in our con - sciousness as vital and commanding figures had there been Boswells to limn them for us ?

		To the fame of a man who is essentially a Maker of lit - erature the memory of his other achievements can add little , and when we speak of him as greater than his work we fall into exaggeration , although of a generous and pardonable sort .

		What we are really doing is to give expression to our delight in discovering that the high ideals of the work have their counterpart in the life , that our hero realized his true self in his lesser activi - ties as well as in those greater activities by which he has earned remembrance .

		This sort of con - sonance is indeed rare , and when we discern it in the life of a
Dante	ORGANIZATION	or a
Milton	LOCATION	, our reverence is deepened , and our admiration echoes the sen - timent of
Rossetti	PERSON	when he speaks of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's proud refusal to accept a degrading amnesty . ''

		Such were his words .

		It is indeed For ever well our singers should Utter good words and know them good Not through song only ; with close heed Lest , having spent for the work 's sake Six days , the man be left to make . ''

		But the imperfection of nature is such that the man is often '' left to make '' in some parts of his composite individuality ; what we would now urge is that every man is entitled to be judged by his strength rather than by his weak - ness , and that the biographer of a great writer needs to remain ever on his guard lest the splendid services of his subject be dimmed or obscured by an over-insistence upon matters of irrelevant detail .

		Let us still be curious although not too curious concerning the ex - ternal history of the creators of literature ; but
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 let us also hold fast to the fact that the truest record of their lives is to be found in the books they have left us , that a formal biography can at best do nothing more than cast side-lights upon a poet 's personality , that a display of the trappings and the suits of life is but a poor substitute for the direct self-revelation offered by the work itself .

		THE GREATEST LITERARY FORM .

		It is worth while to repeat , with
Aristotle	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	, that tragedy is the top achievement of the human intellect .

		Of course this is not an universal opinion .

		The Greeks in general seem to have re - garded Homer as the norm of literature , and Proclus describes the tragic poets as wandering in intoxi - cated error from his true path .

		And
Keats	PERSON	says that '' The epic is of all the king , round , vast , and spanning all like
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	's ring . ''

		But these are enthusiasms .

		Most critics have agreed with
Aristotle	PERSON	, that tragedy contains all that the epic does , in a more concentrated form , and a great deal besides .

		Perhaps the inevitable dualism of life the Me and Not-Me comes out more definitely in the dialogue of tragedy than in any other form of literature .

		It is remarkable that whereas all the great epic poets have been believers , have accepted the religion or creed of their times and justified the ways of God to man , the greater dramatists , on the other hand , have all given a skeptical or doubtful solution of the problem of existence .

		Homer ,
Virgil	PERSON	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, Tasso the list is one of unquestioning wor - shippers .

		The Author of the Book of Job , - ^ Eschylus ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, this is just as surely a roll-call of doubters or deniers .

		Even
Calderon	PERSON	, the poet of Catholicism , in his two greatest plays , forgets his faith in the Cross and the
Inqui	LOCATION	- sition , and gives us the inexplicable struggle of thought .

		A practical explanation of this division of roles between the two orders of poets lies in the fact that the epic poet deals with the outward world with bodies and things .

		Gods , goddesses , angels , and demons , with their respective heavens and hells , are a lucky find for him an extension of his do - main .

		But tragedy deals with the human soul which is incapable of extension , only capable of division .

		It does not follow that epic poetry is the most religious or the most profound .

		It only shows God acting on the world directly ; but tragedy shows him as acting through His enemy His laws re - vealed by the very opposition to them .

		Aristotle 's dictum that tragedy , through fear and pity , effects a purification from such like passions , is one of his dark sayings that compel conjecture .

		In whom does it effect this purification , and how can pity purify from pity ?


Thomas Taylor	PERSON	, the trans - lator of Aristotle , is the only one , so far as I know , who decidedly asserts that the purification is not in the spectators .

		He says tragedy purifies from those perturbations which happen in the fable and are the cause of the unhappy events .

		This is illuminating night with black smoke .

		He seems to mean , how - ever , that the play evolves itself through agitation into calm , and conducts the spectator or reader through the same operations .

		Something like this is
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's view .

		But most commentators accept the usual view that terror and pity act on like passions .

		That such is the case , may be doubted .

		In Gray 's phrase , we '' may snatch a fearful joy '' at times from tragedy , but as a rule the spectator does not feel fear at all such instances as the women fainting on the appearance of the Furies pursuing Orestes being ex - ceptional ; nor is pity aroused to such an extent as would be required for purification .

		Indeed , I suspect the feeling awakened is more that which Lucretius frankly avows when he says that it is pleasant to stand safely on a cliff and behold a shipwreck .

		I think the main causes of our pleasure in tragedy are two : a feeling of admiration for power as it exhibits itself in the unrolling of events , an admira - tion like that with which we gaze on great destruc - tive exhibitions of natural force such as a thunder - storm or a volcano in action ; and , second , the feeling of sympathy and kinship for greatly doing or suf - fering characters .

		We feel that we too under like circumstances could oppose ourselves to the whole power of Fate , and equal it , at least , by defying it .

		Our pleasure in the mere display of power accounts for our tolerance of creations of utter wickedness , but of supreme intellect , such as
Richard	LOCATION	, or lago , or Mephistopheles ; and our feeling of kinship with extreme nobleness or greatness of character , caught in the toils of chance or design , explains our love for Hamlet and Othello .

		They give us a better opinion of ourselves .

		Energy triumphant in evil appeals to us , and good supreme in defeat gives us profound joy .

		Only weakness , moral or intellectual , repels us , and is unfitted for tragic representation .

		Hamlet is not weak in any sense .

		He does every - thing , sooner or later , which could be expected of a tragic hero .

		But his intellect is so vast that it is like illimitable space , where there can be no motion , because an object can never get farther from the centre or nearer to the circumference .

		In compar - ison ,
Faust	ORGANIZATION	is a weak and ignoble creation , bent on low aims and always led by the nose .

		I suppose there is no educated man who has not at some time imagined himself a Hamlet , but I never heard of anyone who wanted to be
Faust	LOCATION	, in spite of the youth , the riches , and the '' good fortunes '' of the German Doctor .

		The hypocritical pretense of a love for humanity , by which he evades just retribu - tion in the end , is a piece with the rest of his char - acter .

		Had he paid his debt to the devil like a gentleman , as did
Marlowe	PERSON	's Faustus and
Molie	PERSON	're 's
Don Juan	PERSON	, we might have some respect for him .

		As it is , be is a mere principle of gravitation holding together the incoherent atoms of a chaotic poem .

		The work lives by reason of the beauty of its cen - tral episode , the profoundly conceived character of 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Mephistopheles , and the wit , poetry , and philosophy with which it overflows .

		As a complete work of art , it has no claim to rank with the Greek trage - dies or with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	; and to place it beside the Divine Comedy , as some have done , is to equal a nebulae with a finished system of stars .

		The heroes of Greek tragedy were personalities ; those of Shakespeare are persons .

		In the Greek conception , the abstract idea is predominant ; in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, the concrete individual .

		Antigone or
Electra	ORGANIZATION	is universal girlhood placed in certain predicaments ;
Cordelia	LOCATION	and
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	are partic - ular women .

		Orestes is the ordinary filial human being in a most terrible position ; Hamlet is original , and unlike any other mortal .

		The collision with the Greeks is sharper and more definite .

		It does not soften itself with humor or human peculiarities .

		Its effect is more tremendous and instantaneous , but not so penetrating .

		It is a contradiction of abstract ideas that must destroy each other .

		The first condition under which we can take pleasure in the exhibition of tragic force is that we , the spectators , shall be safe from it .

		It follows that the more remote and ideal the presentations are , the better .

		Euripides brought tragedy down to earth , and his audiences seem to have felt that they were involved in the issues he exhibited that they were being sermonized and lectured ; and they dis - liked him accordingly .

		Ibsen , a modern Euripides , has done the same thing .

		We are willing to stand at gaze for the shafts of satire and laughter ; but tragedy is too serious a business to be brought home to our hearths and hearts .

		In true tragedy , hell opens at every footstep , and we can only stand this when it is sufficiently removed from us to be harm - less .

		We do not domesticate a tiger , or build our houses over an active volcano .

		Ibsen depicts the Furies moving among the trivialities and common - places of contemporary life .

		It is no answer to say that this is true , that the Furies do wreathe their snakes in town houses and villas .

		Aristotle 's law is absolute , that a possible improbability is a better subject for tragedy than an improbable fact .

		Be - sides , there is weakness and corruption in every one of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's characters , and there can consequently not be any effective collision between them .

		What is the moral of '' The Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	'' ?

		A fool mar - ries an idiot , and they expect perfect happiness .

		Every character in ''
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	'' is bad or silly .

		If they suffer , we say it serves them right and we do not care .

		Gina in '' The Wild Duck '' is
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's one rounded piece of humanity .

		It is a Shakespearean , a Cervantic conception ; and her demoniac husband is excellent fooling .

		But what are they doing among tragic issues ?

		They belong to comedy , and the sentimentalism of the other fig - ures ruins their vraisemblance .

		The characters of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's drama resemble those figures which children cut out of colored paper white , red , pink , or black .

		They are disks with - out projection .

		They have no bodies and no souls nothing but attitudes and apparel in abundance .

		His dramas are probably his poorest works , because they do not contain any of those children or very young people whom he did understand intuitively , and did not have to piece together out of theory .

		In spite of literary limitations , I am inclined to think that
Wagner	PERSON	will finally come to stand as the greatest tragic poet of modern times .

		He seized on a few great myths with a content of mighty virtues and vices , and a consequent struggle which must always shake the human soul .

		The life he depicts is truth , while
Ibsen	PERSON	's life is merely fact , and
Hugo	PERSON	's the phantasies of delirium tremens .

		English tragedy has not done itself proud in the last century .

		In spite of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's hazy conception of human nature and his failure in objective speech , the '' Prometheus Unbound '' and '' The Cenci '' are the best things it has to show .

		Byron , with a firmer grasp of fact , is far looser in his use of the drama .

		His '' Manfred '' and ''
Cain	PERSON	'' are the origins of the drama of monologue , the parents of a monstrous brood
Bailey	PERSON	's '' Festus , ''
Smith	PERSON	's '' Life Drama , '' Ibsen 's '' Brand , '' and much of
Browning	PERSON	's work .

		In all these , a single figure destroys himself from within ; with no adequate collision from without .

		Like all other literary forms , tragedy has fallen into hotch-pot in the novel .

		Hawthorne 's '' Scarlet Let - ter '' and
E. Bronte	PERSON	's '' Wuthering Heights '' are perhaps its best performances of the new mixture .

		The woman 's piece is stern and elemental enough , but
Hawthorne	PERSON	prettifies and sophisticates a good deal . ''

		The Scarlet Letter , '' a twilight melodrama , is hardly universal .

		All the environment and spe - cial pathology of Puritan life must be understood before it convinces .

		Properties and surroundings are indeed of small account in real tragedy .


Dumas	PERSON	's requisites a table , two chairs , two people , and a passion are enough for it .

		The late
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	had , I apprehend , a genuine tragic gift .

		He understood the transformations of character the heights and depths of human nature , its Hima - layas by the Indian Seas better than most moderns .

		But he gave himself up to the cultivation of style , as the Dutch did to their passion for tulips ; and perhaps with the same result .

		Ibsen is to be thanked for one achievement : he has compelled the attention of the reading public to plays .

		Why or when the custom of reading plays fell into disuse , is hard to state .

		In the
last century	DATE	they were universally read .

		But I suppose the ease of having everything spelled out to the scenery , character , incident by the novel , has indisposed the average mind for anything that requires intellectual effort and alertness .

		But the literary form which projects an action roundly , vividly , instantaneously , so that it may show as a whole yet be of polished beauty in its details , is too valuable to be lightly cast aside .

		It is absolutely immaterial to a play as a piece of literature whether it has been presented on the stage or not .

		The Greek tragedies are no longer given , and only a few of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's pieces , but that does not interfere with our enjoyment of them ; and a good play that has never seen the
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 285 boards ought to have an equal chance with readers with a new novel .

		It is necessary , of coarse , that dramatic work should conform to dramatic condi - tions , which for the most part are theatric conditions also .

		An interminable work , for instance , like Tay - lor 's ''
Philip van Artevelde	PERSON	, '' which runs on forever , ought not to call itself a play .

		And Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's dramas err against all dramatic construction and human reason , in their long speeches .

		We can only imagine that the characters themselves listen to each other by a sort of tacit convention that each one is to have his own innings , though some of them , indeed , do n't even allow this , but carry their bat out .

		Subject , therefore , to reason , the rescue of the play , and especially tragedy , as a literary form , is the most important art movement that can be under - taken .

		ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
April 18 , 1898	DATE	.

		The talk is still of magazines .

		I understand that one of onr younger publishing houses has had placed in its hands a very large sum , for the purpose of founding and carry - ing on a new illustrated weekly .

		From what I hear , it is to be a '' big thing , '' and likely to make some stir .

		The illustrated literary monthly , of which I have already told you , is still in embryo ; but , in the meantime , a company of literary and artistic gentlemen is busy plan - ning a new illustrated monthly magazine , to be devoted to the interests of the collector art , books , china , stamps , posters , and the rest .

		Each department is to have its special editor , and the magazine as a whole is to be under the management of a general director .

		The illustrations are to be a special feature , not merely reproductions , but largely of original work by our most accomplished black - and-white artists .

		Mr.
Oswald Crawfurd	PERSON	's ``
London	LOCATION	Review '' is to appear on
May 5	DATE	.

		From the prospectus I find that it is to be '' a high-class weekly Review deal - ing independently and impartially with Politics , Current Affairs , Literature , and the Money Market . ''

		Rather a handful to poise for one penny .

		The fashion for finely printed and elegantly bound library editions of our classic novelists is growing .


Stevenson	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Kipling	LOCATION	, Lever ,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Jane Austen	PERSON	have had their sponsors ; we are now to have a similar production of the works of the
Sisters Bronte	ORGANIZATION	.

		The edition is to consist of thirteen handsome large crown octavo volumes , and will include , when com - pleted , the '' Life , '' by Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	.

		The paper on which the stories will be printed is to equal that used for the best of the modern editions-de-luxe , and the '' get up '' generally will be in the taste to appeal to collectors and lovers of fine books .

		A complete bibliography is to be included in the `` Life . ''

		The publishers are
Messrs. Downey & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the first two volumes may be ex - pected early in
September	DATE	.

		Mr.
E. A. Petherick	PERSON	is one of onr most ardent Aus - tralasian bibliographers .

		For many years he has been engaged on a bibliography of
Australasia	LOCATION	and
Polynesia	ORGANIZATION	, until now the manuscript of his work , which was exhib - ited at the
International Library Conference	ORGANIZATION	in
July	DATE	last , extends to twenty-six quarto volumes .

		I understand that , since his retirement from business , Mr.
Petherick	PERSON	has been actively engaged in passing this magnum opus of bis through the press , and that it is on the eve of being published in an imperial octavo volume of nearly 1000 pages .

		Publishers are not finding affairs going as smoothly as they could wish .

		The several failures which have lately occurred may be followed by some more .

		In that event we may hope for a slackening of the present ten - sion .

		The new Chairman of the
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	is Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	, and Mr.
Murray	PERSON	is rather keen on having a '' close season '' in publishing .

		Perhaps he will take steps to realize it ; although it will be extremely difficult for publishers to agree to anything which ham - pers their freedom in their business operations .

		It might suit a great many to publish , say , from
September	DATE	to
April	DATE	; but there are just as many who favor issuing their novels in the holiday season .

		I fail to see why there should be such a '' close season . ''

		It simply means that the publications of twelve months are to be crowded into seven ; and how , in that event , the publishers can expect a proper appreciation of their wares , I can not see .

		What I conclude from such a course is , that the 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, competition would become keener , and the weakest would go to the wall .

		In other words , the larger pub - lishing houses would benefit in the long run .

		Book sales in our auction rooms are arousing a lively interest ; while the three months that are to come before the season closes will see some fine collections dispersed .

		The final portion of the
Ashburnham	LOCATION	library , the inter - esting antiquarian collection of Mr.
E. Walford	PERSON	, the books of Mr.
A. Morrison	PERSON	, and a few others , will all make much talk and good business for the '' second-hand trade . ''

		But what one obtains for a book at an auction sale , and the price that a bookseller often asks for it are not always the same .

		A fortnight ago , the collection of books and manuscripts of Mr.
H. B. Weaver	PERSON	was dis - persed by
Messrs. Christie & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the lots had been already offered for sale by a leading second-hand dealer in this city , so that a comparison between the prices asked and the prices obtained may easily be made .

		I have been amusing myself lately by making this com - parison , and the result is perfectly ludicrous .

		It may amuse you also , if I give a few examples .

		I remember once visiting the premises and looking at a really fine series of extra-illustrated books , consisting of Boydell 's '' History of the Thames , '' Home 's '' History of Na - poleon , '' and
Thiers	PERSON	's '' History of the French Revolu - tion . ''

		The series was truly a remarkable one , and amounted to nineteen magnificently bound atlas folio volumes , crammed with rare portraits and autographs .

		I have no doubt the set was worth 10,000 the price asked for it ; I am not in a position to say it was not .

		At the sale , however , the three works were sold sepa - rately , with this result : The
Boydell	PERSON	fetched 69 , Home 's '' Napoleon '' 84 , and
Thiers	PERSON	's '' French Revo - lution '' 115 , making a total of 268 !

		The question naturally arises which is the truer value , 10,000 or 268 ?

		A set of the first four folios of Shakespeare was also sold .

		The price asked by the bookseller was somewhere between
2000	DATE	and
3000	DATE	; the prices real - ized at the auction sale were 98 for the first , 64 for the second , 107 for the third , and 35 for the fourth or a total of 304 .

		A copy of the
1544	DATE	-LRB-
Lyons	PERSON	-RRB- edition of the '' Recueil des Histoires de Troye '' brought 24 10s .

		600 was the price attached to this .

		You will agree with me that a collector requires to be very careful in buying if he intends to make a profit by sell - ing his purchases at auction .

		I have come to the con - clusion that the power of a '' trade '' combination at an auction sale is not to be lightly treated and heedlessly reckoned with .

		Times are too dull for me to give you another instal - ment of prophecies .

		I must leave that to the many '' paragraphers '' of our many literary news columns .

		Just now , these gentlemen are simply rehashing inform - ation already announced .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE CLAIMS OF LYRIC POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		With the main contentions of the article '' In Regard to Poetry , '' by Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	, in THE DIAL of
April 1	DATE	, it is impossible not to agree .

		It is hinted , however , that lyric poetry , '' the expression of the spontaneous , the particular , and the immediate , '' has too little ideality to occupy a high place . ''

		Nothing is more certain , '' it is said further , '' than the indifference of the public to collections of the little leaves of song . ''

		The latter assertion is , indeed , too true .

		But must the anthologist be denied even the anticipation of member - ship in the choir invisible , resulting from devotion to this species of art in a sordid age ?

		Such a view would be not a little discouraging to some .

		Fortunately , the last paragraph of the leading article , on the opposite page of the same issue , saves much search for consolation .

		We see by the force of great examples that the specific and the proximate are some - times lost in the flood they unbar .

		Sometimes ?

		Nay , is not the measure of excellence in lyric poetry , as in all poetry , the degree of suggestiveness , of generali - zation , of applicability , afforded by its particularity and immediateness ?

		Examples by the score rush into the mind .

		Soracte standing in deep snow , the blazing sticks on the hearth , the harmless fun , have duplicated them - selves thousands of times under other forms in the affec - tions of the readers of
Horace	PERSON	's ode , by virtue of that little touch '' Leave to the gods the rest '' the dogma of which , as
Schopenhauer	PERSON	would say , is of no moment in comparison with its essential proposition , the ineffable comfort of the negation of the will , lit so brightly with its illustrative background .

		Heine has told us only the most general traits of the child '' like a flower , '' but the little poem in which no particular personality is en - shrined is intensely , purely lyric , and immortal .

		The essence of tragedy is in '' The Twa Corbies , '' of aspira - tion in '' Israfel '' and the '' Ode to the West Wind , '' of eulogy in the sonnet '' To
Mary Unwin	PERSON	, '' of the rhythmic rising of the sap and stirring of the blood in `` Sir
Laun	PERSON	- celot and Queen Guinevere , '' of freedom in '' To Althsea from Prison , '' of loss in
Petrarch	LOCATION	's sonnet '' Soleasi nel mio cor star bella e viva '' with its pregnant close ''
Veramente	PERSON	siam noi polvere ed umbra ; Veramente la voglia e cieca e ` ngorda ; Veramente fallace e la speranza , '' of hard - won deep peace in ''
Hesperia	LOCATION	, '' of romanticism in ''
Kubla Khan	PERSON	, '' of homesickness in the '' Old
Ken	PERSON	- tucky Home '' and the ''
Swanee River	PERSON	, '' of endeavor in ''
Ulysses	PERSON	, '' of the mystery of youth in '' To a Cuckoo '' ; and he would be a hardy critic who would maintain that the shortness of any of these prevents it from sinking as deeply into the soul as if it had been extended to dramatic length .

		Every recluse may find his apology in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's sestina '' I saw my soul at rest upon a day . ''

		In this waif , ostensibly from
North Carolina	LOCATION	, `` De little chillen 's feet so weary ,
Lord	LOCATION	; So weary , so weary , Lord !

		De little chillen 's feet so weary , Lord !

		Call de little chillen ,
Lord	LOCATION	.

		Come , come , little chillen , come to me , '' who cares whether a creed or a need is implied , whether the '' chillen '' are children or figures of speech , black or white , American or Scandinavian ?

		The thought of the brief poem which seems to have moved Poe to ex - claim , '' In perfect sincerity I call and think
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	the noblest of all poets , '' poises itself but for a moment in `` happy autumn fields '' ; it is weighted with the sum of experience .

		Nor can the apparently local minutiae of descriptive lyrics be judged in fitness by any other than this test .

		The elusive but powerful influence of external nature , felt in the freshness and wonder of youth , attending the vigor of resolve , or the fleeting delight of attainment , or the poignancy of loss ; always a subtle stay , an unob - trusive sympathy , even a mirror of our best selves in circumstances which still , it may be , guide our dearest motives , or grant the zest of new ones ; the entity that
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 sometimes almost assumes the weight and character of a personality , as , when one is listening for trivial sounds , '' A gentle shock of mild surprise Has carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain torrents ; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind With all its solemn imagery , its rocks , Its woods , and that uncertain heaven received Into the bosom of the steady lake , '' this presence returns with all its witchery and all its rev - elation at the adequate mention of '' the intense tranquillity Of silent hills , and more than silent sky , '' and thus forms at once and definitely a qualification for a highest class in objective lyrics , identical with that which we have found to characterize the best subjective ones .

		Such a lyric is the perfect first half of Shelley 's fragment '' Summer and
Winter	DATE	'' ; another is the lines of
Keats	PERSON	, ' The clouds were pure and white as flocks new-shorn , And fresh from the clear brook ; sweetly they slept On the blue fields of heaven , and then there crept A little noiseless noise among the leaves , '' and so on .

		Another is
Frederick Tennyson	PERSON	's `` The Blackbird . ''

		Perhaps
Shelley	PERSON	's `` The Question '' is the highest example of the kind , showing as it does how even a '' landscape inventory '' may be a repository of covert feeling and suggestion through the magic of lyric art .

		But , it will be said , whatever one 's theory of this art , the fact remains that it is not popular .

		Is the circum - stance accidental or essential ?

		The writer inclines to the former view .

		Since we have learned that the emo - tions have a physical basis , it may be said that the phys - ical capacity of the heart or emotional soul is , like that of the brain , limited .

		The strenuous clanking of the machinery of what constitutes the life of nearly all is too obstreperous for even musically attuned ears to dis - tinguish delicate strains through .

		In the comparative neglect of the lyric under ordinary conditions of exist - ence may be faintly discerned a proof of its inherent and future supremacy .

		It is quite conceivable and possible that many more may be fitted to learn to appre - ciate lyric art -LRB- as one learns to understand the highest music -RRB- than ever have the opportunity presented to them , or the least incentive to acquire it .

		Not only is sensitiveness requisite , but also an absorption and a calm quite beyond the material reach of most , and this , too , in exact proportion to the value of the art product .

		Neither
Schubert	PERSON	nor
Keats	PERSON	can make their message heard in the hurly-burly of ordinary life , though the ears and the eyes have their will ; but the Gospel Hymns , and novels , are understood and appreciated .

		Even among cultured people of leisure , one may question whether the art -LRB- for such it is -RRB- of reading lyric poetry is widely known .

		How many readers of this journal have assimilated all the few great inspired lyrics of the English tongue alone , on a hundred occasions , more or less , each time letting every ramification of thought , every turn of phrase , every shade of expression , every step toward the central emotion , every association and every picture called up , filter imperceptibly through the consciousness in slow repeated readings ?

		It takes twenty or thirty minutes to properly construe '' Tears , idle tears , '' and unless this is done spontaneously , the time is wasted .

		In this respect music has the advantage , for any pro- duction may be more or less of an exercise in technique , if nothing more .

		Small wonder that we are fairly famil - iar with the requirements of musical training , but bar - barians in pure literature .

		Formal class-room training for poetic appreciation , in mediocre hands defeats its own object ; hence , very wisely , is generally omitted .

		The seclusion of soul so necessary for the first stages of the growth of the tender plant of poetic feeling is con - spicuous by its absence in contemporary society , for many reasons having no close relation to capabilities in that direction .

		Certain subordinate characteristics , how - ever , which mark off some varieties of poetry as narra - tive or dramatic , make somewhat easier an approxima - tion to poetic culture along those lines .

		Hence it is that we have something called by that name , which , lured largely by external trappings plot and personality is disposed to be indifferent to the absorbing , exclusive , imperative requirements of due familiarity with lyric art .

		However , it is in any case not absolutely necessary to prove that what the public does not want would be good for it .

		There are all shades of Philistinism .

		So much depends on the point of view , that one is almost tempted to wander into a disquisition on the immediateness and particularity of fiction and the drama , as distinguishing characteristics of non-lyric production .

		It is at least true that in proportion as the personalities treated are more sharply defined , they are more circum - scribed in their application than the best lyric entities ; for one does not willingly identify himself with a dif - ferent external individuality ; and , apart from their suc - cess as portraits or creations , they attain their greatest power when least limited in qualities affecting the sym - pathy of the reader , as distinguished from his curiosity or wonder .

		But sympathy is a peculiarly lyrical emotion .

		The point of view , again , makes it possible to say as much on one side as on the other on the question whether men 's souls find their needs better met by coming to a conclusion of weight after a contemplation of a long , complex series of external actions , or by reaching the same inference through the medium of subtle suggestion in the light of the understanding furnished by personal experience .

		The former process is doubtless at present better adapted to further a spiritual growth of the masses , hampered as they are by the stress of living .

		But it does not seem clear in what the implied intrinsic inferiority of the latter consists , since its lack of ideality is apparent instead of real .

		Any species of literature , as distinguished from knowledge , exalts only in so far as it confirms or intensifies our range of experience .

		Poetry is intuition , eternal fitness , through but not be - cause of thought .

		It is a tacit recognition of , and en - thusiasm for , moral principles so fundamental in their nature that the poet 's sole office , as such , is to recall to the minds of men that they are , without a syllable of didacticism , or of explanation , not potential in the hearer .

		Evidently , this is accomplished by evoking con - crete transfusing emotions .

		Whether these incentives to insight are or are not cast in dramatic form would seem to be a minor consideration .

		The Ivric , the dra - matic , and the narrative treatments are but different modes of attaining the same end , the choice of the mode being dependent on comparatively adventitious circum - stances .

		The lyric is the more sympathetic ; the non - lyric is the clearer , more vivid , because it appeals to the external attention .

		If in the dim future lies a period when literature shall be exempt from fashion or groping '' tendencies , '' and valued for its permanent elements , the conclusion does not as yet seem inevitable that lyric art will occupy second place .

		288 -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, MEMOIRS or AN IRISH NATIONALIST .

		* Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy	PERSON	is one of the many Irishmen who , leaving their native country to seek a more congenial political clime abroad , have shown through a career of distinguished public services in the land of their adoption how questionable is the charge of political worthless - ness levelled against them in the land of their birth .

		A
Celt	ORGANIZATION	, a Catholic , a whilom '' rebel , '' Sir
Charles	PERSON	is distinctively a member of that class of his countrymen of whom it is freely asserted that they can neither govern nor be governed ; and it is not uninstructive to note , as possibly serving to cast some light on the merits of this sweeping proposition , that while in the one hem - isphere Sir
Charles	PERSON	's public activities landed him eventually in
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	, in the other they culminated in a premiership .

		It would seem to be
Erin	PERSON	's hard lot that all countries save her are free to profit by and suitably recognize the abilities of her sons .

		Sir
Charles	PERSON	has , to our thinking , devoted a rather disproportionate share of his usually lively and entertaining memoir to events and measures which properly belong to general Irish history , and which he has already discussed with all the fulness they deserve in a professedly historical work .

		It would , of course , have been virtually impossible for him to have told the story of his life , or of the earlier phase of it at least , without touching pretty frequently on the topics in question , for his career has been , as all know , closely identified with the Irish nation - alist cause .

		It may even be said that his sobri - quet of the '' Irish Mazzini '' is not altogether ill-deserved , since it is undoubtedly largely ow - ing to Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy	PERSON	's intelligent work as a political propagandist that anything like a really considerable and pervasive senti - ment or consciousness of Irish nationalism ex - ists to-day .

		Our present complaint , however , is that Sir
Charles	PERSON	, with a self-effacement rare in autobiographers , too frequently loses sight of his own story proper to range afield into the not very edifying annals of the Repeal and
Young Ireland	LOCATION	periods .

		the tale of Irish woes and Irish wrongs and abortive Irish enterprises , to which a once sympathetic world now inclines to turn a somewhat impatient ear , getting into his recital very much as King
Charles	PERSON	's head got * MY LIFE IN Two HEMISPHERES .

		By Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with portrait .


New York	LOCATION	: The
Macmillan Go	ORGANIZATION	.

		into the memorial of
David Copperfield	PERSON	's friend Mr.
Dick	PERSON	.

		Even the author 's Hibernian read - irs , we fancy , will grudge the space he bestows on the familiar records of
O'Connell	PERSON	's '' bluff - ing '' agitation with its sorry collapse at Clon - tarf , the callow
Young Ireland	LOCATION	movement with its sham Girondism and rapturous schoolboy enthusiasm for French and Hellenic models , the
Smith O'Brien	PERSON	'' rebellion '' with its farcical end in a cabbage-garden , and the rest of it .

		Into the larger record of these events Sir
Charles	PERSON	does not go in extenso ; but he thinks it worth while to try to clear up for the world the by no means delectable inside history of the paltry squabbles of the nationalist leaders among themselves , which did so much to alien - ate foreign sympathy and served to breed a pretty general doubt of the ability of Irishmen to cooperate for long cordially and unitedly in the Irish cause .

		Having prefaced so much by way of stricture , we hasten to say that the story of our author 's romantic and checkered career as journalist , revolutionist , prisoner of state in the one hem - isphere , and as politician , statesman , and Prime Minister in the other is well worth the telling , and it is told so well , where the author adheres to it , that the reader grudges the more the space given over to the digressions already noted .

		The opening chapter is devoted to an account of the author 's boyhood and youth in the Ulster town of
Monaghan	PERSON	, and the remainder of the first volume and about one-third of the second are taken up with his experiences as journalist and agitator , and with the story of the fortunes of the earlier Irish nationalist movement gen - erally , its rise , culmination , disintegration , and decline , down to the date of his departure for a more promising field of political activity in the new hemisphere .

		It was in
1855	DATE	that Sir
Charles	PERSON	, despairing of an
Ireland	LOCATION	'' where Mr.
Keogh	PERSON	typified patriotism and Dr.
Cullen	PERSON	the Church , '' sailed for the
South Pacific	LOCATION	; and the final two-thirds of his concluding volume deal largely with events of Australasian political history in which the writer bore a conspicuous and honorable part .

		When Sir
Charles	PERSON	arrived at
Melbourne	LOCATION	the motley population of that now handsome and thriving city was just beginning to settle down into a semblance of old-world social decorum , and he preserves some racy pic - tures of the manners that prevailed during the saturnalia following the discovery of gold .

		The dominant class -LRB- while their '' luck '' lasted -RRB- were the '' new aristocracy '' of successful dig - gers , who used to flock into town laden with
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 '' dust '' and nuggets , bent on an orgy to com - pensate them for a season of hard work and enforced abstinence . ''

		Drunkenness was their ordinary enjoyment , and the public houses swarmed at all hours of the day and night with roaring or maudlin topers .

		The mad recklessness of that time exceeds all belief .

		I have heard from eye - witnesses stories of diggers ordering the entire stock of champagne in a public house to be decanted into wash - tubs , and stopping every passer-by with an invitation to swill ; of one frantic toper , when he had made all com - ers drunk , insisting upon having the bar counters washed with claret ; of pier-glasses smashed with a stock-whip in order to make an item worth the attention of a million - aire ; of diggers throwing down nuggets to pay for a dram ; of pipes lighted with a cheque ; of sandwiches lined with banknotes .

		A favorite recreation of the digger on his pleasure trip was to get married .

		A bride was not diffi - cult to discover , who permitted herself on short notice to be adorned with showy silks and driven in an equipage as fine as the circumstances permitted to a bridal which , in many cases , bound them together only during good pleasure . ''

		Like many young towns of a type familiar in this country ,
Melbourne	LOCATION	in
1855	DATE	, though still a straggling village in the by-streets of which stumps of primeval trees were visible , had grandiose views of its immediate future .

		The Public Works department was housed in a shanty , and the Law Offices held sway in a vacant corn store ; but high-sounding names of streets and buildings were rife , and a new Par - liament
House	ORGANIZATION	was planned on a scale so gor - geous that after forty years it is not yet finished .

		There was already a creditable Public Library building , stocked with a strange assortment of books that might , one fancies , have been se - lected by some humorous digger , of a bookish turn , by way of a joke on his unlettered fellow townsmen . ''

		The modern poets were represented by
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	and a single poem of
Tennyson 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The modern novelists stopped with Scott ... But the antiquities of
Athens	LOCATION	and
Attica	LOCATION	were abundantly represented .

		Three hundred volumes of Greek and Latin classics and the Book of Common Prayer in German , French , Italian , Greek , modern Greek , and Spanish ; twelve volumes of the
Bridgewater	LOCATION	Treatises and their antithesis ,
Hobbes	LOCATION	.

		in sixteen volumes were offered as refreshment to the weary . ''

		These matters , of course , are mended in modern
Melbourne	LOCATION	, where the visiting stranger can now walk at will into the same building , and find himself '' as conveniently provided with facili - ties for study as in the reading-room of the British Museum . ''

		Of the humors of Australian political life , Sir
Charles	PERSON	preserves a number of specimens which may be exemplified by the following brace of parliamentary stories . ''


R. C. Aspiuall	PERSON	was a great humorist , and everybody could cite some happy mots of his , as notable for prompt - ness as for felicity .

		He was addressing the
House	ORGANIZATION	some - what vaguely one evening , when a member of Cockney genesis interposed with a question to the Speaker , '
May	DATE	I ask , sir , what is before the ` Ouse ? '

		An H , I sub - mit , ' says
Aspinall	PERSON	... Dr.
Evans	PERSON	said good things , but they were witty and wise rather than humorous .

		He was an old man , and it had become a familiar joke to speak of him as belonging to the era of Queen
Anne	PERSON	.

		On some occasion when he referred to Queen
Anne	PERSON	in a speech there were various cries of ' Did you know her ?

		What was she like ? ' '

		Yes , sir , ' rejoined the Doctor , ' I did know her .

		The scholar is contemporary with all time . ' ''

		Sir
Charles	PERSON	has judiciously leavened his ac - count of his dual public career with a due admix - ture of reminiscences and pen-sketches of celeb - rities he has seen and known .

		Early on the list of these is
Tom Moore	PERSON	, of whom the writer had a glimpse while employed on the
Dublin	LOCATION	'' Register '' late in the thirties .

		He had sat down to luncheon on a
Sunday	DATE	, and was sum - moned below by a message from a gentleman on urgent business . ''

		When I descended I found a little , middle-aged man , with a pleasant smile and lively eyes , but of a coun - tenance far from comely , and so elaborately dressed that the primrose gloves which he wore did not seem out of harmony with the splendor of his attire .

		But my interest was awakened in an instant when he told me his ' name was
Moore Thomas Moore	PERSON	. '

		He had come to ask for a proof of some words spoken the night before at the theatre on a universal call from the house .

		I knew the Irish melodies from boyhood .

		Later I had learned to taste the bitter-sweet of his political squibs , and revel in the veiled sedition of
The Fireworshippers	ORGANIZATION	. '

		There was probably no one living I would have seen with more satisfaction , and he enjoyed my sympathy . ''

		Sir
Charles	PERSON	was returned as a member of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	in
1852	DATE	, and his diary of that period furnishes some lively pen-portraits of notable colleagues . ''

		The most striking figure in the assembly was its official leader , Mr.
Disraeli	PERSON	.

		In the front benches , crowded with Englishmen , for the most part bright com - plexioned and always punctiliously fresh in linen and visage , sat a man approaching fifty , with swarthy fea - tures and a complexion which had once been olive , on every lineament of which was written foreigner and alien .

		It was not an uncomely face , and far from un - impressive , but it was conspicuously un-English .

		Mas - culine will and unflinching purpose might be read , it seemed to me , in the firm mouth and strong jaw gifts worth nearly all the rest in the art of governing men .

		He dressed in complete disregard of conventional preju - dices .

		A Chancellor of the Exchequer in a plum-colored vest was a sight as perplexing to trim propriety as Ro - land 's shoe-ties in the court of
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		And he cultivated on his chin an ornament rarely seen and little loved north of
Calais	LOCATION	, a goatee ... Some of his post - prandial mots steal out , and I should think make fatal enemies .

		Somebody asked him lately if Lord
Robert M.	PERSON	was not a stupid ass . '

		No , no , ' said
Benjamin	PERSON	, ' not at all ; he is a clever ass . '

		... Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was not yet the official leader of the Feelites , but he was the most 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, noteworthy of them , and attracted close observation .

		He was habitually grave , it seemed to me , and spoke as if he uttered oracles , yet he left the impression that his speeches were not only improvised , but that the process of adopting a conclusion was not always complete when he rose to speak .

		But the vigor and grace of his rhet - oric put criticism to flight .

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	, which relished the persiflage of
Palmerston	LOCATION	, thought
Gladstone	PERSON	too seri - ious , and resented a little , I think , the subdued tone of contemptuous superiority in which he addressed the leader of the
House	ORGANIZATION	...
Palmerston	LOCATION	has a gay , debonair appearance , which finds much favor with the
House	ORGANIZATION	, but on me he makes the impression of a play - actor cast in the part of a patriot statesman .

		Carlyle says he is a fitting leader for an age without sincerity or veracity . ''

E. G. J. KON-RELJGION	PERSON	IN THE FUTURE .

		* Drelincourt once brought together two hun - dred and sixty-two hypotheses regarding sex which he demonstrated to be groundless , only to have
Blumenbach	PERSON	characterize his own theory as the two hundred and sixty-third .

		So , when
M. Guyau	PERSON	takes up the philosophical systems of his predecessors , each fondly believed by its author to contain the method by which all future thought is to be guided , curiosity is at once excited to see whether he will himself propose some similarly pretentious metaphysical pan - acea .

		This curiosity , to tell the truth , animates the reader quite to the final page of the com - * THE NON-RELIGION OF THE FUTURE : A Sociological Study .

		By
M. Quyau	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		pendious volume which he calls '' The Non - Religion of the Future . ''

		When concluded , a feeling of admiration succeeds admiration for the dexterity with which
M. Guyau	PERSON	has permitted his own thought to be interpreted in terms of the others .

		If he escapes critical responsibility thereby , he also fails to outline a complete system of what , in his judgment , the world will come to accept instead of existing creeds .

		Though monism unquestionably makes the strongest appeal to the author in this regard , he does not hold it as containing the final word , but seems rather to believe that it will open a way for something conclusive .

		Polemic as such a work must necessarily be , the construction of this is singularly likely to provoke controversy .

		Though simple in plan , every detail is certain to call forth objection , if not objurgation .


M. Guyau	PERSON	is convinced that religion is doomed , that human progress is away from all faith , that time only is needed wherein to wean humankind from the churchly pabulum which has heretofore been , in all stages of its progress , its chief intellectual nourishment .

		He supports his assumption with much direct argu - ment ; but nothing of all that he adduces in this way is so impressive and so provocative of dissent as the self-satisfied manner in which he marshals the effects of vanished religion upon the human world and all its components , the church , the state , the family , the man , the woman , the child everything is examined in the light of his thesis and his conclusions set down in a detail which becomes too abundant .

		Then , having divested mankind of all these superfluities and superstitions , he unfolds , sys - tematizes , and examines the philosophies capa - ble of substitution : theism , atheism , pantheism , idealism , materialism , monism .

		The book has for its secondary title '' A Sociological Study , '' and it is a conception of deity as sociomorphic -LRB- a hideous word -RRB- , rather than anthropomorphic , which appears to be its principal original contribution to a study of the religious question .

		M. Guyau shows an inti - mate acquaintance with many of the authorities , English and American as well as French and German , yet he omits mention of the late
William Kingdon Clifford	PERSON	, whose unfinished essays on '' The Scientific Basis of Morals '' and kindred topics occupy substantially the same grounds as his own Introduction in attributing the origin of the gods and divine law to an extension of the social sense . ''

		Religion was in the beginning nothing more than an imagin - ative extension of human society , '' says M.
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 291 Guyau . ''

		In the highest natures the tribal self is incarnate in nothing less than humanity , '' says
Clifford	PERSON	; and the statements indicate their agreements not less than their divergences .

		Both find a social origin for conscience and both illustrate that trend of modern thought whereby sociology is taking to itself the pre - eminent position once occupied by theology as * ' Queen of the Sciences . ''

		The development of the discussion involves the philosopher here in a consideration of the questions of the day .

		Socialism , commercialism , and fifty more '' current topics , '' find place in our author 's pages , and are made to fit skilfully into the mosaic which reflects his own views .

		In the population sense , he finds the one thing which he admits to be present in religion and absent from any of its possible substitutes ; the fact that religion has already failed in this re - gard in his own
France	LOCATION	apparently not occur - ring to him .

		As successive chapters consider allied topics from various points of view , the book , from being contemporaneous becomes repetitious and discursive , the slender thread of its author 's views being broken too often by the heavy matters he takes from others to hang to it .

		Moreover , the book is frequently inaccurate in detail , however successfully it may set forth certain broad truths .

		What , for instance , can be made of such a judgment as this : '' The ideas of
Kant	PERSON	and
Schelling	PERSON	, when they passed into Amer - ica , gave birth to
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's and
Parker	PERSON	's trans - cendentalism ;
Spencer	PERSON	's theory of evolution be - came , in
America	LOCATION	, a religion of Cosmism , as presented by Messrs.
Fiske	PERSON	,
Potter	PERSON	, and Sav - age '' ?

		The Ethical Culture movement is to M. Guyau '' simply a great mutual aid temper - ance society , '' a rather wild characterization , for which the translator is probably responsible .

		Yet he hastens to add that '' it is certainly one of the forms of social activity which are des - tined to succeed ritualistic religions . ''

		The fundamental objections to
M. Guyau	PERSON	's general contention are two , one logical and one practical .

		Define religion as he will , he merely escapes from one definition to another in throw - ing from it the cloak of dogma .

		His invention of '' non-religion '' and '' a-religion '' can not blind his readers to the fact that even in that term all that is '' religious '' in a very real sense all that
Clifford	PERSON	includes under the word * ' piety '' is retained .

		Even his climax , a state - ment of the ideal conditions which may be evoked in the non-religious society of the future , is based upon a theory of human love which is assuredly of the essence of theoretical
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		Here he depends upon his imagination only to prove his own dictum that '' imagin - ation usually plays with loaded dice . ''

		In this consideration his boasted logic fails to hold to - gether .

		On the other hand , he has neglected a practical method for testing his main hypoth - esis .


France	LOCATION	, he contends , is already non - religious , especially in respect of its men of affairs .

		Would it not have been more profit - able , to theologians , sociologists , and philoso - phers generally , if he had told us what the trend of thought is there , as a matter of fact , rather than to speculate upon what it is going to be throughout the world , as a matter of con - jecture ?

		M. Guyau permits himself to exam - ine successively the metaphysical systems from which he believes the substitute for religion will arise , in the midst of a society which his con - text discloses as swayed by a multitude of con - siderations ; and never a metaphysical one among them .

		Does not the simple statement of his ideal carry with it its own refutation ?

		The curse of labor being upon us , can the hu - man race as a whole ever look forward to a calm and equable life under the bland light of ab - stract reasoning ? ''

		There are no lacunas in the human soul , it is a prey to invincible con - tinuity , '' he says , profoundly enough .

		But in all the panorama , from the '' sociomorphism '' of the present to the metaphysical contentment of a vastly remote future , does he not assume a breach of continuity ?

		Is there not before the student a condition of affairs in
France	LOCATION	to-day which is equally aloof from
M. Guyau	PERSON	's '' re - ligion '' and `` non-religion '' ?

		a literal solu - tion of the continuity he seeks for his pro- gramme ?

		It is not unlikely that many of the difficulties which oppress the reader of this work are due to the translation .

		Hardly a page remains un - marred by solecisms and sentences so entangled that a guess at their meaning is all that is left .

		It would seem as if there had been a collabora - tion some person not too familiar with French being assisted by some one lacking in English .

		Open the book at random , and one will find such a mixture as this : '' They -LSB- the Jesuits -RSB- have even been accused of whispering to advice for the preservation of certain inheritances '' -LRB- p. 328 -RRB- . ''

		What the Germans call the heart of nature ' '' comes to be , in its passage from French to English , an Irish bull .

		Money , ther - mometric degrees , and the like , are indicated by figures alone , leaving it wholly indeterminate what standard is intended .

		In proper names there is nothing short of an orgy : '' Servetius '' 292 THE DIAL -LSB-

		HITTELL 'S HISTORY OF
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	.

		* Enough '' History of
California	LOCATION	'' to satisfy the most enthusiastic dwellers by the
Golden Gate	ORGANIZATION	is given in Mr.
Theodore H. Hittell	PERSON	's four thick octavo volumes that together foot up 8460 pages .

		This unreasonable voluminous - ness is due to the introduction of matter that is either foreign to the subject or is of too little consequence to justify its introduction into a State history ; or to pure prolixity .

		The rela - tions of
California	LOCATION	to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	in the Civil War is an interesting topic , for example , and should be fully and clearly stated in such a work ; but no possible reason can be assigned for giving a comparatively full account of the whole Civil War .

		What the '' Battle above the Clouds '' and ``
Sheridan	PERSON	's Ride '' have to do with the history of
California	LOCATION	, it would be hard to say ; but here they are , nevertheless .

		Another kind of bad judgment is illustrated by the introduction into the final chapter of an account , a page and a half in length , of the attempt that was made to induce the legislature of
California	LOCATION	to buy Mr.
Hubert H. Bancroft	PERSON	's books and manuscripts , which is characterized in no kindly terms .

		Delicate professional feel - ing , as well as sense of proportion , would have suggested that the incident be omitted alto - gether or be relegated to a brief foot-note .

		The impression made by the external features of the work is confirmed by its internal ones .

		It is a ponderous performance .

		The author piles up facts , gathered from a vast number of sources , with great zeal and industry , mountain high ; but the book is heavy reading .

		Open it anywhere you please , and you are struck by its ponderousness .

		Nor is it the matter alone that makes the book heavy ; in fact , matter and manner are very well suited to each other .

		The style is generally laborious .

		The result is that the reader who goes through the work will be carried along by his own interest in the subject , or in the matter , not by the writer 's skill .

		Such a reader may find the long way attractive , but not because he is beguiled by the historian 's art .

		It is almost unnecessary to say that Califor - * HISTORY OF
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	.

		By
Theodore H. Hittell	PERSON	.

		In four volumes .


San Francisco	LOCATION	:
N. J. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		nia offers to the historian an extensive and an attractive field .

		It embraces interesting ele - ments of the most varied character , extending from the time of
Hernando Cortez	PERSON	to the time of
Senator Hearst	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here are sections bearing such headings as '' Early Voyages , '' '' The Jes - uits , '' `` The Franciscans , '' `` Early Mining , '' '' The Spanish Governors , '' '' The Mexican Governors '' ; and it is needless to say that they are very inviting , especially when considered in the two environments furnished by nature and history .

		All these subjects , and others too , the author has investigated with much care and thoroughness ; he has made a valuable contri - bution to fact or information ; and it is to be regretted that he was unable to work his mate - rial , or rather so much of it as he should have used , into a more attractive form .

		Different classes of readers will find the centre of interest in different parts of the work ; but the ordinary reader , we hazard little in saying , will find it in those chapters that pre - sent the series of events that led up to the Amer - ican occupation and conquest of
California	LOCATION	in 18467 , and its admission to the
Union	LOCATION
three years later	DATE	.

		When everything is taken into account , these events are hardly second in ro - mantic interest to any others in our national his - tory , and it must be said , in justice to Mr.
Hit	PERSON	- tell , that he has given us a very full account of them .

		The Spaniards in
California	LOCATION	, like Spaniard * in other parts of
America	LOCATION	, were thoroughly jealous of foreigners .

		Especially , the Spanish authorities on the
Coast	ORGANIZATION	, like the Spanish author - ities in
Louisiana	LOCATION	in the
last quarter	DATE	of the eigh - teenth century , had a premonition of what the coming of the American meant .

		Curiously enough , too , the story opens in
California	LOCATION	with the publication , in
1796	DATE	, of the treaty of
San Lorenzo	LOCATION	, which put the old quarrels between the two countries in relation to boundaries and the use of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	in the way of settlement . ''

		Towards the end of the same year , '' our author tells us , '' the ship ' Otter , ' of
Boston	LOCATION	, Captain
Ebenezer Dorr	PERSON	, the first American vessel that visited
California	LOCATION	, ran into
Monterey	ORGANIZATION	and sur - reptitiously left a few of its sailors , some for - eigners and some English . ''

		The Spanish gov - ernor , after utilizing these sailors in various ways for a time , sent them out of the country .

		The impression prevailed that American ves - sels which came to the
Coast	ORGANIZATION	were engaged in contraband trade ; and this impression Mr.
Hittell	PERSON	thinks was probably well founded .

		On that ground , at least , the second ship to arrive ,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 which was in
1799	DATE	, was compelled to leave with - out delay .

		And , generally speaking , we may say that from this time on the American and the Spaniard were at a point of friction on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	as well as in the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, although for many years the more distant point attracted little or no attention , owing in great part to the absorbing interest with which the nearer one was regarded .

		Ominously enough , however , the century closed with '' considerable talk of an American invasion that is , of an attempt by the rising young giant on the other side of the continent to take not only
California	LOCATION	, but all
New Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		It was not until
1823	DATE	that an American was allowed to settle in the country .

		The first American business house was established in
1824	DATE	.

		The first American party to arrive overland came in
1826	DATE	, and seems to have been the result of an accident , as follows : `` Towards the end of
1826	DATE	the Californians were astonished by the appearance in their country of the first party of Americans that came overland .

		This was a small company of hunters and trappers , under the com - mand of Captain
Jedediah S. Smith	PERSON	, of the firm of
Smith , Jackson , & Soublette	ORGANIZATION	.

		They had been author - ized by the United States Executive to hunt and trade in the territories west of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, and had established their headquarters on the eastern side of Salt Lake .

		In
August	DATE	they had left Salt Lake on a hunting and trapping excursion , and , travelling south - westward , had at length found themselves in a desert country near the
Colorado River	LOCATION	, and in great want of subsistence for themselves and horses .

		Being five hundred miles from Salt Lake and less than three hun - dred from the mission of
San Gabriel	LOCATION	in
California	LOCATION	, they determined to proceed to the latter place , and finally arrived there , very much exhausted .

		Immediately upon their arrival ,
Smith	PERSON	addressed a letter to Governor
Echeandia	PERSON	, then at
San Diego	LOCATION	, describing their situation and necessities .

		Echeandia answered by ordering
Smith	PERSON	to appear at that place and give an account of himself and of his reasons for coming to the country .


Smith	PERSON	did so ; but his story seems to have been doubted .

		He then appealed to a number of ships ' captains who were at that port ; and they joined in a written declaration to the effect that they believed his account , and that his only object in visiting the country was such as he had stated . ''

		Smith is said to have lost his life while attempting to make his way back to Salt Lake .

		The visit was a very unwelcome one , and in - creased the growing tension between the
Cali	LOCATION	- fornians and the Americans .

		But there was no resisting the inevitable ; the American popula - tion continued slowly to increase .

		Shortly after
Smith	PERSON	's departure a report was circulated that the
United States	LOCATION	were about to take Cali - fornia , as they had already taken
Florida	LOCATION	.

		From this time until the end the action becomes more and more accelerated and more and more inter - esting .

		With the breaking out of the Mexican War ,
Fremont	LOCATION	,
Sloat	PERSON	, and
Stockton	PERSON	came , and
California	LOCATION	passed from the keeping of the Mex - ican to that of the American , as it had before passed from the Spaniard to the Mexican .

		But we can not follow the story .

		Full of information as the book is , it must depend mainly upon
State	ORGANIZATION	patriotism for its circulation .

		The author has facilitated the work of those who wish to consult his volumes -LRB- which is sure to be a much larger class than those who actually read them -RRB- by furnishing a full index as well as an ample table of contents .

E. F. Benson	PERSON	's '' The Vintage , '' a romance of the Greek War of Independence , with the romance of the Greek writer Xenos , recently reviewed by us , deal - ing with the same theme .

		One might reasonably suppose that the advantage would be almost wholly with the novelist who was writing of the great period of his own national history , and that the best any Englishman could do would be to produce a pale and colorless reflection of the stirring events of the years concerned .

		Yet the result is all the other way , for the Greek romancer is so oppressed by the weight THE VINTAGE .

		294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, of his information and the stress of his emotion that artistic grasp is denied him , whereas the English novelist with adequate literary training , backed by the continuous tradition of good fiction - writing which is his birthright , succeeds in making from his alien point of view a stronger and in every way finer treatment of the subject .

		The work of Xenos , hur - rying from detail to detail , is weighted down to the level of a chronicle , while the work of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, who knows how to select and arrange , rises to the level of serious and impressive art .

		The English writer does not even have to rely upon the names and events which are in themselves an element of strength , so deep are the associations they bear ; he tells us nothing of
Marcos Botsaris	PERSON	or of Misolonghi or of
Navarino	LOCATION	, and yet he makes us feel to the full the heroic passion of the struggle .

		The chief histor - ical episode of this romance is the siege and fall of
Tripoli	LOCATION	, and to this climax the events lead up with ever - accumulating interest .

		The well-chosen figure of speech embodied in the title of the book is kept in mind throughout , yet not made obtrusive , being relegated to section-headings and chance phrases rather than made a theme for rhetorical amplifica - tions . ''

		The Vintage '' is much the best piece of work that Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has thus far done , and for its sake we may well forgive him for his '' Dodo '' and other futilities . ''

		The Son of the Czar '' is a long historical ro - mance of early eighteenth century
Russia	LOCATION	, and has for its chief characters
Peter	PERSON	the Great and his un - happy son
Alexis	PERSON	.

		The exact period is that of the beginnings of the new capital upon the marshy shores of the
Neva	LOCATION	, and the book is essentially a depiction of the great struggle of the radical em - peror with the bigoted conservatism of his semi - barbarous people .

		The instincts of
Peter	PERSON	were so entirely right that they go far to condone the brutal - ities that marked his policy , and we can not greatly blame a writer of historical fiction for idealizing his character and to a certain extent justifying the means that he was forced to employ for the further - ance of bis great ends .

		Historians have been apt to regard his treatment of
Alexis	PERSON	as one of the dark - est blots upon his fame , but as the relation is pre - sented to us by Mr.
Graham	PERSON	,
Alexis	PERSON	got no more than his despicable character and treacherous de - vices fairly earned for him .

		If this presentation of
Peter	PERSON	as an essentially wise and humane ruler be colored by too much hero-worship , it is made for the time almost convincing by the eloquence of the writer .

		It is evident , also , that Mr.
Graham	PERSON	, has been a minute student of his subject , for his book has a great deal of historical actuality , and never descends to the level of rhetorical commonplace .

		It is , moreover , self-consistent , and its chief artistic defect results from the author 's inability to make an orderly array of so great a store of information .

		The nihilists are just now having their innings again in fiction .

		Mr.
Fred Whishaw	PERSON	's '' A Tsar 's Gratitude '' is a story which begins with the engage - ment at Inkermann , and ends with an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Alexander II .

		As far as ma - chinery goes , it is much the same sort of story that we have read many times before .

		The conspirators live in the same atmosphere of secrecy and terror - ism , and are invested with the same uncanny power to control the machinery of state up to a certain point in the interest of their dastardly aims .

		The hero is an officer in the Russian army who , through no fault of his own , incurs the disfavor of the Tsar , but whose loyalty remains unshaken through trials that would almost justify him in revolt .

		When he eventually saves his ruler 's life at the risk of his own , the Tsar 's gratitude becomes as generous as his previous ingratitude had been unworthy , and the story thus justifies its title , while coming to a happy conclusion .

		It is written in a rather dull style , and bears a good deal of skipping .

		Mr.
Pett Ridge	PERSON	's '' Secretary to
Bayne	LOCATION	,
M. P.	PERSON	, '' deals only indirectly with Russian affairs , since its scene is laid mainly in
London	LOCATION	, and its nihilists are ruffians of a rather cheap description .

		It is the story of a Prince of
Galmada	LOCATION	, who goes to
London	LOCATION	incognito to see the world , and also to discover the whereabouts of one
Olga Netroff	PERSON	, whom he loves .

		The girl turns out to be implicated , innocently enough , in certain nihilist conspiracies , and in his endeavor to get her away from her criminal envir - onment , the Prince barely escapes with his own life .

		The story , which ends happily , is told with consid - erable animation , and provides a very satisfactory sort of entertainment .

		Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's ''
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	'' is a historical ro - mance of which the scene is laid in the
England	LOCATION	of
William III.	LOCATION	, and which has for its central episode the attempt of Sir
John Fenwick	PERSON	and his fellow - conspirators to assassinate the great champion of civil liberties and the Protestant faith .

		It is a very long romance , which fact will delight all lovers of the species who are acquainted as who of them are not ?

		with the other inventions of this fasci - nating writer .

		We notice in this book what we no - ticed in '' My Lady Rotha , '' a tendency so to enlarge the scale and scope of a romance as to obscure the pattern , and make it somewhat difficult for readers to view the performance as a symmetrical whole .

		For clearness of outline and unity of plan , Mr.
Wey	PERSON	- man 's slighter early books were better than the more ambitious ones he has produced of late .

		Still , we have read ''
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	'' with much satisfaction , despite the fact that the hero -LRB- who tells the story -RRB- is little short of a knave and nothing short of a coward .

		Among the historical characters intro - duced , we have
Fenwick	PERSON	, the notorious
Ferguson	PERSON	,
Godolphin	ORGANIZATION	,
Marlborough	LOCATION	, and the
King	PERSON	, and alto - gether the book offers us a vivid picture of the troub - lous times when the Protestant succession was still in question , besides abounding in stirring incidents and hair-breadth escapes .

		Mr. '' Anthony Hope '' takes us some score of years further back in English history when we open the pages of ''
Simon Dale	PERSON	, '' for the chronicler of imaginary royalties and principalities has at last
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 come to the historical novel pare and simple , and given us a story of the Restoration that proves un - failing in its power to excite and sustain the interest , although its audacities of invention at times take away the breath .

		The infamous Treaty of
Dover	LOCATION	affords the chief subject-matter of this romance , and the incognito presence of the
Roi Soleil	LOCATION	at the place of negotiation gives the hero an opportunity for dealing with him in the most surprising manner .

		The treatment to which he is subjected in the '' Vicomte de Bragelonne '' is no more startling than that which he is made to endure at the hands of the bold and sturdy
Simon	PERSON	, who not only talks to him in the '' cheekiest '' fashion at
Dover	LOCATION	, but actually gets him alone in an open boat , and exacts from him an un - willing compliance at the pistol 's muzzle .

		The affec - tions of this audacious hero are divided between the high-born lady whom he rescues from the net of royal intrigue into which she has fallen , and the well-known favorite ,
Nell Gwynne	PERSON	, of whom the novelist draws so engaging a portrait that we can not help liking her better than the proper heroine of the romance .

		We are glad , on the whole , that Mr.
Hawkins	PERSON	has sold his fancy into captivity to the facts of history , for we have no fear that his work will suffer from a too slavish adherence to them , and it is , after all , better to dwell upon the solid ground of the actual than in cloud-built towers and gorgeous palaces that never had any real existence .

		We should judge Mr.
Herman Koerner	PERSON	to be a novice in the writing of romantic fiction . ''

		Belea - guered '' is a story that drags considerably and dis - plays slight inventive resource .

		Given a fortified town in the early Thirty Years War , held by the imperialists and besieged by the Swedes , given also a heroic defender and a lovely maiden , most of the details follow as a matter of course .

		There is a great deal of fighting in the book , besides minor adven - tures and intrigues , but a certain stiffness of manner pervades the whole production and prevents it from being at all inspiring . ''

		Across the Salt Seas , '' by Mr.
John Bloundelle	PERSON	-
Bnrton	PERSON	, is a story of the War of the Spanish Suc - cession .

		An English soldier is entrusted with a secret mission to
Spain	LOCATION	, which results in the capture of a fleet of treasure-ships that are expected to fur - nish the depleted Spanish treasury .

		The action of the romance takes place for the most part upon Spanish soil , and concerns about equally the English soldier already mentioned and a young Spaniard who becomes his companion in arms and devoted friend .

		It afterwards transpires that the Spaniard is a woman in disguise .

		There can be only one way out of such a complication .

		The book is a good one of its sort , crammed with exciting episodes , and wrapped in the atmosphere of romance .

		Mr.
McLennan	PERSON	's '' Spanish John '' is a romance of the Pretender and the expedition of
1745	DATE	.

		The hero is a youth who is sent to
Rome	LOCATION	to be educated for the priesthood , but who finds soldiering much more to his taste , and joins the Spanish troops then campaigning in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		After some very good fight - ing at
Velletri	LOCATION	, he is sent to
Scotland	LOCATION	on a secret mission in behalf of Prince
Charlie	PERSON	, and has so ex - citing a series of experiences that not until the end is reached do we recall , with a sort of pained sur - prise , the fact that we have been reading a book without a love-story .

		The style of the narrative is crisp and vigorous , and a remarkable power of real - izing the life of the period is displayed .

		This power has since been explained , we regret to say , in a way not creditable to the author .

		A contributor to '' The Bookman '' has unearthed , in a Canadian periodical of the early part of this century , a certain '' Narra - tive '' upon which it becomes only too evident that Mr.
McLennan	PERSON	has drawn , not merely for his inci - dents , but for his descriptions and his very phrase - ology .

		It seems to be a clear case of pilfering , which is naturally bad for Mr.
McLennan	PERSON	's reputation , although it does not make his book any the less readable and remarkable .

		The character of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	is rightly a favorite with the romantic novelist , and few periods of history offer material so fascinating as that which deals with the great struggle between
Henry	PERSON	and the
League	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
R. N. Stephens	PERSON	, in '' An Enemy to the King '' deals with this material once more , and tells , after the strictly conventional pattern , of a young scion of an impoverished house who starts out to see the world , after the fashion of Artagnan or Sigognac , and learns to the full the meaning of fierce wars and faithful loves .

		He gets into the thick of events at once , for his first day in
Paris	LOCATION	is marked by an encounter with
Bussy d'Amboise	PERSON	, and not long thereafter he wins the favor of
Marguerite	PERSON	, who helps him to escape the vengeance of Guise and the Queen - Mother , and despatches him to Be * arn with a letter to her princely consort .

		From this time on , his days are filled with exciting occurrences , and he permits no earlier hero of romance to outdo him in deeds of valor and chivalry .

		It is the sort of story that we have read many times before , and is quite as good as the similar inventions of Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	and his confreres .

		We welcome Mr.
Ste	PERSON	- phens to the ranks of our entertainers in this sort , and hope to hear from him again . ''

		For Prince and People , '' by Mr.
E. K. Sanders	PERSON	, is a story of old
Genoa	LOCATION	and the tyranny of the
Doria	LOCATION	.

		The conspiracy of Fieschi is the real subject of the narrative , and the treatment given it follows closely the lines laid down by the early romantic drama of
Schiller	PERSON	.

		The book is not particularly noteworthy , but it is a painstaking piece of workmanship , and we have read it with a certain degree of satitsf action .

		American novelists are learning to draw more and more upon the store of romantic material pro- vided by our own annals , and the work of historical societies and other organizations for the preservation and publication of what bibliographers call Ameri - cana is bearing abundant fruit in the form of his - torical fiction .

		In '' Vivian of
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Hul	PERSON	- bert
Fuller	ORGANIZATION	tells of
Bacon 's Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	, and draws full-length portraits of that popular leader as well as of his grim antagonist , Governor
Berkeley	LOCATION	, whose 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, hatred of schools and printing , expressed in a fre - quently-quoted passage , has preserved his memory better than all the acts of the years when , '' drest in a little brief authority , '' he played the petty despot in his
Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		The hero of the romance is a soldier who has been fighting under
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	in
Flanders	LOCATION	, and now , thrown on the world without employment , welcomes an opportunity to embark for the planta - tions , and cast in his lot with the Virginians .

		The story of his share in
Bacon	LOCATION	's Rebellion , and of his conquest of the fair and high-spirited maiden who engages his affections , is told in the regulation manner , and to much the effect of the countless sim - ilar romances dealing with old-world themes that have come to our attention during the past ten years .

		It is a pretty tale , and has a considerable historical interest as well .

		Miss
Rayner	PERSON	's '' Free to Serve '' takes us some - what out of the beaten track in historical fiction , being the story of a well-born English girl who , through the contemptible conduct of a worthless brother , is brought to
America	LOCATION	to be sold in
New York	LOCATION	as a bond - servant .

		Her services are purchased by a substantial Dutch burgher , whose manorial estate far up the
Hudson	LOCATION	is the scene of the greater part of the ro - mance , and whose two sons become rivals for the love of the young woman who by so fortunate a circumstance falls in their way .

		The book is a long one , packed with incident , and made of unusual value by its strong delineation of the several char - acters concerned , as well as by its vivid presentation of the condition of life in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The time of action is set at the very beginning of the eighteenth century .

		The story of ''
King Washington	LOCATION	'' is based upon an episode in the life of our first President during the period that followed the surrender at
Yorktown	LOCATION	, when
Clinton	PERSON	was still in command in
New York	LOCATION	, and
Washington	LOCATION	was keeping watch at
Newburgh	LOCATION	.

		This romance weaves together into a well-constructed narrative the historical incident of the
Nicola	LOCATION	letter , with its insulting suggestion that the American leader should assume the royal title , and an imag - inary plot , instigated by
Prescott	PERSON	, to kidnap him and deliver him up to the British army .

		The active agent in this plot is a woman of mixed French and Indian blood , disguised as a boy , whom
Prescott	PERSON	has promised to make his wife should the conspiracy prove successful .

		Under the name of
Louis Paschal	LOCATION	this woman gains the confidence of
Washington	LOCATION	and his circle , the plot failing of success only by acci - dent at the critical juncture .

		A pretty love-story , concerning a blunt straightforward American officer and the charming daughter of one of the conspira - tors , lends an additional touch of romantic interest to the situation .

		The story is very well worked out , with much effective use of antiquarian material , and illustrated by photographs of the scenes and historic houses which come within the scope of the work .

		The
Archdeacon	PERSON	of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has written a stirring '' story of land and sea in the days of the Revolution '' the American Revolution , that is and entitled it '' For Love of Country . ''

		There is some good sea-fighting under
Paul Jones	PERSON	and other commanders , a graphic description of the crossing of the
Delaware	LOCATION	and the subsequent campaign of
Trenton	LOCATION	and
Princeton	LOCATION	, and the inevitable love-story with its inevitably happy ending .

		Historically , the author knows whereof he writes , and has taken no unwarrantable liberties with the facts .

		His sea - pictures are especially well done , which is a not unnatural consequence of the author 's early training in the naval service of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Alto - gether , the book is clean , wholesome , and spirited , and deserves well of the public . ''

		Chalmette , '' by Mr.
Clinton Ross	PERSON	, is a romance of the days and events leading up to the Battle of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Its hero is a young Virginian officer under
Jackson	PERSON	's leadership , and the plot is chiefly concerned with
Lafitte	PERSON	and his nest of Baratarian pirates who prove an effective factor in the further - ing of the American cause .

		The manner of narra - tion is jerky and episodical , making the drift of the work somewhat difficult to catch , a defect partly atoned for by the bits of vivid dramatic action oc - curring now and then .

		One can not help feeling that Mr.
Ross	PERSON	is better qualified to write for the stage than for the reading public , and that his work adds to its natural demands upon the ear an unwonted demand upon the imaginative eye of the observer .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
John M. Robertson	PERSON	, in his '' New Outlines of a new Essays toward a Critical Method '' critical method .

		J .

		-LRB- Lane -RRB- makes a suggestive and val - uable contribution to critical literature , although the outlines of the '' general critical method '' which he claims to have developed are not very easy to trace .

		These outlines are to be looked for mainly in the introductory chapter on '' The Theory and Practice of Criticism , '' since the special chapters that follow are admitted to antedate by ten years or more the complete formulation of the writer 's critical system .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is distinctly wedded to the view that criticism may be raised to the scientific plane , wherein he has our hearty approval , and his con - demnation of the subjective and impressionist writ - ing that passes for criticism is well-considered and well-stated , although it amounts in , our opinion to little more than slaying the slain .

		His observations , also , concerning his predecessors among the practi - tioners of scientific criticism are acute and logical .

		He not only pays his respects to such well-known men as Sainte-Beuve and
Taine	PERSON	and Brunetiere , but also calls our attention to less familiar discussions of critical technique by
Hennequin	PERSON	and
Droz	PERSON	and
E. S. Dallas	PERSON	.

		But when we seek the formulation of his own ideas , we find little beyond a modified acceptance of
Taine	PERSON	's fundamental principles coupled with suggestions traceable to Sainte-Beuve and
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297
Hennequin	PERSON	, and supplemented by an insistence upon the primary necessity that the critic should allow for his own personal equation .

		It is under this latter head that the author says his best things , and every critic who takes his business seriously would do well to mark and inwardly digest the following passage : ' As regards his limitations and his antipathies he can only partially take precaution , and this only by a kind of discipline which few are ready to practice .

		In sum , it consists in carefully studying all the cases of wide appreciation in which he can not feel with the many , and carefully estimating the calibre of the judgments with which he can not agree .

		Suppose it be that he does not readily enjoy or admire
Cervantes	PERSON	, or Calderon , or
Schiller	PERSON	, or Hugo , or
Browning	PERSON	, or
Dickens	LOCATION	, or
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, each of whom has won very high , and some very general , praise , to ask himself narrowly whether he has missed the excellences on which it dwells , to consider the training , the bias , the cast of mind of those who bestow it , and then , if he thinks he fairly can , to explain it in terms of the prejudice , or limitation , or deficient culture of the admirers ; or , if he can not , to seek objectively for the merits which delight them , and to note them as forms of effect to which he is but slightly sus - ceptible . ''

		It is this method of collation and diag - nosis of expert opinion that Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	would have the critic pursue , and an application of this method -LRB- although imperfect for the reason above stated -RRB- is what we find in the essays on
Poe	LOCATION	,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	, and
Clough	PERSON	, that fill out his volume .

		We by no means agree with all of the conclusions reached concerning these poets , and think that their unsoundness might in not a few instances be traced to a lack of the very method which Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	admits was not framed until after their formulation , but there is not space to pursue this inquiry into detail .

		We think that a grave injustice is done Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	in saying that , in his work done for the definitive edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, he '' passed from his older attitude of sympathy to that of a pseudo-judical animus . ''

		It is to Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	that this animus must be attributed rather than to his senior colleague .

		And we mark a discrepancy that calls for correction in two notes upon the untimely death of
Hennequin	PERSON	.

		One of them informs us that he died in the
summer of 1888	DATE	, the other in the
spring of 1889	DATE	.

		A pleasant narrative , but not history .

		The day is happily past when pleas - antly-written narrative , with little regard to accuracy of facts , could pass as history .

		The writer who , when taken to task for the errors of his work , pompously replied , '' So much the worse for the facts , '' has been super - seded in public estimation .

		Miss
Edith Sichel	PERSON	, au - thor of '' The Household of the Lafayettes '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , might succeed better as a writer of romance than of history .

		She has imagination and an enter - taining style , but her work can not meet the funda - mental requirement of a history accuracy as to facts .

		How much faith can be put in the story of the
Lafayette	LOCATION	family , as told by a writer who erra grievously regarding the most important facts of the revolutionary history of
France	LOCATION	?

		To enumer - ate briefly : Miss
Sichel	PERSON	would find it hard to name any French Republicans of
1788	DATE	-LRB- p. 100 -RRB- ; Bar - nave was not a Girondist ;
Mirabeau	PERSON	was not the one to christen the States General the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 107 -RRB- ;
Talleyrand	LOCATION	was a bishop , not an abbot -LRB- p. 113 -RRB- ;
Mirabeau	PERSON	was not '' a democrat among democrats from
May	DATE	until the end of Octo - ber , ''
1789	DATE	, nor did he '' proclaim the necessity of restoring an executive '' -LRB- p. 118 -RRB- only after that time : he was consistently in favor of a strong ex - ecutive .

		The author knows next to nothing of political grouping or the nature of the Terror gov - ernment .

		The Girondist party was not a party of the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 133 -RRB- ; the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	did not exist as early as the autumn of
1792	DATE	-LRB- p. 162 -RRB- ; the Revolutionary tribunal was established prior to the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	, and not after it -LRB- p. 179 -RRB- ; the Convention did not proscribe the Catholic faith -LRB- p. 193 -RRB- : that was the work of the commune ;
England	LOCATION	did not declare war on
France	LOCATION	in
1792	DATE	-LRB- p. 194 -RRB- , but
France	LOCATION	declared war on
England	LOCATION	; the Dantonists were not executed `` at the close of the month '' -LRB-
March , 1794	DATE	-RRB- , as stated -LRB- p. 195 -RRB- , but on
April 6	DATE	;
Napoleon	PERSON	was not recalled from
Egypt	LOCATION	by a secret letter , but , in the exchange of prisoners between him and Sir
Sidney Smith	PERSON	, the English commander , some French news - papers fell into his hands , which apprised him of the political condition in
France	LOCATION	;
Pichegru	PERSON	was not beheaded -LRB- p. 296 -RRB- , but was strangled .

		These are positive errors of fact .

		Examples of unripe judg - ment and childish enthusiasm abound .

		One might know very nearly what to expect of a writer who introduces her book by such a statement as this : '' Angels are few and far between .

		It is almost incredible to find a whole band of them , especially a band living together and tied to each other by blood .

		Yet this improbable conception is realized by the De Noailles '' -LRB- p. 27 -RRB- .

		If it were not so pitiable , we might laugh at the assertion that Corn - wallis was '' at last forced into Yorktown by the skill of
Lafayette	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- ; that the French Bill of Rights was similar to the English Petition of Rights ; that
Lafayette	LOCATION	was a `` hero of chivalry '' in the events of the 5th and 6th of
October , 1789	DATE	; that
Mirabeau	PERSON	was jealous of
Lafayette	LOCATION	a statement which reminds one of the fable of the ox and the fly .

		Lesser errors here and there throughout the book betray the fact that the author has little knowl - edge of the institutions of the times she has at - tempted to portray .

		She uses the word '' intendant '' when `` bailiff '' is meant -LRB- p. 7 -RRB- ; she speaks of the jeunesse doree before
1789	DATE	, although a knowledge of the Revolution ought to have taught her that that term has a special historical significance -LRB- p. 7 -RRB- ; she speaks of the Parlements of
Paris	LOCATION	, and even , En - glish as she is , talks of the
Petition of Rights	ORGANIZATION	.

		But 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, it were ungracious to continue criticism of a book whose errors glare at us from every page ; and even the vivacity of the style and the numerous anecdotes can not redeem '' The Household of the Layf ayettes '' to history .

		A noteworthy No evidence of the insufficiency of contribution to the average medical school in this medical literature .

		country -LCB- s so convincing as the char - acter of the medical literature put forth .

		American medical journals are almost as numerous as the leaves on the trees , and of medical books we produce a plenty ; but he is a bold man who will presume to find in this mass of literature the patient study of cases , the scientific accuracy of statement , and the wide range of observation , that characterize the best foreign medical literature .

		In '' Operative
Gyne	PERSON	- cology , '' of which Volume I. has just been issued from the press of
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Howard A. Kelly	PERSON	, of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, has taken a long stride ahead .

		He has produced a book in surgical gynecology that will take rank at once in this specialty with the work of
Schroder	ORGANIZATION	,
Martin	ORGANIZATION	,
Zweifel	PERSON	, and
Veit	PERSON	, in
Germany	LOCATION	; of
Pozzi	LOCATION	and Pe * an , in
France	LOCATION	; and of Sir
Spencer Wells	PERSON	, in
England	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Kelly	PERSON	is still a young man , but he has already achieved an international reputation , and the originality of his book tells why .

		It is the record of the author 's own practice , showing on every page not only a quick and keen observation of facts , but that ability to discriminate , to sift , and to select , which is the true scientific spirit .

		The record covers an experience of eighteen years , during the last nine of which Dr.
Kelly	PERSON	has been gynecologist-in-chief to the
Johns Hopkins Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, in
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		What is especially pleasing in this latest production of the
Johns Hopkins Medical School	ORGANIZATION	is its conservative tone .

		It is the day of gynecology .

		Allured by the prospects of quick rewards in fame and money , young men of all degrees of shortcoming in medical training and experience , and of all sorts of moral consciousness , are rushing into this specialty .

		It has become the by-word of the medical profession that too many of them are only too ready to operate .

		We believe that the comparative safety of abdominal surgery which has been brought about by the knowl - edge of asepsis in modern surgical technique is a great boon to suffering women , but we have no hesitation in saying that operative gynecology is carried too far everywhere .

		It is often a meddle - some interference , based upon ignorance of natural conditions , and wholly mischievous in its moral con - sequences .

		We hope and trust that the conservative and conscientious attitude of so distinguished a gynecologist as Dr.
Kelly	PERSON	will stay the tide of ex - sective operations on women .

		The illustrations of this book are superb .

		There are more than six hundred of them , all original ; surely no medical work , certainly no American medical work , has ever before been so finely illustrated .

		The chapter on the topographical anatomy of the abdomen , which is simply a clear description of a series of beautiful The great age of Spanish literature .

		pictures , is a revelation as to what art can do to illuminate surgery .

		No surgeon can hereafter afford to be ignorant of this admirable piece of work .

		The execution of the book throughout reflects honor upon American printing , and the publishers are to be con - gratulated upon an imprint which is at least as per - fect as care and skill and taste can produce .

		Each volume -LRB- Volume II .

		will appear very shortly -RRB- is separately indexed , in five sections , an index of plates , of illustrations , of cases from the literature , of cases from the
Johns Hopkins Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, and a general index . ''

		The Later Renaissance , '' by Mr.
David Hannay	PERSON	, is a volume in the series called '' Periods of European Literature '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is the second to be pub - lished , but stands sixth in the chronological order .

		It is chiefly concerned with the literatures of
England	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, although short chapters are devoted to those of
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		In the case of
Spain	LOCATION	, the author has practically dealt with the whole of the great age of Spanish literature , overlapping in both directions the period assigned to him .

		The importance of thus treating Spanish literature as a whole seemed to outweigh the reasons for dividing it up among three or four volumes by different hands . ''


Spain	LOCATION	suspended the anarchy of her middle ages at the
end of the fifteenth century	DATE	, gathered force , burst upon the world with the violence of a Turkish invasion , flourished for a space , and then sank ex - hausted at the end of a hundred and fifty years . ''

		The literary manifestations of this energy were no less remarkable than the others , and the intellectual movement as a whole has a unity that demands con - tinuous treatment .

		Still , the reasons for treating as a whole the English drama of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods are no less cogent ; yet the volume before us breaks off with
Shakespeare	PERSON	, leaving most of his great contemporaries to be taken up in another work and by another writer .

		Mr.
Hannay	PERSON	is at his best in dealing with the literature of
Spain	LOCATION	, and his treatment of the other literatures of the time -LRB- even the English -RRB- seems perfunctory in comparison .

		Cer - tain defects of sympathy appear now and then , as in the estimate of such men as Camoens and
Gra	ORGANIZATION	- cian ; but the book as a whole offers an exhibition of temperate judgment and reasonably attractive presentation .

		Some criticism , A little book on the `` Elements of literary and Literary Criticism '' -LRB-

		Mr
Charles F. Johnson	PERSON	, may be recommended to young readers -LRB- and some older ones -RRB- as a readable , and in the main trustworthy , analysis of the elements that make up good litera - ture and as a guide to the acquisition of correct taste .

		The author subdivides his theme , after a preliminary discussion of the principle of unity in literary composition , into the special topics of char - acterization , philosophy , and the musical , phrasal , descriptive , and emotional powers .

		There is much good sense in what he says upon these subjects , and
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 299 much apposite illustration of his several propositions .

		The book is marred now and then by a critical judg - ment that is not easily defensible , as when it is suggested that Hugo and
Tolstoi	PERSON	may possibly be ranked with the great '' illuminated intellects '' of literature , with
Dante	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Goethe	LOCATION	; or when
Byron	PERSON	is called a '' magnificent artist , '' which is precisely what
Byron	PERSON	was not .

		Nor does one often in a good book come across so misleading and unfair a characterization as that of
Rossetti	PERSON	, described as '' a man who believes that the world of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's day is preferable to the world of to-day , who has apparently never heard of the discovery of the conservation of energy nor of the main outlines of evolution , and who thinks the form of a chair or the pattern of a brocade more important and inter - esting than the struggle of humanity towards higher things . ''

		Such a passage as this is a solemn warn - ing of the dangers that attend the cultivation of rhetoric without knowledge .

		A loving memorial to
Miss Rottttli	ORGANIZATION	.

		The `` biographical and critical study '' of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	which we owe to the sympathetic and industrious labors of Mr.
Mackenzie Bell	PERSON	makes a sizable vol - ume of over four hundred pages -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , illus - trated with portraits and facsimiles of the greatest interest , and supplied with a bibliography by Mr.
J. P. Anderson	PERSON	of the British Museum .

		We have no doubt that the preparation of this book has been to the author , as he says , a '' peculiar pleasure , '' and that he has spared no pains to make it an accurate presentation of the noble woman and great poet to whose memory it is dedicated .

		Loving care and sympathy are evident upon every page , as well as a degree of scrupulousness in the statement of exact fact that verges upon pedantry .

		We wish that we might go beyond this tribute of respect , and com - mend the volume as a piece of good writing and adequate criticism ; but this is frankly impossible .

		The limitations of the writer , both as critic and biographer , are too painfully apparent to permit of such praise , and it must be said that his portrait bears about the same relation to the portrait which we hope sometime to possess of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	that is borne by a
Denner	PERSON	to a Rembrandt .

		The markings are all given with photographic accuracy , but the character is somehow missing .

		Neverthe - less , the book is welcome , and we could not well dis - pense with it , although it does little to assist us in comprehension of the rare and beautiful spirit ex - haled from these poems that constitute one of the chief glories of our Victorian literature .

		A true primer of psychology .

		Text-books , like other things , are liable to the charge of being seldom -LRB- or at least not so frequently as is desirable -RRB- what they seem .

		Many a primer is sim - ply a congested mass of facts , in which terseness or inaccuracy increases difficulties with no other com - pensation than a decrease in the number of pages .

		Professor
Titchener	PERSON	's '' Primer of Psychology ''
McCarthy	PERSON	'' * '' French Revolution .

		^ -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- offers a bright contrast to this not un - common type .

		It is a true primer , or first book , of psychology , and is well fitted to make these first steps attractive to earnest students .

		It does not pretend to be a royal road to learning , but counts upon the increase of interest as well of ability which comes only from continued effort ; but it directs that effort wisely and well .

		It is broad in treatment , covering a large part of the domain of modern psy - chology ; but it covers it in a way suitable to the beginner 's understanding .

		It utilizes the daily ex - periences of our mental life ; supplements these by the more direct and forcible results of experimen - tation , and further imbues them with living interest by the introduction of evolutionary , of social , and of literary illustrations .

		It is true that it reflects as well the unsettled condition of many questions in psy - chology ; and the reader is honestly made aware of the fact that he is frequently reading the views of Professor Titchener rather than a consensus of psychological opinion .

		But this is inevitable , and does little harm .

		In brief , the work combines so many of the possible virtues of a primer , and avoids so many of the much larger number of possible vices , that it may be most cordially recommended as an unusually able and practical beginner 's book in psy - chology .

		The second and concluding volume of Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	's '' French Revolution '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- opens with the events immediately succeeding the Fall of the Bastile and ends with the close of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		The events of this period are given in an orderly narration , and though there is a tendency to drag in unimportant details , the author , in his accustomed journalistic style , has drawn a vivid picture of the times .

		Two chapters , one on the news - papers of the period and one on the more important clubs , give interesting information not generally found in short histories of the French Revolution .

		The treatment of the character and influence of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	, while fully recognizing those qualities which made her so unpopular , is distinctly sympathetic , especial emphasis being placed upon her courage in the time of danger .

		An excellent index , to both volumes , is given .

		Students and teachers of comparative and of human anatomy will find much to approve in Professor
Jayne	PERSON	's '' The Skeleton of the Cat , '' the first to appear of a series on '' Mammalian Anatomy '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , designed as a preparation for study in these two fields .

		This monograph opens with a chapter devoted to defini - tions and methods , and is followed by a systematic study of every bone and of the regions formed by union .

		The description of a bone includes an ex - planation of its name , the areas for muscular attach - ment , its articulation , rules for rapid identification , the centres of ossification from which it is developed , its growth , and its variations .

		A careful comparison 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, is then made with the corresponding hone in the human skeleton .

		The derivation of technical names is given , along with the English derivations and French and German equivalents .

		The simple and practical terminology , the clear presentation and logical arrangement of the subject , and the abund - ant illustrations , make the hook a satisfactory and practicable guide for the novice , while its wealth of detail affords a veritable mine of information for the teacher .

		The book is a credit to American schol - arship and American bookmaking , and is destined to a real field of usefulness in the biological labora - tory and in the service of the independent worker .

		In the great geologic stone book , these records were inscribed upon the eldest leaves , forming that strip of present land in

St. Lawrence River	LOCATION	, which first emerged from the shoreless ocean , at least in the Western hemisphere .

		Here life began at the bottom of a most ancient sea .

		Before other deposits were piled upon them , these strata were lifted above the waves and stratigraphic records cease .

		The EozoOn , the dawn animal , ap - pears to have been among the first of the living things which were introduced into the waters that covered the earth , after its more active physical transformations were finished .

		It appears to have come in upon the ground floor .

		It is something to have determined , even approximately , the begin - nings of life and the foundations of continents .

		An excellent American history .

		There is the proper pro- portion , no one period being unduly magnified at the expense of another ; the suggestions and refer - ences are exceedingly helpful ; the illustrative mate - rial is well selected , and the several chapters are so admirably constructed as to make the book appeal at once to teachers as the best of its kind that has yet appeared .

		One of the most important episodes in the earl J history of
New England	LOCATION	was the war of extermination waged against the fierce tribe of
Pequot Indians	LOCATION	, which threatened the quiet and security of the border lands toward which the overflow of the Bay population was rushing .

		So complete was the work of the whites , when once they had bestirred themselves against the savages , that the Pequots were almost entirely destroyed , after which '' the land had rest for forty years . ''

		A good service for students of American history has been done by Mr.
Charles Orr	PERSON	in reprinting in a neat volume -LRB-
Cleveland	LOCATION	:
Helman	PERSON	-
Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the accounts of this war , written by par - ticipants in it , which have been preserved in perma - nent form in the collections of the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story , as told by Major
John Mason	PERSON	, Captain
John Underbill	PERSON	, Captain Lion Gar - dener , and Mr.
Philip Vincent	PERSON	, is illustrated by an introduction , by foot-notes , and by a map , thus putting in convenient form for reference material heretofore locked up in comparatively inaccessible volumes .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The latest number of the
Johns Hopkins University Studies	ORGANIZATION	consists of some two hundred pages on '' The Neutrality of the American Lakes , '' by Mr.
James Mor	PERSON	- ton
Callahan	PERSON	.

		The author finds the comity between
Canada	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	for eighty years under the agreement of joint occupation to be unique , a precedent worthy of imitation , and a strong argument for '' peace establishments . '' ''

		The Best of
Browning	PERSON	, '' by the Rev.
James Mudge	PERSON	, is a publication of
Messrs. Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	.

		It opens with an introduction by the Rev.
William V. Kelley	PERSON	, which is followed by an '' explanatory '' section by the editor .

		Then we have in succession '' How to Read
Browning	PERSON	, '' '' The Benefits of Browning Study , '' '' Brief Felicities and Fancies , '' '' Moral and Religious Thoughts , '' and '' Gems of Description . ''

		Finally , when half through the volume , we come to the selected poems themselves , although even here we are not spared a great deal of comment and annotation .

		One is apt to think '' the worst of Browning '' is that it takes so much apparatus to explain '' the best '' of him , but we would not deride a book that has been so lovingly put together , and that may prove just the thing needed by readers who would not get
Browning	PERSON	at all save in some such guise .

		It is seldom that one sees handsomer specimens of bookmaking than the volumes issued in '' The Tudor Translations , '' a series edited by Mr.
W. E. Henley	PERSON	and published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The object of this series is to reproduce the '' acknowledged master - pieces of English style in the one hundred years from
1550 to 1650	DATE	, which are also masterpieces of Classic and European literature . ''


Florio	PERSON	's Montaigne ,
North	ORGANIZATION	's Plutarch , and
Shelton	PERSON	's
Don Quixote	PERSON	are among the works already issued , the latest to appear being
Geffraie Fenton	PERSON	's translation of the '' Tragicall Discourses '' of
Matteo Bandello	PERSON	, in two volumes , with a lengthy Intro - duction by Mr.
Robert Langton Douglas	PERSON	.

		The
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan dramatists owe much to these quaintly-written love tales of
Bandello	LOCATION	, the material of such plays as `` Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' `` Twelfth Night , '' and `` The Duchess of Malfy '' being directly referable to the '' Discourses . ''

		It was altogether well worth while to reprint the work in this sumptuous series .

		The Poetry of
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	'' is a vol - ume in '' The Muse 's Library , '' imported by Messrs.

		The special significance of this edition is due to the fact that it is edited by Dr.

$ 10.00	MONEY	.

		In the present work an attempt is made to give a general view of the circumstances under which
England	LOCATION	first became a controlling force in the European system by virtue of her power upon the sea ... Not only was
Drake	PERSON	intimately connected , in all the various phases of his life , with every aspect of the Elizabethan maritime upheaval , but throughout
Europe	LOCATION	he was recognized and applauded , even in his lifetime , as the personification of the new political force ... The romantic fascination of his career as a corsair and explorer began , it is true , very shortly after his death to overshadow his work as an admiral and a statesman , but in his own time it was not so ; and a principal object of the present work is to restore him to the position he once held as one of the great military figures of the Reformation .

		333 ON COMEDY .

		One cause of the decline of comedy is the squeam - ishness of modern manners , which will not permit as to present things in their actuality , hut requires a decent veil of words thrown over character and incident .

		A novel may hint at an occurrence , or describe it by periphrasis , or by its effect ; but in comedy the thing itself must happen visibly .

		A novel can write all around a character describe his manners and conversation and walk ; a comedy must set him up on two legs and let him introduce himself .

		If a character is brutal or vulgar or un - seemly , all this must come out in comedy ; in a novel it can be glossed over .

		Nay , more : in a comedy the whole character has to be concentrated into a few speeches .

		It is necessary , therefore , for it to exaggerate all saliencies , and to give in one brief display all the characteristics which a human being would exhibit in a lifetime .

		And as comedy finds its subjects among the lighter follies and vices of mankind , this essential extract is found too strong for modern taste .

		If the aim of tragedy is to produce pleasure by the display of great forces warring against restraint , the business of comedy is to give happiness by the show of unfettered freedom .

		It is like the
Roman Saturnalia	ORGANIZATION	, and in it we slaves of nature or of each other may fling our chains away and flout our mas - ters and defy our fate .

		The comedy of Aristophanes turns the world upside down , sets low what is high and high what is low .

		The comedy of Menander ,

		It apotheosizes the spend - thrift and the thievish servant and the girl of easy virtue .


Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	make animal spirits and a happy-go-lucky disposition the choicest gifts of Fate .

		At
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's command all men drop their masks , and their pretensions and solemn absurdities shrivel in his flickering smile .

		Shakespeare alone , from the dark materials of the earth , builds a place of refuge and escape , reveals the vision of a sweeter , merrier world .

		All alike , however , free us momentarily from our pain and ennui .

		Society is perpetually in danger of being stiffened by formulas , dulled with wisdom , made vile by virtue or cruel by common-sense .

		One good custom can corrupt a world .

		It is a healthy instinct , therefore , which in all times and among all races has allowed the greatest license to the jester .

		He has to wear his cap and bells , and submit to humiliations ; but these accepted , he may say what he pleases .

		It seems , though I believe it is an obscure point , that there were some penalties attached to the acceptance of a comic chorus on the Athenian stage .


Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, phanes brought out his first two plays under an as - sumed name , and hesitated before coming forward under his own .

		Once he undertook the business , however , he was immune from consequences .

		The very notion of comedy , therefore , is license .

		To attempt to make it decent and decorous is to wrest it from its purpose .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	's defense of the Comedians of the Restoration is entirely just , though he hardly took the most logical ground .

		Congreve and his success - ors were within their rights .

		The vices they satir - ized existed in shameless abandon , and their gay and good-humored presentation of them probably did more good than a legal indictment and a hang - ing judge .

		Thackeray , in one of the most amazing pieces of criticism ever penned , dismisses
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	with angry scorn .

		The sordid world of
Thackeray	PERSON	is to my mind more horrible than the lewd world of
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	.

		Congreve 's is at least gay and brilliant , while
Thackeray	PERSON	's includes all that is bad in the older one , and has depths of squalid abasement of soul which
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	could not have conceived .

		It does not mend matters that the novelist pops now and then upon the scene to read a lesson to us on his misguided creations .

		He only spoils the illusion thereby , and does not redeem the impression .

		I think it is hardly disputable that a young man or woman , unused to life or literature , would get a worse opinion of humanity from
Thackeray	PERSON	than from
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	.

		I do not object to
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		He was right to paint what he saw , but he had no call to speak with contempt of a man who was his master in almost every respect .

		Of course , as is the case in
Wycherly	LOCATION	, a comic writer may mistake brutality and filth for wit and fun , but when
Wycherly	PERSON	is brutal he ceases to be comic .

		The display of naked - ness , except with the excuse of passion or beauty or humor , is a crime ; and sniggering suggestiveness is an unpardonable sin .

		Why , indeed , should we make fish of one com - mandment and fowl of another ? ''

		Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's goods '' is a canon , as well as '' Thou shalt not commit adultery . ''

		Nobody ob - jected to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's Avare , but when he brought out his '' School for Wives '' all
Paris	LOCATION	stuffed its fingers in its ears .

		Love is the universal theme .

		It is the salt which keeps literature fresh .

		Comedy can not do without it , but must treat it in the comic spirit .

		It has its lofty heights in '' Romeo and Juliet '' or '' Tristan and Isolde , '' and it has its ludicrous depths in '' The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	'' or ''
Tristram Shandy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is , in fact , too strong a passion to allow to rage unlaughed at .

		As has been said , there is nothing so serious as lust .

		Treat the passion always en fiaut , and there would be no living in the world .

		With one consent , society has always tried to drive the comic writers from this subject ; and with one consent the comic writers have refused to give it up .

		There have been endless attempts to bring in sen - timental comedy , lachrymose comedy , problematical comedy , but genuine comedy , ludicrous comedy , has always rallied and retained the field .

		The liberation of the intellect from all laws or bonds is best shown in the earth-upsetting comedy of Aristophanes .

		It is true that he was a conserva - tive , and tried to restore the o'erblown state to its ancient limits of modesty and order .

		But his treat - ment was homoeopathic .

		It was as though we should try to cure a madman by having a circle of maniacs dance about him with antic shout and gesture .

		It is all , however , a hurly-burly of ideas .

		Character painting , as we understand it , it hardly attempts , though
Cleon	PERSON	and the Sausage-Seller are sketched with some fulness .

		Aristophanes 's superb wit and poetry and thought keep his work from becoming travesty , but it is the parent of all succeeding trav - esty .

		The comedy of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	is the central comedy of the world .

		It resumes into itself all the genres of Menander and Plautus , as well as those of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	,
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	, and
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		Even the fixed types of Italian comedy appear in it .

		Moliere was the composite smile of mankind .

		His comedy ranges from the clown and horse collar stage to the pensive mockery of the profoundest philosophy .

		He is always the defeated idealist who tortures himself by shattering the illusions which are dearest to his soul .

		He loves men and women with all his heart , and no one has exhibited them more naked and unadorned .

		His Alceste is as ridiculous as
Don Quixote	PERSON	, and as noble .

		It is easy to satirize vice , to write with burn - ing indignation ; but to show the utter folly and futility of human life , and yet to make it lovable and desirable , was reserved for Moliere alone .

		It is fortunate that
Louis	LOCATION	IV .

		was more polite than penetrating .

		Tartuffe was a real blow to the ancien regime , and the scene between
Don Juan	PERSON	and the Beggar was perhaps the first note of the French Revolution .

		Shakespeare 's comedy is unique , though there is a trace of its charm in
Calderon	LOCATION	, and
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	has given us a brilliant though shallow imi - tation of it .

		Shakespeare is the idealist who suc - ceeds .

		His comedy is the one art-work of the world which can bestow absolute happiness ; and this not once or occasionally , but again and again with un - staled liberality .

		It is the true
Fountain of Youth	ORGANIZATION	the Age of Gold done into words .

		Shakespeare may almost be said to have created woman .

		Nowhere else does she exist in such bloom and perfume as in his comedy .

		Falstaff stands outside of the magic circle .

		He is
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's greatest contribution to ordinary comedy the comedy such as other men can write .

		Lacking Falstaff , however , we would still have
Sancho Panza	PERSON	; but lacking
Rosalind	PERSON	,
Viola	LOCATION	,
Beatrice	PERSON	,
Imogen	PERSON	,
Perdita	LOCATION	,
Miranda	LOCATION	, Sir
Toby	PERSON	,
Malvolio	ORGANIZATION	,
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	, Bottom , lacking
Illyria	LOCATION	, the Garden at
Belmont	LOCATION	, the forest of
Arden	LOCATION	, Pros - pero 's enchanted isle , the Athenian glades , lack - ing these , what would there be in art to compen - sate us ?

		Hazlitt preferred
Congreve	PERSON	's comedy to Shake - speare 's .

		It was an odd taste ; but after
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Congreve	PERSON	is , I think , the best English prose writer
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 best , not greatest , of course .

		For greatness there is required an intellectual and spiritual equipment that
Congreve	PERSON	did not have .

		Yet the great prose writers , his compeers and successors , Dry den , Swift , Pope , and
Johnson	PERSON	, seem to have looked upon him with a species of awe .

		His
Valentine	ORGANIZATION	and
Angelica	LOCATION	,
Mirabel	LOCATION	and
Millamant	PERSON	, are poor relations of Bene - dict and
Beatrice	PERSON	,
Orlando	LOCATION	and
Rosalind	PERSON	, in point of character , hut they have an equal estate of wit , and , what is more , a gift of speech so mysterious in its colloquial ease , its polished brilliance , that no one since has found its secret .

		When we turn to
America	LOCATION	for comedy , it is the snakes in
Iceland	LOCATION	over again .

		Americans have a credit for humor , hut our humor which gets into print is very pale and mild beside the broad and full-blooded mirth of other nations .

		Like the gen - tleman in
Goldsmith	LOCATION	, we hate what is low , and , though we are obligated to dance a hear , our hear dances only to the genteelest of tunes .

		We treat each other as if we had just graduated from a young ladies ' hoarding-school , or were possible contributors to some Ladies ' Journal .

		We will not see , at least in literature , that there is a coarse and animal side to life , and that for mere relief we must give it vent in speech if not in act .


Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	knew this necessity of human nature , and kept himself up through the deadliest ordeals by lapses into the broadest fun .

		It is impossible to doubt that coarse - ness exists in our life , that
Squire Westerns	PERSON	, and Wives of Bath , and Peachums , and Lockits , live in our midst .

		To a certain extent , the same prudery obtains in modern English literature .

		But
Dickens	PERSON	was deli - ciously '' low , ''
Thackeray	PERSON	's books are one long rogues ' gallery , and
Stevenson	PERSON	went in for ferocity with a vigor that alienated his female constituency .

		I hardly know , however , where to look for coarse - ness or raciness in American literature .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's people are all respectable and genteel .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	's are genteel , if they are not respectable .

		Mark Twain 's
Mississippi	LOCATION	roustabouts never say any - thing which would bring a blush to the cheek of modesty .


Bret Harte	PERSON	's heroes have the manners of grand opera .

		It is no better or worse if one goes backward .

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, a delicate humorist , seemed horn to preach the propaganda of the clean shirt .

		There is a precious spark or two of vulgarity in
Irving	LOCATION	, but it soon dies away into the general decency .

		Cooper 's heroes are moral prize-winners .

		Gazing on all this wide expanse of clean linen and well-washed humanity , the soul aches for a little dirt .

		Is there no material for real comedy among us ?

		Do n't our politicians bribe and betray ?

		Do n't our financiers bubble the community ?

		Do n't rich girls elope with coachmen ?

		Are there no scandals in the upper circles ?

		By the mass , no , if we may trust our books .

		Or if any of these things occur , they are treated with lamentation and tears , instead of with the ironic smile of the earth spirit which is comedy .

		It is a total misconception of genius to suppose that it will give us the highest if we forbid it to deal with the lowest .


Chaucer 's Wife of Bath	ORGANIZATION	is the corollary of the Prioress ; Falstaff is the necessary foil for
Rosalind	PERSON	and
Imogen	PERSON	.

		The rank - ness of the Decameron was necessary to grow the story of the Falcon , the most perfect brief narrative in literature .

		If we restrict our artists to the mid - dling , we must expect middling results .

		And medio - crity , hateful to God and men and columns , is what we have mainly got .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		COMMUNICA TION .

		AN
AMERICAN COMPATRIOT OF QAVAN DUFFY	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy	PERSON	, in his recently published autobiography , `` My Life in Two Hemispheres , '' re - viewed in the last issue of THE DIAL , mentions , as the most interesting feature of his Irish newspaper , '' The Nation , '' a number of young men who materially assisted the Irish cause by their poetical contributions to that journal .

		The plan of propagating the Nationalist re - form by poetry as well as by prose was one of the edi - tor 's original designs , a plan whose utility had been attested by his earlier journalistic attempt , '' The Belfast Vindicator . ''

		Sir
Charles	PERSON	declares that he was most agreeably surprised not only by the effusions of the editors and immediate writers to '' The Nation , '' but by the quality of the contributions from poets previously unknown .

		The Irish cause , under the leadership of '' The Nation '' in
Dublin	LOCATION	and the fiery eloquence of
O'Connell	PERSON	in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	two forces that worked together for some time , however unfortunate their relations finally became , seemed to act as an inspiration to the young poets of
Ireland	LOCATION	as well as her poetical sympathizers in other lands .


Thomas Davis	PERSON	,
Duffy	PERSON	's most efficient co-worker in the management of the paper , who had never hitherto published a line of poetry , early achieved a poetical reputation in the pages of '' The Nation '' ;
Clarence Mangan	PERSON	, already well known , added to his fame by his rhymical declarations in favor of repeal ;
O'Callaghan	PERSON	,
John Dillon	PERSON	,
John Keegan	PERSON	, De
Jean Fraser	PERSON	, and others , made the poet 's cor - ner of the new journal its most conspicuous department .

		One of these young men , who materially contributed to the poetical reputation of
Duffy	ORGANIZATION	's paper , died in
New Haven	LOCATION	a few months ago .

		It was about
1845	DATE	that Will - iam
James Linton	PERSON	began to write for '' The Nation , '' almost the only regular contributor , it is believed , who was not an Irishman .


Linton	PERSON	was at that time thirty - three years of age ; and his leaning for the Irish '' Na - tion '' and its treasonable utterances , however much it may have shocked his family and friends , was in no way inconsistent with his previous career .

		In his earliest youth he had broken away from his ancestral traditions ; had become a fond reader of Shelley 's '' Queen Mab '' and Lamennais ' '' Paroles d'un Croyant '' and a zealous champion of Republicanism and liberty .

		This associa - tion with men of doubtful conservatism had already es - tranged many useful acquaintances .

		He had already become the close friend and companion of
Mazzini	PERSON	, and the confidant and in many cases the participator in his plots for the Italian cause ; had formed , with the great Italian , the People 's
International League	ORGANIZATION	, whose aim was radically anti-monarchical ; had been one of the most conspicuous organizers of the
People 's Charter Union	ORGANIZATION	, 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, whose provisional rules , in Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's own handwrit - ing , have been found among his papers ; had lived much with working-men , chartists , Polish and Russian refu - gees , and had undertaken several literary enterprises with the aim of transforming
England	LOCATION	into a Republic .

		It is not at all surprising , therefore , that
Linton	PERSON	should have been profoundly affected by the new weekly news - paper at
Dublin	LOCATION	, which was pleading the Irish cause as it had never been pleaded before .

		In
1845	DATE	he became personally acquainted with
Duffy	PERSON	, breakfasting with him at his hotel in the
Haymarket	LOCATION	, and also with
Thomas Meagher	PERSON	.

		Duffy wished to engage
Linton	PERSON	in his
Young Ireland	LOCATION	cause ; he believed that he would be useful in attaching to his banner the '' remnants of the chartists , '' and en - couraged him to contribute to his paper .

		In response to the invitation ,
Linton	PERSON	wrote a large amount of prose , usually in the form of letters to the editor , discussing topics of policy on which he differed with the paper .

		These were signed by the pseudonym `` Spartacus , '' which had already gained something of a vogue in '' The Odd Fellow , '' a journal which Mr.
Linton	PERSON	had edited for
Henry Hetherington	PERSON	, one of the conspicuous anti- newspaper stamp agitators of the day .

		In
1849	DATE	,
Duffy	PERSON	invited
Linton	PERSON	to join the staff of '' The Nation , '' an honor prized by more pretentious litterateurs than the distinguished
London	LOCATION	wood-engraver .

		This invitation was , however , declined .


Linton	PERSON	did not care to attach himself to any one paper ; and there were things in '' The Nation '' such , for example , as its Catholic fervor to which he could not subscribe .

		He continued , however , as a contributor ; and in
1849	DATE	began the publication in '' The Nation '' of his most important poetical work up to that time , his '' Rhymes and Reasons Against Land - lordism . ''

		These poems had an extended vogue in their day , were collected in book form , and were deemed of sufficient merit to warrant an American edition
twenty years later	DATE	.

		These poems constituted one organic whole ; the same sentiment ran through them all , and the purpose was in every case the same .

		It was the author 's desire to por - tray graphically , from every point of view , what he re - garded as the one monstrous wrong of English rule in
Ireland	LOCATION	the landlord system .

		Everything was subor - dinated to this end .

		He was no advocate of the separa - tion of
Ireland	LOCATION	from
England	LOCATION	, and was therefore out of sympathy with the chief cause `` The Nation '' was attempting to promote the repeal of the act of
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neither did he endorse the papal policy of Sir
Gavan Duffy	PERSON	and his Catholic co-workers ; the Pope represented to Mr.
Linton	PERSON	everything that was evil and unprogres - sive .

		But in the landlord system he detected a genuine object of reform .

		Whatever faults Mr.
Linton	PERSON	may have had , he was surely never half-hearted and insincere in any cause he had espoused ; and the chief feature of his contributions to '' The Nation , '' therefore , was their unbounded enthusiasm .

		His poems gave a consecutive picture of the Irish tenantry of that day and the injus - tices they suffered at the hands of their English mas - ters .

		All the every-day miseries of life in
Ireland	LOCATION	, and all its stock characters , appeared in graphic succession in his pages .

		Whatever one may think of the poet 's philosophy , he certainly made his picture plain .

		The Irish peasant , ekeing out a bare existence in his miser - able hut , surrounded by his naked and half-starved wife and children , are held up in forcible contrast to his En - glish lord , living in splendor in his
London	LOCATION	house , squandering at the gaming-table and the race-track all the fruits of his tenants ' toil .

		Linton always conceived the two characters in this way .

		He was unable , appar - ently , to imagine a tenant who had more than a potato a day , or a landlord who was charitable or virtuous .

		His poems were full of evictions , deaths by the wayside , famines , and the like familiar features of Irish life .

		The most cheerful picture throughout his pages is an occa - sional immigration to
America	LOCATION	or
Australia	LOCATION	.

		`` Darkly speeds ` The Exile , ' draining The life blood of the land . ''

		There is one interesting feature of
Linton	PERSON	's verse and prose in '' The Nation '' to which he was himself accus - tomed to refer frequently in his later days .

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	was deeply interested in Mr.
Henry George	PERSON	's economic theories ; principally because they were almost identic - ally the same ideas that he had advocated in his early manhood . ''

		This is a very excellent book , '' he used to say , referring to Mr.
George	PERSON	's '' Progress and Poverty , '' '' but I preached those very same ideas forty years ago . ''

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's cure for the injustice of the Irish land sys - tem , indeed , was the same as Mr.
George	PERSON	's cure for pov - erty in general .

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	severed his connection with
Duffy	PERSON	and '' The Nation '' about the year
1850	DATE	, under unpleasant circumstances .

		The editor of '' The Nation '' was un - fortunate enough to cross
Linton	PERSON	in his most delicate point his friendship for and admiration of
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		Duffy frequently objected to
Linton	PERSON	's association with the great Italian , whose hostility to the Pope made him unpopular to the '' Young
Ireland	LOCATION	'' people .


Linton	PERSON	, however , loved
Mazzini	PERSON	and respected his anti-papal policy , and could not be persuaded to abandon either .

		There was no rupture between
Duffy	PERSON	and
Linton	PERSON	until the former violently attacked
Mazzini	PERSON	in the columns of '' The Nation . ''


Linton	PERSON	replied to the attack with such bitterness that he could not longer properly retain his connection with the paper .

		The two parted , therefore , though with no personal hostility .

		Duffy afterwards showed his regard for
Linton	PERSON	when the latter was criti - cized by
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	as an '' extremely windy crea - ture , of the George Sand ,
Louis Blanc	PERSON	species . '' ''

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	, '' said
Duffy	PERSON	, replying to this criticism , '' was less a Republican of the school of George Sand and
Louis Blanc	PERSON	than an English Republican of the school of
Milton	LOCATION	and
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like many of the gifted young men of the time , he found himself drawn towards ' The Nation , ' and contributed to it largely in prose and verse .

		I was delighted at the time , and still recall with pleasure the pictures he drew of the future we aimed to create . ''

		During Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's residence at
Appledore	LOCATION	, in
New Haven	LOCATION	, he corresponded frequently with his old friend and editor .

		They lost track of each other after
Duffy	PERSON	's departure to
Australia	LOCATION	, but when the latter returned to
Europe	LOCATION	and took up his residence at
Cimiez	LOCATION	, Nice , they renewed the old friendship .


Linton	PERSON	, indeed , was almost the last survivor of the men who , fifty years ago , made '' The Nation '' such a powerful force in English politics .

		Several of
Duffy	ORGANIZATION	's letters have been found among Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's effects , in which he refers lovingly to the old times , '' before we were grandfathers . '' ''

		We failed , both of us , '' he says , in one of these letters , '' in our immediate purpose , but it is a comfort in our declining years to know that we pursued it honestly , and that it will probably succeed in the end , though others will reap what we sowed .

		Let
Danton	PERSON	's name perish from his - tory , but live the people ! ' ''

		THE DIAL 315 PL.ATOXIC FRIENDSHIP .

		* Two trim volumes , now before us , contain nearly the whole of the ten years ' correspond - ence -LRB- covering the last decade of the poet 's life -RRB- between
Robert Burns	PERSON	and Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	.

		Of the letters in these volumes , forty-three of those written by
Burns	PERSON	have been published else - where by
Currie	PERSON	and other editors .

		The re - mainder , comprising thirty-eight of
Burns	PERSON	's letters and ninety-seven of Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	's , are now printed for the first time .

		The holographs of this new matter form the
Lochryan MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		now in the possession of Mr.
R. B. Adam	PERSON	, of
Buffalo	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, and were in all probability never seen by
Currie	PERSON	.

		The interweaving of the new letters with the old makes the correspond - ence of
Burns	PERSON	with Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	, as given in the present volumes , rarely complete , a careful search after possible lacunae having disclosed , as Mr.
William Wallace	PERSON	, the painstaking editor , tells us , only four places where it can safely be stated that a letter of
Burns	PERSON	is missing , while of the total of Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	's it seems that
Burns	PERSON	had lost or destroyed only nine .

		Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	's acquaintance with
Burns	PERSON	be - gan in
1786	DATE	; and of all the friendships the poet made , in
Ayrshire	LOCATION	and elsewhere , none , says
Gilbert Burns	PERSON	, seemed more agreeable to him than this one .


Burns	PERSON	was on the point of starting for
Edinburgh	LOCATION	before Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	had heard of him .

		She was suffering from a fit of depression consequent upon a long illness , when chance put into her hands a copy of the newly printed '' Poems . ''

		Opening the book at the pages ^ containing The
Cotter	PERSON	's
Saturday	DATE
Night	TIME	, '' she was so charmed and aroused by the sweet and true verses that she despatched a messenger post to
Mossgiel	LOCATION	, some fifteen miles away , with a note asking the poet for a half - dozen copies of the poems , and bidding him call at
Dunlop House	ORGANIZATION	at his earliest convenience .

		Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	was a lady of standing and of '' quality , '' and a descendant of the illustrious
Wallace	PERSON	to boot ; and the flattered bard lost no time in replying to her missive in his very worst that is to say , his most stilted and arti - ficial style .

		Those unfamiliar with
Burns	PERSON	's letters will find it hard to believe that the au - thor of '' Scotch Drink '' or the address to his * ROBKRT

New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Auld Mare Maggie '' could have penned , save as a joke , the following gorgeous preamble to a note thanking a friendly old lady for an order for his poems and an invitation to call on her . ''

		I am fully persuaded that there is not any class of mankind so feelingly alive to the titillations of applause as the Sons of
Parnassus	LOCATION	; nor is it easy to conceive how the heart of the poor Bard dances with rapture when those , whose character in life gives them a right to be polite judges , honor him with their approbation . ''

		Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	's rejoiner to this effusion is lost ; but her subsequent letters leave no doubt that she replied to it at length and in true
Richard	PERSON	- sonian style .

		Thus began a correspondence which , though it flagged a little occasionally on either hand , ended only with the poet 's life .

		Begun with zeal and industry on both sides , it was carried on for a year or two with zest .

		It slackened as early as
1789	DATE	, one or other cor - respondent keeping silent for a time ,
Burns	PERSON	being the usual offender , and Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	growing thereupon reproachful , nay , even angry , once so much so as to send him a curt note written in the third person .

		That the poet valued his correspondent most highly is clear , and he once assures her , in his usual high - flown -LRB- epistolary -RRB- style , that her letters form `` one of the most supreme of his sublunary enjoyments , '' and , again , that he would rather have '' a sheet of her Prose than a second poem on Achilles by Homer , or an Ode on Love by Sappho '' But there are occasional signs in his letters that there were seasons when even this ineffable '' Prose '' palled upon the recip - ient .

		It is pretty evident here and there that it was not read very carefully , if even at all , which is not altogether unpardonable , since Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	could be prolix and '' preachy , '' and , when in critical vein , provoking ; and the bard had his fits of depression and listlessness .

		Her wooden strictures on the '' undecencies '' of '' Tarn O'Shanter '' would have tried the temper of a saint ; and she sent the author of ''
Duncan Grray	PERSON	'' and '' The Banks of Doon '' reams of her own mild poetic chirpings , '' as a child , '' she modestly -LRB- yet expectantly -RRB- says , '' might scratch mathematical schemes to Sir
Isaac Newton	PERSON	. ''

		Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	was a better critifc of conduct than of poetry -LRB- she counsels her pro- tege to imitate '' the chaste
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	'' ! -RRB-

		, and her advice to
Burns	PERSON	as to mending his ways was as uniformly sound as that in regard to mending his verses was the contrary .

		After
Burns	PERSON	's visit at
Dunlop House	ORGANIZATION	, toward the close of
1792	DATE	, the correspondence languished perceptibly , though the letters written show no abatement in cordiality of tone .

		About two 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, years later , Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	went up to
London	LOCATION	, and from that time broke off writing suddenly and unaccountably , and it now appears finally .

		The
Lochryan MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		go to confirm the charge that she '' deserted ''
Burns	PERSON	before he died , for - sook him at the period when he most needed friends and solace .


Scott Douglass	PERSON	reckons the term of this '' desertion '' at '' two years '' ; but the discovery of a letter bearing date
January 12 , 1795	DATE	, reduces the period to about eighteen months .

		But a desertion it was , and , we are constrained to think , an unfeeling one .

		Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	was even proof against
Burns	PERSON	's dying appeal , written a few days before the end came .

		With the shadow of death plainly upon him , the poet took up his pen to close forever the correspondence with the friend who had turned unaccountably cold toward him . ''

		Madam , I have written you so often without recg .

		any answer , that I would not trouble you again but for the circumstances in which I am .

		An illness which has long hung about me in all probability will speed - ily send me beyond that bourne whence no traveller re - turns .

		Your friendship with which for so many years you honored me was a friendship dearest to my soul .

		Your conversation and especially your correspondence were at once highly entertaining and instructive .

		With what pleasure did I use to break the seal !

		The remem - brance yet adds one pulse more to my poor palpitating heart !

		Farewell !

		!

		! ''

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	, the present editor , is at some pains to account for , perhaps we may say to pal - liate , Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	's course .

		He ascribes her abandonment of Burns to '' inadvertance , '' which seems to us a rather lenient way of put - ting it .

		But there is certainly no direct and sufficient cause of alienation discoverable .

		The tone of the letter just quoted indicates that
Burns	PERSON	himself could have assigned none .

		There is in it no allusion to or trace of contrition for any past specific act of his that might have led to a breach .

		His old friend had unaccountably forsaken him , and his heart was sore ; that was all .

		Doubtless , when the grave at last closed over him , and the full pathos and significance of his last words came home to Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	, she sincerely repented her neglect .

		Such re - grets come in time to most of us , and only those who have felt them know their poignancy .

		Looking broadly at this whole matter , one is inclined to suspect that at bottom Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	's cult -LRB- it really amounted to that while it lasted -RRB- of
Burns	PERSON	was more or less of what we now term a fad .

		The patrician lady -LRB- she boasted rather more than the customary '' Scotch ell of gen - ealogy '' -RRB- certainly warmly admired the poetic gift of her rustic neighbor ; and , as the phrase runs , she '' took him up . ''

		Doubtless she at first idealized the author of '' The
Cotter	PERSON	's
Saturday	DATE
Night	TIME	, '' and for long but dimly discerned the somewhat gross and earthly side of him .

		But time and intimacy brought their disillusion - ments .

		Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	was something of a pre - cisian and a stickler for the proprieties ; and as
Burns	PERSON	the poet merged more and more in her apprehension into
Burns	PERSON	the unpolished farmer and loose-living exciseman , her enthu - siasm cooled proportionately , and in the end she was not unwilling to '' drop '' him .

		She now lives dimly in the memory of man solely by virtue of having known him .

		The relation , Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	thinks , between
Burns	PERSON	and Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	is unique in literary history .

		She was not to him what Mme. de
Warens	PERSON	was to
Rousseau	PERSON	, or what the '' divine Emily '' was to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, or what
Charlotte	LOCATION	von
Stein	PERSON	was to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		She seems to have had some notion of playing Lady
Hesketh	PERSON	to his
Cowper	PERSON	.

		What she wished to be to him is indi - cated in an early letter : '' I have been told
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	read all his manuscripts to an old woman and printed nothing but what she ap - proved .

		I wish you would name me to her office . ''

		Burns -LRB- '' never very amenable to counsel , '' as he owned -RRB- did not accede to this modest re - quest for which incompliance posterity may be truly thankful .

		With all her fondness for criticism , Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	was not a blue-stocking .

		Even her spelling -LRB- which the editor has left partly unconnected -RRB- leaves on the score of cor - rectness much to be desired .

		But she knew , as Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	notes , her Bible , her
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, her Shenstone , her
Richardson	PERSON	, and her Field - ing ; and her interest in literature was keen and unaffected .

		Judged as compositions , her letters are by no means models of their kind ; but they tell us scarcely less of
Burns	PERSON	than do
Burns	PERSON	's Therein lies their value ; and whosoever own .

		writes of
Burns	PERSON	the man hereafter will do well to study them .

		Apart from the general impres - sion of him one gathers from them , they afford here and there fresh bits of biographical infor - mation .

		One learns , for instance , that
Burns	PERSON	might have been a military officer , and alter - natively a professor in the
University of Edin	ORGANIZATION	- burgh , and that
Adam Smith	PERSON	once thought of making him a Salt Officer in the Customs ser - vice at thirty pounds a year .

		Touching the first possibility , Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	wrote
Burns	PERSON	, Feb - ruary 26 ,
1787	DATE	: '' Have your friends been able to point out any future plan for you ; or , as Pope said , shall Homer provide for his children ; or , if so , in what line would you wish it ?

		I suspect a military one , though without any other reason than the red berries you add to the beautiful garland of
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 317 the tenth Muse , * who , like the tenth wave of her seas , overtops all the rest that went before her . ''

		To this slenderly-based surmise the poet replied : '' Would the profits of that -LSB- an edition of his poems then printing -RSB- with rapture I would take your hint of a military life , as the most congenial to my feelings and situation of any other , but , what is wanting can not be numbered . ' ''

		In her reply of a week later Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	, having thought the matter over , proceeded to throw cold water on the not very promising military scheme . ''

		Indeed in your situation a military line wears sev - eral attractions , not wholly to be slighted , but which would be too dearly purchased by laying out your all for an ensigncy which , when you had it , could not make you happy , placed in a rank you could with difficulty support , unable to assist a mother or a friend with your purse , or comfort them with your presence , harassed and tost about , torn from those you loved , and condemned to a slavish dependence , a subaltern obedience to the capricious orders of petulaut , ignorant boys , who , though your inferiors in everything valuable , would despise talents they had not knowledge to discover or taste to relish , and pretend to overlook you were your hair worse drest or your hat worse cocked than their own .

		Indeed , should any of the nobles of the land present you with a pair of colors , the case would be very different , but I hope and trust you will never think of buying into the army unless you can command at least 250 more than the 400 which is the regulated price .

		I am sure I am right in this , and , if I saw you , could convince you by a thousand reasons .

		At any rate the pomp of war is more for poetry than practice , and although warriors may be heros , peace soldiers are mostly powdered monkies .

		So you see , if it will not do , I comfort you like the tod with the sour plums .

		`` f As for the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	professor - ship , it seems that in
1789	DATE	Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	pressed
Burns	PERSON	hard to become an applicant for the new
Chair of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	founded by Mr.
William Johnstone Pulteney	PERSON	, afterwards Baronet of Westerhall ; but the poet hardly appears to have given the project serious thought , believing , as he said , that the post was for him unattainable .

		Burns 's '' religion of the heart '' finds new and eloquent expression in several of the
Loch	LOCATION	- ryan letters .

		The following passage occurs in a consolatory note , called forth by the death of Mr.
Henri	PERSON	, a son-in-law of Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	. ''


Thomson	ORGANIZATION	says finely ' Attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds And offices of life to life itself And all its transcient joys sit loose . '

		And yet , like many other fine sayings , it has , I fear , more of philosophy than human nature in it .

		Poor
David	PERSON	's pathetic cry of grief is much more the language of man : < O Absalom !

		My son !

		My son ! '

		A world to Come !

		is the only genuine balm for an agonizing heart , torn to pieces in the wrench of parting for ever -LRB- to mor - tal view -RRB- with friends , inmates of the bosom and dear to t '' Coila '' of '' The Vision '' ; stanzas 9 and 46 .

		* The Scotch equivalent of the
Fox	ORGANIZATION	and the Grapes .

		the soul !

		The most cordial believers in a
Future State	ORGANIZATION	have ever been the Unfortunate .

		This of itself ; if God is good , which is I think the most intuitive truth in Nature ; this very propensity to , and supreme happiness of , depending on a Life beyond Death and the Grave , is a very strong proof of the reality of its existence . ''

		Again , on
August 2 , 1788	DATE	, he writes : '' I am in perpetual warfare with that doctrine of our reverend priesthood , that ' we are born into this world bondslaves of iniquity and heirs of perdition , wholly inclined to that which is evil , and wholly disinclined to that which is good , untill by a kind of spiritual filtra - tion or rectifying process called effectual Calling , ' etc. , the whole business is reversed , and our connections above and below completely change place .

		I believe in my conscience that the case is just quite contrary .

		We come into this world with a heart and conscience to do good for it , untill by dashing a large mixture of base alloy called prudence alias selfishness , the too precious metal of the soul is brought down to the blackguard sterling of ordinary currency . ''

		To certain familiar letters of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	's which have been variously interpreted , those of Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	form in several instances the needed supplement .

		Supporters of the modern view that
Burns	PERSON	was an '' inspired faun '' and a '' lewd peasant of genius '' will find their char - itable theory controverted in advance in a hitherto unprinted letter from the poet , which may be read in connection with one of Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	's bluntly informing him that '' A gen - tleman told me with a grave face the other day that you certainly were a sad wretch , that your works were immoral and infamous , that you lampooned the clergy and laughed at the ridic - ulous parts of religion , and he was told you were a scandalous free-liver in every sense of the word . ''

		In one new letter we find the bad - gered poet defending himself against a charge of writing Fescennine verse : '' I am very sorry that you should be informed of my supposed guilt in composing , in some midnight frolic , a stanza or two perhaps not quite proper for a clergy - man 's reading to a company of ladies .

		That I am the author of the verses alluded to in your letter , is what I much doubt .

		You may guess that the convivial hours of men have their mysteries of wit and mirth ; and I hold it a piece of contemptible baseness to detail the sallies of thoughtless merriment or the orgies of accidental intox - ication to the ear of cool sobriety or female Delicacy . ''

		There is a touch of unconscious humor in this vindication not unworthy of
Richard Swiveller	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	's editing is of the best sort vigilant , helpful , and unobtrusive ; and the pub - lishers have done their part in a tasteful way .

		There are frontispiece portraits of
Burns	PERSON	and Mrs.
Dunlop	PERSON	, together with some interesting facsimiles .

		Burns students will welcome these comparatively fresh and interesting volumes .

		E. G. J. 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, THE MONUMENTS AND ANTIQUITIES OF
GREECE	LOCATION	.

		* Some
eight years ago	DATE	, under the fantastic title of '' The Golden Bough , '' was published a work which immediately took rank as a classic in its special field of comparative mythology and folklore .

		The author , Mr.
J. G. Frazer	PERSON	, has since then devoted the large leisure of a
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	fellowship thrice renewed to the com - pletion of what is probably the greatest labor of erudition accomplished by any English scholar of this generation , a translation of
Pausanias	LOCATION	, with commentary and indices , in six volumes .

		Pausanias travelled through
Greece	LOCATION	at the time of the Antonines , in the
second century	DATE	, and composed what we may style an ancient
Baedeker	PERSON	or
Murray	PERSON	, with the qualification that it omits what Mr.
Hare	PERSON	calls dull useful infor - mation about inns and restaurants , and gives more space to garrulous historical and archae - ological disquisition than its modern successors .

		Pausanias had many predecessors now lost to us .

		There is still extant , under the name of Dicaearchus , a pupil of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	, a fragment of a lively description of
Greece	LOCATION	in which
Thebes	LOCATION	is portrayed with true Attic malice and Tanagra and its worthy farmers are picturesquely ex - tolled .

		We hear also of numerous special anti- quarian treatises , such as
Polemo	ORGANIZATION	's four books on the offerings of the
Acropolis	LOCATION	, or the work of Theodorus the Phocsean on the Round Build - ing at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	.

		These and countless other works
Pausanias	PERSON	doubtless consulted at one of the great public libraries of the empire , in order to correct and supplement his notes of travel and the dubious erudition of the local guides , who , as a hint of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	informs us , were as per - tinacious and voluble in
Greece	LOCATION	as they are in the
Italy	LOCATION	of to-day .

		He was a commonplace but painstaking and conscientious writer , liable now and then to blunder , and incapable of ex - ercising serious scholarly criticism on the vast mass of matter accumulated in his notes .

		He simply sets down , in a mechanical but conven - ient topographical order , what he saw and what he heard on the spot or subsequently read about it .

		His style , Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	, who ought to know , characterizes as '' looose , clumsy , ill - jointed , ill - compacted , rickety , and ramshackle . ''

		These facts have made him a sort of butt of modern German scholarship , which has no tolerance for anything but the loftiest genius and the most *

		absolute originality .

		It is assumed in his case , as in that of
Cicero	LOCATION	, that because the man , like all the rest of us , refreshed his memory with sec - ondary authorities , therefore he never saw the objects he pretends to describe nor read the books from which he quotes .

		From these ex - aggerations Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	is free .

		In a closely written introduction , he vindicates by internal evidence , as well as by the excavations of the last three decades , the essential fidelity and cor - rectness of his author , and extracts from his work everything that illustrates the man 's intel - lectual makeup , tastes , and beliefs .

		The re - mainder of the bulky first volume is occupied by the excellent translation , which entirely su - persedes worthy old
Thomas Taylor	PERSON	and the hack-work version in the
Bohn	PERSON	's Library .

		The Greek text , easily accessible in the Trubner edition , is not given ; but an appendix to the translation discusses all doubtful passages or important variations .

		The imagination is oppressed by the require - ments of an exhaustive commentary on
Pau	LOCATION	- sanias , whether contemplated as an ideal or in the concrete achievement of Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	's two thousand compact pages crammed with the minutest statements of specific fact , vouched for by chapter and verse citation of an appalling mass of technical literature .

		What
Pater	PERSON	says of the
Rome	LOCATION	of that day is equally applicable to the
Greece	LOCATION	which
Pausanias	PERSON	described .

		At no period of its history had it been better worth seeing . ''

		As in some vast intellectual museum , all its manifold products were intact and in their places , and with custodians also , still ex - tant , duly qualified to appreciate and explain them .

		The various work of many ages fell here harmoniously together , as yet untouched save by time . ''

		The munificence of
Hadrian	PERSON	and
Herodes Atticus	PERSON	had endowed
Greece	LOCATION	with many new structures of utility or splendor ; but still , as
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	tells us , the bloom of an un - dying youth dwelt on the creations of Phidias and Ictinus .

		Still , in many an ancient temple the conical stone or smoke-begrimed wooden images -LRB- xoana -RRB- of primitive fetichism , or the rigid faintly smiling figures of infantine Greek art , remained in startling juxtaposition with the masterpieces of Polyclitus and Praxiteles .

		The old wooden column that testified to the prehis - toric origins of Greek architecture still stood beside its fellows of stone in the temple of
Hera	LOCATION	at
Olympia	LOCATION	.

		The quaint pillar-shaped Apollo of Amycla3 still stood on the sofa-like throne which the Magnesian Bathycles decorated for him with the gold of Cro3sus .

		The Olympian
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319 guides still showed , in the back chamber of the temple of
Hera	LOCATION	, that miracle of early art , the cedar - wood chest richly wrought with reliefs in ivory and gold , dedicated by the old tyrant Cypselus in commemoration of the chest in which his mother had hidden him from the as - sassins .

		The shields of the Spartans captured at
Sphacteria	LOCATION	were still proudly exhibited on the
Acropolis	LOCATION	of
Athens	LOCATION	.

		The spoils of the bar - barian still decorated the national shrine of
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, and the three entwined serpents of bronze now at
Constantinople	LOCATION	still displayed the names of the Greek cities that crushed the Per - sian at
Plataea	LOCATION	.

		On the walls of the Cnidian Lesche at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, where the other day the French spade revealed a few bits of stucco painted with bright pigment , the cheeks of Cassandra still glowed rosy in the frescoes of Polygnotus , already as old as the frescoes of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	are to us .

		And though Megalopolis the great city had become '' a great wilderness , '' and teeming
Bosotia	PERSON	had been converted into a sheep-walk , the depredations of the dilettante proconsuls and emperors of
Rome	LOCATION	had not yet perceptibly diminished the population of bronze and marble gods , heroes and athletes , that still bore witness of the glory and loveliness that had passed away at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	,
Olympia	LOCATION	, and
Athens	LOCATION	.

		The commentator who would resuscitate this vanished world , and , following in
Pausanias	LOCATION	's footsteps , interpret , correct , and supplement him , must be philologian , topographer , archaeol - ogist , architect , and art critic in one , and must in addition be master of the allied disciplines of Greek history , antiquities , religion , mythol - ogy , and folk-lore .

		He must further be familiar with the results of the excavations of the past thirty years .

		He must know what the Germans did at
Olympia	LOCATION	, and what the French are doing at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	: what
Schliemann	PERSON	and Dorpfeld found at
Mycenae	LOCATION	and Tiryns ; the work of the British school at Megalopolis , of the American school at
Corinth	LOCATION	,
Argos	LOCATION	,
Icaria	LOCATION	, and
Sicyon	PERSON	, of the Greek archaeological society at Eleusis ,
Epidaurus	LOCATION	, and
Lycosura	PERSON	, not the facts only , but the vast literature of interpretation and con - troversy that has sprung up about them .

		Every page of Pausanias bristles with special '' Fra - gen , '' each jealously guarded by a corps of watch - ful specialists , who from time to time publish pamphlets in which they refute one another and uphold their own ingenious '' combinations . ''

		And of all these , our commentator must run the gauntlet .

		Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	modestly disclaims competency in so wide a field , and confesses that he is an expert in none of the branches of Archaeology .

		But his indefatigable erudition in codifying and his sound judgment in estimating the work of specialists have made him a very passable imi - tation of an expert in all , and there are few living scholars with whom he could not discuss on equal terms almost any topic in these vol - umes .

		To the high authority of Dr.
Dorpfeld	PERSON	in all questions of Architecture he shows proper deference , but that he has not altogether abne - gated the right of private judgment may be inferred from the observation , '' On a question of the state of
Athens	LOCATION	in the fifth century B. C. , I decidedly prefer the evidence of
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and Thucydides to that of Dr.
Dorpfeld	PERSON	and Professor von Wilamovitz Mollendorf . ''

		More specifically , he rejects
Dorpfeld	ORGANIZATION	's identification of the fountain Enneacrunns with the meagre cistern in the rock at the foot of the
Pnyx	ORGANIZATION	, vig - orously combats his theory that the pre-Persian temple of
Athena	ORGANIZATION	on the
Acropolis	LOCATION	was rebuilt in the face of the
Erechtheum	LOCATION	and served as the treasury of the goddess , refuses to accept his view of the situation of '' Dionysus in the Marshes , '' dissents from his identification of the Pythium with the
Cave of Apollo	ORGANIZATION	on the north side of the
Acropolis	LOCATION	, and approves the arguments of Professor
John Williams	PERSON	White against his opinion that the Pelargicum re - mained a fortress down to the days of Herodes Atticus .

		On the vexed question of the high stage , after perusing Dr.
Dorpfeld	PERSON	's recent book he still maintains , with the majority of French and English scholars , the tradkional view .

		This debate is fast approaching a dialectical dead - lock .

		On the one hand , we have the intrinsic improbability of a very high stage , and Dr.
Dorpfeld	PERSON	's masterly skill in employing his su - perior knowledge of architecture to explain away everything in the extant remains that to the layman seems to point to its actual exist - ence in the Greek theatre .

		On the other side , there is the feeling of scholars that it requires a suspicious amount of special pleading to eliminate the high stage from the tradition of antiquity , and the possibility at least of inter - preting the extant plays in harmony with the tradition .

		Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	sums up fairly well the usual arguments against Dr.
Dorpfeld	PERSON	's view .

		Like
Haigh	PERSON	, he overlooks the fact that the Delian inscription to which he appeals for the identification of the logeion with the stage building is a conjectural restoration ; and he is mistaken in affirming that the passage in which
Lucian	PERSON	describes the ludicrous downfall of an 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, actor in full tragic toggery necessarily implies a fall from the high stage to the orchestra .

		But it is obviously impossible to enter upon the de - tail of Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	's notes here .

		In the field of anthropology and folklore alone he collects material enough for a respect - able volume .

		Tree worship , the cap of invisi - bility , miraculous conceptions , the egg in myth - ology , female kinship , the marriage of the dead , the use of different languages by husband and wife , tribes that abstain from salt , the apple as a love token , the forty-one types of the story of the girl exposed to the dragon , the twenty-eight versions of the tale of the clever thief , divina - tion by '' hefting , '' by water , by lightning , by lizards and livers , the anointing of sacred stones , the clothing , the fettering , and the painting red of sacred images , the use of pigs ' blood in puri - fication , cursing as a means of invoking bless - ings , the beating of the ground to fertilize it , the ceremonial clipping of the hair , serpent worship , prohibition of widows ' marriages , the sacrifice of a finger to avert evil , such are a few of the topics on which he pours forth his copious and exact erudition .

		And as we turn the pages , still the wonder grows .

		Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	will explain to you the chemical cause of the rich golden patina on the columns of the
Parthenon	LOCATION	; the precise differ - ence between the welding and soldering of iron , and why the art of Glaucus must have been the former ; the engineering problems involved in the drainage of the Copaic lake ; the exploita - tion of the silver mines of
Laurium	LOCATION	in ancient and modern times ; the geological formation of the Isthmus of
Corinth	LOCATION	and the digging of the Isthmian canal ; the composition of the stucco used by Greek builders ; the effect on Greek architecture of the use of unburnt brick ; the different shaped clamps used in binding Greek masonry ; the early history of the arch and the five styles of masonry that may be distinguished in the walls of
Plataea	LOCATION	; why the ancient byssos can not have been cotton , and the effect of our civil war on the cultivation of cotton in
Greece	LOCATION	; the nature and origin of amber , etc. .

		He will gossip entertainingly about the fighting cocks of
Tanagra	LOCATION	, the singing trout of the river Aroanius , which , like
Pausanias	PERSON	, he failed to hear , '' though he tarried by the river till sun - set when they were said to sing loudest '' ; the earliest known parrots and peacocks ; the his - tory of the elephant and the rhinoceros in an - tiquity ; the white blackbirds of Cyllene and the possibility that they were selected by protective resemblance to the mountain snows ; the rela - tion of the pygmies to the dwarfs of central
Africa	LOCATION	, and a hundred other equally delightful themes .

		And all this , as well as his more seri - ous discussion of archa3ological and historical problems , is relieved by interesting notes of travel and charming descriptions of Greek scenery the falls of the Styx , the lakes of northern
Arcadia	LOCATION	, the view from the Acro - Corinthus , the pass of the Tretus , the caves of the
Erasmus	PERSON	,
the Valley of Sparta	ORGANIZATION	,
Sicyon	PERSON	,
Epidaurus	LOCATION	,
Troezen Ithome	PERSON	,
Bassffi	LOCATION	, and Arca - dian Aliphera '' mountain-built with peaceful citadel . '' ''

		Oh settentrional vedovo sito , Poi che private sei di mirar quelle . ''

		An appendix of one hundred and fifty pages apparently brings all this multifarious learning down to date , quoting the journals for
1897	DATE	and all the important new books of the year .

		In renewing our thanks to the author for this splendid gift , we should not forget the pub - lishers , who have merited well of the republic of letters by their willingness to undertake in the cause of learning the immense preliminary expenditure necessarily involved in the careful printing of such a mass of detail , with all the accompanying maps , plans , and illustrations .

		They seem to have spared no pains to make the work an indispensable thesaurus of knowl - edge for all who take interest in the geography , the monuments , and the antiquities of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		WILLIAM
MORRIS	PERSON	'S LAST ROMANCES .

		* The work of
William Morris	PERSON	has very dis - tinctly gone through a number of phases .

		The labors of some men strike at the beginning a certain keynote , which is kept without great change to the end .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's latest prose and verse follow in the main the direc - tions which his earlier efforts took , and he is to-day , however broadened and deepened , the man who took the world , as it were , by storm .

		The writer , on the other hand , who produced '' The Defence of Guinevere '' is very different from the man who produced '' The Story of the Glittering Plain '' and `` The Water of the Wondrous Isles . ''

		There has been here not only a deepening of the intellectual life , but a rise into a new and somewhat alien sphere , alien to the dream-like poetry with which he began * THE SUNDERING FLOOD .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 321 his career ; and yet there is also a return : the mysticism which marked
Morris	PERSON	's first volume , abandoned during his middle years , reappears in the later books .

		The life of
William Morris	PERSON	presents a tire - less energy which converts admiration into its primal element of wonder .

		He did enough for half a dozen men ; indeed , he was not merely one but half a dozen persons .

		His successes as a decorative artist were sufficient to fill the ambition of a large mind , and yet they were cast into the shade by his purely literary work .

		This latter also spanned a wider field than most men care to undertake , and still the excellence in diverse ways remains singular and note - worthy .

		The early volume of poems , '' The Defence of Guinevere , '' was full of a vague suggestion that gave it a certain indefinable charm , and that yet stood in the way of its general accept - ance . ''

		The Life and Death of Jason '' fear - lessly emerged from this half-darkness , but re - tained the power of dealing simply and directly with the mysterious , which is found again in so high a degree in the last prose romances .

		There is no intention here of going through the long catalogue of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		That has already been done in a previous number of this journal .

		The purpose is to show rapidly and briefly his progress and unfolding .

		He has reached the stage when he calls himself the '' idle singer of an empty day . '' ''

		The Earthly Paradise '' is filled with an undertone of sadness and resignation ; the hopelessness of attempting to deal with riddles which seem more insoluble than ever the riddles of life and death pierces through that dazzling array of poems with a strange persistency .

		The lyrics which introduce the division into months give a mod - ern touch , in contrast and yet in harmony with the old-world stories unrolling before us like pictures on a tapestry .

		But the emergence from this atmosphere already shows in the work .

		In '' The Lovers of Gudrun '' we enter another world , the world of genuine men and women , who have many and grievous ills , who are torn by conflicting emotions and impulses , and who , above all , live , and feel that their lives have purpose and meaning .

		The clear and invigor - ating air of the Northern legends seems to have been better and healthier for the heroic lungs of
William Morris	PERSON	than the suaver imaginings of warmer climes .

		The great ''
Sigurd	PERSON	the Volsung '' combines in itself all the splendid qualities of
William Morris	PERSON	's genius .

		It is , we think , the high - water mark of his literary productivity .

		All the great elements of the various versions of the great stories which it tells once more are combined in it .

		The
Volsunga Saga	ORGANIZATION	and the Niebelungenlied are laid under contribution ; the mysterious is subordinated to the human in it ; and the manner of telling has only so much of the archaic as to give remoteness and breadth .

		The interest in real life pervades it ; the heroic in action and the delight of achievement are celebrated in its ringing lines .

		The poet has come out of the dreamland of '' , The Earthly Paradise '' ; if life can not be understood , it yet affords a large field for the doing of things worthy to be done ; and , in the Morality , '' Love is Enough , '' we are told that we may dispense with everything that the world ordin - arily esteems , provided we have affection and sympathy and space wherein to labor .

		This may not be a satisfactory solution of our diffi - culties , but it is a long advance over the idle - ness of an empty day .

		In this connection a word may be interpolated about the translation of the Odyssey and the ^ 3neid and the Norse Sagas .

		Whatever may be said of them as suc - cesses in the impossible art of reproducing a poem in an alien medium , they indisputably have the merit of reading as if they were to the manner born ; they are as much a part of En - glish literature as though they had first seen the light of day under the changeable English skies .

		They add to our impression of the heroic activ - ity of the writer , who could give us these as well as the vast body of his original work .

		Here is , indeed , an Anglo-Saxon Sigurd with limit - less capacity for forging marvels and an un - shaken hold upon youth and all that it implies .

		This is not the place to say much about
Morris	PERSON	's devotion to the cause of socialism ; the latter years of his life were intensely given to it , and his prose romances show its influence clearly enough .

		No doubt these romances sprang out of his Northern studies and his changed outlook upon mankind and the world .

		The breath of
Mediaeval Romance	ORGANIZATION	is all through them .

		They point to simpler forms of living , to fellowship in having and doing , to adven - tures generously pursued for the welfare of the many .

		They occupy a unique place in the lit - erature of the day , and it is not an easy matter to assign to them the consideration which is their due .

		Of them all , the first to be published , the '' House of the Wolfings , '' will perhaps command the most general acceptance .

		The communal life described in that book had doubtless its serious fascination for the author , 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, and the story is written throughout with un - flagging enthusiasm .

		The motive is simple and inspiring , the series of pictures varied and finished .

		How far the allegorical tendencies of these romances are to be pushed is a question which hardly calls for a categorical reply . ''

		The Story of the Glittering Plain '' lends itself readily to a consistent interpretation which can hardly have been entirely absent from its author 's intention . ''

		The Roots of the Mountains '' was , we are told , the best of the romances in
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's opinion .

		The last of them , '' The Sundering Flood , '' may surely re - ceive a high meed of praise .

		The allegory , if allegory there be , is not forbidding in its diffi - culty , nor carried out with undesirable minute - ness .

		The conquest of love and faith over seemingly insuperable obstacles is made plain and convincing ; the heroism of Osberne shines like that of Sigurd himself ; the counsellor and guide ,
Steelhead	ORGANIZATION	, is not an altogether mysterious personage ; and the final return to the simple and wholesome life of the dalesman , from the complications of a civilization not conscious of itself or its needs , points a moral and adorns a tale .

		With '' The Water of the Wondrous Isles '' one may perhaps be pardoned for hav - ing some questionings ; although no one need have any questionings as to the heroine , Bird - alone , in her courage and her womanliness .

		Nor will one have any questionings in regard to the springlike freshness which pervades the entire story , the wealth of incident , the clear - ness of description , the exhaustless resources of an imagination which knows no such thing as weariness .

		Still , the voyage from island to island of the wondrous sea has more of the allegorical about it than the sundering flood , and the magical element in the book removes it more from the prosaic sympathies of the day .

		No one need , however , take the whole as other than it presents itself to be ; and then , the nar - rative is admirable .

		Through the various trials of inexperience , the girl Bird alone , helped by the mystical wood-mother
Habundia	PERSON	, passes , and in her triumphs uplifts with herself all those with whom she comes in contact .

		The indescribable charm and atmosphere of the art of
William Morris	PERSON	are over both books , and one may as well surrender at discretion to that magic and influence .

		The founder of the
Kelrnseott Press	ORGANIZATION	would gladly hold in his hand these volumes , such fine exemplars of the printer 's art are they .

		If a good story ought to have a goodly investiture , it has been given in the present instance ; and the fortunate possessor of these romances will not only have two beautiful books , but two happy specimens of the work of a man whose recognition as one of the leaders of his time , and a benefactor of the race , is assured .

		MEXICO THROUGH FRIENDLY EYES .

		* Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	is always enthusiastic : he loves or he loves not .

		And just now his love is Mex - ico , and in '' The Awakening of a Nation '' he gives us some striking and suggestive sketches .

		He sees much to admire in
Mexico	LOCATION	, and a great part of what he admires is due to Spanish influ - ence .

		This is unwelcome just now when it is the fad to hate and despise
Spain	LOCATION	and the Span - iard .

		But , after all , hatred and contempt alter no facts ; and it is true that the Spaniard has been a wonderful explorer , a not unkind con - queror , and a marvellously good governor , more than once . ''

		His marca is upon the faces , the laws , the very land - scape .

		How significant this is , we may better judge when we remember that the
Saxon	PERSON	, masterful though he is , has never anywhere achieved these results .

		He has filled new lands with his speech and his faith -LRB- or his lack of it -RRB- , but only by filling them with his own blood , never by changing the native .

		The
United States	LOCATION	, for instance , is of his speech ; but what Indian tribe speaks English ?

		In the vastly greater area of Spanish Amer - ica , every Indian tribe speaks Spanish and has done so for centuries .

		The
Saxon	PERSON	has never impressed his language or his religion upon the people he has overrun . ''

		It was that same Spaniard in
America	LOCATION	who developed in
Mexico	LOCATION	a golden age of letters in the sixteenth century , long before
Plymouth	LOCATION	Rock felt pilgrim footsteps .

		Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	does well to hint at this . ''

		The Bay Psalm-Book '' was not the first book printed in
America	LOCATION	, nor were '' The Jesuit Relations '' the '' very first beginnings of American literature . ''

		How naive and amusing such claims would be , were they not humiliating evidence of narrow ignorance !

		The first American books were in Spanish , of course ; and they represent a great variety in subject , treatment , and character .

		Some fea - tures of that early literature are most curious .

		Thus , as Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	says : '' Another striking point in the literary history of
Mexico	LOCATION	and one wholly without parallel in ours is this : in the first generation after the Conquest there was already in
Mexico	LOCATION	a band of Indian authors like
Tobar	PERSON	,
Zapata	LOCATION	,
Tezozomoc	LOCATION	,
Chimalpain	LOCATION	,
Camargo	LOCATION	,
Pomar	PERSON	, the * THE AWAKENING OF A NATION :

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 323 Ixtlilxochitls , and others , whom no student of
Ameri	LOCATION	- cana can ignore . ''

		How can we fit this with our narrow prejudice : '' It is curious to remember that up to 1830 no book was ever so handsomely published in the
United States	LOCATION	as the
Lorenzana	LOCATION	edition of the Letters of
Cortez	LOCATION	, ' in
Mexico	LOCATION	in
1770	DATE	. ''

		We have called the sixteenth century a golden age of letters in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		It was such .

		At that time there was there poetry of a high order ; there was history , chronicle , belles-lettres ; there was philosophy and theology ; there was science and very creditable science too .

		The
University of Mexico	ORGANIZATION	was flourishing and turning out bril - liant scholars long before
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	was dreamed of .

		Model industrial schools with hundreds of Indian pupils , where not only theory but trades were taught , grew up under devoted friars .

		Even schools for the careful study of the native Indian tongues existed , and a college of twenty diligent students studying the Otomi language had been established in the Indian town of Huiskelucan .

		But Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	does not unduly linger over the past .

		He deals with
Mexico	LOCATION	of to-day an awakened nation .

		One of his first asser - tions will come with a shock to our prejudice and ignorance . ''

		To-day
Mexico	LOCATION	is and I say it deliberately the safest country in
America	LOCATION	.

		Life , property , human rights , are more secure than even with us . ''

		This is the
Mexico	LOCATION	of to-day , not the
Mexico	LOCATION	of twenty years ago .

		Few realize the vast changes of a single year in our sister republic .

		Yet Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's state - ment might have been made , in fact it was made , years ago .

		In
London	LOCATION	, in
1892	DATE	, 1 heard a prominent man lecture on
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		He said : '' Many consider
Mexico	LOCATION	dangerous , believe that life and property are not secure .

		I know well all parts of the
United States	LOCATION	, and do not hesitate to say that life and property are more secure in every part of
Mexico	LOCATION	than in any of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		I felt that this was the rabid utterance of a prejudiced Englishman , - but I did not then know
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	treats of the natural resources of the country , describes the ferment now lead - ing to their development , and shows how a financial condition which would paralyze us has been to
Mexico	LOCATION	, with her different conditions , a helpful stimulus .

		He gives glimpses of the great enterprises now undertaken .

		The old mining industry , once the great wealth of the country , is still important , but will soon be insignificant when compared with the agricul - tural , manufacturing , and carrying industries .

		He emphasizes , and with the highest justice , the fact that this mighty progress is chiefly due to one person not only a great Mexican , but a great man
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	, the President of the Republic .

		He sketches the romantic career of this man in whose hands the national destiny has so long rested .

		We do not grudge one word of praise to
Diaz	PERSON	; he deserves it .

		But we might wish that our author had a little more emphasized the work of that inscrutable Indian ,
Juarez	PERSON	, to whom personally and polit - ically Diaz owes so much .

		We will quote but one more passage from our author : it is not simply captious . ''

		It is notorious to those who know both countries thoroughly , that educated Americans are far more igno - rant of
Mexico	LOCATION	than educated Mexicans are ignorant of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		One reason is , doubtless , that we are the more shining mark ; but another is that the Latin - American nations have rather different ideas of a diplomatic service .

		They do not send to any country an ambassador who will be lost there without an inter - preter .

		Even down to consuls , this ridiculous supersti - tion is operative .

		Men are selected who are at least gentlemen in appearance ; who can command the respect - ful attention of business men ; who know how to ask for the information they desire .

		The result is that
Mexico	LOCATION	is steadily informed of the moods and needs of this country . ''

		A pity ' t is ' t is true .

		324 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	.

		His occasional contribu - tions of verse to '' The Athenaeum , '' together with the few pieces that have already found their way into the anthologies , have served to whet to a keen edge the interest of literary students , who have long felt it a wrong to letters that a poet of such extra - ordinary critical acumen and technical mastery of the art of rhythmical expression should remain un - known save to the few who had tracked him to his haunts .

		Two or three years ago , the announcement was made that his poems were at last to be produced by his friend
William Morris	PERSON	in a
Kelmscott	LOCATION	vol - ume , and the interest of book-lovers was all agog at the prospect .

		The untimely death of
Morris	PERSON	put an end to this project , and affected Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	in a way of which he must be allowed to speak for himself .

		`` Among the friends who saw much of that great poet and beloved man during the last year of his life , there was one who would not and could not believe that he would die myself .

		To me he seemed human vitality concentrated to a point of quenchless light ; and when the appalling truth that he must die did at last strike through me , I had no heart and no patience to think about anything in connection with him but the loss that was to come upon us . ''

		The next year , nevertheless , the writer put forth in a thin booklet his superb `` Jubilee greeting at Spithead to the Men of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	, '' a poem which gives impassioned embodiment to the patriotic sentiment of the occasion by which it was inspired , and which is equalled we hardly dare to say surpassed only by the '' Recessional '' of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		This publication gave us at least a fore - taste of what might be expected from '' The Com - ing of Love , and Other Poems , '' the volume which has at last seen the light .

		It is safe to say that this volume is one of the strongest and most original contributions to literature that have been made of recent years , and that there is no living English poet save only Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	from whose hands we might expect a gift of greater and more lasting value .

		Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	drinks from his own glass , which is both wide-brimmed and ample ; and his utterance , whatever may be its subject , has the touch of high distinction that marks the difference between the artists and the mechanics of verse .

		In its choice of subject , indeed , the art of the poet is put to the severest of tests in the titular poem , which fills about a third of the volume , and is a sequence of sonnets , lyrics , and dramatic epi - sodes which tell of the poet 's love for the gypsy maiden
Rhona	PERSON	.

		This maiden is absolutely unlet - tered , and much of the story is told in her own words , including a plentiful infusion of Romany vocables and uncouth English phrases .

		No more unpromising material than this could well be imag - ined , yet the result impresses the reader first and last as poetry of a high order .

		Let us quote two stanzas from
Rhona	PERSON	' s letter to her absent lover . ''

		She sez , ' The whinchat soon wi ' silver throat Will meet the stonechat in the bnddin whin , And soon the blackcap 's airliest gillie ` nil float From light-green boughs through leaves a-peepin thin ; The wheat-ear soon ` ull bring the willow-wren , And then the fust fond nightingale ` ull follow , A-callin ' Come , dear , ' to his laggin hen Still out at sea , ' the
spring	DATE	is in our glen ; Come , darlin , wi ' the comin o ' the swallow . ' ''

		The thought o n't makes the snow-drifts o '
December	DATE	Shine gold , ' I sez , ' like daffodils o '
spring	DATE	Wot wait beneath : he 's comin , pups , remember ; If not fer me no singin birds ` ull sing : No choring chiriklo ` ull hold the gale Wi ' ' Cuckoo , cuckoo , ' over hill and hollow ; There '11 be no crakin o ' the meadow-rail , There '11 be no ' Jug-jug ' o ' the nightingale , For her wot waits the comin o ' the swallow . ' '' ''

		The Coming of Love '' as a whole is difficult to characterize .

		It is too episodical to form a contin - uous story , yet it has emotional unity , and this trag - edy of the soul , passing from the careless joy of the years '' before the coming of love '' into the raptur - ous days when '' natura benigna '' is the watchword of the world , and through these to dark days of suffering with their sinister vision of '' natura ma - ligna , '' winning at the end a passionless and trans - cendental peace , seems to offer a typical portrayal of the pilgrim 's progress of the inner life .

		And scat - tered through it all are such unforgettable verses as `` Song leaps from deeps unplumbed by spoken word , '' and '' If heaven 's bright halls are very far from sea , I dread a pang the angels could not ` suage , '' and '' Love is still his own orthographer As when on scriptured leaves of asphodel He taught his earliest pupil , Eve , to spell , '' and '' From that dear harp , her heart , whose chords are love , '' and '' Though Love be mocked by Death 's obscene derision , Love still is
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's truth and Death her lie , '' and , most wonderful of all , the '' First Kiss '' sonnet , long familiar to all who treasure the purest gold of English poetry , yet which we venture to quote for the sheer pleasure of transcription . ''

		If only in dreams may Man be fully blest , Is heaven a dream ?

		Is she I claspt a dream ?

		Or stood she here even now where dew-drops gleam And miles of furze shine yellow down the West ?

		I seem to clasp her still still on my breast Her bosom beats : I see the bright eyes beam .

		I think she kiss 'd these lips , for now they seem Scarce mine : so hallow 'd of the lips they press 'd .

		Yon thicket 's breath can that be eglantine ?

		Those birds can they be Morning 's choristers ?

		Can this be
Earth	LOCATION	?

		Can these be banks of furze ?

		Like burning bushes Jired of God they shine !

		I seem to know them , though this body of mine Passed into spirit at the touch of hers ! ''

		The verse which we have ventured to italicize would not be easy to match , even in the greatest of our poets .

		The remaining contents of this volume include , besides the miscellaneous section , the poem called '' Christmas at the Mermaid , '' a lyrical rosary whose beads are told by
Jonson	PERSON	and
Raleigh	LOCATION	and
Drayton	PERSON	and ''
W. H.	PERSON	, '' singing now the praises of the friend who has lately left
London	LOCATION	for the quiet
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 325 of
Stratford	LOCATION	, now the glories of English patriotism as illustrated by the repulse of the Armada , and all the great deeds that were still thrilling in English souls .

		The miscellaneous pieces are mostly sonnets , and nearly all of them are of an occasional or per - sonal character .

		They establish beyond cavil the place of their author among the great English sonnet - writers , a place beside
Milton	LOCATION	and
Keats	PERSON	and Words - worth and
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		It is hard to choose among poems of such beauty and distinction , but perhaps the sonnet-sequence '' What the Silent Voices Said , '' inspired by the funeral of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, may be taken as the high-water mark of the poet 's achievement in this sort of memorial verse .

		Of the six sonnets thus linked together , we quote the last . ''

		Beyond the sun , beyond the farthest star , Shines still the land which poets still may win Whose poems are their lives whose souls within Hold naught in dread save Art 's high conscience-bar Who have for muse a maiden free from scar Who know how beauty dies at touch of sin Who love mankind , yet , having gods for kin , Breathe , in Life 's wood , zephyrs from climes afar .

		Heedless of phantom Fame heedless of all Save pity and love to light the life of Man True poets work , winning a sunnier span
For Nature	ORGANIZATION	's martyr
Night	ORGANIZATION	's ancestral thrall : True poets work , yet listen for the call Bidding them join their country and their clan . ''

		Two sonnets , one addressed to Mrs.
Garfield	PERSON	in the hour of her great sorrow , the other '' To
Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' on the death of
Lowell	LOCATION	, have a peculiar interest to American readers , and no generous Amer - ican can be deaf to the appeal of such lines as these : '' How shall ye honor him whose spirit stands Between you still ?

		keep Love 's bright sails afloat , For
Lowell	PERSON	's sake , where once ye strove and smote On waves that must unite , not part , your strands . ''

		During the past few weeks the name of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	has become , in certain critical quar - ters at least , one to conjure with .

		The loud acclaim which has greeted his recent volume of '' Poems , '' coupled with the notoriety attendant upon his ex - ploitation by a self-constituted English '' Academy , '' have together made his name familiar to a great many readers .

		The thin volume by which the ex - travagant claims made for Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	by his spon - sors must either be justified or fall to the ground is now before us , and the question becomes pertinent whether he has really achieved greatness or merely had it thrust upon him by over-zealous friends .

		When we remember the sort of thing that even so sane and conservative a critic as
R. H. Hutton	PERSON	not so long ago said in '' The Spectator '' about the then newly-discovered poet of ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Grave , '' we are at least given pause at sound of the praise that has been heaped upon Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, and made to realize the unwisdom of a stampeded judgment .

		Some degree of suspicion is justifiable under these circumstances , and it is therefore something of a surprise to find the work of Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	on the whole so admirable .

		It is of very uneven quality , indeed , and such poems as '' The Wife '' and '' The Woman with the Dead Soul , '' which have been sin - gled out for special praise , do not impress us as being quite deserving of it .

		Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	has recently dissented from this critical acclaim , point - ing out very justly that a great theme is as import - ant as noble treatment in the making of tragedy .

		There is , of course , a question-begging element in this criticism , for the human soul may rise to gran - deur in the most humble or sordid environment ; but at least the poet should not emphasize , as Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	seems to do , the prosaic surroundings of the women whose tragedy is portrayed in these two poems .

		As Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	has said more than once , the dying-out of the soul within a man or a woman is an awful thing , fit for the most tragic contemplation ; but the effect may be spoiled by an excess of realism in the treatment .

		At least the realism should be spiritual rather than material , a truth that Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	seems not to have grasped in writing the poem with which his volume opens .

		Yet , for all this defect , there are wonderful things in the poem , particularly these lines descriptive of the dying soul 's last moments of hectic life . ''

		For not at once , not without any strife , It died ; at times it started back to life , Now at some angel evening after rain , Builded like early Paradise again , Now at some flower , or human face , or sky , With silent tremble of infinity , Or at some waft of fields in
midnight	TIME	sweet , Or soul of
summer	DATE	down in the dark street . ''

		There are exquisite things , too , in the '' Christ in Hades '' phantasy , by which Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	first made himself known a year or more ago , and which comes at the close of the present collection .

		But our highest praise and remaining space must be reserved for ''
Marpessa	LOCATION	, '' a poem which could hardly have been written had it not been for
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Tithonus , '' which is constantly awakening echoes of the great singers of the past , yet has so distinctive a beauty of its own that we should mourn indeed were it to be lost out of the treasury of our literature . ''

		Mar - pessa , being given by Zeus her choice between the god Apollo and Idas a mortal , chose Idas '' such is the descriptive legend which introduces us to the poem .

		Here is the plea of Idas for the love of
Marpessa	LOCATION	, a passage of such perfect beauty as to need no commentary . ''

		I love thee then Not only for thy body packed with sweet Of all this world , that cup of brimming
June	DATE	, That jar of violet wine set in the air , That palest rose sweet in the night of life ; Nor for that stirring bosom all besieged By drowsing lovers , or thy perilous hair ; Nor for that face that might indeed provoke Invasion of old cities ; no , nor all Thy freshness stealing on me like strange sleep .

		Not for this only do I love thee , but
Because Infinity	ORGANIZATION	upon thee broods ; And thou art full of whispers and of shadows .

		Thou meanest what the sea has striven to say So long , and yearned up the cliffs to tell ; Thou art what all the winds have uttered not , What the still night snggesteth to the heart .

		Thy voice is like to music heard ere birth , Some spirit lute touched on a spirit sea ; Thy face remembered is from other worlds , 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, It has been died for , though I know not when , It has been sung of , though I know not where .

		It has the strangeness of the luring West , And of sad sea-horizons ; beside thee I am aware of other times and lands , Of birth far-back , of lives in many stars .

		O beauty lone and like a candle clear In this dark country of the world !

		Thou art My woe , my early light , my music dying . ''

		Even the god can not match the eloquence of this appeal , and the maiden makes choice of the mortal .

		The lot of Tithonus seems to her far less desirable than the lot of human lovers who grow old together , in whom passion of youth becomes transmuted into the calm affection of maturity .

		`` So shall we live .

		And though the first sweet sting of love be past , The sweet that almost venom is , though youth , With tender and extravagant delight , The first and secret kiss by twilight hedge , The insane farewell repeated o'er and o'er , Pass off ; there shall succeed a faithful peace ; Beautiful friendship tried by sun and wind , Durable from the daily dust of life . ''

		The poem which contains these passages , and others of almost equal beauty , constitutes a real addition to English song , and makes us exceedingly hopeful of the writer 's future .

		We have given up hoping for great things from Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	.

		He has a considerable talent for serious verse of the higher imitative order , but that talent was displayed almost if not quite as fully in his first volume as in any succeeding one . ''

		The Hope of the World '' is the eighth collection of orig - inal verse that he has put forth , and is , like its pre - decessors , a curious mixture of strength with weak - ness , of intellectual passion with mere rhetorical froth .

		For one thing , Mr.
Watson	PERSON	can not get rid of the self-consciousness that even here , in his latest volume , prompts him to describe himself as '' Singing a nation 's woe , in wonder and ire , Against me half the wise and all the great . ''

		One of the most unfortunate things about Mr.
Wat	PERSON	- son 's verse is that it so often inevitably invites com - parison with the greatest achievements of English song , and naturally to its discomfiture .

		Readers of '' Hellas , Hail ! ''

		can not help thinking of the glori - ous lyrical outburst of another '' Hellas , '' while the poem to '' The Unknown God '' deliberately chal - lenges comparison with Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's magnificent '' Recessional . ''

		Whatever may be the philosophical justification for the intellectual attitude of this invo - cation , the poverty of its form is evident enough when we put by the side of the poorest of Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling 's stanzas such a passage as the following : '' Best by remembering God , say some , We keep our high imperial lot .

		Fortune , I fear , hath oftenest come When we forgot when we forgot ! ''

		We can not ignore a contrast thus forced upon our attention , and the pale abstractions of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's verses make but a poor showing by the side of the rich imagery and the religious passion of Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling 's hymn .

		In this as in his other volumes Mr.
Watson	PERSON	is at his best when he essays some bit of spir - itual portraiture , as in these '' Jubilee Night '' verses : '' Long watched I , and at last to the sweet dale Went down , with thoughts of two great women , thoughts Of two great women who have ruled this land ; Of her , that mirrored a fantastic age , The imperious , vehement , abounding spirit , Mightily made , but gusty as those winds , Her wild allies that broke the spell of
Spain	LOCATION	; And her who sways , how silently !

		a world Dwarfing the glorious
Tudor	PERSON	's queenliest dreams ; Who , to her wellnigh more than mortal task , Hath brought the strength-in-sweetness that prevails , The regal will that royally can yield : Mistress of many peoples , heritress Of many thrones , wardress of many seas ; But destined , more melodiously than thus , To be hereafter and forever hailed , When our imperial legend shall have fired The lips of sage and poet , and when these Shall , to an undispersing audience , sound No sceptred name so winningly
august	DATE	As Thine , my Queen , Victoria the Beloved ! ''

		The poet of '' Homeward Songs by the Way '' has endeared himself to the lovers of contemplative verse , and his new volume will meet an appreciative welcome from readers whose souls are attuned to the elusive harmonies of his soft and dreamy meas - ures .

		In '' The Earth Breath , and Other Poems '' Celtic color and glamour are blent with a strain of oriental mysticism , and the product is exquisitely imaginative and tender .

		It is indeed a '' fountain of shadowy beauty '' -LRB- to quote one of the happiest titles of the volume -RRB- whose springs are at the com - mand of this fine spirit , but the passion is no less deep for being veiled in these subtle mists of deli - cate imagery .

		Let us reproduce one of the simpler lyrics . ''

		Image of beauty , when I gaze on thee , Trembling I waken to a mystery , How through one door we go to life or death By spirit kindled or the sensual breath . ''

		Image of beauty , when my way I go ; No single joy or sorrow do I know : Elate for freedom leaps the starry power , The life which passes mourns its wasted hour . ''

		And , ah , to think how thin the veil that lies Between the pain of hell and paradise !

		Where the cool grass my aching head embowers God sings the lovely carol of the flowers . ''

		Lovelier than these verses , if such a thing be possi - ble , are the stanzas which dedicate the volume to Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	. ''

		I thought , beloved , to have brought to you A gift of quietness and ease and peace , Cooling your brow as with the mystic dew Dropping from twilight trees . ''

		Homeward I go not yet ; the darkness grows ; Not mine the voice to still with peace divine : From the first fount the stream of quiet flows Through other hearts than mine . ''

		Yet of my night I give to you the stars , And of my sorrow here the sweetest gains , And out of hell , beyond its iron bars , My scorn of all its pains . ''

		The '' Poems of a Country Gentleman '' are simple and sincere exercises in verse , reflecting the moods
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 of a recluse and a lover of nature .

		The pretty fancy embodied in the lines entitled '' On the Roman Wall '' may serve to illustrate this writer 's quality .

		The flower in question is a corydalis , a native of the
Campagna	PERSON	. ''

		Fair , simply-blowing floweret wild ,
Small	ORGANIZATION	, short-lived star of earth , Then , like some gypsy-stolen child , Art here of alien birth '' -LRB- Here , where the grassy mound I trace ,

		How earnest thou thence ?

		Sick of the time and all its fears , Did some Italian maid .

		Watering thee oft with secret tears , Nurse thee thro ' sun and shade ? ''

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	's '' Admirals All '' has had a marked popular success in
England	LOCATION	, and the reason is not far to seek .

		These lyrics are of sufficiently stirring quality , and sufficiently filled with the pride of En - glish achievements in warfare , to make them highly acceptable to readers of the indiscriminating sort .

		Technically , they are very faulty , but few readers care anything for such a matter when they can get the sort of thing that here follows : `` Splinters were flying above , below ,
When Nelson	PERSON	sailed the Sound : ' Mark you , I would n't be elsewhere now , ' Said he , ' for a thousand pound ! '

		The Admiral 's signal bade him fly , But he wickedly wagged his head : He clapped the glass to his sightless eye , And ` I 'm damned if I see it ! '

		he said . ''

		Admirals all , they said their say -LRB- The echoes are ringing still -RRB- .

		Admirals all , they went their way To the haven under the hill .

		But they left us a kingdom none can take The realm of the circling sea To be ruled by the rightful sons of
Blake	PERSON	, And the Rodneys yet to be . ''

		The Celtic imagination , so rich in color , so pas - sionate in utterance , and so devoid of real intellec - tual content , glows in the ballads and lyrics of Mrs.
Shorter	PERSON	, and lends them at least a transient beauty , although their spell is dissolved by the corrosive touch of analysis .

		The most characteristic of these pieces are the ballads , to which a brief quotation would hardly do justice ; we must , then , perforce select for our example one of the simpler lyrics , and '' Wishes '' will do as well as another for the purpose .

		`` I wish we could live as the flowers live , To breathe and to bloom in the
summer	DATE	and sun : To slumber and sway in the heart of the
night	TIME	, And to die when our glory had done .

		44 I wish we could love as the bees love , To rest or to roam without sorrow or sigh : With laughter , when , after the wooer had won , Love flew with a whispered good-bye .

		44 I wish we could die as the birds die , To fly and to fall when our beauty was best : No trammels of time on the years of our face ; And to leave but an empty nest . ''

		The peculiarly Celtic qualities of Mrs.
Shorter	PERSON	's verse reappear in the collected poems of Miss
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, but touched with a finer art and glowing with a richer passion .

		These are indeed '' Songs from the Hills of Dream , '' and the light that is upon them never shone upon earth 's landscape , save to the spiritual vision .

		No unpurged eye may view '' The Rose of Flame , '' but to the poet it is truer than truth itself . ''

		Oh , fair immaculate rose of the world , rose of my dream , my Rose !

		Beyond the ultimate gates of dream I have heard thy mystical call : It is where the rainbow of hope suspends and the river of rapture flows And cool sweet dews from the wells of peace forever fall . ''

		The thought of a peace '' beyond these voices '' seems to brood over the writer 's imagination , again and again inspiring such a strain as the above , or as is found in these stanzas : '' It lies not on the sunlit hill Nor on the sunlit plain : Nor ever on any running stream Nor on the unclouded main 14 But sometimes , through the Soul of Man , Slow moving o'er his pain , The moonlight of a perfect peace Floods heart and brain . ''

		One or two extracts do scant justice to the rare and exquisite beauty of these songs and lyrical ballads ; one must become steeped in them to get their full effect , and for this nothing less than the volume itself will suffice .

		In Mr.
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	's new volume we have still another example of the Celtic spirit renascent , but the work is in this case tempered by broad intellec - tual culture , and is no less rich in content than in color .

		The noble ode to
Ireland	LOCATION	, which stands in the forefront of the collection , is at once passionate and austere , the utterance of a Celt with a wider than the Celtic outlook .

		One stanza may be given to illustrate the form and spirit of this fine poem . ''

		Proud and sweet habitation of thy dead !

		Throne upon throne ; its thrones of sorrow filled ; Prince on prince coming with triumphant tread , All passion , save the love of
Ireland	LOCATION	, stilled .

		By the forgetful waters they forget Not thee , O Inisfail !

		Upon thy fields their dreaming eyes are set .

		They hear thy winds call ever through each vale .

		Visions of victory exalt and thrill Their hearts ' whole hunger still : High beats their longing for the living Gael . ''

		It is not every Irishman who could write of Crom - well in the spirit of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's poem upon the death of the Protector , from which we take the open - ing and closing stanzas : 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, '' Now , on his last of ways , The great
September	DATE	star , That crowned him on the days Of
Worcester	LOCATION	and
Dunbar	PERSON	, Shines through the menacing night afar . ''

		Nay , peace for ever more !

		O martyred souls !

		He comes , Your conquered conqueror : No tramplings now , nor drums , Are his , who wrought your martyrdoms . ''

		Tragic , triumphant form , He comes to your dim ways , Comes upon wings of storm : Greet him , with pardoning praise , With marvelling awe , with equal gaze ! ''

		Fervent hymns of the faith in
Latin	LOCATION	and English , fragments of liturgical adaptation , poems of persons , memories , and occasions , all imbued with lofty and sincere thought and emotion , are offered by this memorable volume , which fully establishes the au - thor 's position among the best of living English poets .

		There is nothing new in the collective issue of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's '' Poems , '' but lovers of what is best in recent English song will welcome this definitive and corrected edition of a poet who has always written with rare sincerity , and has ever been unwilling to derogate , for the sake of mere popularity , from high and worthy ideals of his art .

		An introductory note explains why a single volume of no great dimensions is ample to contain the poetical product of a quarter of a century . ''

		Small as is this book of mine , it is all in the matter of verse that I have to show for the years between
1872	DATE	and
1897	DATE	.

		A principal reason is that , after spending the better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry , I found myself -LRB- about 1877 -RRB- so utterly unmarketable that I had to own myself beaten in art , and to addict myself to jour - nalism for the next ten years . ''

		There are defeats that are better than victories , of which truth our time has offered no better example than the author of the lines '' I am the master of my fate , I am the captain of my soul . ''

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's utterance is as strongly individual as that of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, for example , but is not affected by the pronounced mannerisms that often make that poet so grotesquely unreadable .

		A striking portrait , from the bust by
Rodin	LOCATION	, provides this welcome vol - ume with a frontispiece . ''

		A Selection from the Poems of
Mathilde Blind	ORGANIZATION	, '' made by the loving hands of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, preserves in one small volume all that is likely to be remembered of the lyric output of that great-hearted woman .

		Poet in a high sense she was not , yet the emotion that throbbed so intensely in her life and is regchoed in these pages can not leave the reader unaffected by its glow .

		Here is a tender song than which nothing lovelier came from her pen and heart : '' Thou walkest with me as the spirit-light Of the hushed moon , high o'er a snowy hill , Walks with the houseless traveller all the
night	TIME	, When trees are tongueless and when mute the rill .

		MOOD of my soul , O phantom of delight , Thou walkest with me still . ''

		The vestal flame of quenchless memory burns In my soul 's sanctuary .

		Yea , still for thee My bitter heart hath yearned , as moonward yearns Each separate wave-pulse of the clamorous sea : My Moon of love , to whom for ever turns The life that aches through me . ''

		Very typical of our transition age are these outpour - ings of a soul that clings passionately to the sub - stance of a faith whose forms and formulae have become outworn .

		The old wine is too precious to be spilled , yet the new bottles for its preserving have not yet come from the mould .

		The mood is one that has not found complete reconcilement with philos - ophy , and which accepts with something less than perfect resignation the ideal of '' Nirvana . ''

		If at one moment it can say , '' Enter thy soul 's vast realm as Sovereign Lord , And , like that angel with the flaming sword , Wave off life 's clinging hands .

		Then chains will fall From the poor slave of self 's hard tyranny And Thou , a ripple rounded by the sea , In rapture lost be lapped within the All , '' at another it is constrained to exclaim , '' But when resurgent from the womb of night
Spring	DATE	's Oriflamme of flowers waves from the sod ; When peak on flashing Alpine peak is trod By sunbeams on their missionary flight ; When heaven-kissed earth laughs , garmented in light ; That is the hour in which I miss my God . ''

		The name of
Tupper	PERSON	has not hitherto been one with which to conjure in English literature , but it now wins a new association through Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	, who has edited the posthumous verse of his old friend
John Lucas Tupper	PERSON	.

		The author of this verse lived from
1826	DATE	to
1879	DATE	, was a sculptor first and a draftsman afterwards , was acquainted with the
P. R. B.	PERSON	, and published several poems in '' The Germ . ''

		These are now reprinted , together with perhaps fifty pieces left in manuscript .

		They at least justify publication , and perhaps more than that .

		They have quaintness , vivid imagination , ro - mantic feeling , and an occasional touch of poignant sincerity .

		The latter quality , at least , appears in the first lines of the poem called '' Aliens . '' ''

		Love , when I meet thee face to face , I feel thou art not of my race ; I know thy language is not mine , Or only so in the hollow sign The lips make .

		Of my world of things Thou hast no care or questionings , Nor I of thine . ''

		What words are said between us twain I strive to recollect , in vain .

		Such merest sound the words we say , Our souls might be in separate spheres That own another night and day ; Thy smile , God knows , may count for tears ! ''

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	finds the salient characteristics of his friend 's verse to be an acute susceptibility to impres - sions , a true lyrical impetus , a certain comic feeling , and a repugnance to some aspects of modernism .

		The slender volume in which these qualities are dis - played is one to be read with pleasure , and to stand in a niche of its own in the temple of minor
Victo	PERSON	- rian verse .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		in explanation heightens our interest in any of the French description of the present French Republic .

		Republic is the nature of the issues at stake during the first twenty years of its history .

		No mere question of tariffs or finance , important as these may be , separated the parties .

		It was the more funda - mental problem of the organization of the powers of the central government .

		This has been the dominant political question since the Empire , for the social and administrative organization which
France	LOCATION	now pos - sesses has been undisturbed by all the minor revo - lutionary shocks .


Baron de Coubertin	PERSON	, the author of `` The Development of
France	LOCATION	under the Third Republic '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , is therefore particularly for - tunate in his subject .

		He is also the first to present in English an adequate treatment of it .

		If he has not been altogether happy in the use of his oppor - tunity , it is not because his book is weakened by erroneous views , but because of his tendency to be - come Delphic the moment he reaches a difficult ques - tion .

		For instance , when he discusses the position of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in relation to the responsibility of ministers , he takes refuge in phraseology so vague that a page of interpretation is needed before the reader , vho goes to the book for instruction , may comprehend what it is all about .

		The volume gains in definiteness as the narrative proceeds .

		When the author reaches the history of the Ferry ministry , his account becomes clear and straightforward .

		Later , nevertheless , in the chapter on the Colonies , the trouble begins again , and he seems to be making passes in the air instead of reaching the heart of the subject .

		We are assured in the Introduction , by no less an authority than Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	, that the author is the Tocqueville of the present day .

		This does not seem to argue a fitting appreciation of either that famous Frenchman 's matter or style .

		Would Tocqueville have ascribed such wonderful powers to the statesmen of the Constituent As - sembly as to assert in the same sentence that these gentlemen '' chopped down '' monarchical institutions and `` gave birth '' to the Constitution of
1791	DATE	?

		Does not
Baron de Coubertin	ORGANIZATION	's sentimentality get the better of his sense of humor when he eulogizes the Republic for giving the French army the Rus - sian army as its '' sister '' ?

		It is a possibility that the translator may be partly responsible for the tone of many similar sentences , especially the one which affirms that the French met the attacks of the Ger - man press `` with every appearance of the most haughty calm . ''

		Baron de Coubertin is a critic fav - orable to the Republic , and evidently believes in its stability .

		His account of the reconciliation of the Church and the Republic is clear and sufficiently detailed , but it is half spoiled by a sermon which he has attached to it on the nature of religion , remark - ing by the way that the French are generally too '' superior '' to feel the need of worship , although '' the Gallic soul is captivated by death , and takes pleas - ure in contemplating , during a joyous life , the dis - quieting and grand perspectives of the world be - yond . ''

		One of the most interesting suggestions in this book is the theory that the Exposition of
1889	DATE	restored confidence in the Republic , and brought
France	LOCATION	safely through the crisis of discontent sym - bolized in the Bonlanger episode . ''

		So it came to pass , '' says the author , '' that , by virtue of having tasted for the space of several months the very great and very noble joy of commanding the attention of the world , the French citizen set to reading over with care the ballot which was slipped into his hand , and when he had read it he flung it aside and took another . ''

		It is to be hoped that the forbidding title of a recen ' work b y M * .


E. p. Evans	PERSON	, `` Evolutional Ethics and
Ani	PERSON	- mal Psychology '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , will not prevent the general reader from turning the pages of the volume sufficiently to convince him that the book is one of great interest , and in style and treatment is ad - dressed to a popular clientele .

		Evolutional ethics is the story of the development of the relation be - tween man and the animal world ; and a very inter - esting story it is .

		The conception of ethical relations as involving the rights of others is at first narrow , and only gradually broadens with the broadening influences of civilization .

		At first the tribe marks the horizon of ethical duties , and members of other tribes are enemies without rights or fellowship .

		Patriotism substitutes a wider field of ethical ac - tivity , and the recognition of a common humanity emphasizes and modifies the rights of all men .

		Sur - vivals of the outgrown traits are , however , not diffi - cult to find .

		The English boor who is ever ready to '' ` eave ` arf a brick '' at a stranger , as well as the innkeeper of whatever nationality who regards it as proper to impose upon the stranger within his gates , are not isolated instances .

		The enlargement of altruistic tendencies gradually encompasses the ani - mal world , until to-day statutes and customs , socie - ties for the protection of animals , and hospitals for the care of the decrepit , are regarded as the natural provisions of an enlightened community .

		It is not , however , so much the ethical as the anthropological interest which sustains the attractiveness of this story .

		The shifting of theory and attitude accord - ing to the conception of animal nature that was dominant at different times unfolds a suggestive panorama .

		The overweening conceit of man that made him regard his world as the centre of the uni - verse , and the spot where he dwells as the middle of the earth , makes him look upon all the animal crea - tion as serving his uses .

		Hence the degradation of animals and the exaltation of man .

		The primitive doctrine of metempsychosis , however , acts just the other way .

		Souls migrate , and human souls may pass into animal bodies , and vice versa .

		Hence , animals are to be revered , protected , and held sacred .

		In the orient , this doctrine has been very influential and has dictated a humane treatment of the dumb creation .

		But the final step in the recognition of 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, animal rights is the scientific one .

		Evolution has shown that men and animals have much in common , and the recognition of this community inevitably re - sults in humane treatment .

		Not only in bodily struc - ture , but in mental endowment are animals akin to men ; and thus the study of animal psychology gives rise to evolutional ethics .

		Such is the interesting story attractively told in this volume .

		For the ani - mal psychology , less commendation can be offered .

		The stories of sagacious doings of animals are val - uable only when carefully analyzed and critically interpreted .

		The present collection evidences the author 's high opinion of the minds of animals , but it carries little proof to others .

		There is too much reading in of human motives and ways of thinking into animal doings .

		As a contribution to psychology , the volume is weak ; as a contribution to the an - thropological history of the relation of man to beast , it is alike valuable and readable .

		`` Unforseen Tendencies of Democ - Modern democracy -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- IS the Collective and its tendencies .

		, % ** , < !

		/ title of a sheaf of thoughtful and well - timed essays on topics of current public interest by Mr.
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	, the accomplished editor of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		With the author 's journalistic writings most of our readers are doubt - less familiar .

		In the present volume the opportu - nity is given of contrasting Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	the caustic and somewhat dogmatical editorial writer who draws his customary inspiration from such rasping themes as
Platt	PERSON	and Tammany and the Jingoes and the '' good Americans , '' with Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	the publicist who surveys the phenomena of democracy with the serene and philosophical eye of a Lecky or a Tocque - ville .

		So far as we have discovered in these essays , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	does not once lose his temper therein or yield to his alleged besetting propensity to scold .

		He shows that in his more philosophical moods he can view with a lenient and even an indulgent eye the ways peculiar to his adopted fellow countrymen .

		More than once he is on the verge of praising us , of discerning a clear roseate streak of hope on the horizon of our national future .

		In fine , while the con - stant reader of Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's editorials might be led to infer therefrom that in the author 's opinion this country is on the whole in a pretty bad way , such is not the impression to be gained from the clear and scholarly little volume before us .

		It bids us hope and now we shall all doubtless proceed to do so .

		Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's aim in the present volume is not to describe democracy '' something which , '' he says , with characteristic modesty , '' has been done by abler hands than mine '' but to point out '' some of the departures it has made from the ways which its earlier promoters expected it to follow . ''

		As he points out , democracy has pretty generally done pre - cisely the unexpected and the unpredicted thing .

		It has not , it is especially encouraging to note , shown that inability to correct its mistakes which recent writers have assumed .

		It is not very teachable by philosophers and jurists , and most of its legislation has hitherto been '' mere groping '' ; but '' experience is a master from whose chastening rod none can escape . ''

		To suppose , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	concludes , de - mocracy '' will not learn through mishaps and mis - carriages would be to despair of the human race , for it is from suffering or failure that we have got most of the good things in civilization .

		The great , perhaps the only , mistake optimists appear to make is , as I have said , the mistake of thinking there are short cuts to political happiness . ''

		Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's style is terse and clear , and the papers in this col - lection treating such subjects as '' Equality , '' '' The Nominating System , '' `` The Decline of Legisla - tures , '' '' Peculiarities of American Municipal Gov - ernment , '' etc. show both philosophic breadth and close special knowledge .

		The careful analyses of critical ^ thought and the off-hand decisions of popular judgment frequently lead to opposite results .

		The sun appears to rotate about the earth ; but it can be proved that the reverse is true .

		Thus , '' things are not what they seem , '' and this fact , in some of its tendencies and relations , is the burden of metaphysics .

		Especially is this true of the ultimate justification and explanation of the relations between subject and object , which is the service that metaphysics is called upon to perform for psychology .

		Professor
Alfred H. Lloyd	PERSON	has given this problem a suggestive and timely setting in a volume which he entitles '' Dynamic Idealism , '' an elementary course in the metaphysics of psychol - ogy -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The dominant tone of the thesis is that ideas are not forms but forces ; that active relations , not classified elements , make up the con - tent of things in their various relations to one an - other and to man .

		The development of this concep - tion can not readily be outlined ; interested readers , who are prepared to follow with effort a detailed argument , may be referred to the original .

		Such readers , however , are not many ; and in spite of the ability in thought and diction which Dr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's essay abundantly manifests , it in some measure evi - dences the defects which have repelled a goodly por - tion of possible readers of this field of literature .

		These defects produce the feeling that the wiping out of distinctions in which metaphysics so fre - quently indulges is neither profitable nor logical .

		The metaphysicians seem to take pleasure in remov - ing the wax with which the practical etcher has covered his plate , so that when the whole is exposed to the acid of critical analysis the lines are over - bitten , and light and shade , even the outlines them - selves , are lost in a general confusion of black and white .

		And again , these defects produce the feeling that metaphysics is not as closely related to science and knowledge as it pretends to be .

		It is so easy to prove that things ought or must be so , after you know that they are so .

		This false air of leadership repels .

		It is much as though the dog were to imagine that he is leading his master because he constantly runs on just a little ahead ; but the wise dog looks back for indi -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 cations of the master 's proposed route .

		Here , again , it is possible that things are not what they seem .

		It will not do for science to disparage metaphysics , nor for metaphysics to disparage science .

		Each has a message for the other ; but it is extremely diffi - cult to induce them to speak in the same language .

		After masterly expositions by such Growth of the m Professor
Seeley	PERSON	, Captain British Empire .

		J rt i
Mahan	PERSON	, and Professor
Goldwm Smith	PERSON	, it is disappointing to find the same great sub - ject , '' The Growth of the British Empire , '' given an inadequate and unscholarly treatment , in a volume by Mr.
A. T. Story	PERSON	, in the '' Stories of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The writer has set about his task conscientiously , yet his narrative rarely rises above a commonplace setting forth of a tale already known .

		His work deserves this praise , however , that it brings into juxtaposition events which Americans , at least , do not often think of as closely related to their own colonial history .

		The author professes to have gone to the best sources , but the books he quotes in the footnotes suggest that he has little idea of what the sources are .

		His most frequent reference on the early colonial period in
New England	LOCATION	is ''
Robert	PERSON	- son 's
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Now ,
Robertson	PERSON	was a great his - torian ; but researches into the history of New En - gland did not close with the publication of his book in
1777	DATE	.

		The same fault appears even more strik - ingly in the chapters on
India	LOCATION	, especially in the pages on
Dupleix	LOCATION	.

		The author is apparently una - ware that the old calumnies against
Dupleix	ORGANIZATION	, based on incidents connected with the surrender of
Madras	LOCATION	, have been silenced by later English historians , not - ably by Colonel
Malleson	PERSON	; and that
Labourdonnais	PERSON	, the rival of the French governor , praised by the older school of English writers as the pattern of chivalry , was probably less moved by honor in his stubborn efforts to thwart Dupleix than by the 40,000 which he was to receive in case the settle - ment was put to ransom .

		It is not difficult to dis - cover where the author got his knowledge of the subject .

		Comparing his pages with those of Mill , it is apparent that he has followed Mill sentence by sentence with patient fidelity , sometimes taking over a sentence bodily with the mere change of a word or two .

		But he has improved on Mill in his char - acterizations of the Frenchman 's duplicity , perhaps prompted by
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's severer language , which , in turn , was derived from
Orme	PERSON	, a contemporary of
Dupleix	LOCATION	, who for patent reasons failed to under - stand him .

		These instances will serve as illustrations of the manner in which this work has been done .

		Mr - Ed g ar
Stanton Maclay	PERSON	, whose creditable '' History of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' we reviewed at length some three or four years ago , has compiled a read - able volume of '' Reminiscences of the Old Navy '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , from the journals and private papers of Captain
Edward Trenchard	PERSON	and Rear - Admiral
Stephen Decatur Trenchard	PERSON	.

		service in our navy , and are naturally replete with episodes and exploits not unworthy of commemora - tion , that have escaped the attention of the formal historian .

		Notably interesting are the journal and notes of a cruise for the suppression of the slave - trade on the African coast , left by the elder Trench - ard ; while the copious journals kept by his son when on service in the
China	LOCATION	sea , and during his remark - able career as commander of the
United States	LOCATION	cruiser ''
Rhode Island	LOCATION	'' throughout the Civil War , are well strewn with stirring episodes heretofore unrecorded .

		Among these latter may be mentioned , as especially worthy of notice , the chase and cap - ture of a Confederate vessel by the ''
Jamestown	LOCATION	, '' the capture of the British ship ''
Richard O'Brien	PERSON	, '' the adventure of a boat 's crew from the ''
Rhode Island	LOCATION	'' after the sinking of the '' Monitor , '' the cap - ture of the Confederate vessels ''
Venus	PERSON	, '' '' Vixen , '' and '' Cronstadt , '' the several chases after the sup - posed ''
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' and the active participation in the assaults on
Fort Fisher	LOCATION	.

		Decidedly interesting , too , is the elder
Trenchard	ORGANIZATION	's story of the battle of the Peiho Forts the occasion of Tattnal 's famous sentiment , '' Blood is thicker than water . ''

		The chief value of the book lies , as Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	observes , in the fact that it is part and parcel of the inside his - tory of our navy during the period covered .

		The volume is neatly made , and the edition is limited to 750 copies .

		Having depicted , in the opening vol - ume of his 8erie8 of 8tadies * '' The Second French Empire , '' the early exiles , mishaps , illusions , and chagrins of the Pris - oner of Ham ,

		Prominent in these pages are the Crimean War , the Great Exposition of

France	LOCATION	, and at the close of the book , the birth of the ill-starred Prince Imperial .

		One of the prettiest specimens of ornate yet chaste and tasteful book - making that has lately fallen in our way is Mrs.
Anne Hollingsworth Wharton	PERSON	's '' Heir - looms in Miniature '' -LRB-

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's idea was a particularly happy and timely one , and it has been irreproachably carried out .

		Her original plan was merely to gather together some interesting and representative American miniatures , and to ac - company each of these with some brief account of the person represented .

		As her task progressed , how - ever , so many fresh and interesting facts as to the painters and their sitters came to light in the course of her correspondence with the possessors of the 332 THE DIAL -LSB-

		original likenesses that her book grew insensibly under her hand considerably beyond its projected scope and compass .

		In fine , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	has given us , instead of a sort of mere pictorial catalogue rai - sonn & , an entertaining and richly illustrated work , brimful of interesting biographical fact and anecdote , on American miniature painting .

		Brief accounts are given of the leading artists and their more note - worthy patrons ; and Mrs.
J. Madison Taylor	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, has added a chapter on Miniature Painting as an art .

		There are some ninety illustra - tions , including the dainty tinted frontispiece por - trait , after
Malbone	PERSON	, of Mrs.
Alexander Bleecker	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		In view of the current interest in old miniatures and of the promised revival of the useful and beautiful art of miniature painting , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's book is well-timed and will doubtless find the favor it deserves .

		The second year of this work is represented by the an - nual volume for
1897	DATE	, indexing the contents of one hundred well-chosen periodicals .

		It is a volume of 635 double-columned pages , which is nearly twice the number contained in the volume for
1896	DATE	.

		As compared with ''

		Indeed , a ''

		Mr.
Brett	PERSON	gives us entries under both authors and subjects , references to reviews of books in great number , titles of individual poems , and even references to portraits .

		Dates of birth and death are also given with author , and biograph - ical subject references .

		We hope that the public will provide this work with sufficient support to insure its continuance , for its usefulness can hardly be overestimated , and the cost of its preparation must be considerable .

		Hereafter the bi-monthly instalments of the '' Index '' will be cumulative for a period of six months , after which a second series for the year will begin , but we understand that the two will be combined , as at present , in the annual volume .

		Further - more , if we may not make practical use of it just now , we may with great satisfaction add it to the library as a reference-work of the most useful sort .

		It is a volume of over six hundred pages , including
Portugal	LOCATION	within its scope , but not , for some inex - plicable reason , the
Balearic Islands	LOCATION	.

		A
Baedeker Egypt	LOCATION	is also among the publications of this
spring	DATE	, although the work in this case is not strictly a new one , being rather the compression into a single vol - ume of the '' Lower Egypt '' and '' Upper
Egypt	LOCATION	'' hitherto known to travellers in the
East	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons import these guide-books for the American market .

		At the same time , we may acknowledge the receipt of our old acquaint - ance , '' The Complete Pocket - Guide to
Europe	LOCATION	, '' in its latest annual revision .

		This marvel of compact - ness is now published by Mr.
W. R. Jenkins	PERSON	, and bears upon its title-page the names of Mr.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	, who first planned the volume , and Dr.
Thomas L. Stedman	PERSON	, who yearly brings it up to date .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		The Statesman 's Year Book '' has just made its ap - pearance for
1898	DATE	, still edited by Mr.
J. Scott Keltie	PERSON	, this time with the assistance of Mr.
J. P. A. Renwick	PERSON	, and published , as heretofore , by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The special new features of this issue are a revision of the navies of the world , a series of diagrams showing the course of trade in the leading countries for twenty - five years , and a map of
West Africa	LOCATION	illustrating the disputed question of the
Niger	LOCATION	.

		Words in praise of this publication would be wasted , as every well-informed person knows it to be one of the few reference manuals that are absolutely indispensable .

		Volume
VIII	PERSON	.

		of the ''
Harvard Studies	ORGANIZATION	in Classical Philology '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- includes the following monographs : '' The Trial of the
Alcmeonidse	PERSON	and the Cleisthenean Constitutional Reforms , '' by Mr.
G. W. Botsford	PERSON	; The Saliva Superstition in Classical Literature , '' by Mr.
F. W. Nicolson	PERSON	; '' Greek Grave-Reliefs , '' by Mr.
Richard Norton	PERSON	; and `` The Origin of Roman Prsenominse , '' by Mr.
George D. Chase	PERSON	.

		No .

		VI .

		of the ''
Cornell Studies	ORGANIZATION	in Classical Philology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is devoted to a single monograph , being '' Studies in
Latin Moods	LOCATION	and Tenses , '' by Mr.
Herbert Charles Elmer	PERSON	.

		Mr.
James Hamilton Wylie	PERSON	's `` History of
England	LOCATION	under Henry the Fourth '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is now made complete by the publication of the fourth volume .

		It has been the work of twenty-five years of industrious application , and deals with its period as thoroughly and as minutely as the period of the
Long Parliament	LOCATION	is dealt with by Dr.
Gardiner	PERSON	.

		The present volume covers the last two years -LRB- 1411-1413 -RRB- of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's reign , and only about one - fourth of the contents are needed to com - plete the narrative proper .

		The remaining contents are a series of thirty appendices , a glossary of obsolete words , and a comprehensive analytical index , extending to two hundred pages , to the entire work . ''

		School Reading by Grades '' is a series of eight num - bers , compiled by Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	, and published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selections are scrappy , as a matter of course , but as school readers go , this series exhibits good judgment and literary taste .

		From the same publishers we have '' The Story of ^ neas , '' by Mr.
M. Clarke	PERSON	, in the '' Eclectic School Readings , '' and Mr.
S. W. Baird	PERSON	's Graded Work in Arithmetic , '' in four parts .

		They also send us an `` Applied Physiol - ogy , '' by Dr.
Frank Overtoil	PERSON	, with the chapters on ''
Nar	ORGANIZATION	- cotics '' that are nowadays incorporated in books of this sort , in deference to unwise legislation and an exagger - ated phase of popular sentiment .

Gibbon	PERSON	's '' De - cline and Fall '' is being somewhat deliberately carried on to its conclusion .

		Volumes IV .

		and V. have just appeared , leaving but two more to complete the work .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Mr.
W. J. Stillman	PERSON	has resigned as correspondent in

London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' and will take up his resi - dence in
England	LOCATION	.

		He is said to be engaged upon a history of
Italy	LOCATION	from
1812	DATE	to the present day , as well as several other books .

		Still another old English comedy has been enacted by college students .

		This time it is
Dekker	PERSON	's '' Shoe - maker 's Holiday , '' and the performance was arranged by one of the secret societies of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The play was given twice in

1894	DATE	.

		The original work has , however , been considerably augmented . ''

		Little Dorrit , '' ''
Bleak House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and ''
Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	, '' each in two volumes , are now ready in the '' Gadshill '' edition of
Dickens	PERSON	's works , imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The same publishers have added '' The Bride of Lammermoor '' to their '' Temple '' edition of the Waverley novels , issued in connection with
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		A new translation of Renan 's '' The Apostles , '' by the late
Joseph Henry Allen	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Life of Jesus , '' and '' Antichrist '' have previously been set to the credit of this singularly com - petent translator , and it is to be hoped that his death will not interrupt the work of providing the English public with a complete version of the seven volumes of Renan 's `` Origines .

		The
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	says : '' Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	sketches his character !

		with a firm hand , and knows how to breathe into them the breath of life ... The author has not only a brilliant touch and a keen insight , but a wide range of sympathy and an exquisite tenderness . ''

		Time and the Hour says : '' Surely in these brief intimate chapters Mr.
Le Gallienue	PERSON	has made something like a very small masterpiece .

		Such writing has a flavor and grace of its own that should make it memorable with the few , while its plain sincerity , its rare kindliness and sympathy , must endear it to many . ''

		The
City Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- says : '' ' The Romance of
Zion Chapel	ORGANIZATION	' is a novel of rare literary finish and impressive power .

		It is the novel of a poet who can write prose of rare distinction ; of an epigrammatist who can flash wit and wisdom in a bewildering profusion of pregnant phrases ; of a psychologist who can present objectively his keen , interpenetrative analysis of human motives and human character ; of a painter who can project his portraits in relief against a background of hazy chiaroscuro . ''

		This new book by Mr.
Le Galltenne	PERSON	is uniform with '' The Quest of the Golden Girl , '' which is now in its tenth edition .

		It is therefore with the greatest possible pleasure that we notice the delightful little collection of ballads which Mr.

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	has done a notable thing .

		He has managed to write ballads full of ring and go , and full also of patriotic feeling , without imitating Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	... ` Admirals All ` is practically Mr.

		The new romance relates the history of the year for which Pascalet was absent , and of some years more .

Adeline	PERSON	as an `` aristocrat , '' thus furnishing a point of view of the Revolution which is the opposite of that presented in '' The Reds of the Midi . ''

		The central motif of the romance , developed with singular sympathy by the author , is the picture of a young girl 's feelings when thrown into the vortex of the French Revolution .

		The action passes for a time in

		The interior of the gloomy fortress of

London	LOCATION	, furnish the background for swiftly moving scenes which are tense with suspended interest , with the power of love , and with the stress of peril .

		Although a story of the present day , the pulse of adventure and romance throbs as strongly in these pages as in a mediaeval tale .

		A Story .

		By
GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	, author of `` Esther Wa - ters , '' etc. 12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's comparative silence for the last few years has been due to his preoccupation with his most serious and important work which is now given to the public .

		This novel is a masterly analysis of a conflict between art and the world on one side and religion upon the other .

		The theme is developed with a penetrating insight into motives , a grasp of character , and a mastery of literary technique which make `` Evelyn I lines '' a notable book .

		The action of the novel passes in large part in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It is a story of the present day , characterized by a vivid perception of the doubts and complex conditions of modern life .

		The musical motif which has so large a part in the development of the story is interwoven with others which in their unfolding show a rare subtlety and power of expression .

		Mr.

		He takes a hunting party to the Canadian woods in his opening chapter , and gives a series of vivid pictures of actual field work .

		This is followed by a series of careful explanations of the proper treatment of animals , large and small , of birds , and heads .

		The many lovers of outdoor sport who are interested as amateurs in the various phases of taxidermy will find their requirements fully met , while to professional taxidermists this impor - tant and comprehensive work will be indispensable .

WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not often that the closing days of a great career compel the grief and sympathy of the whole civilized world .

		There are so many great men in so many departments of human activity , while the interests of observers are so special - ized and varied , that one must occupy an extra - ordinarily commanding position to exact from all classes the tribute of attention , even under circumstances that make unusual demands upon the sympathies .

		That something like this tri - umph was achieved by Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	is evi - dent from the widespread eagerness with which the course of his fatal disease , and the pathetic sufferings attendant upon it , have been followed by all kinds of readers , and the abundance of eulogy that has been set free by the news of his final release .

		The last remaining member of the remarkable group of men fortuitously asso - ciated by the year of their common birth , his popular renown was perhaps greater than that of any of the others , although it may hardly be doubted that the verdict of '' them who know , '' as registered by the posterity of the twentieth century , will assign to Lincoln a higher place in the making of history , to
Tennyson	LOCATION	and Dar - win higher places in the development of thought .

		But just now we are so impressed with the tow - ering personality of the English statesman , and feel so keenly the loss of his leadership , that the critical sense becomes deadened , and the temptation is well-nigh irresistible to join in the journalistic chorus of praise in which his life - work is now being reviewed .

		To the critic determined upon unrelieved eulogy there is , indeed , in the career of Glad - stone material enough to inspire the most slug - gish to panegyric , achievement to the credit of the man himself and to humanity at large suf - ficient to give pause to the voice of detraction and permit the laurel-wreath of fame to rest unquestioned upon his brow .

		The memory of his eloquence , the devotion inspired by his lead - ership , his splendid humanitarian endeavor in behalf of oppressed peoples , his unexampled mastery of financial and other administrative problems , his instinct for righteousness in both public and private life , his unswerving devotion to the ideals which seemed to him worthy , how - 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, ever mistaken some of them may have been , his almost complete exemption from the human failings that so often add a touch of pettiness to the lives of the most exalted , all these things offer the strongest possible temptation to deal with his memory in the spirit of the old adage that bids us speak nothing but good con - cerning the dead .

		In this case , at least , there is no danger of providing a new illustration of the Shakespearian lines , `` The evil that men do lives after them , The good is oft interred with their bones . ''

		The danger is rather that eulogy will become so indiscriminate as to make claims for Glad - stone that can not possibly be justified , that his intellectual defects will be for the time forgot - ten in the generous glow of feeling with which his career is commemorated .

		The public life of
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	will receive its final appraisement from the impartial historian far on in the coming century .

		It is safe to say that this appraisement will be far removed from the laudatory extreme of the present day when the sense of his loss is fresh in our hearts , and from the extreme of dispraise which his famous volte-face of
1886	DATE	then evoked from most of the men among his contemporaries where opinions had real weight .

		That his plan for the settlement of the Irish agitation would , if successfully carried out , have sown the seeds of disintegration in the Constitution of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, we firmly believe ; but the violence with which he was assailed for his advocacy of that plan , and the passionate way in which his motives were then impugned , did little credit to his opponents , and afforded a melancholy illustration of the extremes to which the partisan spirit may pervert the judgment .

		The degree and quality of
Gladstone	LOCATION	's states - manship remain yet to be weighed in the impar - tial scales of dispassionate criticism ; and this it is no more possible to do at the present time than it would have been
ten years ago	DATE	, for the balance which would then have tipped far too much on the one side would just now incline far too much upon the other .

		Meanwhile , we may express the opinion that the estimate made by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	not long before his death , and published in one of the monthly reviews , will in the end prove to have come as near as any contemporary estimate to the judgment of posterity .

		It has been too much the fashion to speak slightingly of
Arnold	LOCATION	's judgment in extra-literary matters , but his memory will in time come to its own in this regard , and it will be understood upon how many matters of polit - ical and religious significance he held the scales of even-handed justice .

		The twentieth century will not find it alto - gether easy to account for
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's hold upon the nineteenth century .

		It will have to accept the fact as unquestionable , but the ex - planation will prove puzzling .

		He will be remembered as a Great Commoner , somewhat as the elder
Pitt	PERSON	is now remembered , and men will turn to his speeches to penetrate the secret of his power .

		But in those speeches they will find little to remind them of the eloquence with which
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	appeals to us even now from the printed page .

		They will find , rather , a diffuse and common style , often weighty in matter , but without wings to soar .

		The irony of the familiar phrase , litera scripta manet , will be deeply felt when these dull periods are contrasted with the tradition of their framer 's eloquence .

		For
Gladstone	PERSON	was , beyond doubt , one of the most eloquent speakers who have ever moved legis - latures .

		But to the student of a hundred years from now , while the written word will indeed remain for his examination , the moral fervor that made the word vital when spoken will have been long since chilled , and the personality that made the word impressive will have become but a dim memory .

		How marked is the contrast between the case of
Gladstone	PERSON	and the case of
Burke	PERSON	.

		The ineffectual oratory of the eight - eenth-century statesman had no charm for the sense , but the speeches that he delivered to empty benches have taken their place for all time in the literature of the world .

		Delivered to inattentive ears , the depth of their political wisdom and the gorgeous embroidery of their style have made them an inexhaustible source of inspiration to all succeeding generations .

		The speeches of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, on the other hand , for half a century compelled the attention of crowds of eager listeners , but their power to sway died with the breath that gave them life , and the statesman of the future will turn to them neither for guidance nor for inspiration .

		What is true of
Gladstone	LOCATION	's speeches con - sidered as literary productions is also true of the great mass of other printed material fur - nished forth by his busy pen .

		It is with regard to this phase of his activity more than any other that the day-laborers of the press , as
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer calls journalists , have shown a total lack of critical discrimination .

		They have simply taken for granted that so great a man must be great in whatever he undertakes , and have en - tertained and spread abroad honestly enough , no doubt the notion that
Gladstone	PERSON	was a
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 345 distinguished writer and a profound thinker .

		Nothing could be farther removed from the truth than this opinion .

		One may search his voluminous writings in vain for anything like high distinction in expression , while scholars in most of the special fields into which he some - times made excursions have almost always re - fused to take him seriously .

		When they were occasionally persuaded so to take him , as in the case of his famous controversy with
Huxley	PERSON	, the result was much to his discomfiture .

		He was hardly more fortunate in his Homeric studies than in his championship of an old - fashioned theology against natural science and the higher criticism .

		He possessed a vast store of minute information upon historical and ec - clesiastical subjects , but even the great length of his years did not bring the philosophic mind in the best sense , and he always displayed an extraordinary instinct for the exploration of '' blind leads '' in theological and humanistic discussion .

		These diversions of his literary activity , as distinguished from his really solid work in the fields of financial , administrative , and political science , are for the most part hopelessly futile ; they have produced no more than a few ripples in the current of serious thought , and they have no antiseptic of style to protect them from decay .

		A man who wrote so much as
Gladstone	PERSON	, yet in his writing could never attain to any higher literary qualities than a certain sincerity of pur - pose and quiet dignity , whose manner was ha - bitually diffuse and frequently commonplace , could hardly be expected to display a delicate critical sense in dealing with literature in gen - eral .

		Omnivorous reader that he was , it was evidently the matter of books that he prized rather than the form of its expression .

		One never knew what kind of a new book would receive his approval , and be launched upon the sea of an ephemeral fame by one of his famous post-cards .

		He never outgrew the didactic ideal of literature , and the didacticism of a book , in order to win his favor , must conform pretty closely to a rather narrow set of traditional lines .

		Poetry , to be really great , must have fairly definite religious implications , and the norm of these implications must not depart very far from the standards of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		His interest in the Homeric epic , for example , derived much of its strength from fancied anal - ogies between the Hellenic and Hebraic ideals , and he displayed all his ingenuity in seeking to establish such a synthesis .

		A typical pas - sage from one of his essays speaks of `` the solid and consistent wisdom which can feel no other firm foundation in the heart of man than the
Gospel Revelation	ORGANIZATION	, without which , even while we feel the poet to be an enchanter , we can not accept and trust him as a guide ; and of which
Wordsworth	PERSON	is an example unequaled probably in our age and unsurpassed in any age preceding ours . ''

		Gladstone 's essential attitude toward literature is expressed , and its limitations clearly emphasized , in the words above quoted , and in the elaboration of their thought which follows . ''

		The highest functions of the human being stand in such intimate relations to one another that the patent want of any one of them will commonly prevent the attainment of perfection in any other .

		The sense of beauty enters into the highest philosophy , as in
Plato	LOCATION	.

		The highest poet most be a philosopher , accomplished like
Dante	PERSON	, or intuitive like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		But neither the one nor the other can now exist in separation from that conception of the relations between God and man , that new standard and pattern of humanity , which
Chris	PERSON	- tianity has supplied .

		It is true , indeed , that much of what it has indelibly impressed upon the imagination and understanding , the heart and life of man , may be traceable and even prominent in those who individually disown it .

		The splendor of these disappropriate gifts in particular cases may be among the very greatest of the signs and wonders appointed for the trial of faith .

		Yet there is always something in them to show that they have with them no source of positive permanent vitality ; that the branch has been torn from the tree , and that its life is on the wane . ''

London	LOCATION	,
May IS , 1898	DATE	.

		All our plans and schemes are '' gang agley . ''

		We have no time for publishing books ; and if we had , we should find nobody willing to buy them .

		Your '' little affair '' with
Spain	LOCATION	has set everything topsy-turvy .

		Our newspapers are now having their innings .

		All that we could do was to meet at a big restaurant and have a dinner .

		There we seemed to cheer up a bit ; but Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, the Chairman , did not give us much chance to lay any unction to our souls .

		He thought things looked bad for book publishers and booksellers , and the only way ont , so far as his inexperienced mind could suggest , was by way of publishing books cheaper .

		Well , we all knew that .

		It was not news , and it did n't help us much to digest the dinner .

		But a good deal has been written and talked since the speech was given .

		What it will end in must be left to the imagination .

		I have lately been told of several instances of authors of the third and fourth class who vent their spleen on the publishers who refuse their manuscripts , by writing letters in reply to the refusal note , of a most insulting character .

		Fortunately for these authors , the letters they write are private , and the publisher has perforce to throw them into the waste-paper basket with an amused smile .

		But it occurs to me that a
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, such as we have in this country , ought to have such letters placed before it , and the writers of them noted for future reference .

		Only to-day I saw a 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, letter from a lady novelist to a publisher , which , had it been printed , would have placed that lady in a very uncomfortable position .

		It was written in the most insulting tone , and wound up with a threat that she would hold the publisher up to the obloquy of all her friends .

		Commend me to the disappointed lady novelist for politeness , and the amenities of a well-bred society .

		The new edition of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's novels , about which I wrote to you a few weeks ago , is now definitely an - nounced , in prospectus form , as '' The Winchester Edi - tion , '' to consist of ten volumes of large crown octavo size .

		The first two , containing '' Sense and Sensibility , '' will be issued on
June 8	DATE	, and will be succeeded by the remaining stories , in chronological order , two volumes each month . ''

		Lady Susan '' and '' The Watsons , '' says the prospectus , '' will not find a place in the Winchester edition , for neither , the publisher takes leave to imagine , would have been included in such an edition by the au - thoress herself . ''

		I have little doubt that this series of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's novels will be accepted by all lovers of good and beautiful books , as the final edition .

		A special advantage lies in the fact that readers may buy the novels separately ; and the price of five shillings a vol - ume is low enough to tempt almost everybody .

		The late
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	's books seem , in their first editions , to be bringing record prices at the auction rooms .

		The other day , a copy of The Garland of Rachel '' sold for 12 10s .

		!

		But there happens to be something spe - cial about this volume , which entitles it to a biblio - grapher 's respect .

		The Rev.
H. Daniel	PERSON	, Fellow and
Bursar of Worcester College	ORGANIZATION	, has a private printing - press of his own , and this copy of
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	's book is one of the earliest productions of that press .

		Moreover , it is one of but thirty-two copies printed ; and a curious point to note is that among these thirty-two copies there are eighteen different title-pages .

		In
1881	DATE	, when the volume was printed , it sold for four guineas .

		The Rev.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	has long been engaged on a study of the works of
Robert Browning	PERSON	, similar to his work on
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	.

		The substance of the
Tennyson	PERSON	volume , and the groundwork of the
Browning	PERSON	book , were both delivered as lectures at
Bedford Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, during Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's ministry there .

		The
Browning	PERSON	volume is so far proceeded with that the publishers ex - pect to be able to issue it next
October	DATE	.

		Our new weekly is , I hear , to be called '' The
Satur	PERSON	- day Chronicle , '' and will have an influential contributor is the person of the Rt. .

		Hon.
James Bryce	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	.

		What it intends to do exactly , I pannot say ; but , no doubt , its promoters believe that there is room for another , where '' The Spectator '' has succeeded so well .

		Two books which are to be published next month will deserve your careful consideration .

		One is '' True Heart , '' by
F. Breton	PERSON	; and the other is a novel of West Indian life by
Haldam McFall	PERSON	, the son of Mrs.
Sarah Grand	PERSON	.

		Both books will be issued here by Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	; but I believe one of your publishers has ar - ranged for their appearance on your side of the water .

		Mr.
Eden Phillpott	PERSON	's Children of the Mist '' is passing through the press , as is also a new story by Mr.
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	to be called `` Father Anthony . ''

		A story which I understand Mr.
David Christie Murray	PERSON	consid - ers to be the best he has so far written , is to be pub - lished here by Mr.
C. A. Pearson	PERSON	.

		Its title is to be '' Despair 's Last Journey . ''

		The `` Kailyard '' books are waning in popularity .

		Where once they sold in their tens of thousands , they now , so I hear , sell in tens of hundreds .

		Well , they had a good time while it lasted .

		Whether or no their authors have enough left in them to make a second '' boom '' remains to be seen .

		Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's '' Romance of Zion Chapel '' has been what one might call a literary success .

		The story has been rather well received by the critics .

		The trouble is that the reading world are not bothering their heads about it much here .

		I am sorry for this , because the book deserves strong consideration from the guardians of the Nonconformist conscience .

		It must be that these people do n't read much , after all , unless it be detective stories and divorce cases .

		Carlyle 's '' Sartor Resartus '' is to have an illustrator in the person of Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	, the English artist .

		The volume is to be one of the first books of the coming season , and ought to be quite an interesting item .

		I am asked by
Messrs. Duckworth & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to make a small correction .

		In one of my previous letters , I an - nounced that these publishers were about to issue a new edition of
Butler	PERSON	's '' Lives of the Saints . ''

		This is not so .

		The series of books which they will issue is to bear the general title , '' The Saints , '' and to consist of an entirely new set of '' Lives . ''

		The general editor is
M. Henri Joly	PERSON	, and the English translations are to be revised by the
Rev. Father Tyrrell	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes already arranged for are '' The Psychology of the Saints , '' by
Henri Joly	PERSON	;
S. Augustine	PERSON	, '' by Ad .

		Hatzfeld ;
S. Clotilda	PERSON	, '' by
Godefrey Kurth	PERSON	; ``
S. Vincent de Paul	PERSON	, '' by
Prince Emmanuel de Broglie	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a noticeable absence of the '' fad '' in our social and literary life .

		I can not report any single new '' fad '' or '' mode . ''

		All these are apparently '' off '' for the present .

		We are taking things less seriously than we were wont to do .

		Even ourselves , we are beginning to look upon as being slightly humbugs .

		It would seem that '' fads '' never appear when the spirit of true humor is abroad .

		Not that we have precipitated anything great in humor lately ; but we are enjoying ourselves a little more heartily , and amusing one another with theories about wars and politics and ministries and the rest .

		I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing like an international imbroglio to stir the world up to a bit of genuine fun .

		At the same time , I must confess the young decadents and the rest were fun enough in their way , but one saw it in the funny way only when the young gentlemen gave us a chance , which was not often , they were so persistently serious in their poses .

		The time Slipped back through thirty centuries dim with rime , And mist that veils the dawn of human things , Until we felt the awe the great past brings To us who dwell in this unstoried clime .

		And then he paused and turned ; the night was torn With flying clouds , but once there gleamed a star ; And he : ' '' Lo , that dim light saw

		THE DIAL 347 Btfo A COTTXTRYMAX OF HAMLET UPON SHAKESPEARE .

		* There is something impressive in the circum - stance that now , three hundred years after the first appearance of '' The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of
Denmark	LOCATION	, '' a work of more than eight hundred pages upon Shakespeare by a Danish critic should be translated into the En - glish language . ''

		Hamlet , '' says Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, '' has given the name of
Denmark	LOCATION	a world-wide renown . '' ''

		Denmark , '' he continues , '' has produced several men of note
Tycho Brahe	PERSON	, Thorvaldsen , and
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	, but none of them has attained a hundredth part of Hamlet 's fame . ''

		When the announcement was made , two or three years ago , that the dis - tinguished Danish critic had completed a com - prehensive work upon
Shakespeare	PERSON	and that it was to be translated into English , some hope was entertained that so accomplished a writer would give us a survey of the subject at once large , stimulating , and exact .

		Of the welcome that would be accorded to a masterly treatment of this great subject , there can be no doubt .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's notable book upon the '' Chief Tendencies of the Literature of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' was a brilliant rather than a pro- found or exact work .

		But it is now well-nigh a quarter of a century since that work was given to the world , and it was hoped that , in undertaking to deal with the greatest and the most difficult subject in modern literature , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	would not repeat the mistakes of his youth .

		It now appears that these high hopes were not warranted .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has doubt - less learned many things in the
past quarter	DATE	- century , but with all his getting he has not got wisdom .

		His book has the distinction of being the greatest literary disappointment of the period .

		There remains for us the somewhat ungrateful task of deriving such instruction as we may from the study of so brilliant a failure .

		A failure in the world 's sense which may perhaps be the sense of the author too it cer - tainly is not .

		To the reader of Shakespeare it is interesting , almost captivating ; and no doubt it will have a great sale .

		But it is an unsound book , and , as such , can bring the author no lasting reputation .

		Superficially , the book makes a favorable * WTT.T.TAT * SHAKESPEARE .

		impression .

		It is beautifully and correctly printed , and its contents are made easy of ac - cess by chapter-headings and head-lines .

		The task of the translators has been performed , on the whole , uncommonly well .

		There is , how - ever , a noticeable inequality , the part done by Mr.
Archer	PERSON	being distinctly the best .

		There are lapses and oversights , instances of false syntax , failures to verify citations from acces - sible English sources ; and the index is inade - quate .

		Perhaps the most grotesque example of failure to identify a quotation is to be found at page 160 , Vol .

		II. , where a well-known pas - sage in
Hamlet	LOCATION	's advice to the players is taken over directly from the Danish in such a way that its author would repudiate it .

		At the very beginning of his book , and again at the very end , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	distinctly states its purpose , which is to acquaint us with Shake - speare the man .

		His true life is incorporated in his writings : '' It is entirely our own fault if we know nothing whatever about him . ''

		But , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	is careful to add , in order to dis - tinguish the personality that rises from his works , these must be read '' with an open , recep - tive mind , with sanity of judgment and simple susceptibility to the power of genius . ''

		These excellent principles are laid down in the very last paragraph of the book .

		At the beginning also he speaks to like purpose : '' It is true that we possess in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets a group of poems which bring as more distinctly into touch with his personality than any of his other works .

		But to determine the value of the Sonnets as autobio - graphical documents requires not only historical knowl - edge but critical instinct and tact , since it is by no means self-evident that the poet is , in a literal sense , speaking in his own name '' -LRB- pp. 5 and 6 , Vol .

		I. -RRB- .

		To Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's treatment of the Sonnets let us accordingly turn in order to test his own adequacy in the qualities which he himself indi - cates as essential to the Shakespearian critic , openness of mind , sanity of judgment , critical tact , and historical knowledge .

		He begins by committing himself unreservedly to the theory that
William Herbert	PERSON	, afterwards Earl of Pem - broke , was the youth to whom the greater num - ber of the Sonnets are addressed .

		The argu - ment by which he supports this conclusion is scarcely so firmly linked as circumstantial evi - dence should be .

		For example , the date of the first friendship of Shakespeare with
Herbert	PERSON	is fixed as
1598	DATE	, on the strength of some Latin verses by
Francis Meres	PERSON	which are supposed to have suggested some expressions in Sonnet 55 .

		Meres , after quoting
Ovid	LOCATION	and
Horace	PERSON	, enu - merates , in imitation of them , some of the 348 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, agencies that will succumb to
Time	ORGANIZATION	sooner than the lines of
Sidney	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest of the English poets .

		Among these agencies are '' Mars : ferrum : flamma . ''

		In Sonnet 55 , which is evidently written upon the text of the famous '' exegi monumentum '' of
Horace	PERSON	, occur the lines : '' Nor Mars his sword nor war 's quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory . ''

		Meres would have sent
Shakespeare	PERSON	a copy of his book ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	would have read his own praises there , and would have paid Meres the compliment of imitating his indifferent Latin verses .

		For it is not to be supposed that a genius like Shakespeare could have hit upon such recondite figures as those of '' Mars his sword '' and '' war 's quick fire '' without being helped to them by an ass like Meres !

		Yet this is the sort of thing that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	expressly declares to be conclusive proof .

		But this is not all : granting that this is proved , nothing is proved with reference to the date of the friendship in question , which is referred to as `` new , '' not in Sonnet 55 but in Sonnet 56 , which , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	asserts , '' must date from about the same time . ''

		Thus , by proving that Sonnet 55 contains a commonplace or two re - sembling something that an eulogist of Shake - speare wrote in
1598	DATE	, it is demonstrated that another Sonnet , which chances to stand next in the printed book , must refer to a circumstance occurring in the year
1598	DATE	!

		To point out the numerous fallacies that grin from every loop - hole of this argument is an exercise in logic which I leave to the ingenious reader .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	next plunges into the unsavory account of the unclean tripartite relation that existed , as he and others most powerfully and potently believe , between these two friends and
Mistress Mary Fitton	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1601	DATE	this
Mistress Fitton	ORGANIZATION	gave birth to a child whose paternity
Herbert	PERSON	-LRB- now
Earl of Pembroke	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- acknowl - edged , '' but utterly renounceth all marriage . ''

		This , according to Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, is '' evidently '' the love-affair which forms the subject of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets .

		This Mistress
Fitton	PERSON	, then , is to be accepted as the '' Dark Lady '' of the Sonnets .

		And upon what evidence ?

		Abso - lutely none except such as is furnished by her relation with
Pembroke	PERSON	, who had numerous other relations of the same kind , this chancing to be the one that became notorious at this par - ticular time .

		We do not even know that her complexion was dark !

		Lady
Newdegate	PERSON	, who best knows the supposed portraits of her , thinks them to represent '' a fair red-and-white girl with brown hair . ''

		Yet Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	makes her play the woman 's part and that most mischievously in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	's life , and is positive in his conviction that she is not only the Dark Lady of the Sonnets , but also the '' black '' Rosaline of '' Love 's Labor 's Lost , '' the Rosa - line of '' Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' and Cleopatra .

		After devoting many pages to the unsavory gossip about her , and to the various references in the sonnets to the '' woman coloured ill , '' and the rest , while offering not a particle of proof and little enough of strong probability r he concludes : '' It has been established , as clearly as anything of this kind can be established without the direct evidence of contemporaries , that Mrs.
Mary Fitton	PERSON	and the Dark Lady were one and the same person . ''

		Compare with this the statement of the case lately made by Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	at the close of his comment on Lady
Newdegate	ORGANIZATION	's book : '' The conclusion of the whole matter then is , that though the suggestion of
William Herbert	PERSON	and
Mary Fitton	PERSON	as the man and the woman of the Sonnets is the best yet made , there is nothing like proof or good evi - dence that they are the folk we want , and there is at least much evidence against them . ''

		-LRB- From '' The Theatre , '' 1st
December , 1897	DATE	. -RRB-

		I have gone into this , first , because it gives a fair example of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's notion of his - torical evidence ; and , secondly , because this Dark-Lady theory colors his entire interpreta - tion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's character and works .

		Possessed by this and other theories equally airy in foundation , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	frequently overcharges his colors , does violence to the facts , or disregards inconvenient evidence .

		Thus , he insists , at the close of his interesting study of ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra , '' that the dramatist puts Cleopatra , after
Antony	PERSON	's death , '' in a much more unfavorable light '' than does
Plutarch	PERSON	, purposely intending a `` home-thrust '' at his bete noire , the Dark Lady .

		Plutarch represents
Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	's pretended clinging to life as a mere feint to elude the vigilance of Octavius .

		Shakespeare suppresses this '' his - torical explanation '' of her conduct , says Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, in order to disparage her ; for him '' she is ever the quintessence of the she-animal in woman . ''

		Had Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	not been wedded to the Dark-Lady theory , he might have seen that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	permits us to infer the '' his - torical explanation '' of Cleopatra 's conduct .

		It is bad criticism to say of a dramatist that he suppresses a motif that he distinctly implies .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has studied his Shakespeare to little purpose if he has not learned that it is far from being the great dramatist 's way to cross

		THE DIAL 349 every t and dot every i for us .

		Indeed , the incomparable succinctness and economy of force that distinguish this play above all others are lost , so far as here appears , upon the Danish critic .

		Let anyone without prepossession com - pare
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's narrative , in the translation of Sir
Thomas North	PERSON	, with the play , and judge whether Shakespeare is disparaging Cleopatra , or whether he is not , on the contrary , distinctly ennobling his historical model .

		He emphasizes her motherhood by making her delay her death in order , if possible , to obtain the kingdom for her son .

		He dignifies her by making her the object of the unselfish devotion of Dolabella .

		In this episode , by the way ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has an - ticipated
Browning	PERSON	's exquisite fancy of `` queen - worship . ''

		We feel that a woman capable of inspiring such affection can not be all unworthy .

		Never was the charm and sacredness of '' das Ewig-Weibliche '' expressed with such heart - piercing pathos as in
Cleopatra	LOCATION	's dying words : '' Peace , peace !

		Dost them not see my baby at my breast , That sucks the nurse asleep ? ''

		Yet all these master-strokes are lost upon Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	.

		He complains that in '' Macbeth '' all is too clear , '' Nothing lies concealed between the lines ... It is a rich highly moral melo - drama . ''

		Perhaps it might have been as well for Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, and even for his public , had he postponed his ambitious work upon Shake - speare until he had dropped his plummet a little deeper into '' Macbeth '' and had trained his eye to catch the flashes of suggestion in '' An - tony and Cleopatra . ''

		The truth seems to be that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	is a heavy-handed critic , as signally lacking in crit - ical tact as we have seen him to be lacking in sanity of judgment and openness of mind .

		After this , one would like to ascribe to him the re - maining quality which he rightly deems essen - tial to the critic , historical knowledge .

		Yet no one can be said to possess historical knowl - edge whose attitude toward facts is so habitu - ally careless as his .

		To point out and exemplify all the inaccuracies of statement and consequent or causative errors of judgment in this extended work would require a volume .

		These inaccu - racies of statement are generally minute , it is true ; none the less , the whole book is worm - eaten with them .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	makes the most of Shakespeare 's '' pessimism , '' '' bitterness , '' sickness of heart , disgust with life , '' misanthropy '' and '' mis - ogyny , '' during the third period of his author - ship , the period to which are ascribed '' An - tony and Cleopatra , '' '' Coriolanus , '' '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' and '' Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		To the less inspired and more depressing of these plays he gives disproportionate attention .

		Thus , to '' Troilus and Cressida '' he devotes nearly three times as much space as to '' Macbeth '' or '' King Lear '' ; to '' Coriolanus '' twice as much , and even to '' Timon '' considerably more than to either '' Macbeth '' or ''
Lear	PERSON	. ''

		This is because he finds more of Shakespeare 's '' personality '' in the more '' pessimistic '' plays .

		His method of getting at this person - ality is a simple one .

		He merely selects the character to which it suits him to ascribe the utterances of the author 's personal mood .

		In `` Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' for example , this char - acter is the '' scandalous buffoon '' Thersites .

		It is difficult to characterize this method of criticism by the use of adjectives sufficiently polite .

		I have given very few of the scores of exam - ples that might be cited in exemplification of these strictures , but I have said enough to show how baseless is the claim that this is a book distinguished by '' German thoroughness . ''

		Its two damning defects are inaccuracy of detail and grandiose disregard of the relations uni - versally demanded by reasonable beings be - tween premises and conclusions .

		By the method of proof here adopted , any proposition can be demonstrated according to the mood of the au - thor .

		It would scarcely be a parody of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's method were we to contend that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	must have been haunted by a tor - turing prevision of the vagaries of Danish crit - icism when he made the Queen in '' Hamlet '' exclaim : '' How cheerfully on the false trail they cry !

		O this is counter , you false Danish dogs . ''

		The fact that this book is , considering its size and comprehensiveness , one of the most spirited and fascinating works ever written about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, makes its defects especially deplorable .

		The author seems deliberately to have chosen the role of the special pleader rather than that of the cautious investigator .

		It is not to be denied that he is an effective writer , nor that his rhetoric is often used in the service of just views .

		The book reads like a series of '' University Extension '' lectures by a profes - sor more adroit to persuade than scrupulous to instruct his audience .

		One is often tempted to push the work aside with the remark that it may do very well for the general public , but that it is not for the student .

		This is , however , a fallacy , one to which the kindly reviewer too 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, often resorts in his desire to say a good word for the work of a clever man .

		The truth is that no book is fit to be recommended to the general public which is not at the same time of value to the scholar .

		In other words , it must be true as far as it goes .

		No one can keep in mind all the minute facts and nice arguments that come within the purview of a comprehensive book about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author of such a book must therefore be as scrupulous about '' the mint and the cummin '' as about '' the weightier matters of the law . ''

		Attention to detail is the touchstone of reverence for truth ; and every student knows how often the weightier matters hang upon trifles .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's book is not only interesting and skilfully written : it contains many just crit - icisms and suggestive remarks , and some inter - pretations that are brilliant and even illuminat - ing .

		But in order to utilize his book one must follow him up patiently step by step , exam - ining his sources and testing his conclusions .

		Such a method of reading , however profitable it may be to the student , does not heighten one 's respect for the book .

		One gradually be - comes convinced that the author is not always to be trusted for his facts and never for his inferences .

		Of course the general reader can - not be expected to follow an author up in any such way .

		He could not if he would ; and Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	does his work so neatly , and with such an air of confident superiority , that no one not especially acquainted with the subject would dream of distrusting him .

		His method is one which has become only too common .

		A fasci - nating theory is set up ; doubtful traditions or unverified statements of fact are put forward ; lines from the plays or the poems are pressed into service ; and , out of this nebula of uncer - tainties , certainty is hocus-pocussed , and there stands the author , with the air of being master of the situation , pointing triumphantly to his conclusion !

		The method is irresistible , the audience is enthusiastic , and the book has an immense vogue .

		It is thus that many a lit - erary reputation is made , many a university chair or academic fauteuil attained .

		Mean - while it is becoming harder and harder to se - cure the dissemination of reasonable views when they chance to be unsensational ; and in this fascinating field of literary study false prophets arise to prophesy , some in Shake - speare 's name and some in
Bacon	LOCATION	's , and in their names to write many wonderful works .

		THE MATERIALS OF
AMERICAN HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Some twelve years ago , Prof.
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	called the attention of the
American Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	to the constant danger and frequent destruction of the material for making complete the history of the
United States	LOCATION	, and urged the Society to become the agent for the collection and proper preservation of such material .

		But it was felt that local historical societies , state commissions , etc. , were already engaged in this useful work , and that it would be wiser to help these existing agencies than to create new ones .

		Yet , finding that many States with ample stores of material did nothing , and that many socie - ties were hampered by a lack of resources , the
American Society	ORGANIZATION	, at its annual meeting in
1895	DATE	, appointed an
Historical Manuscript Commission	ORGANIZATION	, consisting of Professor
Jameson	PERSON	of
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Talcott Williams	PERSON	of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	press , Professor
Turner	PERSON	of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and Professor Trent of the
University of the South	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first Report of this commission is now given to the public .

		The members of the commission early deter - mined to omit from their consideration archives of all kinds , unless having a national bearing ; to avoid trenching on grounds occupied by ex - isting agencies ; and to assist societies having matter suited for publication but without means of doing so .

		Naturally , the first effort was to discover and catalogue the available resources .

		The commission , therefore , sent out two circu - lars , the one to individuals , the other to organ - izations .

		The response to the latter has been more general than to the former appeal ; yet sufficient returns are now in to show a surpris - ingly large amount of unpublished matter , not alone valuable in itself but tending to throw light on isolated letters already in print .

		To secure these papers for publication is , it must be presumed , not always an easy task ; hence the commission is able to announce only the hope of presenting in future reports the '' cor - respondence of two brothers , prominent states - men of that region -LSB- the
Middle States	LOCATION	-RSB- during the first half of the present century , '' and '' the unpublished papers of one of the greatest of Southern statesmen . ''

		But the profitable show - ing made in the first Report needs neither apology nor promises .

		If this be an earnest of the future , the commission has earned the grat - * REPORT OF THE HISTORICAL MANUSCRIPTS COMMISSION OF THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION .

Frederick J. Turner	PERSON	, and
William P. Trent	PERSON	.


Washington	LOCATION	:
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 351 itude not only of the
Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, of teachers and students of American history , but of every citizen who has at heart the preserva - tion of the story of our national rise and progress .

		Departing from the example of the
Royal Commission	ORGANIZATION	on Historical Manuscripts of En - gland -LRB- founded in
1869	DATE	-RRB- , which prints only calendars of collections , the commission began the task of selecting the matter which should make up its first Report .

		The Revolutionary period had been most largely explored and its documents most largely printed ; the Colonial period had been almost as fully exploited .

		It was therefore decided to take for the first work of the commission the period from the end of the Revolutionary War to the beginning of the nineteenth century a formative period when the infant republic was making its first effort to secure recognition as a nation and was learn - ing much by the hard rule of necessity .

		From the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	extracts were made from the correspondence of Phineas Bond , sometime British consul at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The letters cover the period from the beginning of
1787	DATE	to the end of
1789	DATE	, furnishing a store - house of information on the imports , exports , manufacture , products , and population of the States , as well as on international questions , such as the treatment of the Tories , the British debts owing in
America	LOCATION	, and the British soldiers retained in the Western forts .

		The second contribution in the Report is from Dr.
Douglas Brymner	PERSON	, Archivist of the Dominion of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		It consists of copies of four letters supposed to be written by a traitor in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to the
Duke of Mirepoix	ORGANIZATION	, offering for a sum of money to raise an army in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	for marching to
Fort Pitt	LOCATION	and assisting the French in the French-Indian war .

		The intercepted letters are accompanied by nineteen others , showing the efforts put forth by the English government to discover the writer .

		Much side information is thus given out , and one can now more readily appreciate the ignorance of the home govern - ment concerning the colonies when one sees how readily the fabrications of this mysterious writer were believed .

		He asserted that he had already enlisted 1800 Germans and Irish , had rallied all the able-bodied Acadians -LRB- ! -RRB-

		, and would soon have
2000	DATE	more soldiers under his banner .

		That a man who had been '' solicited to be at the head of a considerable army to be raised this
Winter	DATE	in
Pennsylvania Govt	LOCATION	.

		& c , '' would place Fort Du Quesne 900 miles from
Canada	LOCATION	, and speak of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	'' Ger - mans imported from
Holland	LOCATION	, '' and yet be credited , is passing strange ; but very strenuous efforts were made to discover him , even the name of
Washington	LOCATION	being considered in a process of elimination of suspected persons .

		Returning more closely to the period intended to be covered in the Report , the Letters of
Stephen Higginson	PERSON	, contributed largely by his grandson , Col.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, present much new information concerning
Shay	PERSON	's Rebellion , the rise of the Federalists , the
Essex Junto	LOCATION	, and political life in
New En	LOCATION	- gland .

		These letters show a wealthy
Boston	LOCATION	merchant and bank director , supposed to be worth at one time over 8400,000 , taking an active part in politics , and offering most prac - tical suggestions for the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	at the time of its formation .

		The fifty-seven letters of
Higginson	PERSON	cover the period of
1783	DATE	to
1806	DATE	.

		The South is represented in the Report by the Diary of
Edward Hooker	PERSON	, a native of Con - necticut , who went to
South Carolina	LOCATION	from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	college , and recorded his observations on life in that
State	ORGANIZATION	from
1803	DATE	to
1808	DATE	.

		The editor has wisely sacrificed the young man 's opinions on the social life in
South Carolina	LOCATION	for the care - ful retention of everything bearing on the po - litical life of the future great leader of the
South	LOCATION	during this transitional and formative period of her existence .

		The apparently inexhaustible resources of the
Wisconsin Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	have been drawn upon for that portion of the Report which represents the West , supplemented by contributions from the library of Col.
Reuben T. Durrett	PERSON	, of
Louisville	LOCATION	,
Ky.	LOCATION	, and also from the French Archives .

		The
Louisiana	LOCATION	expedi - tion which Gen.
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	proposed to make under the patronage of Genet , in 1793-5 , forms the main object of the collection of letters and papers ; but about it are clus - tered the interesting and sometimes puzzling questions of
Jefferson	PERSON	's connivance , the atti - tude of the other officials , and the relations with the Indians , with
Spain	LOCATION	, and with
France	LOCATION	.

		These documents close the Report , without an index .

		An important feature of the Report is a Bibliography , geographically arranged , of the printed lists and descriptions of historical man - uscripts and archives in
Washington	LOCATION	and scat - tered through the different States .

		In this cat - alogue the student may ascertain at least where he can look for unprinted material upon a sub - ject he is investigating , and thus it marks a 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, distinct step toward that historical cooperation and systemization so much needed for intelli - gent , complete , and profitable local investiga - tion .

		The list is not necessarily complete , but its publication will bring additions .

		It is com - paratively free from errors , although a few have crept in , such as -LRB- page 509 -RRB- `` Nimian '' for Ninian
Edwards	PERSON	.

		Certainly no one will criticise the decision of the commission to print the documents instead of calendars of them ; to sacrifice a certain ex - actness by using translations of all languages save French , and thereby to gain a wider use - fulness ; to print entire letters , and , as far as possible , entire documents , instead of extracts .

		Some criticism may be heard concerning the selection of the material for this first report ; but account should be taken of the natural difficul - ties under which such efforts are carried on difficulties due not to hostility on the part of holders of valuable papers , but to procrastina - tion in replying to inquiries , to reluctance in giving out what is often regarded as personal or family history , and to the very limited resources of the commission , which made much of the labor a labor of love .

		It now remains for teachers , students , and readers of American history , as well as all inter - ested in this subject , to call public attention to the first fruits of the
Historical Manuscripts Commission	ORGANIZATION	; to arouse general interest in fur - thering its ends ; and to secure the cooperation of other agencies well equipped to supplement its efforts in the praiseworthy task of preserv - ing in all its details the interesting story of our great experiment in representative government .

		THE MEMOIRS OF A LIEUTENANT - GENERAL , .

		* If there is a particular feature which gives special value to the story told by Lieutenant - General
Schofield	PERSON	of his forty-six years of ser - vice in the
United States	LOCATION	army , it is that the various chapters are composed of materials gathered at the time of the events described or prepared immediately after the publication of some volume of reminiscences which awakened recollections in the mind of the writer .

		And although the notes were carefully reexainiued and revised before their publication in compact * FORTY-SIX YEARS IN THE ARMY .

		By Lieutenant-General
John M. Schofield	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:

		form , the evidences of contemporaneous treat - ment are many .

		As long as there are any unpublished papers relating to the Civil War , volumes of '' me - moirs '' must be expected , setting forth the ac - complishments of their author in as favorable a light as possible .

		Even if the matter is largely personal , historical literature will be enriched by such publications .

		Just why this or that battle was lost , and just who was to blame for certain mistakes , may not be finally determined by this generation of Americans , but the his - torian who tries to tell the story of our Civil War to those who come after all the actors in the great drama are dead will have an exceed - ingly difficult task when he seeks the exact truth amid the contradictory accounts furnished in the memoirs of generals North and South .

		The reader turns away from General Scho - field 's interesting life-story with the feeling that many men have been unduly honored by the people .

		In important movements of the Civil War ,
General Schofield	ORGANIZATION	had opportunity to know the leaders .

		At the start he was connected with the army in the midst of the difficulties in
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		He realized the mistake in the battle of
Wilson	PERSON	's
Creek	LOCATION	, where the brave
Nathaniel Lyon	PERSON	sacrificed his life needlessly .

		He speed - ily formed an unfavorable opinion of
General Fremont	ORGANIZATION	, and his account sustains the position of those who feel that the enthusiasm of the campaign of
1856	DATE	gave to the first Republican candidate for the presidency a higher place in the esteem of the people than his abilities would otherwise have secured him .

		As each year of the war is described , the effect of the story is distinctly depressing , because of this element of personal criticism , which sometimes makes a firm impress on the mind of the reader , even when the unfavorable comment is accompanied by words of praise .

		The case of General
Thomas	PERSON	is an example .

		If the reader should happen to have been brought up in a part of the country filled with ex-soldiers of that army which loved General
Thomas	PERSON	with a fervor of devotion rarely manifested among men , the ac - count of the engagements in which both Gen - eral
Schofield	PERSON	and General
Thomas	PERSON	played prominent parts would seem unduly harsh to - ward the latter .

		There is evidence that personal feeling is involved in the pages .

		Looking backwards , many famous engage - ments seem based upon plans that are faulty from the standpoint of a military commander , or in the eyes of a student of strategy .

		The battle of
Bunker Hill	ORGANIZATION	has been severely criti -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 cised , as showing frightful blunders on the part of British and Americans alike .

		But such crit - icism will never affect the position of that en - gagement in American history .

		It is not always well-laid plans and skilful manoeuvring which succeed in warfare ; sometimes it is a happy conjunction of circumstance , and more than a trifle of luck .

		It was success which gave Sher - man 's '' march to the sea '' its glory .

		Defeat and disaster might have shown very clearly the lack of military skill involved in such a move - ment .

		The West may have been improperly protected at a critical time .

		Grant may not have needed
Sherman	PERSON	's help in finishing the struggle .

		But the fact remains that the famous oo march has found a place in song and story , and that it will be a long time before criticism can erase from American annals the account of that military excursion .

		Perhaps the most important pages in
General Schofield	ORGANIZATION	's volume are those given to a memo - randum , written in
1868	DATE	, regarding interviews with
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	and Attorney - General
Evarts	PERSON	relative to
General Schofield	ORGANIZATION	's accept - ance of the portfolio of War , in the last part of President
Johnson	PERSON	's stormy administration .

		As Mr.
Evarts	PERSON	was one of the counsel for the impeached president , and
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	was outspoken against Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	, the varying views shown make this particular memorandum very interesting reading .

		How General
Scho	PERSON	- field conducted himself in the trying situation is indicated in Mr.
Elaine	PERSON	's words : '' He took charge of the War Department at a difficult and critical time , but his administration of it was in all respects successful and received the commendation of fair-minded men in all par - ties . ''

		Set against this achievement as a cabinet member in an unpleasant period might be the experience as commandant at
West Point	LOCATION	, the acceptance of which position General
Schofield	PERSON	designates '' the mistake of my life . ''

		There were ups and downs in the life of forty-six years in the army , but there were enough ele - ments of satisfaction in it to more than make up for any periods when the experiences were not entirely pleasant .

		Aside from the chapters which deal with events which have occasioned controversy , the volume contains much that is interesting read - ing for itself alone .

		The recent history of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	is well presented , and the discussions of the defensive strength of the country are full of suggestiveness at this time of war 's alarms .

		A SCIEXTTFIC BlBI/E DICTIONARY .

		* The announcement of Dr.
Hastings	PERSON	's great
Bible Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, made some little time since , aroused considerable interest in theological cir - cles .

		The monumental work of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	had passed through two independent revisions , but one of them -LRB- that by Professors
Hackett	PERSON	and
Ezra Abbott	PERSON	-RRB- was hopelessly out of date ; while the other , which appeared in
England	LOCATION	only a few years since , covered only one-third of the work , and was very expensive .

		There was room for a thoroughly new dictionary written from a modern point of view and representing the precipitate of criticism .

		Especially was this necessary in the departments of Introduction and Biblical Theology , in which '' scientific '' theology has made its influence most felt .

		The first instalment of this present work is on the whole satisfactory , although it is marked by one very serious defect : its Biblical theology is not Biblical theology in any true sense .

		En - glish scholars , especially of the New Testament , however much they excel in certain lines of investigation , have not shown such aptitude for such historical methods in theology as those of
Germany	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, and in certain instances have seemed unwilling to break free from the dogmatic position of the Established Church ; but it was hoped that all this might be reme - died in work entrusted to such competent edit - orship as that of Dr.
Hastings	PERSON	.

		But the result has not justified the hope .

		Such articles as would naturally be included under Biblical Theology are hardly more than restatements of ecclesiastical or dogmatic positions supported by references to Scripture texts , and in one or two instances the writers have apparently sub - stituted
Church History	ORGANIZATION	for Scripture .

		But such faulty method is confined to this group of subjects .

		The articles on questions of chronology , history , and Introduction leave little to be desired .

		Here , especially , one meets with considerable concession to the critical school .

		Professor
Hommel	PERSON	, it is true , writes upon
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	, but his position can hardly be classed as that of a traditionalist ; while the papers upon the Chronology of the Old Testament , and the Book of
Daniel	PERSON	, by Professor
E. L. Curtis	PERSON	, and that upon
Deuter	PERSON	- onomy by President
Ryle	PERSON	, are , as one would expect , abreast of the best recent conclusions .

June 1	DATE	, In his paper upon
David	PERSON	, Professor
H. A. White	PERSON	would reduce the number of Davidic psalms as given even by
Ewald	ORGANIZATION	.

		But in no case are the articles radical in conclusion or even suggestion .

		The same progressive yet conservative spirit is to be seen in the articles dealing with similar matters in the
New Testament	LOCATION	, although the article upon Acts hardly gives as much atten - tion as one could wish to the various critical questions the book involves .

		The brilliant ar - ticle upon the Chronology of the
New Testa	LOCATION	- ment is not only one of great learning and orig - inality but also one that shows the effect of recent studies .

		Geographical and archaeological subjects are similarly well handled .

		Altogether , the volume marks a distinct stage in theological development , in that it is soberly and constructively critical .

		One would not ex - pect or wish that it should represent radical positions , but it will be a revelation to those people who have decried or scorned critical results to see how far English and American scholars of recognized sobriety and learning have accepted them .

		In this particular the work is destined to have a lasting influence for the good , for it can not fail to become authori - tative among those persons whose own teach - ings will set the trend of popular theology dur - ing the next generation .

		And it further proves that to-day 's theologians are not dogmatists , but are working with the acumen and method of genuine science .

		distinctive delineation , and when its fundamental theme is based upon a condition of spiritual stress known by personal experience to every earnest man or woman of this generation , it may justly claim a more careful consideration than is deserved by the rank and file among the productions of current fic - tion .

		Such a book must be treated as literature rather than as entertainment , and such a book we undoubtedly have in Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	's '' The Gospel of Freedom . ''

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's previously published stories have shown him to be a conscien - tious worker in his art , with well-conceived ideals of both its form and its ethical content .

		But their scale has been so small as to preclude the putting forth of the most serious kind of effort , and they have dis - played , at the most , a talent for doing the sort of thing that Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	does so supremely well , and that remains , after all , so supremely futile .

		In '' The Gospel of Freedom '' Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	has taken heart for a flight of wider sweep than hereto - fore , yet has been careful not to exceed the limits of his conscious power .

		His art is still capable of much further development in several directions ; it has not acquired the strength to which it may some time attain , and the severe lesson of restraint has not been wholly learned .

		It is still too closely the transcript of an unassimilated personal experience .

		But it has the promise of swift and vigorous growth , and already represents an achievement which is considerable for so young a writer .

		The gospel of freedom is a phrase of many meanings , but they are all reducible to two categories .

		That the truth makes men free is one of the oldest of sayings , but from what is it that men are to be freed ?

		From the tyranny of circumstance and environment , say some ; from the bondage of irrational instincts and passions , say others .

		To put it differently , there is an external freedom and an internal freedom , and each has had its impassioned champions in all ages .

		That the latter is the truer and higher form of free - dom is hardly to be doubted by those who have felt the emancipating influence of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and the innere Freiheit which he has helped so many to win is the most precious of all possessions .

		Again and again do we find this lesson enforced by the finer spirits of the century now ending
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, Renan , and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and in comparison with this ideal the old outpourings against kingcraft and priestcraft , against institutions and observances , seem the `` trumpery '' that Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	contemptuously styles them , seem at the best but means to an end whose existence they barely realize .

		Now , the per - son whose quest of freedom forms the substance of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's book , although herself a woman little above the commonplace , although not invested with qualities of extraordinary charm , although merely typical of a class numbered by tens of thousands in every advanced country , does yet in her experience so embody the lesson of the two kinds of freedom that she becomes a significant figure .

		To this fine issue is her spirit so touched that she realizes in the end , after having loosened herself from the external
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 355 trammels under which she chafed , that she is not really free , that her struggle for freedom has only just begun , that the vital problem is still unsolved , and stares her in the face more threateningly than did ever the problems that she had hitherto fancied were the only serious ones .

		Such is the main import of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's novel .

		There remains to say that the scenes are set in
Paris	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, that the story has both action and actuality , that the characters are well grouped , and their inter - course animated , that the residual impression is of a clean-cut piece of workmanship .

		One can not help recalling , at times Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's '' Little Journey in the World '' and its sequel , at times Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's '' A Doll Home . ''

		The heroine is placed in a situation closely resembling that of Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's heroine , and she escapes from it much after
Nora	PERSON	's fashion .

		That part of the book which is descriptive of life in Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's adopted city will hardly be relished by its inhabitants .

		Such bits of personality as '' the scamp that owns the mayor and the city council , '' and the '' kind of buffoon '' who represents the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	at a public celebration are not numerous , and few will take exception to them , but certain things that are said about
Chicago	LOCATION	in general are too painfully truthful for their writer to hope for for - giveness , while there is a merciless realism about his report of the conversation at social gatherings that will make some of his readers grieve , and would make more of them grieve were the satirical intent not so deftly concealed from the duller-witted .

		Finally , although a very small matter , we will re - mark that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	should look more carefully to his spelling of foreign words .

		We know of no
San Geminiano	LOCATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	or elsewhere , seduisante badly needs an accent , enthusiasmes is neither French nor English , and sympatico does not exist in any known language .

		There is a crispness of manner and a breeziness of invention about '' The Celebrity '' that go far toward making it one of the most entertaining books of the season .

		The hero is a popular American story-writer , adored by young women , and celebrated for both his books and his conquests .

		Weary of what he is pleased to call his fame , he repairs to a Western summer resort , and assumes the name of another man to whom he bears a close personal re - semblance .

		Here he becomes a lion of the verandas and a leader of cotillons , incidentally occupying himself in the pleasant task of making love to two girls .

		Unfortunately for him , the girls in question are not of the usual ''
summer	DATE	'' type , but young women of insight and blessed with a keen sense of humor .

		They play with him in the most delightful way , protected from discovery by the invulnerable armor of his conceit , while fate joins hands with them in the most unexpected way by turning the real owner of the name he has assumed into an em - bezzler and fugitive from justice .

		How his new friends accept the situation , pretend not to believe his explanations , and hustle him away in a yacht and over the Canadian border , are things to be read about in Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's genial pages , not to be feebly described in a summary like this .

		One bit may be quoted .

		The Celebrity is brought face to face with the two heroines , to the second of whom he has just offered his hand and heart .

		She an - nounces the fact to her friend , who calmly remarks : '' But ,
Marian	PERSON	, you can ' t have him .

		He is engaged to me .

		And if it 's quite the same to yon , I want him myself .

		It is n't often , you know , that one has the opportunity to marry a Celebrity . ''

		After two pages of delicious comedy , which the girls had carefully planned in anticipation of such a scene as this , the denouement is reached . '' '

		Marian , ' said
Miss Trevor	PERSON	, ' I am going to be very gen - erous .

		I relinquish the prize to you , and to yon only .

		And I flatter myself there are not many girls in the world who would do it . ' '

		` Thank you ,
Irene	PERSON	, ' Miss
Thorn	PERSON	replied gravely , ` much as I want him , I could not think of depriving you . ' ''

		Well , there is a limit to all endurance , and the Celebrity had reached his . '' '

		Crocker , ' he said , ' how far is it to the Canadian Pacific ? ' ''

		I told him . ' '

		I think I had best be starting , ' said he . ''

		And a moment later he had disappeared into the woods . ''

		This amusing story will give zest to the holiday hours of many readers during the present
summer	DATE	, and their enjoyment will no doubt be heightened by the fact that no one can miss discovering in the Celebrity of the novel a celebrity of actual life .

		There is a fine democracy in the novels of Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	that goes far to cover up their structural defects .

		We feel that their author is a man of the wide world , not the narrow one , that his sympathies are not circumscribed by the limits of any caste or social stratum , that he delights in natural manliness , whatever the station in which it may be found .

		The intercourse with many sorts and conditions of men that has resulted from his varied experiences as artist , traveller , and engineer has both widened and quickened his sympathies , and enabled him to delineate for us with equal insight Venetian gondoliers ,
Virginia	LOCATION	colonels , and men who do with their hands the rough necessary work of the world .

		It is the latter type that he presents to us in the person of
Caleb West	PERSON	, who is the hero of his latest novel , unless indeed the real hero be no human being whatever , but the lighthouse that gets itself built despite the fury of the adverse elements that would balk civilization of its conquest .

		The scenes depicted are not unlike those in Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' Cap - tains Courageous , '' and have something of his sin - cerity and strength .

		The interest , however , is far more varied , and episodes from a politer sphere of existence share the attention .

		There is a Southern '' major '' who delights us after the fashion of Col - onel
Carter	PERSON	, and there are two love-stories one expressed and one only suggested besides the trag - edy that so nearly wrecks
Caleb	PERSON	's life .

		In the strug - gle of his contracting engineer with an ignorant government inspector of the work , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has doubtless embodied some of his own experience with the sort of malicious stupidity that our political sys - tem too often clothes with brief official authority , 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, and we take great satisfaction in the final discom - fiture of this particular scoundrel .

		But credulity is at least strained when , after having taken elaborate measures to secure evidence of the incompetence of his enemy , our engineer is made , in the closing chapters , to forget that any such evidence exists , and to be surprised when it is forthcoming .

		This is the chief of the several technical faults with which the story , in spite of its genial vitality , is clearly chargeable .

		The author of '' Hassan : a Fellah '' has lived for many years in
Palestine	LOCATION	, and accumulated a great store of information concerning the history of the country , as well as concerning the customs and be - liefs of its
Mohammedan	DATE	inhabitants .

		This infor - mation he has unloaded in somewhat indiscriminat - ing and wholesale fashion upon the work of fiction which bears the above title , and which proves rather exasperating to read by reason of its effort to be so very instructive .

		Stripped of its scientific and his - torical accessories , it appears as a touching story of native love , thwarted in various ways such as the sending of the hero to
Crete	LOCATION	with the army , but brought to a satisfactory conclusion .

		It is a con - scientious piece of work , and that is about all . ''

		A Queen of Hearts , '' by Miss
Elizabeth Phipps Train	PERSON	, is an example of the sort of story that affords an hour of mild entertainment , and is completely forgotten the next week or month .

		It is the auto - biography of an actress , nurtured in a Puritan house - hold , but unable to repress the impulse to lead a freer life , an impulse that has come to her legitimately enough from a French play-acting father .

		She be - comes a queen of the lyric stage , enjoys a checkered but successful career , and deserves , on the whole , the happiness that is eventually her share .

		The tone of the book is prettily sentimental , and the incidents of a rather stereotyped sort .

		It has a cer - tain amount of grace and animation , although the flush of its life has a slightly hectic suggestion . ''

		Madame of the Ivies , '' another story by the same writer , reproduces these qualities with an altered scenario .

		It again takes the form of auto - biography , being told by the young woman who is its heroine , and who becomes the companion of an old woman who lives in absolute seclusion , as the result , partly of blindness , partly of the tragic hap - penings that seem to have wrecked her life .

		The novel might almost be described as a pale reflection of ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' for it has several of the character - istics of that immortal work the governess , the sombre hero , and his maniac wife , immured for years in the family mansion .

		The story is brought to a happy ending , and sunlight at last flows into the lives of both the stricken mother and the injured son .

		The story of '' The War of the Worlds '' is con - trived with an ingenuity of invention that outdoes
M. Jules Verne	PERSON	, yet it remains almost as unconvinc - ing as the pseudo-scientific imaginings of that enter - taining Frenchman .

		It is difficult to take seriously these Martians who look like leather polyps , who go stalking about
England	LOCATION	in spheroidal long-legged metallic engines , and who deal death and destruc - tion by means of heat-rays and poisonous suffocat - ing vapors .

		The best parts of the story are those that describe the advent of the Martians in cylinders shot from our neighbor planet , and those others that make the terrible visitors succumb to the ravages of the terrestrial microbe .

		In this book , as in such others as '' The Time Machine '' and '' The Invis - ible Man , '' Mr.
Wells	PERSON	accepts to the full the logical implications of his primary postulate , and works in .

		a good deal of effective realism in the detailed de - scription of occurrences .

		The imagination displayed is somewhat unusual in intensity , although of a cheap sort , and if his account of '' The War of the Worlds '' does not actually thrill , it may at least be admitted to entertain .

		Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, in '' A Desert Drama , '' has found an excellent subject for dramatic narrative , and has told a story of sustained and exciting inter - est. .

		A party of English-speaking tourists on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	who have ventured beyond the
First Cataract	ORGANIZATION	leave their boat one morning to explore a famous temple .

		They are attacked by a band of dervishes and taken into captivity .

		Some of the party are murdered and the others are started by their cap - tors for
Khartoum	LOCATION	.

		At a critical juncture they are rescued by a detachment of the
Egyptian Camel Corps	ORGANIZATION	and restored to civilization .

		The characters are clearly outlined , and both talk and act in a sim - ple and natural manner .

		When one thinks of the temptation for melodramatic handling offered by such a situation , one can hardly praise the writer sufficiently for his restraint .

		Perhaps the most dis - tinct impression left by this strong story is of the sharp contrast between the careless ease and frivo - lous preoccupations of the tourist party and the grim realities with which they are so startlingly con - fronted .

		There is no nonsense about the dervishes , but it takes some time for their captives to realize the fact and adjust their mental focus to the new conditions .

		It is not often that people are con - fronted with the seriousness of life by so sharp a turn as this , and the difficult situation thus created is handled by Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	with an insight into the springs of character no less admirable than that which goes to the depiction of its external aspects .

		Just at this time , when the recapture of
Khartoum	LOCATION	by the forces of civilization is a certainty of the near future , '' A Desert Drama '' is a timely book , and will have a host of readers . ''

		The Pride of Jennico '' is a quasi-historical novel of a somewhat familiar type , being concerned with the fortunes of an English gentleman of the eight - eenth century , who falls heir to a vast estate in
Southeastern Europe	LOCATION	, and the story of his love for a German princess .

		It is a tale of long-drawn agonies , desperate adventures , and final success .

		What separates it from most books of its class is its distinction of manner , its unusual grace of diction , its delicacy of touch , and the fervent charm of its love-passages .

		It is a very attractive piece of ro - mantic fiction , scorning most of the cheap devices

		Mr.
Christie Murray	PERSON	is a story-teller of a some - what old-fashioned type , but for that not the less to be commended .

		His characters are apt to be chil - dren of the soil rather than of the salon ; human beings with genuine emotions instead of the varied sorts of degenerates with which much of our fiction is concerned .

		Major
Arthur Griffiths	PERSON	's Welling - f * ? ''

		> Hi8 Comrades and
Contempora	ORGANIZATION	- ries '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is a handsome memorial volume , about three-fourths of which is devoted to the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, the balance of it containing brief sketches of his leading lieutenants , Cotton , Hill ,
Beresford	PERSON	,
Picton	LOCATION	,
Craufurd	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	, and the rest .


Wellington	LOCATION	's reputation has suffered from a certain reaction in public sentiment of late , and there has even been a tendency on the part of his countrymen to harp on his familiar foibles and to belittle his really superior gifts and services as a soldier .

		No censor has gone quite as far as
O'Connell	PERSON	did when he flouted the Iron Duke as a '' Stunted Corporal '' ; but the less admirable traits in his character have been somewhat unduly em - phasized and dwelt on .

		We have been told that he was harsh , unsympathetic , ungrateful ; without strong affection , whether as son or father ; taking all to his own credit , and passing on little praise and fame to those who helped him to his great successes .

		The
Wellington	LOCATION	of
Talavera	LOCATION	,
Vittoria	LOCATION	, and
Waterloo	LOCATION	, has become merged somewhat in the popular appre - hension in the
Wellington	LOCATION	of
Apsley House	ORGANIZATION	.

		All this is mainly due , perhaps , to that inevitable reac - tion of opinion and feeling which is the Nemesis of too towering reputations .

		But the Duke lived to see his own popularity decline .

		His strenuous oppo - sition to the Reform Bill gained him widespread obloquy ; and the fickle mob , which had cheered and deified him after
Waterloo	LOCATION	, hooted and hunted him through the streets and smashed the windows of the palace he had acquired in the heyday of his glory .

		Nor was the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's bearing under the fire of popular insult of the kind that conciliates and turneth away wrath .

		He could repay abuse with cutting scorn sometimes with stinging rejoinder .

		Once , on a well-known occasion , when an angry crowd ordered him to halt in a narrow street and repeat the current popular shibboleth , '' God bless Queen
Caroline	PERSON	, '' he acquiesced in the demand , but added grimly as a Parthian shot while riding away , '' and may all your wives be like her ! ''

		He har - bored a strain of inbred contempt for the minds and persons of those composing the theoretically most sovereign stratum of the sovereign people - the '' masses . ''


Wellington	LOCATION	was born a '' gentleman '' -LRB- in the technical sense -RRB- and bred a soldier .

		He had a plain , if a strong , understanding .

		He was no adept at political metaphysics .

		He did not under - stand the modern apotheosis of ignorance and rags .

		He held to the old-fashioned doctrine of the supe - rior political fitness of property and education .

		The mob was to him simply the mob , and there was nothing sacrosanct about it .

		It was as good as , and no better than , the individuals that composed it ; and what those individuals were , he trusted to his senses to tell him .

		The '' people '' meant for him , not a sublime and mystic abstraction , clothed with ineffable dignities and fixed inalienable rights , but a motley multitude of widely diverse individuals , good , bad , and indifferent , largely untaught , un - ruly , and unwashed , who were to be governed , not according to some fixed fundamental scheme of eternal principles drawn from philosophy , but ac - cording to their manifest desert and the practical exigencies of the moment .

		Laissez faire was a good rule perhaps for fair weather ; but what the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's notion of the province of government in times of intestine storm and stress was may be gathered from the nature of his measures for the defense of
London	LOCATION	against the Chartists in
1848	DATE	.

		The stern old soldier was prepared to deluge the streets of the city with blood , as
Cavaignac	PERSON	did in the same year at
Paris	LOCATION	, rather than allow the hordes of vandalism and anarchy , that were plainly ready to turn the honest purposes of the actual petitioners to their own account , to work their infamous will on civil society .

		He did not propose to see the
Gordon	PERSON	riots repeated in his day .

		Major
Griffiths	PERSON	claims for his interesting memorial that it is a new move toward rehabilitating
Wellington	LOCATION	in the esteem of his countrymen .

		He has dwelt chiefly on his hero 's military career , while not neglecting his political services .


Wellington	LOCATION	's personal character is clearly and entertainingly portrayed , and there is a rich fund of anecdotes including that famous one relat - ing how Lord
Uxbridge	LOCATION	lost a leg while at the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's side at
Waterloo	LOCATION	, and how the sad news was imparted and received : '' I 've lost my leg , by G d ! ''

		cas - 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, ually remarked his lordship , during the heat of battle .

		`` Have you , by G d ? ''

		absently replied his chief , without removing his glass from his eye .

		The work is handsomely illustrated , mainly with portrait .

		A new series of biographies under the title '' Builders of Greater Britain '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- includes men whose sphere of activity has been , in the main , adminis - trative , as well as those who have fought and ex - plored by sea and land .

		The first volume of the series , by Mr.
Martin A. S. Hume	PERSON	, is devoted to Sir
Walter Ralegh	PERSON	, and fittingly so , for to
Ralegh	PERSON	and his brother , Sir
Humphrey Gilbert	PERSON	, belongs the honor of first undertaking exploration with the dis - tinct purpose of founding colonies , and not merely for the sake of treasure .

		Ralegh 's life at court , his unceasing activity in every branch of learning , and his ability as soldier , statesman , and admiral , are discussed clearly and entertainingly .

		Aside from Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's discovery of some letters of the Spanish ambassador
Gondomar	PERSON	, the work has little that is new either in subject-matter or treatment .

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	, in these letters , which were discovered at Simoncas and in the
Palace Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Madrid	LOCATION	, finds fresh proof of
Gondomar	ORGANIZATION	's agency in securing
Ralegh	ORGANIZATION	's execution .

		Extracts from them and from the other Spanish papers utilized show that '' it was no private revenge , it was no desire to inflict pun - ishment for the injury actually done on the last
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	voyage , that led Gondomar to hound Ralegh to death , for he was practically condemned before he sailed , but to serve as an object lesson to
England	LOCATION	that all
South America	LOCATION	, at least , belonged to
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Much is made of this new material , nearly a fourth of the book being given up to the last
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	voy - age and the Spanish intrigues relating to it .

		Upon the whole , the author , while devoting much space to details of home and court life , has fulfilled the pur - pose of the series by emphasizing
Ralegh	ORGANIZATION	's share in the development of
England	LOCATION	's colonies .

		The sub - ject of the second volume of the series is Sir
Thomas Maitland	PERSON	, a forgotten organizer , though an import - ant contributor to
England	LOCATION	's colonial greatness .

		The author , Mr.
Walter Frewen Lord	PERSON	, speaking of his hero 's family , credits it with '' predatory polit - ical '' instincts , and makes this family characteristic a partial explanation or excuse for his earlier po - litical inconsistencies .


Maitland	PERSON	, indeed , during the first years of his parliamentary experiences , made bitter speeches against colonial expansion and the increase of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		This attitude , it would seem , was assumed that his silence might be bought by the government .

		His political position , how - ever , become totally changed in
1802	DATE	.

		During the debates on the Treaty of
Amiens	LOCATION	, and soon after - ward , he began those administrative labors which constituted his real life-work .

		His success as Gov - ernor of
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	led to his appointment as Governor of
Malta	LOCATION	, carrying with it a general direction of English interests in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		Here his rough and sometimes brutal methods succeeded in giving to
England	LOCATION	more complete control in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	than she had ever exercised , a con - trol which , since that time , has never been recovered .

		Maitland possessed great diplomatic ability as well as strong common sense , and the arbitrariness which gained for him the name of '' King Tom '' was often assumed , or used as a last resort .

		Mr.
Lord	PERSON	, in spite of some vulgarisms , has written a book of great interest ; a book which will give to the American reader a clearer understanding of certain staunch British characteristics , and a more intelligent appre - ciation of the men who have helped to make En - gland 's naval supremacy and her magnificent empire .

		The style is everywhere forcible and the characterization excellent .

		Unfortunately , careless proofreading has resulted in numerous typograph - ical errors in both of these books .

		The influence of Man is a suggestible animal , says Dr. Suggestion in
Boris Sidis	PERSON	, in his recent volume on mental process .

		The p 8yc h o logy of Suggestion '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- ; and this means that he is largely influ - enced , in his opinions , his feelings , and his actions , by other forces than those which make up his own inward individuality .

		Consciously and unconsciously , he receives suggestions from his fellow-men , from his environment , from the constituted order of things which is part of his heredity .

		The psychol - ogy of the mode of action of these varied processes of suggestion is full of interest , and Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	has made a valuable contribution alike to our general knowledge of suggestible conditions and to the proper explanation and statement of the relations of these states to our mental life .

		While the main interest centres in the increased and somewhat ab - normal suggestibility which characterizes the hyp - notic condition , and this volume is therefore mainly concerned with hypnotism , it is well to emphasize the existence of normal suggestibility .

		This is well done by Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	, by special experiments made upon normal persons , and again by considerations of social suggestion of the forces that sway the crowd in a mob .

		The street fakir or the shrewd political speaker may present the normal side of crowd suggestibility ; the contagious panic of fear , the religious epidemics , commercial crises , or intel - lectual fads , represent various types of unusual or abnormal '' crowd '' action , in all of which sugges - tion is an important factor .

		It is of great practical importance that these influences should be fully understood .

		The bulk of the volume is concerned with descriptions and explanations mainly the latter of the various hypnotic conditions , with the hope of shedding light upon the true psychological differences which separate the hypnotic from the normal waking consciousness .

		The solution is found in the theory of a dissociation or disaggregation of groups of mental elements , so that a part of our subconscious self is split off from the rest and acts in apparent separation from our normal personality .

		This subconscious self comes to the surface in all
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359 forms of hypnotic conditions , and produces many startling results .

		The theory is not without its merits , but Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	carries it rather too far .

		There is a point beyond which figures of speech do not aid explanations , and theoretical assumptions inter - fere with rather than promote helpful experimenta - tion .

		Dual personality as an unusual mental phe - nomenon is interesting and worthy of record ; it can not as yet be wisely used as a source of explana - tion of more common conditions .

		This portion of the volume will be too technical for the general reader , and is most likely to be questioned by the professional reader .

		The remainder of the book may be highly commended as an able and interest - ing contribution to the nature of suggestion and its practical importance .

		A book for -
Statham	PERSON	's `` Modern Architecture : A Book for Architects and the public .

		and the Public -LRB- Scribner -RRB- admir - ably expresses its meaning .

		Its appeal is both technical and popular .

		To make such a dual appeal requires not only a most thorough knowledge of both aspects of the subject , but a style capable of con - veying to the minds of the people technicalities in such a way that they can be at least partly under - stood , and to the minds of architects popular views in such wise that they will not seem contemptible and offensive because of simplicity , but useful be - cause of suggestion .

		Such a style , difficult as it is , Mr.
Statham	PERSON	has very happily achieved .

		His book is a most valuable contribution to the literature of architecture , and stands perhaps on a different plane from any of the rest .

		M. Viollet le Due 's '' The Habitations of Man in All Ages '' is some - what on a similar plan , but is far more technical ; and it lacks the great charm of dealing directly , as does Mr.
Statham	PERSON	's book , with the very buildings that we see about us , and with some that are not yet completed .

		Churches and town halls , dwelling - places and the buildings of trade and commerce , even bridges , upon all of these does Mr.
Statham	PERSON	touch rapidly , incisively , with the sureness of the accom - plished artist and the wide knowledge of the man of the world .

		It is fascinating to see how he takes churches and houses and business buildings of our own time , many of which are familiar to us , and applies to them principles of criticism which are derived from the study of architecture in all ages , yet are never pedantic , never dogmatic , but always suggestive , instructive , and certainly helpful to one who would build almost any kind of a building to-day .

		His chapter on the use of iron in modern construction differs so strikingly from Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's views on that subject , that any reader of this book will find the comparison interesting .

		The great English art critic writes almost entirely from the standpoint of the idealist .

		With utilitarianism he has but little to do , and that little against his will .

		In this book there is much stress laid upon the beau - tiful , but fully as much on the practical .

		It would be hard to say which is the most interesting part of the book , but perhaps that which deals with modern church architecture shows Mr.
Statham	PERSON	's peculiar powers better than any other .

		He is broad-minded enough to recognize fully the force of a sentiment which has come to associate Gothic with churches , yet he shows conclusively that the Mediaeval Gothic form is not in all ways suited to the requirements of a building for public worship in modern times .

		In this , as in other chapters , many and varied illus - trations of different methods of treatment are given .

		These illustrations are beautifully executed , and are in themselves enough to make the book most val - uable .

		A handbook for miner * and projector * .

		Mr -
Charles A. Bramble	PERSON	's `` ABC of Mining '' -LRB- Rand ,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ig a p ^ k ^ vo l Qme of 183 pages , offered as a handbook for prospectors for minerals .

		It appears to have been prepared with especial refer - ence to the Klondike , containing detailed instruc - tions as to outfit of tools , clothing , and provisions needed in that inhospitable region , with particular advice as to how one shall march , camp , eat , sleep , prospect , locate and develop a claim , and sell it to a pecunious and unsophisticated syndicate .

		Both the merits and defects of the book indicate the work of the so-called practical man , at home in the field rather than at the desk .

		Suggestions of great vari - ety are presented , drawn evidently from the glean - ings of long experience , and of real service to the novice who searches the wilderness either for land or logs or lodes .

		The methods of testing ores are well detailed , and the difficulties which beset the analyst who works with extemporized means in a rude shack by the Arctic circle are plainly stated and skilfully met .

		On the other hand , the terms and symbols of exact science are often used without sufficient explanation , sometimes without any .

		The tyro who needs the proportion on page 43 must guess that AT means assay ton : for he is not so told .

		The percentages given on page 95 are not obtain - able from the chemical formulae alongside , and the names of two of the substances are of doubtful spelling .

		The author 's ton is usually
2000	DATE	pounds , but in the table on page 75 it is 2240 pounds .

		In the same table the gallon equals 277.46 cubic inches ; on page 178 it equals 231 cubic inches .

		A careful reviser should have observed such errors , and might also have thought it unnecessary to record the dif - ference in color of venous and arterial blood .

		More light is shed on Napoleonic top - ics bv the 8eries of '' New Letters of Napoleon I. '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , comprising the more important of those omitted from the famil - iar collection issued under the auspices of
Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present volume is a full one , though some of the specimens included are mere notelets , and the translating and editing have been carefully done by Lady
Mary Loyd	PERSON	.

		The dates range from Jan -
uary 29 , 1800	DATE	, to
June 19 , 1815	DATE	.

		Among the names of recipients , that of Fouch ^ appears with conspic - 360 THE DIAL -LSB-

		There are many amusing and characteristic personal references .

		For example , the Emperor writes to
Fouche	PERSON	' , from Pulstuck : '' If
M. Chdnier	PERSON	ventures on the smallest sign , let him know I will send him to the Isles of Ste.
Marguerite	PERSON	.

		The time for joking is quite gone by .

		Let him keep quiet .

		That is the only right he possesses .

		Do not allow that jade ,
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	, to come near
Paris	LOCATION	.

		I know she is not far off . ''

		Some months later ,
Madame	ORGANIZATION	comes in for a still fiercer reference , and for an epithet quite un - mentionable to ears polite : '' I am resolved she shall never leave
Geneva	LOCATION	.

		Let her consort , if she chooses , with the friends of Prince
Louis	PERSON	!

		Paying court one day to the great a patriot , a democrat , the next !

		One 's indignation boils over at sight of all the shapes assumed by this , a fright into the bar - gain ! ''

		Quite refreshing , especially just at present , is the following token of the imperial attitude toward mischievous journalism : '' The Journal de V Empire still goes on badly .

		What business has it to insert Mr.
Canning	PERSON	's speech in the
Copenhagen	LOCATION	intelligence ?

		Had the editor that speech before him ?

		Ought he to have inserted it without know - ing that it suited me ?

		That young man is either an ill-disposed person or a fool ; tell him so from me .

		If he does not change his ways , I shall change the editor . ''

		Being annoyed by disturbances at Val - ladolid , the great man promptly directs that thirty of the worst characters in town be arrested and shot ; and he shuts off a doctrinal dispute with the Bishops by announcing , '' I am as much of a theo - logian as they are , and even more . ''

		There is a fair amount of minor information to be got from the volume , and it should not be overlooked by close students of Napoleonic times .

		Tourguenieff No vel T & * illumination is thrown and some of MS on the personality of Tourgue ` nieff French friends .

		^ y ^ ^ p art O f hj g correspondence with his friends among French men of letters which
M. E. Halperine-Kaminsky	PERSON	has edited and
Ethel M. Arnold	PERSON	has translated under the title , '' Tourgue * - nieff and his French Circle '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The larger number of the letters are addressed to
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
George Sand	PERSON	, Daudet , Durand-GreVille , and Zola , and turn for the most part on appointments for meetings , visits , business relations or health , Tour - gudnieffs gout being perhaps the most frequently recurring topic .

		There is now and then an opinion or point of view that is of greater interest to the student of literature , but one can not help feeling that Tourgue ` nieff kept his ideas for his books and for private conversation .

		He was not a letter - writer , but a man who from force of circumstances was obliged frequently to use the mails to commu - nicate with his friends .

		The writer whom we see in these pages is a modest , kindly , helpful man , Gossip of the century .

		On the whole , the letters bear more convincing testi - mony to the kindness of the writer 's heart than to the keenness of his head , and support the editor 's contention that Tourgue ` nieff was wholly innocent of those unkind comments on his French friends which were attributed to him and by which Daudet was so bitterly offended The two handsome volumes entitled '' Social Hours with Celebrities '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , though numbered and indexed as an independent work , really form , as the title-page indicates , the third and fourth volumes of the late Mrs.
W. Pitt Byrne	PERSON	's lively and entertain - ing '' Gossip of the Century . ''

		The editor is Miss
R. H. Rusk	PERSON	, and she has shown due diligence and judgment in reducing to comparative order the won - derful medley of anecdote and chit-chat which her sister , Mrs.
Byrne	PERSON	, had stored up as material for a projected continuation of her popular book .

		We shall not attempt to furnish even a specimen list of Mrs.
Byrne	PERSON	's gallery of celebrities , English and foreign -LRB- she runs the social gamut from kings and prelates to Cartouche -RRB- , still less to illustrate the anecdotal quality of her book by quotations .

		Many of her stories were matter of her own personal recollection , and most of those that were not so bear retelling .

		Now and then an old acquaintance crops up for instance , the venerable story of
Rothschild	ORGANIZATION	's bidding Morny '' take two chairs '' ; but the average is fairly fresh .

		The publishers have been liberal in point of illustrations , which are mainly portraits .

		BRIEFER MEN TION . ''

		Chambers 's Biographical Dictionary '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Messrs.
David Patrick	PERSON	and
Francis Hindes Groome	PERSON	, who also edited '' Chambers 's Encyclopaedia , '' is a volume of one thousand pages , and averages ten biographies to a page .

		The editors are no snobs , for they include in their work '' assassins like Abd-ul-Hamid and
Ravachol	PERSON	, knaves like
Arthur Orton	PERSON	and
Jabes Bal	ORGANIZATION	- four , madmen like Herostratus and
Nietzsche	PERSON	, traitors like Pickle the Spy and
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	, tagrag and bobtail . ''

		There are many good features to commend this most compact and serviceable volume , and the jaunty editorial preface of two pages gives one a pleas - ant impression of what is to follow . ''

		Who 's Who '' is an English reference manual that has seen the light annually for half a century .

		Two years ago it fell into the hands of Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	, who introduced sundry new features , and made it a more acceptable adjunct than ever to the editorial desk .

		The
1898	DATE	volume , now before us , is the fiftieth publication , and the second of Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	's editing .

		The seven thousand brief biographies have been supplied , or at least corrected , by their respective subjects .

		Since they eschew generalities , they may probably be relied upon .

		A sprinkling of American names may be found among the biographies .

Charles Black	PERSON	expect to begin the tenth edition of their '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' in the year
1901	DATE	, the first of the twentieth century .

		Under the title of The Red , White , and Blue , '' Mr.
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	issues a pretty decorated booklet with accurate texts of our four most familiar national songs . ''

		The Flying Islands of the
Night	TIME	, '' a collection of poems , is the title of Volume VI .

		of the edition of Mr.
J. W. Riley	PERSON	's writings , in course of publication by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		Two more volumes in the series of '' Stories by For - eign Authors '' have just been published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The contents are French and German , respectively .

		Messrs.
Lee & Shepard	PERSON	publish '' A History of Our Country , '' by Mr.
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	, being a school text - book of the modern sort , excellently arranged and attractive in presentation .

		An acceptable addition to the series of '' Little Mas - terpieces , '' edited by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, and published by the
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a booklet containing the most remarkable state papers of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, including the '' lost speech '' made at
Bloomington	LOCATION	,
May 29 , 1856	DATE	.

		Recent German text-books are the following : '' Der Praktische Deutsche '' -LRB-
Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
U. J. Beiley	PERSON	;
Lessing	PERSON	's ''
Minna	PERSON	von Barnhelm '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
M. B. Lambert	PERSON	; and '' Die
Freiher	PERSON	- ren von Gemperlein '' with '' Krambambuli '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , being two stories by
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
A. R. Hohlfeld	PERSON	.

		The series of `` Representative English Comedies '' which Professor Gayley is editing , and which the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	are to publish , will extend to five octavo volumes of about 650 pages each , and about forty plays will be included .

		Each play is to have its own editor and apparatus .

		Heywood 's '' Interludes '' will open the series , and '' The School for Scandal '' will close it .

		An examination for the fellowships in classical archae - ology offered by the
American School of Classical Stud	ORGANIZATION	- ies at
Athens	LOCATION	will be held in

		Two fellowships of
8600	DATE	each are provided , besides the Hoppin fellowship of S1000 for which the candidates must be women .

		Professor
B. I. Wheeler	PERSON	, of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	will furnish applicants with all needed infor - mation .

		The death of
Edward Bellamy	PERSON	, on
May 22	DATE	, was not unexpected .

		He had been in declining health for some time , and it long ago became evident that a fatal ter - mination of his illness might not long be delayed .

		Born near
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in
1850	DATE	, he lived to the age of forty-eight .

		He was first a lawyer , then a journalist , and finally a man of letters .

		His early books , `` A Nan - tucket Idyll , '' The Blind Man 's World , '' and '' Dr.
Heidenhoff	PERSON	's Process , '' had no great vogue , although discerning critics recognized their marked literary abil - ity .

		But '' Looking Backward '' -LRB-
1887	DATE	-RRB- was a different matter ; it not only had an enormous sale , but it became a sort of religion with thousands of people having inclin - ations toward socialism .

		It will long be remembered as one of the class of books to which More and
Campanella	PERSON	contributed , and which describe Utopian commonwealths with such vividness of imagination as to create a con - siderable sense of reality .

		Neither this book nor th '' Equality '' of a year ago will bear the tests imposed by economic science , and their essential futility has often been demonstrated .

		But they will continue to appeal to men of warm sympathies for the oppressed , and the ethical glow which they have kindled is perhaps sufficient to compensate for the encouragement they have given to loose thinking and hopeless social experiments .

JOHN C. VAN DYKE	PERSON	, L.H.D. , Art for Art 's Sake , '' Professor of Art at
Rutger 's College	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` First Studies in Natural Appearance '' is the tub-title of this unique volume , in which the author has tried to show in a popular way what things in Nature are beautiful and to explain why they are so .

		It is in this sense a detailed nature - guide , which tells how to look at the material beauties of Nature : the lights , shadows , forms , hues , and atmospheres which go to make up those infinitely varied manifestations .

		Professor Van Dyke has studied the subject for many years and in many lands ; he has brought to bear upon it the keenness of observation , the authoritative culture , the scientific knowledge , and the lucid style , for all of which he is famous ; and it is no wonder that such a combination of the nature-lover , the landscape painter , and the scientific observer should hare produced a volume on Nature illuminating in the extreme and entirely differ - ent from anything yet written .

		Those who already care for the beauties of Nature will find clearer vision and more vital apprecia - tion through reading it ; while to others it will prove a revelation of the every-day wonders which they have hitherto passed by with - out notice .

Navy	ORGANIZATION	, International Law , and other subjects of present importance 386 ARMS AND THE BOOK .

		That the laws are silenced by the clash of arms is one of the oldest of maxims .

		In our own times , it should not be taken too literally , for the fabric of the modern state is so closely woven that parts of it may easily be torn with - out affecting the integrity of the rest .

		Nothing but the most dire of internecine embroilments or the horrors of a widespread invasion could now entail a real suspension of the civil law in the relations of ordinary life .

		A nation like
England	LOCATION	may wage half-a-dozen wars at once in as many parts of the world without ceasing to hold with an even hand the scales of domestic justice , and without shock to the machinery of administration .

		We , likewise , engaged as we are in naval warfare , need not anticipate among its consequences any general slackening of the operations of law , or any irruption of the anar - chical fires that smoulder beneath every civili - zation .

		Our Enceladus is deeply buried under the mountain , and his rumblings offer no just cause for alarm .

		What we have to fear , how - ever , and what makes the present situation of the nation an object of tragic contemplation , is the emergence in our public life of that spirit of impulsive recklessness which , while it does not actually force civilization to take a back - ward step , confronts it with new dangers that it is unprepared to meet , and gives effectual pause to all the tendencies that hitherto have been silently working toward the betterment of our social health .

		Our perspective becomes disarranged ; comparatively unimportant things become so magnified as to fill all the foreground , while matters of the most vital importance to our national welfare are crowded out of sight .

		When the war shall have ended , and we shall have taken stock of its total outcome , we fear that both the narrower interests of our nation and the wider interests of humanity in general will be found to have lost more than they have gained , even in the event of the most complete success that it is possible for us to achieve .

		It is not our present purpose , however , to discuss these broader aspects of the present conflict , but to consider how its turmoil is likely to affect such things as education and the pro- duction of literature .

		To speak first of the 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, subject of education , we are happy to record the fact that some of our most honored leaders of opinion in this field have dared to risk un - popularity for the sake of the truth .

		To advise young men now making their way through col - lege to abandon their studies and take the field , seems a questionable procedure .

		Our imme - diate need for fighters is less urgent than our need , both for the present and the future , of educated men to take part in the counsels of the nation .

		Such men can have no more truly patriotic aim than that of patiently continuing to fit themselves for the battles of the future , the battles that must yet be fought to redeem our civilization from the insidious foes that work within , the bloodless battles which are to be won only by the trained intellect and the tempered character , and which call for a higher form of courage than is needed to face the guns of the enemy in literal warfare .

		As one of our correspondents suggests , the recent utterances of Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	constituted an act of greater bravery than was displayed by Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	when he destroyed the Spanish fleet at
Manila	LOCATION	.

		Magnificent as that feat was , it must take a lower place in the scale of cour - age than the daring of the man who , in these times of popular frenzy , says without regard for the consequences what he believes to be true .

		This is not necessarily an expression of entire agreement with Professor
Norton	PERSON	's views , but it is a tribute of respect to the moral force and the downright manliness that inspired them .

		After all , the present conditions are very dif - ferent from those that obtained during the Civil War .

		Then the question was one of the de - fence of the nation from the forces of armed rebellion ; now the question is of the perform - ance of police duty in a neighboring country .

		The call of duty to the individual citizen was then far more imperative than it can possibly be in the case of the present war , unless condi - tions should arise that are now absolutely un - foreseen .

		With more fighting energy at our disposal than is likely to be needed , there is no lack of patriotism in suggesting that the work of education should be the last of our social activities to be impaired by the call to arms .

		It seems proper that a journal devoted to the interests of literature should say something about the probable or possible effects of the war upon the writing and publishing of books .

		The subject has been much belabored already , and it is not easy to go far beyond the obvious in dealing with it .

		Looking at it from the eco - nomic point of view , it is impossible to deny that the effect of war is to discount the resources of the future and to make the material condi - tions of existence harder for years to come .

		War means much unproductive expenditure , and the withdrawal from industrial pursuits of many capable men .

		It means , in the long run , increased taxation , lower real wages , and the consequent necessity for retrenchment in many directions .

		It means , moreover , an excited and unhealthy condition of the public mind , and a check upon the operation of the silent forces that , in happier times , are ever making for the advance of culture and the growth of a more righteous civilization .

		On the other hand , it is true that these effects , while inevitable in the long run , are sometimes slow to make them - selves felt , and that men may for a time be de - ceived by that feverish quickening of the indus - trial pulse that always accompanies war in its earlier stages .

		For a while , men may fancy themselves much more prosperous than they are , and the piper may not insist upon pay - ment of his bill until it is really long overdue .

		Furthermore , if the war should be brought to an early end , its drain upon the resources of so wealthy a country as ours would not be very serious in its totality , and might be spread over so many years that it would not be felt very severely at any given time .

		In the matter of book-production , no effect is as yet noticeable , and the real test of the mat - ter will come next
autumn	DATE	, when we learn to what extent the plans of publishers , now being made for the coming season , have been inter - fered with .

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' makes the significant statement that '' in another fort - night the early Fall books will begin to be an - nounced in abundance , and it is the consen - sus of opinion among the publishers that in case the war be terminated before
September	DATE	the revival of book writing , book printing , and book reading will be absolutely unprecedented . ''

		We trust that this may prove a prophetic say - ing , and it is an opinion not without much prob - ability .

		In
England	LOCATION	, Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has come forward with a cheerful protest against the notion that war discourages literature , and undoubtedly scores a point when he calls atten - tion to the great literary productivity of his own country during the trying period of the
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic wars .

		That the war will give American readers an increased interest in the literature of warfare is hardly to be doubted , and those of our younger writers who are now gathering material from the actual observation of battles on sea and shore will not be backward in their
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 effort to satisfy the new demand .

		Mr.
Zang	PERSON	- will 's humorous suggestion that the present war was really instigated by the
Century Company	ORGANIZATION	is not without its grain of truth so far as it hints at the probable appetite of our reading public during the next few years , and the flood of mem - oirs , and campaign-books , and novels '' Of moving accidents by flood and field , Of hairbreadth scapes , i ' th ' imminent deadly breach , '' will rise to full tide with the end of the nine - teenth century .

		The habit of reading is one not easily lost , and we have small faith in the pessimistic view that newspaper head-lines in poster type , or even the sensational contents of the popular periodicals , are going to be ac - cepted by future readers as a substitute for books .

		Rather do we believe it true that these devices create a new reading public of their own , from which the category of book-readers is being recruited year by year .

		Just now , perhaps , war-bulletins , and maps of the Spanish posses - sions , and the lucubrations of imaginative news - paper reporters , may suffice a numerous class of readers , but it will not be for long , and the bookseller is not likely to find his occupation gone next year , although he may have to vary his stock in trade in accordance with the changed nature of the demand made upon it by the public .

		ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
June 5 , 1898	DATE	.

		The Whitsuntide holidays are over , and now we are busy arranging for the
summer	DATE	holidays .

		Between now and
September	DATE	very little will be done in the matter of planning new books .

		What is to come is already '' on the stocks , '' and we shall know in good time what to expect .

		A small few of our publishers take the oppor - tunity , at this season , afforded them by little competi - tion , to issue some novels for seaside and holiday read - ing ; but these novels are , as a rule , of but third-rate importance , and hardly worth the mentioning .

		Still , there will be one or two due in the coming month which may attract more than a passing attention .

		Certainly their writers have achieved a fame which excludes them from the '' third-rate '' category .

		I mean '' The Wheel of God , '' by
George Egerton	PERSON	; '' The Yellow Terror , '' by
M. P. Shiel	PERSON	; `` Father Anthony , '' by
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	; `` The Price of a Wife , '' by
John Strange Winter	ORGANIZATION	; and The Monks of the Holy Tear , '' by
Lucas Cleave	PERSON	.

		The death of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	has already brought on a plague of biographers ; but this is but a foretaste of what we may have to endure before the year is out .

		Already one hears of several larger and more important works commissioned , as well as reprints of a few which have already been published .

		At present , the daily press is amusing and interesting us with the regulation remi - niscences and anecdotes .

		Probably we shall have the '' authoritative life '' from one of the members of the family .

		In that case , Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	may reap , as Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	did over the '' Life of Tennyson . ''

		Reprints , and cheap reprints , are the order of the day .

		Our publishers are rivalling each other in the number of copyright works they can issue at sixpence .

		Messrs.
Chatto & Windus	ORGANIZATION	are placing on the market a whole shoal by
Hall Caine	PERSON	,
Clarke Russell	PERSON	,
Ouida	LOCATION	,
Charles Reade	PERSON	, and
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Sampson	PERSON	Low have followed suit with works by
Russell	PERSON	and
Blackmore	PERSON	; and now
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce a new series headed by
Rolf Boldrewood	PERSON	's '' Robbery under Arms , '' and including works by Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	and Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	.

		Of course , the competition in these '' six - pennies '' will soon become as keen as it is in other mat - ters , and the publishers will find that they have worried one another to little purpose .

		After all is said and done , only a certain number of books may be published , since only a definite number can be sold .

		And that number promises to be reached and satisfied very quickly .

		The
New Vagabonds Club	ORGANIZATION	will give a dinner in honor of the founding of the new magazine '' Literature , '' and its guests are to be Mr. and Mrs.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	is to take the chair , and Mr.
Arthur Diosy	PERSON	of the
Japan	LOCATION	Society will act as vice-chairman .

		There are to be speeches galore , and compliments without number .

		Probably this is as it should be .

		The '' New Vagabonds '' are quick to recognize the '' coming man '' or the '' coming event '' ; but both Mr.
Traill	PERSON	and '' Lit - erature '' have already '' arrived . ''

		Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's arrival has found him , many years ago , one of the ablest literary men of his day .

		The arrival of '' Literature '' finds it ably dull and dully able .

		The great point of the dinner , let us hope , will be that it may help the directors of '' Literature '' to arrive at a much-needed stage of self - consciousness , and thus enable them to review their work to see if what has been done was well done ; and how it may be possible to make it still better .

		It seems to me that there is a criticism still waiting for an ex - pression which shall be neither academic nor dilettante , but which shall yet embody the finest qualities of each .

		Such criticism , it goes without saying , demands a very facile , agile , and accomplished critic , one who is mas - ter of the art of measuring instinctively by fixed stand - ards , as well as of expressing the results in a polished and engaging diction .

		If there be many who have the analytic power , they are found wanting in the syn - thetic ; and it is found that the few who have the crea - tive genius have not often the scholarship necessary for making a judgment .

		But there are many who possess both the scholarship and the genius ; the '' Quarterly Review '' is witness to this .

		It is for a journal such as '' Literature '' to afford such men their opportunities ; and it is for such a man as Mr.
Traill	PERSON	to find such men , and to nourish them .

		I think I have already told you of the forthcoming publication of a story of West Indian life by Mr.
Haldane McFall	PERSON	.

		The title of the book is to be '' The Wooings of
Jezebel Pettyfer	PERSON	, '' and the work embodies a vivid picture of the vie intime of the West Indian negroes their ideas , superstitions , and peculiar rela - tions with the white men .

		Mr.
McFall	PERSON	is a step-son of
Madame Sarah Grand	ORGANIZATION	, and has served some time in a Zouave regiment .

		Portions of the story have already appeared in the '' Westminster Gazette . ''

		By the time this reaches you , Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	will have issued , through
Messrs. Smith	PERSON	, Elder ,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, his volume of poems , '' Songs in Action , '' and the same publishers will have subscribed Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, new novel , '' Helbeck of Bannisdale . ''

		Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	's poem of '' The White
Huntsman	PERSON	, '' published in '' The Speaker , '' deserves a place in his volume ; it is one of the finest pieces of the kind ever penned .

		I also ven - ture to express my belief in Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	's poem on
Gladstone	LOCATION	, as being an exquisite tribute to the mem - ory of the great statesman .

		Among other new books of fiction I may announce Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	's '' The Admiral , '' called '' a Nelson novel '' ; Mr.
Shan F. Bullock	PERSON	's `` Paying the Piper '' ; Mr.
Robert Machray	PERSON	's `` Grace O'Malley '' ; Mr.
Harry Lindsay	PERSON	's `` The Jacobite '' ; and Mr.
W. H. Tirebuck	PERSON	's ''
Meg	PERSON	of the Scarlet Coat . ''

		I also hear of a new vol - ume of short stories by
Miss M. E. Wilkins	PERSON	, entitled `` Silence '' ; an English society novel by Mrs.

		DEMOCRACY AND LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		If democratic polity be defined as a government of the people , by the people , and for the people , democratic literature may likewise be defined as a literature of the people , by the people , and for the people .

		The tendency of literature in a democratic civilization to become wholly popular is very evident .

		The author is every - where asked to appeal to the taste of the greatest num - ber , and the standing of authors is more and more determined by the vote of the majority .

		Newspapers and periodicals , aiming at hundreds of thousands of readers , offer to writers of ability large payments , pro- vided they conform to the popular standard ; and pub - lishers more and more demand light and quick circulat - ing books adapted to the popular taste .

		The populace will not rise to the author ; he must come down to them .

		Hence the conscientious litterateur who seeks merely the highest and best expression of his own thought , regard - less of popular demand , is more and more apt to be neglected by democratic civilization .

		The general result of popular pressure on literature is mediocrity and vulgarity .

		The masses read the ten - cent magazine and the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper , and litera - ture as a whole feels deeply the enormous success of these agencies in a general lowering of standard , in a turning to merely superficial and coarse effects .

		The vulgarization of the drama has its parallel in the vul - garization of literature .

		Smartness and cleverness win the day .

		The populace would enslave the author to play the buffoon for them , or to tickle their palate with highly seasoned messes ; and the reward of this service is a wide popularity and a high compensation .

		Too often the author is induced to abandon his ideals and serve the
Philistines	LOCATION	.

		And so , instead of the quiet , patient , leisurely toil by which alone the masterpiece is evolved , the author scratches along at lightning-stroke , striving to keep up with the ever-hastening wave of popularity .

		Thus the writer gives up his individuality and freedom to conform to the crude tastes of a thoughtless public .

		The psychological rationale of this degradation of literature lies primarily in the overweening conceit and presumption of a democracy where every man thinks himself as good as anyone else , and perhaps a little better .

		This vulgar assertion of equality implies a neg - lect and contempt for all that is distinguished and superior , that is , for all high art , literature , morals , and religion .

		Further , the stress of cosmopolitan com - petition in our great centres so harasses and wearies that many have no time nor inclination for cultivating an elevated taste , but seek the easiest diversion in the vau - deville show and the sensational story .

		On the other hand , we must acknowledge there is a vast popular improvement toward culture , as is shown in such enterprises as Chautauqua classes , university extension , etc. .

		And it is interesting to note that our '' department stores '' dispose of Shakespeare and
Emer	PERSON	- son by the carload .

		Certainly every honest attempt , however awkward , to rise above sheer Philistinism is most praiseworthy , and encourages hope so far ; yet it can not be doubted that mere popularism is an increas - ingly powerful factor in controlling the yearly output of literature .

		Now , when the many decide to read only what most easily and directly pleases them , they put an end to the function of the literary critic .

		And it is certainly true that sound and sober criticism of a high type has less and less to do in determining the publication and circu - lation of a book .

		The public pay little heed to the voice of the critic , but they know a good thing when they find it , and eagerly devour it , whether it be good , bad , or indifferent from a strict literary standpoint .

		Hence a thorough-going democracy in literature , that is , the election of writers to the highest rank merely by the votes of the majority , means the extinction of the critic .

		And yet we know that literature , like all art , has been determined , in all its higher forms at least , by the consensus of critics , by the united appreciation of superior minds of special insight and training .

		Now , consensus of specialists is the method of appraisement in all spheres .

		Particularly in science and the practical arts , and in all progressive and advanced civilization , it is the expert that counts ; and hence it must be consid - ered as retrogressive for literature to be determined mainly by the uncultivated and untrained many .

		But the man who neglects the direction of the professional critic in his reading is doing as foolishly as the man who neglects the direction of the oculist as to using his eyes .

		The reader who follows the instructions of
Mathew Arnold	ORGANIZATION	will come out far better than he who follows his own crude tastes .

		In conclusion , we may ask what can be done to save literature in this general lowering of standard in a democratic civilization .

		We see what the endowed presses of universities and societies do for high-grade scientific writings to-day , and we must look to some - thing of this sort to help high-grade literature .

		We see what the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	has done , both positively in setting a high standard , and negatively in its incentive to distinguished litterateurs like Daudet and Zola who never attained its portals .

		We see also what the Salon does for French art , both positively and negatively .

		An Academy is likely to become a clique , but it ever incites to far better work than the merely popular .

		Possibly two competing Academies , one conservative , the other advanced , would best secure the interests and progress of literature as a fine art .

		At least if litterateurs would form definite and general cooperative associations , as do the craftsmen in other fine arts , they would be far less tempted to be dragged down by popularism .

		THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VERY MODERN LITERATURE .

		* The spirit of international interest in litera - ture has grown greatly in the last twenty-five years , and especially , we are inclined to think , in this country .

		It may not be really keener than it was in
the earlier half of the century	DATE	, when '' the French , '' '' the German , '' and '' the Spanish '' were read and studied by many a cultivated circle , but it is certainly more wide - spread .

		It is assumed now that there will be a considerable current curiosity in regard to the work of a Eussian or a Polish novelist , of a Norwegian or a Spanish dramatist , not to speak of whatever new may appear in French , Ger - man , or Italian .

		Indeed , unless a man is going to be satisfied with translations he must be master of all the tongues of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		There is , probably , more of this feeling in
America	LOCATION	than elsewhere , because we Americans travel more than Europeans , and so , although we do not by any means become better linguists , we are apt at least to have a more vigorous curiosity in international matters .

		When you add to this the fact of foreign influence in our own literary work , and the ordinary post - Darwinian desire to see how things came to be as they are , you have reason for a considerable interest in a history of contemporary foreign literature .

		But such a history is not very easy to get at .

		There are histories of French and German literature in the present century , writ - ten by our own scholars .

		There are also some books in French and German ; but , on the whole , one has had to depend largely on collec - tions of essays .

		Under these circumstances ,
M. Georges Pellissier	PERSON	's '' Le Mouvement Lit - teraire au XIXe Siecle '' was a book of great interest , and Mrs.
Brinton	PERSON	has done our reading public a considerable service by translating it .

		We shall not go into a detailed criticism .

		That would seem something of an impertinence .


M. Pellissier	PERSON	is a professor in one of the lycees , and also a writer of consideration on the his - tory of French literature .

		His work has been considered by
M. Bmnetiere	PERSON	, and considered to be , on the whole , good .

		We shall do well , we suspect , instead of taking issue with
M. Pellissier	PERSON	on one or two points where we allow * THK LJTEKABT MOVEMENT IN

		By
Georges Pellissier	PERSON	.

		Authorized Transla - tion by

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		ourselves to differ with him , if we point out some of the reasons why the course of French literature in the present century is of particular interest to readers of English literature .


France	LOCATION	in the present century has occupied rather a singular position so far as art and let - ters are concerned , or to be more accurate , so far as painting and prose are concerned .

		She first absorbed and then gave out .

		At the beginning of the century she was herself power - fully influenced in both respects .

		So far as
England	LOCATION	was concerned , however ,
France	LOCATION	prac - tically did not count ;
Germany	LOCATION	was the foreign influence in letters , and
Rome	LOCATION	in painting .

		Between 1800 and
1850	DATE	no literary influence of importance came from
France	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	, nor was English practice or precept , so far as painting was concerned , disturbed by any fash - ion that might excite the Quartier Latin .

		Now - adays things have changed very much ; we need not do more than mention the influence of French painting at the present day .

		We are at present concerned only with the impression which French prose has made upon English .

		But we think in both directions the most strik - ing indication of the change is to be found in the position of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		In
1860	DATE	Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was at his apogee , so far as popular estimation is concerned , both as to manner and matter .

		Now , his views on painting are utterly condemned by crowds of young artists , and his prose style is already classic .

		We incline to think that if it had not been for the influence of
Paris	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	would still be the great art-critic of the day , and
Stevenson	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	would have produced works very different from those we know .

		The great English influence in art of our time has been the pre-Raphaelite movement , and with the early pre-Raphaelites Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was in sympathy .

		But then came Manet and Zola , and looking back over the forty years we can see that though Realism by no means dis - possessed the natives , it did at least wholly check the free development of pre-Raphaelitism in painting and in prose .

		So far as principle is concerned , the two are about as different as
Tweedledum	LOCATION	and Tweedledee .

		But in the working out , each goes its own way .

		When we speak of French influence , we do not necessarily mean influence of contemporary literature .

		So far as Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	is con - cerned , for instance , he is , in a way , like
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	, but of course not much influ - enced by him ; rather might one say that the two are affected by the same influences .

		As 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, for
Stevenson	PERSON	, it is not very probable that his affectations of vocabulary and figure came from the Des Goncourts ; both probably were influ - enced by the same previous forces .

		Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, however , in his later work , was in all probability as directly the result of Naturalism as need be desired .

		And so far as lesser men are concerned , there are unnumbered examples of those who have absorbed the ideas current in French literature , often without knowing it , and probably more here than even in
England	LOCATION	, where just now native influences have been cropping out .

		But we do not mean to indicate that
France	LOCATION	at the beginning of the century received ideas on art from
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, and that at the end of the century
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	receive ideas on art from
France	LOCATION	.

		That would be but a distant approximation to the truth ; nor , if it were the truth itself , would it be a matter of more than gentle historical interest , a matter of some interest to the French , but not so much to us .

		The real fact would rather seem to be this : that not only at the beginning of the century did
France	LOCATION	gain ideas , but at all times .

		Byron ,
Scott	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the German romanticists at first doubtless , but then later ,
Poe	PERSON	,
Turgenieff	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, during the century
France	LOCATION	has always taken its literary ideas wherever it has found them , just as in another direction she is willing to get whatever there is from the Japanese , the pre - Raphaelites , the German Christian painters .

		And it is not now only that
France	LOCATION	is , or rather has been , an influence .

		In fact , nowadays , when
France	LOCATION	is rather fascinated by this or that Norwegian , German , Englishman , there are who say that it is but the influx again of the very ideas which influenced
Europe	LOCATION	in the days of George Sand ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, and
Dumas	PERSON	fils .

		And this is the important matter , for this is so typical of the culture of our own time .

		Our century has more and more inclined to an amendment of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's dictum so as to read '' the best that is now being thought and said . ''

		More in
France	LOCATION	than in any other country is the cosmopolitan tendency of which we spoke at the beginning of this article effec - tive in literature , and effective in the right direction , namely , toward literary influence and not toward literary imitation .

		So , because it gives an account of a truly modern literature and from a modern standpoint , will this book of
M. Pellissier	PERSON	's be of great interest in this country .

		It enables us to study a very sensi - tive and very active national mind .


M. Pellissier	PERSON	writes this book as a realist .

		Not as a violent naturalist , of course nowadays , but as what we might call a neo-idealist , namely , a realist purged of the grossness of naturalism and quickened by the legacies of romanticism .

		And , naturally , this fact gives a tone to the book .

		But it is hardly more than a tone ; nor would one have expected that it would have been otherwise .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		AN AMERICAN CHANCELLOR OF LAW .

		* Chancellor Kent was a student rather than a man of affairs .

		His life presents so little incident that it furnishes scant materials for a biography .

		His '' Memoirs and Letters , '' col - lected and arranged by his great-grandson ,
William Kent	PERSON	, are published in commemora - tion of the fiftieth anniversary of his death .

		Much of the material consists of memoranda and letters ; the book is therefore largely auto - biographical .

		Kent 's early life affords glimpses of
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	, where he was graduated in
1781	DATE	.

		His college training was supplemented by systematic and laborious courses of reading , which were continued through life .

		This vol - ume contains many notes of this reading .

		The most striking thing about them is that , of all the books read , none , barring
Adam Smith	PERSON	,
Grotius	PERSON	, and possibly Puffendorf , would now be referred to by anyone for any purpose : so rapidly does a literature become obsolete .

		Much of the '' Memoirs '' is devoted to Kent 's charming domestic life , which began with an early marriage and lasted until his death .

		The contested election for the governorship of
New York	LOCATION	, in
1792	DATE	, was the turning-point in Kent 's career .

		The canvassers appointed by the legislature '' counted in ''
Clinton	PERSON	by reject - ing the returns of certain counties .

		Kent 's vig - orous support of
Jay	PERSON	in the Assembly offended his constituents , and he was soon afterward defeated for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		His political prospects seemed for the moment to have been blighted .

		He had , however , gained the favor of
Jay	PERSON	, whose influence probably procured Kent 's ap - pointment to the law lectureship in
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	; and when
Jay	PERSON	afterwards became Governor ,
Kent	PERSON	became a Master in
Chancery	LOCATION	,
Eecorder	PERSON	, and in
1798	DATE	a Judge of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 377 a political to a judicial career , and thus largely did personal influences shape the course of his life .

		When Chief Justice
Lewis	PERSON	became Gov - ernor , he advanced Kent to the vacancy that his own election to the governorship had cre - ated .

		The anecdote is told that
Lewis	PERSON	jokingly said to Kent before the election , '' If you will vote for me , I will make you Chief Justice , if I am elected . ''

		Kent replied , '' No , sir ; though I admire you personally , I utterly detest your political principles . ''

		Nevertheless , he received the appointment .

		In
1814	DATE	Kent was made Chancellor , and continued in this office until
1823	DATE	, when he had reached his sixtieth year , the age limit for judges as the
State Constitu	ORGANIZATION	- tion then stood .

		Upon his retirement from the bench , Chancellor Kent resumed his law lec - tures at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, which he later issued as his '' Commentaries on American Law . ''

		Thus briefly may be told almost the whole story of his life .

		Chancellor
Kent	PERSON	was a strong Federalist , the friend and ardent admirer of
Hamilton	PERSON	and a bitter enemy of
Burr	PERSON	.

		The author of these memoirs tells an anecdote , which he says is current in family traditions , that illustrates the Chancellor 's hatred of
Burr	PERSON	.

		Meeting him one day on the street , after
Burr	PERSON	's return to this country , he exclaimed , '' You are a scoundrel , sir , a scoundrel . ''


Burr	PERSON	, checking his anger and bowing graciously , replied , '' The opinions of the learned Chancellor are entitled to the highest consideration , '' and passed on .

		Kent was emphatically a '' gentleman of the old school . ''

		His political opinions would be very unpopular to-day .

Webster	PERSON	: '' All theories of government that suppose the mass of the people virtuous , and able and will - ing to act virtuously , are plainly Utopian , and will remain so until the Saturnian age . ''

		This is the attitude that caused the downfall of fed - eralism .

		The language of the Chancellor 's let - ters is in the fashion of the first half of the century , and sounds stilted in modern ears .

		His frank opinions of his contemporaries were probably never intended to be made public .

		Of Sumner he wrote in

		Altogether the book is a pleasant one .

		PROBLEMS OF EXCHANGE AXD TRADE .

		* The first volume of Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's Political Economy , which deals with Produc - tion and Distribution , appeared in
1893	DATE	.

		The author then stated that it was his intention to cover the same ground covered by Mill : to re-state , in fact , Mill 's teachings in the light of the criticism of later writers and of the de - velopment of economic theory since Mill 's time .

		Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's second volume is devoted to Exchange ; and , as in the earlier volume , the scope of the work and many of the divis - ions of the subject-matter again bear a general resemblance to Mill .

		At this point , however , the resemblance ends .

		The '' dismal science '' has made some progress since
1848	DATE	, and it is doubtful if Mill would recognize in Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's book a re-statement of the princi - ples laid down in his own work of half a cen - tury ago . ''

		Monopoly values '' and '' quasi - rent s '' would have sounded strange to a man given to reasoning as though competition was the sole regulator of industry , and whose only notion of a rent was that of the unearned incre - ment due to the unequal degrees of productivity of land .

		While not rejecting altogether the marginal - utility theory of value , and while acknowledg - ing the importance of distinguishing between total and final utility , and even admitting that '' it is the marginal utility that determines mar - ginal expenditure , '' Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	urges that these facts are of little importance in a discussion of exchange value .

		Exchange val - ues do not depend on utility alone , and while money measures exchange value , it does not measure the respective utilities secured by the two parties to an exchange .

		Neither marginal utility nor total utility can be measured by a money standard . ''

		We can obtain from the records the precise rates of exchange , but as regards the feelings of the buyers and sellers , or the utilities and disutilities acquired or en - dured through the exchanges , the records are silent . ''

		Utility and exchange value are essen - tially different .

		The central point in our author 's theory of exchange , '' the fundamental principle '' to which he has constant recurrence in his reason - ing , is the proposition that '' relative prices must be adjusted to relative values . ''

		378 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, owing to causes directly affecting this standard , a change from one level of prices to another is made , the change must , '' when equilibrium is restored , leave relative values unaffected , ex - cepting always the relative value of the stand - ard itself . ''

		The relative values are determined by real causes , and money is only the instru - ment by which they are measured .

		Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's own illustration will make this point clear .

		Under normal circum - stances , the average ox is worth more than the average sheep , and '' whatever be the movement in general prices , whether index numbers fall or rise , unless there are particular influences affecting the demand and supply of either , the relative value of the ox and sheep will remain unchanged . ''

		But although the adjustment ulti - mately comes about , during the process of tran - sition from one level of prices to another , some commodities will feel the effect more than oth - ers , and there will thus be a real disturbance in value due to the movement in prices .

		The losses to some lines of business may become very serious during this transition period , and although there is a gain to other individuals , for society as a whole the gains are seldom equal to the losses .

		It is for this reason that '' sta - bility in the standard of value is preferable either to appreciation or depreciation . ''

		In his discussion of the quantity theory of money , the author makes use of the fundamen - tal principle that relative prices adjust them - selves to relative values , to explain why a gen - eral rise of prices caused by an inflation of credit will cause a demand for more metallic money .

		Even where wholesale transactions are effected mainly by credit instruments , the pay - ment of wages and many retail transactions demand '' cash '' in the form of metal or of notes resting on metallic reserves which must be increased with the increase of the notes rest - ing upon them .

		As the rise of general prices , therefore , carries with it a rise in retail prices and wages , more cash will be required .

		The need of more metallic money is also caused by the demands of foreigners who come to sell in the dearest market and must be paid in metal - lic money .

		A third drain on metallic reserves is made by the demand for precious metals for use in the arts ; for the higher wages and profits which follow the rise in prices make possible greater expenditures for ornaments , and these exceptional demands must fall upon the metals used as money in some form .

		The principle that relative prices adjust themselves to relative values applies not only to one country but to all countries taken to - gether if they have commercial and financial connections .

		The particular level of prices , when once all contracts , etc. , have become ad - justed to the level , is a matter of indifference .

		The adjustment , however , made necessary when - ever there is a passage from one level to another '' involves serious practical difficulties and so - cial disturbances . ''

		Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	has long been known as one of the most ardent and able of the advocates of international bimetallism .

		He has supported it not only on theoretical grounds , but in an address delivered in
1887	DATE	at the
Manchester AthenaBum	ORGANIZATION	, and which was published in his '' Money and Monetary Problems , '' he claimed for the scheme that it was '' both advantageous and practicable . ''

		It will therefore be of interest to see how far the changes , economic and polit - ical , which have caused the rapid fall in the price of silver since
1890	DATE	, and which have made gold monometallists out of several prominent bimet - allists , have caused Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	to alter or modify his previous views .

		He seems , indeed , to have been not unaffected by the trend of historical happenings in finance since
1893	DATE	.

		The reasons which make bimetallism desirable appear to him to be as potent now as they were ten years ago ; and it is worth noting that he thinks that stability of prices is not the most '' palpable and obvious '' advantage , if it is the most real one , which would result from the adoption of an international agreement . ''

		For one who sees the effect of a fall in general prices , there are ten thousand who see the effect of a fall in the rate of interest . ''

		But on the grounds of practicability , the author expresses himself more reservedly than in the earlier writing .

		In
1887	DATE	he stated that : '' The only obstacle to general bimetallism is the pub - lic opinion of this country -LSB-
Great Britain	LOCATION	-RSB- , and public opinion is rapidly turning in its favour , simply because the merits of the proposal are every day becoming more widely known and appreciated .

		... It seems , then , that we have only to give our proposals plenty of light and air , to put them before the public in the plainest manner possible , and the details of the method of action will soon be decided . ''

		In the present work , although he continues to assert that '' an agreement on the part of the principal commercial nations to adopt bimetal - lism would in many respects be much more sim - ple than is generally supposed , '' Professor
Nich	PERSON	- olson realizes more fully the difficulties which lie in the way of this agreement , and acknowl - edges that an attempt on the part of banks or of governments to collect gold reserves might 1898 . -RSB-

		379 lead to a drain on the gold reserve of the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	and cause a premium on gold . ''

		Thus the simplicity of an international bimetallic arrangement consequent on the absence of penal causes and the reliance on options may be under certain circumstances a source of weakness . ''

		Added to this difficulty is '' the vis inertia of popular prejudice , '' which objects to tampering with the currency .

		But besides the practical difficulties which stand in the way of interna - tional bimetallism , the author is not firmly con - vinced that the double standard should be adopted to-day .

		Many of the evils caused by the single standard can not now be undone .

		Readjustment is almost complete , and certainty in the standard is of more importance than mere stability of value .

		At the same time , he warns us that '' just as protection met its potato famine , the gold standard may meet its famine , and possibly the financiers of
England	LOCATION	may prefer the adoption of international bimetallism to the adoption of a silver standard by the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The book contains interesting chapters on the development of markets and the historical development of foreign trade , and a more lengthy discussion of the foreign exchanges and the theory of foreign trade .

		There has long been a lack of an English treatise which should give a satisfactory discus - sion of the theory of Exchange ; and while some of the views presented by Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	may not find general acceptance , yet on the whole this second volume of the
Principles of Political Economy	ORGANIZATION	comes nearer to supplying the want than any book written in English which has appeared within the quarter-century .

		tain
James	PERSON	translates with skill and care the sterling account given by
General	ORGANIZATION	von Verdy of the life he led in the Royal headquarters from the beginning to the end of the
Franco	PERSON	- German war , as the chief of a section of the general staff .

		This book , accessible for some time in its own language , is an important contribution to history , revealing as it does the inner detail of that wonderful fighting machine which caught and held the French people as in a vice until they had given up a pair of provinces and a milliard of money .

		It is curious to compare the mobilization of the German army in
1870	DATE	with that of the American troops now going on .

		And the report of the process whereby our farmers and mechanics and clerks are converted into efficient and intelligent soldiers , to be made by the German experts now in this country , will be more curious still .

		Another volume of the series is devoted to '' Indian Frontier Warfare . ''

		This work con - tains , among other things , an account , not too detailed yet fairly exhaustive , of the method adopted by the French Revolutionary general ,
Hoche	LOCATION	, for the pacification of La Vendee : a method which Sir
Frederick Roberts	PERSON	took as his model during the reduction of Burmah in
1886	DATE	, with the most brilliant success .

		Briefly considered , Hoche was confronted with the problem of a small , irregular , and illusive army of insurgents , indigenous to the soil and sus - tained by it , operating over a wide territory the inhabitants of which were amicably disposed to them when not actively enlisted among them .

		Establishing fortified camps , with his small force General Hoche gradually extended the sphere of their influence , taking into temporary possession the cattle of district after district , as well as the principal men among the Vendeans , these being held until all the arms were deliv - ered within the neighborhood .

		Step by step he thus brought a stubborn people under complete subjection , his own force being self-sustaining , though in no way ravaging or desolating the land .

		Nothing could show the incompetence of
Spain	LOCATION	better than the rejection whether through ignorance or design is immaterial by
Campos	PERSON	,
Weyler	PERSON	, and
Blanco	PERSON	successively , of so humane and effective a plan for the extinguish - ment of the Cuban rebellion .

		In
Weyler	PERSON	's case it meant not only the dismissal without trial of a famous method , given new renown after almost a century 's interval by so brilliant an administrator as Sir
Frederick Roberts	PERSON	, but the sacrifice of an innocent population .

		It is not out of place here to commend both 380 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Woolwich and
Sandhurst	LOCATION	, like West Point and

		Yet Grant ,
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	, and other renowned sol - diers , write in admirable English .

		It is certain that these military schools do , on the other hand , inculcate a habit of body and mind , and a tone which we may call professional for lack of a better word , meaning thereby a certain single-heartedness and unity of aim , found in the man of battle as perhaps nowhere else .

		May we not find here another proof that the secret of style lies , after all , in character ?

		* Prof.
H. G. Mitchell	PERSON	in
1893	DATE	edited a valuable essay on Amos , and he now gives us a volume of 263 pages , containing a study of the first twelve chapters of Isaiah .

		This present attempt is made for the popular Bible student .

		The author has indus - triously rounded up all of the chief authorities on these twelve chapters , and has appropriated , though not slavishly , the best that each possessed for his purpose .

		His introductory chapters , on
Isaiah	PERSON	, his times and his prophesies , are rather out of the reach of the ordinary student , because of their density , brevity , and fragmentariness .

		His translation is well done , except that now and then we have some arbitrary handling of the text .

		The commentary , which occupies the larger part of tbe book , is rich ; and full of references to and quotations from the best writers .

		With all this , the author is by no means devoid of independent judgment .

		The norm by which the genuine and the non-genuine passages are separated could not stand the test in the realm of pure literary criticism .

		Wherever there is spe - cial need of philological or archaeological arguments , the author has wisely dropped them to foot-notes .

		Aside from the tendency to arbitrariness , the volume will do valuable service in the popular interpretation of these early chapters of the sublime prophet .


Egypt	LOCATION	is the treasure-house of ancient oriental lore .

		Dr.
Fradenburgh	PERSON	, the author of '' Light from
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' has not shut his eyes , nor written his book out of his inner consciousness .

		The last fifteen years of Egyptian research under the auspices of the Egyptian Exploration Fund have poured count - less treasures on the counters of modern civilization .

		These have been published , with detailed explana - tions , in about twenty quarto and folio volumes , lavishly illustrated with artistic cuts and half-tones of the monuments .

		The expensiveness and inacces - sibility of these books set our author to work to cull out , condense , and put into popular form the best and most startling results revealed in those volumes .

		This popularization , though not the same that any - one else would make , displays quite good judgment in its selection of material and in its presentation for the popular reader .

		Dr.
Charles Roads	PERSON	has found '' The Gospel of Paul '' a pat theme for his little book .

		He has a capital idea , but it is poorly executed .

		The testi - mony of
Paul to Jesus	ORGANIZATION	is classified by him under sixteen heads ; but in these chapters he attempts to give a connected discourse , at the same time omit - ting the source of each paragraph until he reaches the end of the chapter , where he puts all the refer - ences together .

		This is confusing to a reader who always desires to know the sources of his quotations .

		Besides , it does not aid in more closely connecting the different series of quotations .

		The most admir - ably arranged part of the book is the '' Harmony '' on the last few pages , in which we have a conspectus of the four gospels and of
Paul	PERSON	's testimony to
Christ	LOCATION	.

		This is of real value , in spite of the fact that now and then we could not agree with his selection .

		The book entitled '' The Hebrews in
Egypt	LOCATION	and their Exodus '' may be regarded as a game of chess or chance with figures .

		The author became so u thor - oughly disgusted with biblical commentators and the latest historians , whether orthodox or skeptical , '' that he casts them all aside .

		Without prepossession or prejudice , he states that he attempted to unravel the records for himself .

		With
Graetz	PERSON	as his para - gon , and Dr.
Charles S. Robinson	PERSON	in his '' Pharaohs of the Bondage and the Exodus '' as his target , he strikes out into the field .

		He finds no adequate so - lution of the problems of the Exodus until he drops on the genealogies of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Now difficulties vanish , every event in time and place falls into its groove , and we have for the first time a harmonious solution of problems which have puzzled scholars for ages .

		This genealogical solvent even sets aside such conclusions as those of
Naville	ORGANIZATION	and Sayce .

		The

		THE DIAL 381 author admits that he is no Hebraist -LRB- page 308 -RRB- .

		It is noticeable that he frequently says '' if the gen - ealogies be authentic , '' then such and such results follow .

		The book reads as if it were written by fragments .

		We find references to some old out-of - date works , and to some new books of value .

		The volume entitled '' The Bible and Islam '' comprises a body of ten lectures delivered on the
Ely Foundation	ORGANIZATION	to the students of
Union Theolog	LOCATION	- ical Seminary ,
New York City	LOCATION	, by the Rev.
Henry Preserved Smith	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	.

		The Influence of the Old and New Testaments on the religion of Mohammed has engaged some of the foremost Semitic scholars of our day .

		The two schools of interpreters are -LRB- 1 -RRB- those who believe that they find in Judaism the sources of Islamism , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- those who trace it back to Christian sources .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	belongs to the sec - ond school , and in his lectures amply proves his case .

		Of course , we must take into consideration the fact that the Christianity of the sixth and sev - enth centuries , especially in the Arabian peninsula , was a defective type in comparison with that of the second century in
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, or that of the nineteenth century .

		Mohammed knew only the defective type .

		The discussion , then , occupies itself wholly with the Koran and its teachings , and does not touch later phases of Islamism , as the title would imply .

		The author discovers that the Koran teaches '' the unity of God , the certainty of judg - ment , the fact of revelation , God 's will to save men , and good works the fruit of faith . ''

		Mohammed 's `` system is a Judaistic Christianity adapted to Arabic conditions '' -LRB- page 317 -RRB- .

		Because of its large element of truth , we witness its great power over men .

		In a sense , it is a preparation for the larger truths of Christianity , in which men are elevated , ennobled , and enriched , in life and character .

		The author is fully informed on his theme , candid and fair in his estimates , discriminating in his judgment , and clear-cut and plain in style .

		He has presented us with a valuable treatise on the live theme of com - parative religion .

		The first edition of Professor Driver 's '' Intro - duction to the Literature of the Old Testament '' appeared in
1891	DATE	.

		It struck a popular key , and rapidly passed through successive editions .

		The appearance of new literature on the various books and critical questions of the Old Testament required so many supplementary pages and addenda that for this sixth edition the entire book was re-set and re-plated .

		This gave the author an opportunity to revise the text .

		He has notably improved his En - glish expression in some places , and , what is more important , has introduced into the text recent lit - erature on the Old Testament .

		This has also given him an opportunity to discuss in appropriate places the critical positions of the newer exponents .

		The author stands substantially where he did in the first edition .

		He still holds an extremely conservative position as to the validity of the conclusions of arch - aeologists .

		The most valuable feature , however , in this new edition is the full and up-to-date bibliog - raphy of each book .

		The full indices of subjects and scripture texts give the volume handy value to every student .

		To facilitate comparison with earlier editions , the author has inserted the pagination of those editions in bracketed black-faced figures .

		This is now by far the best Old Testament Introduction in the English language .

		In the
year 1891	DATE	, Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	edited a small popular work on '' Who Wrote the Bible ? ''

		He now presents a little book entitled '' Seven Puz - zling Bible Books , '' which aims to supplement the earlier one , in that it discusses more in detail than was possible in the earlier work , the books of Judges ,
Esther	PERSON	, Job ,
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	, Song of Songs ,
Daniel	PERSON	, and
Jonah	PERSON	.

		The author takes his positions , for the most part , in the shelter of the guns of Driver and
Farrar	PERSON	.

		In a careful reading of the discussions , one can not but see the pleadings of an advocate .

		It is the province of such treatments to examine both sides of a ques - tion , and on evidence to reach a conclusion .

		But our author is too ready to specify as difficulties some points which would readily yield to a careful , minute study of the whole situation .

		Again , he is not careful enough in his own statements .

		He assumes an erroneous interpretation -LRB- on page 228 -RRB- , and then files an objection to it .

		On page 230 he says , '' The fifth chapter is a dramatic picture of the downfall of Babylon , '' and immediately strikes at its histor - icity ; while the fact is that there is nothing but a tradition to back up his statement .

		Babylon is not mentioned as the place of that feast .

		Again , the historical character of Belshazzar is assailed , though firmly established by the cuneiform inscriptions of the reign of Nabonidus .

		That he was the king 's son is also definitely known by
Nabonidus	PERSON	' own statement in his annalistic tablet .

		But space for - bids further notice of details .

		Suffice it to say , while this volume presents many truly reasonable , and , among scholars , widely accepted opinions , it also sets forth views and positions which are as yet merely unproved theories and misleading hypoth - eses .

		Mr.
W. D. Crockett	PERSON	has made a new tool for students and readers of the Old Testament , in his `` Harmony of
Samuel	LOCATION	, Kings , and Chronicles . ''

		And yet it is not new , for others have done the same thing .

		The material of these six books is broken into five parts : -LRB- 1 -RRB- until the founding of the monarchy , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the reign of
Saul	PERSON	, -LRB- 3 -RRB- the reign of
David	PERSON	, -LRB- 4 -RRB- the reign of
Solomon	LOCATION	, and -LRB- 5 -RRB- the king - doms of Judah and
Israel	LOCATION	.

		These five divisions are minutely sectioned and subsectioned until the mere outline itself covers forty-five pages .

		The general plan of the work is that adopted in
Stevens	PERSON	's and
Burton	PERSON	's '' Harmony of the Gospels . ''

		The arrange - ment of the first four parts required little more than the scissors-and-paste method .

		But the fifth part , covering the period of the dual kingdom , pre - sents a series of problems equal to the best-trained expert .

		It is just here that Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	's work shows its weakness .

		It is not clear that he follows any known system of chronology .

		This is , of course , 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, a source of embarrassment and dissatisfaction to the reader .

		His disregard of the indisputable chrono - logical evidence of Assyriology is seen in the intro - duction of two interregna , amounting to twenty-nine years , in
Israel	LOCATION	-LRB- pages 295 and 307 -RRB- , and one of eleven years in
Judah	PERSON	-LRB- page 293 -RRB- .

		The Assyrian records describe only one invasion of Sennacherib -LRB- cf. pages 322-24 -RRB- .

		These irregularities errors in chronology are not fatal , but are nevertheless just enough to discount the value of much of the fifth part of the book .

		Otherwise this will be a ser - viceable work .

House of Brunswick	ORGANIZATION	as a convenient halting place .

Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, can only be surmised .

		In the present volume , Mr.

J. K. Laughton	PERSON	, describes , in a concise , straight - forward way , the active work of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	under
James I.	PERSON	,
Charles I.	PERSON	, and the Commonwealth ; and he has succeeded in throwing a ray of fresh light upon the history of the operations of the fleets of the early Stuarts , and upon the events of the first Dutch War .

		The record of Voyages and Discoveries has again fallen to the share of Sir
Clements Mark	PERSON	- ham , whose present contribution comprises two suc - cinct chapters summarizing the work of exploration and discovery from
1603	DATE	to
1649	DATE	, and from
1660	DATE	to
1714	DATE	.

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's quota consists of chapters on the

1649	DATE	, from
1649	DATE	to

1660	DATE	to
1714	DATE	.

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	has also compiled a table of losses of H. M. ships from the Revolution to

		We have already , in an ex - tended notice of Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's opening volume -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Sept. 1 , 1897	DATE	-RRB- indicated the general aim and scope of this important work , which bids fair to satisfactorily fill the need of a comprehensive his - tory of the

		The vol - ume sparkles like a gem with the rays of genius , and is transfused with the poet 's enthusiasm for the ideal for all high aims and enterprises . ''

		If to be an idealist , '' he writes to
Lamartine	PERSON	, '' is to be a radical , then I am one .

		Yes , from every point of view , I understand , I desire , and I hail improvement ... Yes , a society which tolerates misery , a religion which admits hell , a humanity which admits war , appear to me to be a society , a religion , and a hu - manity of the lower order ; and it is towards the society , the religion , and the humanity of a higher world that I aspire : society without kings , humanity without frontiers , religion without sacred books ... These are my principles , and that is why I wrote Les Mis6rables .

		In my view ,
Les Miserables	ORGANIZATION	is simply a book with fraternity for its starting-point and progress for its goal . ''

		That this high faith in the possibilities of progress , in the political ideals born with his century , had its rude shocks and bitter disillusionments , is occasionally manifest .

		In
1859	DATE	Hugo wrote to George Sand : '' Just now I am over - whelmed with grief .

		They have killed
John Brown	PERSON	.

		And it is a republic that has done this !

		Here is a free nation putting to death a liberator !

		Alas !

		my heart is indeed sad .

		The crimes of kings one can understand : a king 's crime has nothing abnormal about it ; but crimes committed by a people are intol - erable to the thinker . ''

		The volume is , we repeat , an eminently characteristic one , containing in satis - fying measure those elements in which its predeces - sor seemed strangely lacking .

		`` The Quest of Happiness '' -LRB-
Rob	PERSON	- erto -RRB- is an unfinished , yet by no means fragmentary , work from the pen of Mr.
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	the last word to his fellows of a serene and thoughtful spirit who , consciously nearing his end as he wrote , wished be - fore departing to shed upon the path of those com - ing after him some guiding rays from the lamp of
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 his own experience .

		Death arrested the hand of the writer , without impairing the value of what he had written .

		Indeed , the very incompleteness of the essay seems in a way to chime with its theme ; since , as Mr.
M. R. F. Gilman	PERSON	, the excellent editor of the book , observes , '' no completed essay upon the incomplete science of human happiness could ever wholly satisfy the insatiate heart of humanity . ''

		Hamerton was penetrated with a strong sense of the essential imperfection and illusiveness of things mundane ; but when he paused as it were upon the threshold of what we venture to term the other world , to look back for a moment over the fading expanse he had traversed , he saw with the clear and comprehensive eye of the traveller who has attained a commanding height that this world , with all its deceptions and positive ills , is furnished with pro- visions for our happiness not a few .

		Much good may be attained and much evil avoided by those who shape their course aright ; and to furnish in some sort a chart for the journey was Mr.
Hamer	PERSON	- ton 's aim in composing the present treatise .

		The volume is the outcome largely of considerations that presented themselves to the mind of the author while meditating the plan of a work to be called '' The Life of the Feelings . '' ''

		The Quest of Happiness '' was begun early in
1891	DATE	, but was laid aside until
1893	DATE	, when Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	resumed work upon it , and had nearly completed it , when a theory of what he believed to be '' The Real Law of Happiness '' dawned upon him , and he at once determined to re-write the book de novo .

		He was still at work on it , feeling , as we have said , that it was to be his final word to his readers , in
November , 1894	DATE	, when he died , leaving the closing portion unfinished .

		The classification of chapters is the work of Mrs. Ham - erton , from whose charming memoir of her husband Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	has drawn the material for the bio - graphical part of his Introduction .

		To the thou - sands of earnest American men and women who , in the face of chilling deprivations and disadvantages , aspiring to the higher standards of thought and living , have drawn cheer and guidance from the lucid pages of Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's '' Intellectual Life , '' we say by all means read too '' The Quest of Hap - piness . ''

		In style it is , as Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	thinks , quite equal if not superior to its two predecessors , '' The Intellectual Life '' and '' Human Intercourse . ''

		Its philosophy , though elevated , is woven of experience , not dreams .

		It deals with the attainable , and does not mock the wayfarer whose feet are glued to earth by bidding him scale the inaccessible heights of the ideal .

		It is a frequent comment , in the com - parison of foreign and American universities , that we give the student much more guidance and direction than is custom - ary abroad .

		We do not merely set him to browse in rich pastures , but take pains to point out the rela - tive values of the available materials .

		As a conse - quence , the text-book has reached a marked devel - opment with us ; and as a successful writer of text-books the American professor is second to none .

		In the
department of Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Ladd	PERSON	has been a strong influence in the dissemination of an intelligent interest in the phenomena of the mental life .

		A larger and a briefer compendium of physiological psychology , a primer , a larger and now a smaller volume on descriptive psychology , have all appeared within a dozen years .

		These volumes are stimulating as well as useful , systematic as well as discriminating , scholarly as well as readily intelligible .

		Professor
Ladd	PERSON	is probably at his best in the description and analysis of the everyday phe - nomena which make up the main portion of oar mental existence , and in this recent volume , '' Out - lines of Descriptive Psychology '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , his material bears the mark of thorough congeniality to the writer .

		It is not markedly original , and could not readily be so ; but it is able , judicious , and interesting .

		The main purpose of the volume may be represented by the following extract ; and it may be added with confidence that this important service of illuminating the significance of common processes the volume will perform with credit . ''

		To the unreflecting mind there appears to be no mystery about our daily use of the senses .

		To such a mind there is no problem of perception .

		Illusions and hallucinations seem indeed interesting .

		The phe - nomena of hypnotism , telepathy , and so-called spirit - ualism , appear profoundly mysterious .

		But just ordinary , everyday seeing , hearing , tasting , smelling , and feeling of things what that is problematical or scientifically interesting can there be in these commonplace conscious states ?

		For the genuine scientific man and the devoted student of science , however , the case is precisely reversed .

		Ordinary perceptions are most interesting , most profoundly mysterious .

		And there is very little doubt that the scientific mastery of these will one day give us the key to all the wonders in which the lovers of the marvellous find their chief delight . ''

		Mr.
W. E. D. Scott	PERSON	's '' Bird Studies '' are issued by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons in a square quarto volume , heavy with the weight of thick calendered paper , fit to receive a perfect imprint of the delicate and intri - cate illustrations with which the book is lavishly furnished .

		Many of these are full-page plates ; all are photographic reproductions of birds and their nests , and really form the distinguishing feature of the work .

		Some , taken from life , are of striking interest , as that of the wood-thrush sitting on her eggs -LRB- page 3 -RRB- ; the series of young bluejays in various stages of growth ; the nests of the
Baltimore	LOCATION	oriole and yellow-winged woodpecker ; with others of sim - ilar quality .

		The attempt to illustrate by photo - graphing bird skins , technically so-called , is unsatis - factory .

		In many cases it would trouble an expert to identify the species thus represented .

		The letter - press of Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's volume comprises brief studies of the land-birds of
Eastern North America	LOCATION	, pre - A sumptuous volume of bird studies .

		384 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, sented in a plain matter-of-fact style .

		In a few instances original observations are embodied which are of value .

		In the arrangement of his matter , the author has chosen to diverge from the customary method of classification , and to group the birds of which he treats somewhat arbitrarily in reference to their favorite localities , '' About the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Along the Highway , '' '' In the Woods , '' '' Fields , '' `` Swamps , '' and by the water-side .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	is an undoubted lover of feathered creatures , and has been their intimate in the haunts which they affect in
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	states .

		He has been careful to make no statement that conflicts with accredited authorities in the domain of ornithology .

		The excitement and the charm which , thirt 7 7 ears a g were acknowledged as attendant upon European travel are very naively confessed to in Mrs.
Sherwood	PERSON	's reminiscences , published under the title of '' Here and There , and Everywhere '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Not all of these are drawn from her initial journey - ings , but all are of one type , giving , unconsciously , the spirit of a younger and perhaps a more senti - mental period than the present .

		Mrs.
Sherwood	PERSON	has seen much of the world , its people , places , and pageantries ; and her recollections are therefore not wanting in raison d'etre .

		It is something , indeed for one with any gift of imagination to have made a first visit to
Venice	LOCATION	when
Venice	LOCATION	was all festal for the Empress Euge ` nie ; it is something to have had friendship with such a man as
Lord Houghton	LOCATION	; and there is , doubtless , more than a little flavor in the thought of having chatted with the critic
Taine	PERSON	and the actor Coquelin , or of having dined with a French officer of the American army who had known Chateaubriand and
Madame Becamier	PERSON	and the daughter of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	.

		Yet old West Point and old
Newport	LOCATION	are recalled with as much pleasure as are
Venice	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	; and no royal person - age though the book leans to royal personages is remembered with more enthusiasm than is Wash - ington Irving , to whom Mrs.
Sherwood	PERSON	once made a morning visit ; or
Bancroft	LOCATION	, whom she knew well ; or that gentle dandy ,
N. P. Willis	PERSON	, whose taste and ability she warmly defends .

		The book is meant to entertain , and must be received in the placid and ingenuous spirit in which it is written ; it is not to be read by any stickler for literary art , or by any of the rigidly unsmiling among critics . ''

		The Story of the Nations '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- series is appreciably enriched by Mr.
Andre * Lebon	PERSON	's '' Modern
France	LOCATION	, '' a lucid summary of French internal his - tory from
1789	DATE	to
1895	DATE	.


M. Lebon	PERSON	is a Member of the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	and a republican of the more conservative sort , but we do not perceive in his book any marked indications of party bias .

		To con - dense into a small volume of 470 pages anything like an adequate outline story of a century so rich in ideas and achievements , in men , changes , and events , as has been the period under discussion in
France	LOCATION	, calls for an unusual turn for literary com - pression , a just sense of proportion , and a clear view of the rationale of events .

		These qualifications
M. Lebon	ORGANIZATION	clearly possesses in due measure .

		On the score of loose or inaccurate statement we have two or three rather serious complaints to enter .

		For instance , it is not a little surprising to find
M. Lebon	PERSON	stating that , on the refusal of
Louis	LOCATION	to sanction the decree against the priests in
1792	DATE	, '' the Girondin Cabinet resigned , '' whereas , as the merest smatterer ought to know , the '' Patriot Ministers , '' instead of resigning , were dismissed -LRB- `` kicked out , '' as Dum - ouriez put it -RRB- by the king an unusually vigorous proceeding on
Louis	ORGANIZATION	's part , which largely led up to the abortive demonstration of
June 20	DATE	.

		Again ,
M. Lebon	PERSON	, in describing the
September	DATE	Massacres , tells us that '' the populace stormed the prisons and mur - dered nearly a thousand aristocrats and priests '' a palpably erroneous account of a familiar event , which we shall not pay our readers the poor com - pliment of correcting .

		On the whole , however ,
M. Lebon	PERSON	has given us a useful and readable epitome of modern French history .

		There are three special chapters on '' Letters , Arts , and Sciences , '' together with a page or so of bibliography .

		Classified tables of names and works prominent in the history of the literary , artistic , and scientific movement in contem - porary
France	LOCATION	are appended , as well as a chrono - logical list of French governments and ministries from
1789	DATE	to
1895	DATE	.

		The volume is acceptably illus - trated , and the translation appears to have been done with care .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` The Bookman Literary Year-Book '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- for
1898	DATE	is the first volume of a new annual publication edited by Mr.
James Macarthur	PERSON	.

		Its contents are mainly reprinted from the monthly issues of '' The Book - man , '' and relate chiefly to '' new and prominent writers of the year , '' a somewhat comprehensive designation , since it is made to include such men as Messrs.
Edward Bellamy	PERSON	,
Marion Crawford	PERSON	,
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, and
Hall Caine	PERSON	.

		The section of '' Obituaries '' includes seven sketches , that of Daudet being the longest .

		Other fea - tures are summaries of the book production of the year , the principal serials and dramatizations of current fic - tion , lists of libraries , book-clubs , and `` best books , '' directions for securing copyright and for correcting proof .

		There are a good many portrait illustrations , but the publication is , on the whole , a somewhat futile one . ''

		Choses et
Gens	PERSON	d'Ame ` rique '' -LRB- LeVy -RRB- is the title of a new volume by
Madame Blanc	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- '' Th .

		Bentzon '' -RRB- .

		Never profound , never critical in any deep sense , this amiable writer is always pleasant to read , and always contrives to find interesting subjects for discussion .

		Of the five papers which make up the present volume , '' La Vie de Famille en Ame ` rique '' is the only strictly social study .

		The other four are reviews of books and their writers , the subjects being
Edward Bellamy	PERSON	,
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, Miss Alice French , and Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	.

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 The study of the latter writer , entitled '' Un Loti Ame ` r - icain '' is singularly sympathetic , and once more illus - trates the truth that prophets must still seek in other countries the honor due them in their own .

		Mr.
Henry E. Chambers	PERSON	, in ''
West Florida	LOCATION	and its Relation to the Historical Cartography of the United States '' -LRB-
Johns Hopkins University Studies	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , clears up the historical mistiness which has so long clung about the outlines of the vanished territory of that name .

		He traces the confusion to the rapidly changing ownership , naming no less than six changes of ownership and juris - diction over the strip in question .

		He carefully outlines and distinguishes between the British , Spanish , and the two American West Floridas .

		He offers proof that the
United States	LOCATION	did not acquire title to land as far east as the Perdido with the purchase of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, but that the claim was an ambitious second thought emanating from
Livingstone	PERSON	, one of the negotiators .

		Recent texts for the study of English include the fol - lowing : Four selected books of Pope 's `` Iliad '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , edited by Mr.
William Tappan	PERSON	;
Kingsley	PERSON	's `` The Water-Babies '' -LRB-

Edna H. Turpin	PERSON	; `` The Shorter Poems of

		The Shorter Poems of
John Milton	PERSON	'' are edited for school nse by Mr.
Andrew J. George	PERSON	, and the book is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
George	PERSON	has included in this edition a number of the Latin poems , and supplied the whole with an extensive body of notes .

		Real bookworms , not metaphorical ones , are the theme of the Rev.
J. F. X. O ` Conor	PERSON	,
S.J.	LOCATION	, in a small volume entitled '' Facts about Bookworms , '' published by Mr.
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	.

		The work is attractively printed , and some of the illustrations are extremely interesting .

		A tasteful edition of the '' Rubaiyfit '' is published by Mr.
William Doxey	PERSON	as the first volume in a new series of reprints to be known as '' The Lark Classics . ''

		The volume is of convenient pocket size , the typography clear and exact , the binding attractive , and the price low .

		Of the numerous war maps , atlases , charts , etc. , lately put on the market , altogether the best and the cheapest is
Messrs. Rand	LOCATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' War Atlas of the World . ''

		This publication consists of sixteen large maps , with marginal statistics , of all parts of the world con - cerned in the present war .

		The
Christian Literature Co.	ORGANIZATION	are making excellent progress in their plan of republishing in cheap form the '' Sacred Books of the East . ''

		We noticed not long ago the appearance of the Upanishads in this acceptable edition , and we now have
Biihler	PERSON	's translation of '' The Sacred Laws of the Aryas , '' two volumes made into one by means of thin paper .

		We note with pleasure the publication , by
Messrs. Methuen & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, of the second edition of '' Ox - ford and its Colleges , '' by Mr.
J. Wells	PERSON	.

		This dainty little book , with its charming illustrations , is of value as a guide to the city which it describes , and of much interest to the general reader on account of its wealth of anecdote and historical fact . ''

		Mr.
Arthur Fairbanks	PERSON	is editor and translator . ''

		With Fire and Sword , '' by Mr.
Henryk Sienkie	PERSON	wicz , now appears in a popular edition at one-half the price hitherto fixed , although in point of mechanical execu - tion it is almost as desirable as the original form of issue .

		The publishers are
Messrs. Little	ORGANIZATION	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and we hope they will find it advisable to give us '' The Deluge '' and '' Pan
Michael	PERSON	'' in the same form .

		On the first of the present month , the firm of
Messrs. Little	ORGANIZATION	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	took possession of practically the entire business carried on for some fifty years by
Messrs. Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter house will continue to publish its editions of Balzac and Moliere in English , but the other books upon its list will be added to the catalogue of the publishers who have thus made two of the most important
Boston	LOCATION	houses into one .

		Professor
Pasqnale Villari	PERSON	's `` Life and Times of
Niccolo Machiavelli	PERSON	, '' as translated by
Madame Linda Villari	PERSON	, is imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons in a new one-volume edition of more than a thousand pages .

		In this form , the work is even more complete than in its four - volume issue of fifteen or twenty years ago .

		The price is very moderate , thus bringing this valuable work within the reach of every student .

		Dr.
William B. Cairns	PERSON	, of the
University of Wiscon	ORGANIZATION	- sin , has published a monograph '' On the Development of American Literature from
1815	DATE	to
1833	DATE	. ''

		Particular attention is given to the periodical literature of the years surveyed , and a great variety of interesting ma - terial has been brought together for convenience of reference .

		We trust that Dr.
Cairns	PERSON	will continue the important work that he has begun in so scholarly a way .
