		After experiencing the benefits of interna - tional copyright for thirteen years -- alsit omen -- the act whereby those benefits were secured to American and English authors alike is now brought up for renewed discussion by no less a IDcrson than Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who , in his ' Editor s Easy Chair ' for
December	DATE	, registers a half - querulous complaint , and suggests , at least , that our reading public has been in some ways a sufferer through the operation of the act in .

		v..-rV ; ; quesiibn .

		The responsibility for the complaint is thrown , in part , upon the shoulders of an anonymous ` friend , ' who is quoted as opining * that the Devil has got hold of the job .

		and turned it to his own ends , ' that ' no solid Eng - lish book is reprinted here , ' that our ' publishers do n't look at a serious b < x -RRB- k , ' and that * no one now reads anything but trash , ' and who closes his screed with the prediction that * we shall relapse into barbarism , and then resort to piracy , which will so improve our minds that we shall again seek a lawful alliance , then degenerate again , and so on and so on . '

		This whimsical plaint evidently appeals to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, for he proceeds on his own account , and in somewhat similar vein , to comment upon the consequences of our ' wanton benevolence ' as expressed in the law of
1891	DATE	.

		Although he does not write in the fashion of one who expects to be taken altogether seriously , he makes some rather positive assertions that chal - lenge inquiry .

		He says , for example , that ' the law has strangely and curiously resulted in alienating the international public which the authors of the two countries chiefly concerned used to enjoy , or rather which used to enjoy them .

		English authors have now less currency in
America	LOCATION	than they had before the passage of the act , and American authors have less cur - rency in
England	LOCATION	, although in the social , politi - cal , and commercial interests there has been so great an affinition of their respective nations . '

		?

		fow assertions like these may without much diflBculty be brought to the test of fact , and that test seems to us to refute the verj - bases of the argument so genially developed by Mr.
Howelk	PERSON	.

		Discussing these strange propositions , ` The Publisher 's Weekly ' says flatly of their pro- pounder that ' his conclusions are as wrong as his premises , and his premises as wrong as his facts . '

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, who , assur - edly , does know the facts , likens the essayist 's reasoning to that which is reputed , according to the old rhyme , to have made a heretic of
Bishop Colenso	ORGANIZATION	. '

		A bishop there was of
Natal	ORGANIZATION	, Who a Zulu did take for a pal ; Said the Zulu : '' Look here .

		Ai n't the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	queer ? ''

		Which converted my
Lord of Natal	ORGANIZATION	. '

		And Mr.
George Piatt Brett	PERSON	, who likewise knows tlie facts , declares that ^ Ir .

		Howells 's article ' fairly bristles with unfounded charges as to the evil effect ^ of international copyright . '

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, Have American authors less currency in Eng - land than they had before the Copyright Act of
1891	DATE	?

		The correspondent whom Mr.
Howells	PERSON	quotes says that ` not even our worst - authors are now popular in
England	LOCATION	, let alone our best ones ... The younger English readers do not know our good authors ; and there is unhappily growing up in the racially and lingually related countries a generation re - ciprocally ignorant of their respective litera - tures . '

		ISTow if this be the case with our authors in the mother-country , it can hardly be a consequence of the act in question , for the simple reason that under that act our authors have practically the same standing that they had before .

		Before its adoption , they might , if they so desired , secure English copy - right under substantially the same conditions at present .

		If more of them noAv do so than formerly , it is because they have become more enterprising in protecting their books from piracy .

		The proverbial stubbornness of facts when confronted with imaginary suppositions is illustrated by Mr.
Brett	PERSON	's reference to the official statistics of our
Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' which prove that , not only has the business of exporting books nearly doubled in tlie last five years , but that the value of books exported from this country is very much greater than the value of books imported into it , ' Mr.
Brett	PERSON	further avers that ' few American books of wide popu - larity fail to appear in special English editions printed abroad Avhich find a public there cer - tainly not smaller than that enjoyed by writers of native origin . '

		And he clinches his case by quoting a fellow-puiblisher to the following effect : ` The records of our sales show that instead of a decrease in the sale of American books in
England	LOCATION	there has been a greater sale of works by Ilnited States authore in that coun - try during the last three years than ever before . '

		So much having been said for one aspect of the question , let us now turn to the other .

		Here .

		of course , the case is somewhat different , for if an English author wishes to obtain copy - right in this country upon our hard conditions , he may do so , whereas previous to 1891 he had no possible protection from our laws .

		Doubt - less , under the act of
1891	DATE	, we have diminished our reading of English literarj ^ rubbish , and substituted therefor the reading of the similar home product .

		But good English books are certainly obtainable in this country at prices that compare favorably with those at what the best American books are put upon the market .

		More than this it is not reasonable to expect .

		There have been a few instances , no doubt , in which important English books have had unusually high prices set upon them in both markets , a proceeding which we may consider unwise , but concerning which we have not the shadow of a right to be dictatorial .

		A com - plaint upon this score is hardly more than a veiled apology for the piratical practices which so shamed us before the law ended them in
1891	DATE	, and which flouted in the most brazen manner the rights of literary property .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	declares it to be ' undoubtedly the case that there has been with copyrighted foreign books a steady tendency to lower prices , ' and in support of this proposition quotes Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	's statement that ` the great benefit of international copyright has been the gradujil decline in the price of standard foreign works . '

		Thus the contention of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and his correspondent is shown to have not a leg uiwn which to stand ; one of the two being completely amputated by the official facts , while the other , if still preserving a semblance of functional activity , is seen to be too crippled for any real usefulness .

		There is absolutely nothing in the considerations adduced which gives cause of legitimate complaint against our national pro- tection of the rights of English authors .

		But there may be seen at many points , just beneath the surface , the crest of the reptile that was scotched in
1891	DATE	after years of effort .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	should not speak of ` the ruthless but kindly rule of the pirate , ' nor should he give voice to any plea based upon the grievance of our being no longer able to get English books by plunder .

		Of course he does not really mean that we ought to withdraw the protec - tion of our law from English writers ; and , des - pite what goes before , Ave have no doubt that his closing sentence , in which he says that we had better keep ' our historical novels and a good conscience ' than get ` the best English fiction and the sense of having robbed the author , ' is the expression of his inmost thought .

		iSTevertheless , we can not but regard as infelici - tous the manner in which he has raised this buried subject of discussion .

		As a matter of fact , our law should be amended for the further protection of English authors , and of the authors of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	countries .

		It still affords inadequate protec - tion for works that have to be translated from foreign tongues , while the provision for double typesetting , inserted at the dictation of a self - ish class interest , remains as a dark blot upon its character .

		As '
The Nation	ORGANIZATION	' remarked many years ago , this provision would be fairly matched by a provision that no foreigner land - ing in the
United States	LOCATION	should be entitled to the protection of the police and the courts until he had purchased , and was actually Avearing , a suit of clothes made by an American tailor .

		Such is the reductio ad ahsurdum to which we are led by a candid examination of this most obnoxious clause in an otherwise commendable piece of legislation .


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		How our curious unwillingness to adopt a policy of thoroughgoing fairness toward foreign authors affects us in the eyes of the international public is strikingly illustrated by our copyright relations with
Japan	LOCATION	, an illustration which Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	uses with telling effect .

		For some years we have been trying to secure a copy - right treaty with that country , but the reply which the statesmen of
Japan	LOCATION	make to our request is , in substance , ' that when our nation has accepted the world 's standard of action in regard to the recognition of literary property , and has become a party to the Convention of
Berne	LOCATION	, no separate treaty between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	will be necessary . '

		In other words , the Asiatic empire accepts the civilized provisions of that Convention and the American commonwealth rejects them !

		It should be a cause for much searching of hearts , because , as Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	justly says , this attitude on our part puts us outside ' the comity of nations ' in the treatment of the rights of authors .

		THE THANKLESS MUSE .

		Again and again the would-be author is warned not to adopt literatiire as a vocation , but , if he must dabble in letters , to let his writ - ing be merel -RCB- - an avocation , a side issue , a harmless relaxation from the stem business of law or medicine or theology or trade .

		It is time a word were uttered on the other side , and a plea made for what Milton aUowed himself to c-all ' the thankless Muse . '

		At the outset it will of course be understood that if one 's ambition is to * get on ' in a worldly sense , if fame and fortune and a numerous j ^ rogeny are the objects of desire , literature is an exceUent calling not to embrace .

		But pre - supposing that one has enough of the ascetic and tlie stoic in his composition to enable him to eat bread and pulse -LRB- if need be -RRB- with a glad heart , literature will be found to offer not merely compensations but real and positive sat - isfactions , and that too , most often , in inverse ratio to the success , commercially considered , that is attained in its pursuit . ''

		Mature is sat - isfied with little , and if she be so , even so am I. ' Thus said
Spinoza	PERSON	, the excommunicated Jew , who , as tradition has it , was forced by IK -RRB- verty to abandon his hope of winning the gifted
Clara Maria	ORGANIZATION	van den Ende and soon became absorbed in a more ideal love-suit -- to immortal truth .

		A more strenuous literary life than his it would be hard to imagine .

		Practicing , from choice as well as from necessity , a rigid economy in daily life , confined somewhat closely to his chamber both bv the oxactinix nature of his studies and by the state of his health , the life-long object of malignant assault and acrimonious abuse from the orthodox , alienated even as a youth from his family and early f riends ; , and in hearty intellectual accord with none of his contem - poraries , this heroic scholar and writer has yet given us his word that his life was a happy one .

		Problems perplexed him until it was easier for him to work at their solution than to refrain ; and in this inward compulsion he found his happiness .

		Counsels of perfection are cheap , and it is not the present writers purpose to indulge in them .

		But the name of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, the devoted seeker and declarer of truth , calls up that of his great English contemporary , who counted it gain to lose his eyesight in penning his ' Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio . '

		Warned by his ph -RCB- -6 ician what he must expect , ^ I would not have listened , '
Milton	PERSON	declares , ' to the voic-e of iEsculapius himself in preference to the sug - gestions of the heavenly monitor within my breast : my resolution was unshaken , though , the alternative was either the loss of my sight or the desertion of my dut -RCB- - ... I resolved , there - fore , to make the short interval of sight which was left me as beneficial as possible to the com - mon weal . '

		Another devoted follower of litera - ture and learning , but one whom we are more inclined to think of as a dry-as-dust gerund - grinder , an arrogant and irritable pedant , than as an acute writer and reasoner of recognized authority , is the younger Scaliger .

		Living in the century preceding that of Spinoza and Mil - ton , and when literature received even less rec - ognition as a reputable calling ,
Joseph Scaliger	PERSON	had the courage to be true to himself .

		When as a young man he was offered an assistant - professorship of law at
Valence	LOCATION	in acknowledg - ment of his remarkable attainments in juris - prudence , he did not for a moment hesitate in liis reply or so much as dream of tu rn ing his back on literature , which he rated above law , medicine , the diurch , or any other calling .

		He had mastered law merely as an instrument of philological inquiry , which was in his eyes not an amusement for the ingenious , but the only means of interpreting ancient records .

		Those who have read -LRB- as all ought to have -RRB-
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's Autobiography , will remem - ber what he says in his closing chapter about the consolations of literature ` It has been with me , ' he writes , ' b. source of continual pleasure , distinct from other pleasures , to evolve new thoughts , and to be in some sort a spectator of the way in which , under pereistent contemplation , they gradually imfolded into completeness .

		There is a keen delight in intel - lectual conquest -- in appropriating a portion of the unlmown and bringing it within the realm of the known . '

		But of mere success as 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, an author in the eyes of the world , he main - tains that when it is achieved it often brings vexations and worries greatly overbalancing the pleasures . '

		Adverse criticisms of utterly unjust kinds frequently pursue the conscientious writer , not only during his period of struggle , but after he has reached his desired position .

		Careless mis-statements and gross misrepresen - tations continually exasperate him ; and if he measures the pains produced by these against the pleasures produced by due appreciation , he is likely to find them in excess . '

		Again he declares : ` Of literary distinction , as of so many other things which men pursue , it may be truly said that the game is not worth the candle ... A transitory emotion of joy may be produced by the first marks of success ; but after a time the continuance of success excites no emotion which rises above the ordinary level , ' In the same vein he writes , ' It is indeed astonishing to what an extent men are deluded into pursuit of the bubble reputation when they have within their reach satisfactions which are much greater . '

		But for him who devotes him - self to serious authorship not for the saJce of reputation or pecuniairy return , there are ample rewards in store , though he must be prepared to practise renunciation .

		Spencer tells us that a writer of this class ' must be content to remain celibate , unless indeed he obtains a wife having adequate means for both , and is content to put himself in the implied position .

		Even then family cares and troubles are likely to prove fatal to his undertakings .

		As was said to me by a scientific friend , who himself knew by experience the effect of domestic worries -- `` Had you married there would have been no system of philosophy . '' '

		But , * after all , ' Spen - cer concludes in his own case , ' my celibate life has probably been the best for me as well as the liest for some unknown other . '

		As
Gibbon	PERSON	solaced himself with a history instead of a wife , so Spencer found compensation in his Synthetic Philosophy for the renounced conjugal joys ; and in the ' weeks , months and years of wretched nights and vacant days ' that made existence for him ' a long-drawn weariness , ' the one thing that supported him and gave him a motive for continuing the struggle was the hope , however faint , of finishing his self - appointed task .

		Having , then , pondered
Spencer	PERSON	's words of counsel and warning , and made up our minds to attempt something in literature to benefit mankind , we are further cautioned by our phil - osopher to be ready to bear losses and priva - tions , and perhaps ridicule .

		For ' ^ adequate appreciation of writings not adapted to satisfy popular desires is long in coming , if it ever comes ; and it comes the more slowly to one who is either not in literary circles , or , being in them , will not descend to literary '' log-rolling '' and other arts by which favourable recognition is often gained .

		Comparative neglect is almost certain to follow one who declines to use influ - ence with reviewei-s , as I can abundantly tes - tify . '

		These quotations may be thought much more deterrent than encoiiraging to the literary aspirant .

		Let them rather nerve him to sterner and loftier endeavor .

		What there is of truth in them can work him no harm .

		It is astonish - ing how little is required , of material resources , to support a life of plain living and high think - ing .

		There is more than a kernel of truth in what
Thoreau	PERSON	, a writer eminently unsuccessful in a business way , says of the poet . '

		The poet is he that hath fat enough , like bears and mar - mots , to suck his claws all winter .

		He hiber - nates in this world and feeds on his own mar - row . '

		Perhaps , therefore , the best fortune one can wish a young writer is to be ever on the eve of a great success , but never quite to attain it ; for with complete success , if such there be , must come disillusion , weariness , and disgust .

		It is only those who take the static and not the dynamic view of life who cherish expectations of gaining this perfectly satisfying success , which always turns out to be simply another name for stagnation and death .

		What is better than to be beckoned forever onward by the ideal that alone gives purpose and meaning to one 's life ? '

		Every motive of a great artist must , in its perfect completion , open the mind , as it were , to perceive a still greater work , which hovers invisibly above it , and fills us , while we laiow not whence it comes , with that ever unsat - isfied curiosity which , after fancying it has exhausted all , feels , at the very moment we turn away , that it has only seen the smallest part . '

		So says
Hermann Grimm	PERSON	in his biog - raphy of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	.

		It is the dimming of this ideal , the blurring and blotting of this beatific vision , that is too often wrought by that success which is measured in terms of popular applause and in dollars and cents .

		From this kind of success we can not too fer - vently pray that our weakness may be delivered .

		The book that wins immediate acclaim with the masses , and large pecuniary returns , is the book an author should devoutly hope never to write .

		The humorous complaint of a popular writer that not one of her offered contributions had ever been rejected by an editor , because she wrote nothing of sufficient depth to be misun - derstood , may well have had a note of sincerity in it .

		Immediate favor is often won at the cost of subsequent neglect .

		The purveyor to the demands of the hour seldom ministers to the needs of the centuries .

		To be sure , it may be
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL said that it is very easy to affect a fine scorn of an unattainable success ; and disparagement of even a transitory renown will inevitably recall a certain ancient fable .

		But it has never been proved that the grapes were not really sour .

		The chances are very many that , could they have been reached , they would have proved somewhat disappointing .

		At the utmost , they would have yielded but a momentar -RCB- - gratifica - tion .

		This much , finally , is certain , that in the success that tempts or forces one to renounce a congenial solitude for the whirl of society , a lettered seclusion for the glare of pub - licity , the silent approval of one 's conscience for the resounding plaudits of the crowd , there lurks a very real danger .


Gregari	PERSON	- ousness , it has been well said , is not conducive to the production of fine literature .

		The gen - erative process will not be exposed to the vidgar gaze ; conception has its mysterious laws , in things of the spirit even more than in those of the body ; and to him alone who will ' strictly meditate the thankless Muse ' shall it be given to effect something praiseworthy in literature , and to learn that the
Muse	PERSON	, thus courted , is not so thankless a mistress after all .

Ebxest W. Clbment	ORGANIZATION	.

		A biography of
Aubrey Thomas de Vere	ORGANIZATION	could hardly fail to be interesting .

		His mind and character were so noble , his personality was so attractive , his friendships among great contemporaries were so numerous , that an account of his life and achievements could hardly fail to charm .

		The present volume , by Mr.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	, is intended to take the place of the second volume of recollections which Mr. , de Vere had planned -LRB- the first appearing in -
1897	DATE	-RRB- , but of which he had at death written practically nothing .

		As his literar -RCB- - executor ^ Mr.
Ward	PERSON	found many of his letters and many passages in his diaries suitable for publication .

		.

		These he has skilfully woven into a readable narrative , in such a way as to let the poet tell his own story and reveal his own mind and tem - perament , at the same time furnishing ' some graphic contemporary descriptions of great men . '

		Many will regret that Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has not given us a fuller biography , based on all of de
Yere	PERSON	's published recollections and on a full collection of his letters .

		Little is here said , for example , of his poetry and of his position among the Victorian singers .

		But we must respect Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's plea that the limit of time prescribed by Mr.
de Vere	PERSON	for the publication of this work rendered a fuller biography impos - sible ; and that the materials presented are , after all , sufficient to give a true picture of the man himself .

		The life of
Aubrey de Vere	ORGANIZATION	was a long and comparatively uneventful one .

		Born in the year before
Waterloo	LOCATION	, he survived all of his famous contemporaries , living through a year of the new century .

		Although he took a keen interest in public affairs , -- the distresses of
Ireland	LOCATION	, the American Civil War , the ec-clesias - tical controversies of the time , -- his life was mainly spent in solitude , in the study of poetry and theology .

		Destined by his father for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, he seems from an early age to have been fond of theological reading and a close student of religious problems .

		The narrative of his gradual change of belief , which led to his reception in
1851	DATE	into the Chtirch of
Rome	LOCATION	, is well told , of course at considerable length and with svmpathetic approval .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	speaks on these matters with no uncertain voice ; yet we must commend his thoroughly broad and liberal treatment of the whole subject • AfBBKY DE Vere .

Jan. 1	DATE	, of the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	and ite tendencies , so ■ far as he touches on them here .

		De Vere 's theological speculations , however , did not remove him entirely from the world of action .

		During the terrible famine of 1846-7 , he devoted himself to energetic work on relief committees , and to that close study of the Irish situation which bore fruit in
1848	DATE	in his * English Misrule and Irish Misdeeds , ' which Lord Manners pronounc-ed ' the most valuabLi contribution to our Irish political literature since the days of
Burke	PERSON	, ' and in almost every passage of which even
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	found ' much to agree with . '

		Throughout his life , his voice and pen were active in the effort to ameliorate the conditions in
Ireland	LOCATION	, and to solve such per - plexing questions as that of adjusting lana difR - culties and of providing for the university edu - cation of larger numbers of
Catholic Irishmen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet
Avhile Aubrey de Vere	ORGANIZATION	won some distinc - tion as an able political thinker , he will be remembered chiefly as a poet .

		Poetry was his real vocation ; and though he failed to win wide recognition , * his devotion to poetry was none the less ardent .

		His failure to win popular favor is explainable on more than one ground .

		One reason he himself gives , in a letter to Pro- fessor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.

		` Literary labour , with the hope of a result , must be a very animating thing !

		For a great many years I have never written anything in prose or verse without the knowledge that , on account of jeal - ousies and animosities , either political or polemical , what I wrote was in fact but a letter to some few friends , known and unknown , to be illustrated by a good deal of abuse , and recalled to my recollec - tion by the printer 's bill .

		I am of the unpopular side , you know , in
England	LOCATION	because I am a Catholic , and in
Ireland	LOCATION	because I am opposed to revolution - ary schemes . '

		Moreover , as
Hutton	PERSON	pointed out to him , his poetry lacked a certain force which might have arrested the ear of a wider public .

		Besides , his choice of Christian themes tended to diminish th
$ volume	MONEY	of that poetry which appealed to a public not always sensible of the real value of Christianity , or at least indifferent to the thoughts and moods of the pietist .

		We must bear in mind , too , that from
1850	DATE	on ,
Tenny	PERSON	- son was the dominant figure in British poetry ; and that , as
Henry Taylor	PERSON	wrote to de Vere in
1850	DATE	, Hhere is hardly ever more than one poet flourishing at a time , as there is only one
Prima Donna	LOCATION	. '

		Yet we venture to believe that with the coming of a day of larger toleration • So little known Is
Aubrey Thomas de Vere	PERSON	that he has often been confused with his father .

		Sir Aubrey de Vere < 1788-1846 -RRB- , author of ` The
Duke of Mercla	ORGANIZATION	, ' ` Julian the Apostate , ' `
Mary Tudor	PERSON	, ' ' The Lamentation of
Ireland	LOCATION	, ' some sonnets , etc. .

		This confusion , for example , exists In the early volumes of
Poole	ORGANIZATION	's Index , and in the English `` Catalogue , 1816-51 ; while in a well-known anthology of - world literature the brief sketch of Sir Aubrey Is embel - liahed with a portrait of his son !

		and broader sympathies , the poetry of
Aubrey de Vere	ORGANIZATION	will be more widely read , and a more appreciative pixblic will concede to him that higher position among the inspired group to which he is justly entitled .

		We have already alluded to the friendships of
Aubrey de Vere	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like
Carlyle	PERSON	, he was a liero - worshipper ; and his heroes were his friends .

		He came early under the spell of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and first came to know the old bard in
London	LOCATION	in
1841	DATE	.

		A letter to his sister gives young de Vere 's impressions , from which we quote a few sentences .

		` He strikes me as the kindest and most simple - hearted old man I know .

		He talks in a manner very peculiar .

		As for duration , it is from the rising up of the sun to the going down of the same .

		As for quality , a sort of thinking aloud , a perpetual purring of satisfaction .

		... I was at first principally struck by the extraordinary purity of his language , and the absolute perfection of his sentences ; but by degrees I came to find a great charm in observing the exquisite balance of his mind , and the train of associations in which his thoughts followed each other ... He is the voice , and Nature the instrument ; and they always keep in perfect tune . '

		In
1842	DATE	, de Vere stayed in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's own house , -- ' the greatest honour , ' he declared , ' of his life . '

		For nearly fifty years following the death of
Wordsworth	PERSON	in
1850	DATE	, he made an annual pilgrimage to the poet 's grave .

		De Vere 's friendship with
Tennyson	PERSON	began in
1841	DATE	or
1842	DATE	.

		His contribution to the
Tenny	PERSON	- son Memoir is of no small importance ; and Mr.
Ward	PERSON	prints some passages from the diaries which give us further interesting pictures of the future poet laureate .

		`
April 17	DATE	-LSB- 1845 -RSB- .

		-- 1 called on
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	, and found him at first much out of spirits .

		He cheered up soon , and read me some beautiful Ele - gies , complaining much of some writer in `` Fraser 's Magazine '' who had spoken of the `` foolish facil - ity '' of Tennysonian poetry , `
April 18	DATE	.

		-- Sat with
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	, who read MS. poetry to
Tom Taylor	PERSON	and me .

		Walked with him to his lawyer 's : came back and listened to the `` University of Women . ''

		... As I went away , he said he would wdllingly bargain for the reputation of Suckling or
Lovelace	PERSON	, and alluded to `` the foolish facility of Tennysonian poetry . ''

		Said he was dreadfully cut up by all he had gone through .

		` Maj - ^ 9 .

Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	came in and smoked his pipe .

		He told us with pleasure of his dinner with
Wordsworth	PERSON	, -- was pleased as well as amused by
Wordsworth	PERSON	saying to him , `` Come , brother bard , to dinner , ' ' and taking his arm ... ' While
Wordsworth	PERSON	was de Vere 's acknowl - edged master in poetry ,
Newman	PERSON	was his guide in religious thought .

		Yet he was never a servile imitator .

		In
1850	DATE	, a year before he became a Catholic , he thus wrote of
Newman	PERSON	, who had joined the Roman communion five years before : ` There is , as you say , occasionally an iron hard -

J. Newman	PERSON	; but in him , as in
Dante	LOCATION	, there is also an exquisite and surpassing sweetness , which makes me regard the hardness as but that tribute of strength and hardihood which accompanies the heroic mind ... Breadth of mind may not be
Newman	PERSON	's peculiar excellence , but that is only one form of greatness out of many .

		The only part of his mind which 1 do not like is that which comes out in his vein of irony . '

		Elsewhere he speaks of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and New - man as *

		The volume abounds in glimpses of other great men , --
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Eichard Monckton Milnes	PERSON	, Sir
Henry Taylor	PERSON	,
Manning	PERSON	,
Vaughan	PERSON	,
Faber	PERSON	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	, -- a group of characters who loom up large on the stage of Victorian politics , literature , and ecclesiastical history , and most of whom were men of remarkable personality .

		Yet not the least of the reader 's reward comes from his more intimate knowledge of a pure and unself - ish life , lived largely in the service of his fel - lows : a poet who here reveals himself most fully as the patriot and the friend .

		* The titanic struggle for predominance in

		sian authorities wherever they have spoken amoimting to solicitude .

		He accepts tacitly the economic interpretation of history up < Hi which
Karl Marx	PERSON	and his followers insist , proving that the vast increase in the population of
Japan	LOCATION	requires an outlet on the Asiatic main - land , and setting forth the right and interests recently acquired by
Japan	LOCATION	in both
Manchuria	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	.

		It is easy to glean from these showings that the very existence of the nation demands a freedom of commercial exchanges which
Russia	LOCATION	is not at all ready to grant since her acquisition of
Manchuria	LOCATION	and her scheming for the control of the Korean government .


Japan	LOCATION	is compelled to import large quantities of food-stuffs for the support of her population , pa \ - ment for which can be made only through the sale of her factory products .

		This requires an open door in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, for
Japan	LOCATION	essen - tially , for the
United States	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	in less degree .

		Korea is , as the Japanese states - man observes , a sword thrust out against
Japan	LOCATION	from the continent , no less than the obvious outlet for the surplus population of the island empire .

		It is also an effectual wedge thrust into the heart of Russian schemes for the stu - pendous theft of
Manchuria	LOCATION	from
China	LOCATION	, a permanent threat against the reactionary com - mercial policy of
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		War was inevitable ; and , the circumstances being what they are , peace seems remote .

		Of the broad causes leading up to hostilities .

		Dr.
Asakawa	PERSON	tells us little not already known .

		But in details and the marshalling of facts he is far fuller than anyone preceding him .

		He is especially solicitous to disavow the imputa - tion of revenge for the iniquiiy of Russian intervention , in company with
France	LOCATION	and Ger - many , after the war with
China	LOCATION	, as a casus belli ; but he shows that this attitude on the part of
Russia	LOCATION	was the means of awakening
Japan	LOCATION	to a sense of the need for warlike preparations .

		As for the diplomatic negotiations immediately preceding the war , he is content with showing how often
Russia	LOCATION	had been successful , even with
Japan	LOCATION	itself , in the same sort of policy , though he does not lay quite the stress needful on Rus - sia 's assumption that
Japan	LOCATION	would not fight -- that ` the bluff would not be called , ' in the language of the card-table , which is often the logic of diplomacy as well .

		The book contains portraits of the statesmen who figure in its pages , and may be taken as a valuable contri - bution to contemporary history from the end of the war with
China	LOCATION	through the diplomatic cor - respondence immediately following the outbreak of hostilities .

		Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	's volume , ` With
Kuroki	PERSON	in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, ' presents a newspaper correspondent 's pictures of Japanese readiness and skill in warfare , confirming the impressions 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, already accepted in this country , and leaving little doubt that the perfection of Japanese dis - cipline and the qualities of Japanese character will enable her armies to maintain their posi - tion against heavy odds , even though the Kus - sians themselves are undergoing a rapid educa - tion in military matters .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	was present at the crossing of the
Yalu River	LOCATION	, and his story closes with the occupation of Liao - Yang : it did not seem possible to him that
Russia	LOCATION	would attempt to retake her position in that city , so he failed tO ' see one of the greatest and most disastrous of Russian repulses .

		At the close of his book , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	indulges somewhat in the dubious game of prophecy , and his most interesting prognostication follo \ \ `` s : ` If after repeated attempts Eussia fails , then from sheer exhaustion on both sides peace will come .

		If she succeeds , the line of least resistance for her by which she can re-establish her prestige in the
East	LOCATION	is to swing in flank upon Peking , while
Germany	LOCATION	at
Kiauchou	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	in southern
China	LOCATION	will not say her nay .

		England and
America	LOCATION	can not run their battleships over the plains of Chi-li .

		The limit of their power is the range of their naval guns , unless they land troops .

		Port
Arthur	PERSON	, with her harbor open to reinforcements and supplies , is an impregnable fortress .

		Eussia can not take
Port Arthur	LOCATION	or
Korea	LOCATION	with
Japan	LOCATION	in command of the sea .

		If
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	are so far negligent of their selfish interests as ever to permit
Japan	LOCATION	to lose com - mand of the sea ,
England	LOCATION	will no longer be a power in the
Far East	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	might as well cede her
Pacific	LOCATION	coast to
Mexico	LOCATION	so far as trade or influence on the eastern shores of the
Pacific	LOCATION	are concerned .

		Eussia 's pride is bitten deep .

		She will have no honest truce with the Anglo-Saxons now .

		Our course is clear . '

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	believes that if
Japan	LOCATION	takes
Harbin	LOCATION	the war will abruptly cease , and that an army of a million men is needed by
Russia	LOCATION	to drive
Japan	LOCATION	back to the Korean frontier .

		His entire book is vividly written , and will be found as informing as it is interesting in its accounts of the actual fighting .

		Numerous reproduced photographs by Mr.
Hare	PERSON	add greatly to its value .

		If Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's book is taken as proof of
Japan	LOCATION	's capabilities in destructive warfare , that of Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	, ' From Tokio through ^ Man - churia with the Japanese , ' is equally important as showing their constructive and conserving qualities .

		As a military surgeon -LRB- attached to our armies in the
Philippines	LOCATION	-RRB- , Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	's chief interest naturally lay in the treatment of the sick and wounded in times of war , as .

		well as the means taken to prevent sickness in the field .

		The testimony he gives regarding
Japan	LOCATION	- ese science and skill shows that remarkable peo - ple to be as far in advance of European and American civilization in these respects as they appear to be in all others that constitute an effective army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	had some interesting experiences in -RSB- \
Ianohuria	LOCATION	, at Che - foo , and in attempting to reach
Port Arthur	LOCATION	; , but prominence is always given to the hospitals and medical systems .

		What he says of the health of the Japanese troops is almost incred - ible in view of the fact that in the war with
Spain	LOCATION	the
United States	LOCATION	lost fourteen soldiers through preventable disease for every one who .

		died in action , and that
Great Britain	LOCATION	in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	in the
Madagascar	LOCATION	expedition , did little better , -- or , rather , did worse .

		Listen ! '

		The medical oflicer -LSB- Japanese -RSB- is omnipresent .

		.

		You will find him in countless places where in an American or British army he has no place .

		He is as much at the front as in the rear .

		He is with the first screen of scouts , with his microscope and chem - icals , testing and labelling wells , so that the army to follow shall drink no contaminated water .

		When the scouts reach a town , he immediately institutes a thorough examination of its sanitary condition , , and if contagion or infection is fount !

		he quaran - tines and places a guard around the dangerous dis - trict .

		Notices are posted , so that the approaching : column is warned , and no soldiers are billeted ' where danger exists . '

		The Japanese rank and file seem to be as much more cleanly , temperate , and moral than the American or British as these last are thaa the Russian -- which is saying a great deal . -RSB-

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	bears witness to the fact that the Japanese armv not only took sanitary care of itself , but of all the filth left by its retreating advei-saries .

		Even flies , he observes , disap - peared , in spite of the swarming myriads gen - erated in Russian squalor and ignorance .

		Small wonder is it that the wards for intestinal and contagious diseases in the Japanese hospitals are empty , and that , as Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	says , ' The loss from preventable disease in the first six months of the terrible conflict with
Russia	LOCATION	will be but a fraction of one per cent , -- this , too , in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, a country notoriously unhealthy . '

		In the Spanish-American war , he notes that ' The mortality from bullets and wounds was 268 , while that from disease reached the appal - ling number of 3,862 , ' on the American side .

		And in regard to the wounded , an even more - remarkable exhibit is made , stated thus : ` Up to
August 1st	DATE	, 9,862 cases had been received at the
Eeserve Hospital	ORGANIZATION	at
Hiroshima	LOCATION	, of whom 6,636 were wounded .

		Of the entire number up to - that time , only 34 had died .

		Up to
July 20th	DATE	, the hospital ship
HaJcuii Maru	ORGANIZATION	alone brought 2,406 casu - alities from the front without losing a case in transit .

		Up to
July 1st	DATE	, 1,105 wounded -- a large proportion of whom were stretcher cases -- were received in the hospitals at Tokio ; none died , and all but one presented favorable prognoses . '

		Such facts as these lend significance to the statement of a distinguished Japanese officer with whom Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	discussed
Russia	LOCATION	's over - whelming numbers . '

		`` Yes ; we are prepared for that ,
Eussia	LOCATION	may be able to place 2,000,000 men in the field .

		We can

		We propose to eliminate disease as a factor .

		Every man who dies in our army must fall on the field of battle .

		In this way we shall neutralize the supe - riority of Russian numbers and stand on a com - paratively equal footing . '' '

		Very suggestively does Dr.

		* In the
Spring of 1904	DATE	, I wrote to a corre - spondent , a well-known student of municipal affairs , that I was about to visit
England	LOCATION	.

		In replying , he desired me to take note of various things , but particularly to notice the terms upon which public franchises were being granted in that country .

		It so happened that in the course of my visit I met Mr.
John Bums	PERSON	, member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and of the
London	LOCATION
County Council	ORGANIZATION	; and to him I referred the question put by my correspondent .

		` Upon what terms are we granting franchises ? '

		said he ; ' upon no terms ! '

		-- and he proceeded to tell me how many cities had taken over their street-cars , their water-works , electric-lighting , and what not .

		!

		Mr.
Bums	PERSON	did not exaggerate ; municipal ownership is in the air of
England	LOCATION	to-day , and as yet there is nothing to show that public con - trol is losing favor .

		When the progressives of the
London	LOCATION
County Council	ORGANIZATION	undertook to gov - ern the metropolis , so far as their powers per - mitted , there were many who predicted disaster .

		The rule of these ` theorists ' has indeed cost money , but it has produced so many blessings that it has won approval , and in spite of abuse the result of each election has been a progressive victory .

		The story of the
London County Coun	LOCATION	- cil , with the visible results of its work , are I think of more significance than anything else in
England	LOCATION	to-day .

		Such a movement naturally and properly pro- duces its own literature .

		If the judgment of contemporary writers is not exactly impartial , it is at all events the fruit of genuine mental pertui ` bation .

		The thing , whether it appears good or bad , has to be dealt with somehow , and no writer doubts that his judgment upon it is of great moment .

		The time for mere disdain , or even for mere opposition , is past .

		The Advantages and
Disadvan	PERSON	- tages Resulting from the Substitution of Representative Bodies for Private Proprietors in the
Management of Industrial Undertakings	ORGANIZATION	.

		By Major
Leonard Darwin	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
CoiduoK Sense of Municipal Trading	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Westminister :
Archibald Constable & Co. , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this spirit , and quite honestly , does Major
Darwin	PERSON	discuss Municipal Trade in a work of 464 pages .

		His book is the result of much research , and is full of interesting information .

		Very conveniently for the reader , the gist of each chapter is summed up in a few sentences , so that it is possible to get at the main argu - ments of the author almost too easily , and the impression gathered from the detailed perusal of the text may be confirmed by the author 's own summary .

		It is stated at the outset that
Munic	ORGANIZATION	- ipal Trade is increasing rapidly , and is more extensively undertaken in
Great Britain	LOCATION	than in any other countr -RCB- * .

		Municipal Trade and Socialism are said to be products of the same forc-es ; but this volume has no immediate con - cern with the latter . '

		The strongest argument in favor of -LSB- Municipal Trade is that companies , looking mainly to making profits , may , in the case of monopolies , ignore questions connected with public health , morals , order , or conve - nience .

		Municipal Trade is , therefore , undoubt - edly right in many cases . '

		However , there is the danger of corruption ; ' a large number of voters being in the pay of the
State	ORGANIZATION	adds greatly to the probability of corruption . '

		Then foUows a detailed discussion of various cases , and a demonstration of the unreliability of statistics , with such statements as these : ' No gain is made by Municipal Trade unless a risk is run .

		.

		.

		Municipal Trade diminishes competition and checks progress ... Looking to the future , a reformed municipal trade should be com - pared with a reformed private trade . '

		The last sentence indicates the main position of the author , which is that private trade may be so reformed and controlled as to serve all public purposes as well or better than municipal trade , with the exception of certain specified under - takings , which it is held shoidd be in public hands .

		On the whole .

		Major
Darwin	PERSON	goes so far that one wonders why he does not go farther .

		The reason is , apparently , that he can not escape from a certain old-fashioned point of view , bom of the orthodox political economy of the last century .

		He can not see things in their broader light , being too much concerned with financial profit-and-loss , and too afraid of ` subsidising ' one class at the expense of the rest , -- as if private trade did not do this on a gigantic scale !

		Consequently his book is hailed in certain quar - ters as a really scientific demonstration of tiie fallacies of modem scwialistic movements ; whereas it actually affords a remarkable illus - tration of the working of the new wine , though it be in old bottles .

		It is impossible in a brief review article to discuss the arguments pro and con , but refer - ence may be made to page 57 , where it is urged 12 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, that sentimental considerations can not be al - lowed to weigh in the balance .

		* A feeling of gratification at their city 's acMeve - ments is felt by most citizens , especially by those possessing the municipal franchise , because the sentiment that they have a share in the ownership and management of large municipal works is agreeable to them , even if that share be excessively small ; and such feelings will create a desire for a further increase in the number of the functions to be performed by municipalities .

		But does this desire , founded on this feeling , indicate in the slightest degree that any such increase in the func - tions performed by the state would be beneficial ?

		... We are considering whether the popularity of Municipal Trade proves it to be intrinsically bene - ficial ; and , as far as popularity depends on mere sentiment , it obviously proves nothing . '

		On the contrary , it seems to me that if a given municipal enterprise -LRB- or anything else -RRB- pro- duces a feeling of gratification in the minds of the citizens , that feeling in itself is an asset of a valuable kind , fairly to be set even against financial loss .

		Major
Darwin	PERSON	must surely admit that even if -LRB- as was not stated -RRB- the gratification of the ' sentiment ' involved some loss of money , the exchange might be no rob - ber -RCB- ^ , or otherwise he shcftild hesitate the next time he buys a ticket to the theatre , or treats himself to any innocent form of amusement .

		The American reader will find the use of the word ' corporation , ' meaning always a public body , rather confusing .

		It will also be recog - nized , in comparing American experiences , that what will succeed in one place may very well fail in another ; in other words , the abilil ^ ^ of any city to develop the best type of govern - ment depends upon the character of its cit - izens .

		At the same time , it has been justly urged that public mismanagement sufficient to create a national scandal may yet be a small thing compared Avith the almost unrecorded fruits of private rapacity , -- a fact which should prevent us from being discouraged by apparent failures .

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's little book on ' The Com - mon Sense of Municipal Trading ' comes like a breath of fresh air to dispel the fogs engendered by fruitless controversy .

		Characteristically , he says in his preface : ' I hope nobody will be deterred from reading this book by the notion that the subject is a dry one .

		It is , on the con - trar -RCB- ' - , one of the most succulent in the whole range of literature . '

		And so it is , in his hands .

		I am sorry I can not quote the whole book ; any mere summary would be inadequate .

		The fol - lowing quotation will best serve to give an idea of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's point of view , and if it is rather longer than is usually permitted in a review , I think no apology is necessary : ` Consider the case of a great dock company .

		Near the docks three institutions are sure to be found : a workhouse , an infirmary , and a police court .

		The loading and unloading of ships is dangerous labor , and to a great extent casual labor , because the ships do not arrive in regular numbers of regular tonnage at regular intervals , nor does the work average itself sufficiently to keep a com - plete stafP regularly employed as porters are at a railway station .

		Numbers of men are taken on and discharged just as they are wanted , at sixpence an hour -LRB- in
London	LOCATION	-RRB- or less .

		This is convenient for the dock company ; but it surrounds the dock with a demoralized , reckless and desperately poor population .

		No human being , however solid his character and careful his training , can loaf at the street corner waiting to be picked up for a chance job without becoming more or less of a vagabond : one sees this even in the artistic professions , where the same evil exists under politer conditions , as unmistakably as in the ranks of casual labor .

		The shareholders and directors do not live near the docks , so this does not affect them personally .

		But the rate payers who do live near the dock are affected very seriously both in person and pocket .

		A visit to the workhouse and a chat with one of the
Poor Law Guardians	ORGANIZATION	will help to explain mat - ters .

		` Into that workhouse every dock laborer can walk at any moment , and , by announcing himself as a destitute person , compel the guardians to house and feed and clothe him at the expense of the rate - payers .

		When he begins to tire of the monotony of `` the able bodied ward '' and its futile labor , he can wait until a ship comes in ; demand his dis - charge ; do a day 's work at the docks ; spend the proceeds in a carouse and a debauch ; and return t & the workhouse next morning , again a destitute per - son .

		This is systematically done at present by num - bers of men who are by no means the least intel - ligent or capable of their class .

		Occasionally the carouse ends in their being taken to the police sta - tion instead of returning immediately to the work - house .

		And if they are unlucky at their work , they may be carried for surgical treatment to the infirm - ary ; for in large docks accidents that require hos - pital treatment occur in busy times at intervals of about fifteen minutes .

		Finally , when they are worn out , they subside into the workhouse permanently as aged paupers until they are buried by the guardians .

		` Now workhouses , infirmaries and police courts can not be maintained for nothing .

		Of late years workhouses have become much more expensive ; in fact the outcry against the increase of the rate , which is being so vigorously used to discredit municipal trading , is due primarily and overwhelm - ingly to Poor Law , and only secondarily to educa - tional and police expenditures , and has actually forced forward those branches of municipal trading which promise contributions out of their profits in relief of the general rate .

		This expenditure out of the rates on the workhouse is part of the cost of poverty and demoralization ; and if these are caused in any district by the employment of casual labor , and its remuneration at less than subsistence rates , then it is clear that a large part of the cost of the casual labor is borne by the ratepayer and not by the dock company .

		The dividends , in fact , come straight out of the ratepayers ' pockets , and are not in any real sense profits at all .

		Thus it is one of the many ironies of the situation that the sacrifices the ratepayer makes to relieve the poor really go largely to subsidize the rich . '

		A municipality can not pick the ratepayer 's pocket in this fashion .

		Transfer the docks to the municipality , and it will not be able to justify a loss at the workhouse and police station by a profit at the docks .

		The ratepayer does not go into th * accounts ; all he knows is whether the total number
1905	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL la of pence in the pound has risen or fallen .

		Conse - quently the municipality , on taking over the docks , wonld be forced to aim in the first instance at organizing its work so as to provide steady perma - nent employment for its laborers at a living wage , even at the cost of being overstaffed on slack days , iintil the difBculty had been solved by new organ - ization and machinery , as such difficulties always are when they can no longer be shirked .

		Under these conditions it is quite possible that the profits made formerly by the dock company might disap - pear ; but if a considerable part of the pauperism and crime of the neighborhood disappeared simulta - neously , the bargain would be a very profitable one indeed for the ratepayers , though the
Times	ORGANIZATION	would abound with letters contrasting the former commer - cial prosperity of the dock company with the present `` indebtedness '' of the municipalitv . '

		* Something of a new departure in the machin - err for a critical study of our native authors is noted in the appearance of three attractive volumes forming the beginning of what is announced as ' The Wampum Library of Amer - ican Literature . '

		When completed , this enter - prise will include ' a series of uniform volumes , each of which shall deal with the development of a single literary species , tracing the evolu - tion of this definite form here in the
United States	LOCATION	, and presenting in chronological sequence typical examples chosen from the writings of American authors .

		The editors of the several volumes provide critical introductions in which they outline the history of the form as it has been evolved in the literature of the world . '

		The entire work is under the editorial super - vision of Prof.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	.

		We regard the plan as timely and useful .

		If the succeed - ing volumes are as capably edited as the three now publishd , the series will prove of great value in the historical study of our literature , and will go far in substantiating the existence of a definite body of compositions to which the distinctive title of American literature may properly and worthily be applied .

		That there is a quality as well as a tone in the work of our own authors notably distinct from that of the British product is emphasized in at least two of the three volumes at hand .

		Xaturally one 's attention is drawn to the critical essays introducing the selections in the several volumes , and to the principles which have directed the choice of the specimens pre - • The Wampt-m Lebraby of Amzbicax Literatche .

		sented .

		Taking first the volume of
Short Sto	ORGANIZATION	- ries we find that Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	has planned , both in his introduction and in Ms illustra - tions , to emphasize development .

		He particu - larly states that it is not his purpose to collect the best American short stories .

		Recognizing this particular literary development as alto - gether an indigenous growth , he notes the appearance of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's `
Berenice	PERSON	' -LRB- 1835 -RRB- as the emergence of the definite form .

		Previous to this date lies the period of experiment .

		Taking Irving 's ' Eip Van
Winkle	PERSON	' as the initial exam - ple , significant in its method of the influence of both
Addison	PERSON	and
Goldsmith	PERSON	, the editor points out that the ' sketch , ' as Irving correctly termed his work , is not identical in form with the t -RCB- - pe which was to be evolved .

		As further specimens of the productions of this tentative period he cites the wonderfully clever tale by
William Austin	PERSON	, entitled '
Peter Rugg	PERSON	, the Missing Man , ' -- strikingly suggestive in its weird symbolism of the maimer of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	; * The French Village , ' by
James Hall	PERSON	; and ` The Inroad of the Xabajo , ' by
Albert Pike	PERSON	.

		The characteristics of the subsequent period - , that in which the perfected type becomes appar - ent , are illustrated by selections from Haw - thorne ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Willis	PERSON	, Mrs.
Kirkland	PERSON	,
Fitz-James O'Brien	PERSON	,
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	, Bay - ard
Taylor	PERSON	,
H. C. Bunner	PERSON	, and
Harold Fred	PERSON	- eric .

		In the short story as conceived by
Poe	PERSON	, Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	finds the perfect model of the new form .

		The definite principles embodied in its construction are recognized as harmonisation , simplification , and gradation . '

		Every detail of setting and style is selected for its architectural fitness ... Its contrivance to further the mood may be seen in the use of a single physical detail as a recurring dominant -LSB- like the refrain so frequent in his verse -RSB- . ' '

		At best he planned a rising edifice of emotional impressions , a work of creative , structural imagination . '

		The defining mark of the short story is thus arrived at : ' Unity of impression through strict unity of form . '

		The particular tale chosen to rep - resent the power of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is * The Fall of the
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	, ' -- a perfect example of this theory in its application .

		Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	, by the way , makes no reference to ' the interest in sit - uation , ' discussed by Mr.
Henry S. Canby	PERSON	in a recent number of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In a condensed and rapid survey of a dozen pages the author completes his introduction with an account of the literary derivation of the short story from the late Greek and Latin romances , through the mediaeval tales and the work of the Italian and French story writers .

		The Dial ,
Sept. 1 , 1904	DATE	.

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, Upon the same general principle -- namely to illustrate the progress of its evolution -- is based the plan of the second volume in the series , which deals with the development of the critical spirit in American literature .

		The essays selected are wholly upon literary themes , and include examples of
Dana	LOCATION	,
Ripley	LOCATION	,
Emer	PERSON	- son ,
Poe	PERSON	,
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Whipple	PERSON	,
Stedman	PERSON	,
Howells	LOCATION	,
Lanier	PERSON	, and
Jamep	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's introduction is particularly illumi - nating , and may fairly be included with the essays which follow , as an illustration of lit - erary insight and critical discrimination .

		The natural law of literary development : first the creative , then the critical period , is modified in the history of American literature by the fact that the native beginnings in this country were the beginnings not of seedlings but of transplanted growths which may develop only after the plants have acquired adaptability to the new environment .

		Thus does the author account for the retardation of the growth both of the creative imagination and of critical per - ception among American writers imtil the open - ing of the nineteenth century .

		* It would be invidious , ' says Mr.
Payne	PERSON	, ' to single out any one -LSB- distinctive writer of that period -RSB- as `` the father of literary criticism '' in
America	LOCATION	.

		Per - haps
Bryant	PERSON	would come as near as any to deserving that title by virtue of the article -LSB- a review of
Brown 's Essay on American Poetry	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- which appeared in
The North American Review	ORGANIZATION	for
1818	DATE	... A better case is made out for
Richard Henry Dana	PERSON	-LRB- 1787-1879 -RRB- , who in the years 1817-19 contributed to that Review a number of lengthy critical studies . '

		We have space to note but few of many interesting details which enliven this essay ; but the care - ful appreciations of
Whipple	PERSON	and
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	shoidd be mentioned .

		Poe is happily , and by no means slightingly , referred to as * the enfant terrible of American criticism . '

		Of Lanier Mr.
Payne	PERSON	remarks , perhaps too mildly , that he ' rather forced the relation between poetry and music , and his scholarly equipment was inadequate to the ambitious task which he set himself in these lecture courses which were afterwards made into books . '

		In the third volume , which treats of Amer - ican familiar verse , Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	has departed slightly from the plan followed by Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	, in that his collection appears to be Hhe first attempt to select the best specimens of familiar verse by American authors only . '

		The editor has l ^ een catholic in his choice , for we find selec - tions apparently as incongruous as the well - worn classic of ' Old
Grimes	PERSON	' and the tender lyric ' Auf Wiedersehen , ' the children 's favorite * 'T was the
Night	ORGANIZATION	before
Christmas	DATE	/ and ' Pan in Wall Street . '

		Yet upon examination , in spite of what at first appears a rather startling catholicity in the admission of selections , this body of verse as a whole gives a coordi - nated and agreeable impression of the sentiment and cleverness of American poets in this par - ticular field .

		Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	in his introduction defines the term Familiar Verse as ' the lyric of commingled sentiment and playfulness which is more generally and more carelessly called vers de societe ' and further indicates as re - quisite elements in its success the characteristics of brevity , brilliancy , and buoyancy .

		Electing to use the more inclusive phrase which he employs in his title , he finds that the familiar verse in English literature , including the work of British and American poets , is as rich as that existing in French literature and probably superior to the latter .

		American familiar verse proves to be ' less often a song of Society itself than is its British rival ; it has a little less of the mere glitter of wit and perhaps a little more of the mellower tenderness of humor .

		It shrinks less from a homely theme ; and it does not so often seek that flashing sharpness of outline , which Praed delighted in and which sometimes suggests fireworks at
midnight	TIME	. '

		Holmes ,
Saxe	PERSON	,
Eugene Field	PERSON	, and
Henry Cuy	PERSON	- ler
Bunner	PERSON	, together with
Stedman	PERSON	and
Aldrich	PERSON	among living poets , are recognized as our most conspicuous masters in this form of verse .

		From the character of these three volumes it is evident that the series when complete will place in their proper proportions the successive steps in the evolution of these distinct literary forms , -- a desirable thing to accomplish , and one not easily achieved in a single volume of cssais .

		The one unfortunate feature in the general plan of the library is the arbitrary restriction which prohibits a selection from any living American writers whose birth has occurred since
December 31 , 1850	DATE	; while selec - tions are included from living authors born before that date , and from others who were born later but who are now dead .

		Inasmuch as the work is planned not to exploit our writers but to illustrate and record the development of our literature in its various forms , this illogi - cal rule must prove imnecessarily embarrassing to the editors and often unfair to the reader .


W. E. SiMONDS	PERSON	.

		` First Aid for the After-Dinner Speaker ' might have been the title of a little book compiled by Mr.
John Home	PERSON	, and more modestly styled by him ` Starting Points . '

		It is a collection of ` sentences sifted from authors of to-day and yesterday , ' and designed to offer a bait to the mind oppressed with the necessity of saying something in public , and having not the least idea how to begin .

		The selec - tion is catholic enough , in all conscience ;
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	jostles with Mr.
J. K. Jerome	PERSON	, and Erasmus with Mr.
John Huntley Skrine	PERSON	-- whoever the gentleman may be .

		As the editor remarks , ' A commonplace to-day may be an archangel 's blast to-morrow . '

		THE DIAL .

		15 Recext Fictiox .

		* One of the noteworthy achievements of mod - em psychology is its demonstration of the part played in shaping human lives by the uncon - scious or sub-conscious factors in the mental pro- cess .

		The poets have known this truth intui - tively for years , but it has remained for the men of science to establish it by experiment .

		■ ` The Undercurrent , ' a new novel by Mr.
Robert • Grant	PERSON	, offers us a concrete illustration of this principle as applied to a special case .

		His theme is the very modem problem of the divorce evil , and he shows us how the undercurrent of emo - tion eventually triumphs over reason , and sweeps away the intellectual objections which stand in the path of a woman 's happiness .

		The situation is subtly handled , and one of the oldest of stories thereby acquires new distinction .

		It is the familiar story of marriage without much thought , the husband 's rapid development into a vulgar Tjrute , and his final desertion of wife and chil - < lren .

		Then the right man appears upon the scene , and the deserted wife is torn by the con - flict between desire and dutj ' .

		The plea of duty is voiced by the representatives of church and society , and their argument convinces her intel - lect , yet it takes only a slight mishap to the man whom she loves to bring about her surrender .

		Although this is a very special case , and the writer does everything in his power to make us feel that considerations of the sanctity of the marriage bond and the interests of society should not be permitted to stand in the way ' of this
Tvoman	PERSON	's happiness , he presents the argument against divorce - with absolute fairness and with so much cogency that it should have prevailed upon a woman of her strength of character , and held her fii-m in her resolution to accept the conse - quences of her ill-considered marriage .

		When impulse gets the better of argument , and she A-ields with the author 's evident approval of her * The Undercurrext .

		action , we become conscious of a ehUling of the moral atmosphere , and a lowering of the heroine in our esteem .

		Of course , this method of dealing with the difficulty is a hundred times more honest than the artificial expedient of the husband 's timely death , which most novelists would find adequate , but we can not help feeling that the writer tips his moral balance the wrong Avay , and that the clergyman 's ` One wearies of this everlasting demand for happiness in this life , ' strikes a deeper note than can be heard in the protestations of the lovers .

		Mr.
Joseph A. Altsheler	PERSON	has deserted the field of warfare for that of present-day journalism and politics , and has given us in his `
Guthrie	PERSON	of the Times ' an interesting and straightforn ` ard story of modem life -- ' a story of success , ' he calls it , and the description is true in more senses than one .

		The scene of the novel is a state un - named , but easily identifiable as
Kentucky	LOCATION	; the hero is a newspaper writer of resource and high ideals ; the heroine is a young woman who has to become re - Americanized after a life spent main - ly abroad .

		How the hero defeats the attempt to impeach a public officer in the interests of a cor - rupt financial enterprise , how the heroine , wit - nessing , admires , and how in the end he wins both her love and an unexpected nomination for Con - gress , are the chief matters which enlist our interest .

		Incidentally , we are given a vivid pic - ture of a
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountain feud , in which the hero plays a part .

		The whole story is told to direct and workmanlike effect , and illustrates not only the practice of journalism as exhibited by the leading figure , but also the characteristic lit - erarj ' qualities which journalism of the better type develops in its professional followers .

		Two novels of the Civil War demand a place in our present selection .

		Mr.
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	's ` Traitor and Loyalist ' is a straight - forward storj ' of blockade-running in the early days of the conflict .

		The scene of operation is the course from
Nassau	LOCATION	to
Wilmington	LOCATION	, and the author has thoroughly informed himself upon the technical details of the trade .

		His hero is the captain of a merchantman who goes into the risky business because it is his father 's business , because that father is a
New York	LOCATION	copperhead of rabid prejudices , and because the son , having been brought up to obey his father 's orders , does not give much thought to the polit - ical and patriotic considerations involved .

		The heroine is the daughter of a secessionist leader of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, and it devolves uf -RRB- on the hero to take her as a passenger when he runs the blockade with his consignment of supplies .

		It is his love for her that eventually opens his eyes to the fact that he is betraying his countrj ' , and her trust in his essential integrity that leads him to give up his trade and give his serxdces to the imperiled nation .

		This he is about to do when the storj - ends .

		The work is cleverly done upon conventional lines , and has both breeziness and \ ` igor .

		`
Manassas	LOCATION	, ' by Mr.
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	, is a very different sort of book , having for its purpose not entertainment , but instruction and the 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan.	DATE	ly revivifying of the intense emotions of the years preceding the Avar .

		It is only fair at the outset of our comment to give warning that it has a hero but no heroine .

		Although absolutely devoid of the love interest , which is not even hinted at in the course of these four hundred pages , it is one of the most thrillingly interesting books of its kind that we have ever read .

		We are not quite sure that it even has a hero , for the leading character , whose life is portrayed for us from childhood up , does not become a man of action until the very close , but is presented to us throughout as one in whose mind and feelings are reflected the interests and the passions of the period of anti-slavery agitation .

		The real drama of the book is the historical clash of the two civilizations , and individuals seem to be made use of only by way of incidental illustration .

		The hero , if we may so call him , is reared upon a
Mississippi	LOCATION	plantation which will eventually fall to him as an inheritance .

		When still a boy , he is taken to
Boston	LOCATION	, and there educated .

		He does not lose sympathy for his own people as a result of this removal , but his eyes are opened to the horrors of slavery , and he realizes that when the struggle comes it will be his duty to stand by the union .

		As the fundamental cause of that struggle slavery is emphasized , and rightly , as all-important .

		In the course of the narrative we are made acquainted with the workings of the Underground Railroad , the mobbing of abolition - ists , the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law in
Boston	LOCATION	and elsewhere , and
John Brown	PERSON	's mad enterprise at
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry .

		We are also given , although not taken to the scene , vivid accounts of the border warfare in
Kansas	LOCATION	, of the great slavery debates in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, of the dastardly assault upon Sumner , and nearly every other matter affecting the slavery issue during the fifties .

		In fact , the reader , if he stops to think at all , must soon realize that what he is reading is not fiction at all , but a consecutive and almost documentary history of the period .

		It is his - tory written with warmth and an eye for dra - matic effect , to be sure , but it is nevertheless essentially history .

		It is the author 's triumph that his readers are not likely to think very much about such things , so enthralling has he made his pages .

		It is only near the close that Sumter is fired upon , and the war begun .

		Then we get a few impressionist snap-shots of the excitement in both sections , a hurried account of the scenes of confusion in and about
Washington	LOCATION	, a glimpse of the new President as he seemed in those first days of trial to the men who had been too bewil - dered to take his true measure , and finally , the rout at Bull Run from the standpoint of the hero , a private in his first engagement .

		This battle episode suggests ` The Red Badge of Courage , ' only it seems to be better done .

		And here , hav - ing brought us just over the verge of actual con - flict , the book ends -- ends where most novels of the Civil War begin .

		It is a work deserving of very high praise .

		It does not treat its histoi-y as a spectacle simply , but has the rare quality of arousing our emotions almost to the pitch of those that made the war inevitable , and of enabling us of a later generation to feel the passion of those great past days when conscience counted for something in our polities , and Avhen a worthy cause evoked our noblest national energies .

		A fastidious man of letters , whose life has - never been ruffled by anything more serious than the clash of conversational wits or the contro - versies of the critical pen , is one day crossing the
Bay of San Francisco	LOCATION	on a ferry-boat .

		The Bay is .

		foggy , but he has no thought of danger until the ferry is suddenly struck amidships and speedily sunk .

		The cause of the mishap is an outward-bound sealer , and upon this craft the victim of the collision finds himself after he is restored to consciousness .

		He then discovers to his consternation that he is in for a voyage of several months to the coast of
Japan	LOCATION	and Kams - chatka , and that he has ceased to be even a free agent .

		The captain of the sealer , it appears , is a brute of violent disposition who is a law imto himself , and this autocrat decrees that the new passenger shall sign as cabin-boy , ` for the good of his soul , ' as the Sea -
Wolf	PERSON	grimly remarks .

		Since this person has a rough and ready way of enforcing his arguments by a free use of his fists , , and since the newlj-rescued man has then and there a convincing object-lesson of the validity of this method of reasoning , the views are per - force accepted , and he faces for the first time - in his career the realities of life .

		From this jDoint on , the book becomes a tale of the sea , and of the daily routine of a floating hell .

		The Sea -
Wolf	PERSON	is the incarnation of sheer animalism , the vigor of his physical frame matched by the strength of his will , and capable of every sort of brutality .

		He is also -- and this is the curious thing about him -- by way of being a philosopher ; he reads
Spencer and Browning	PERSON	, and interprets them by the light of a vigorous and unsophis - ticated intellect .

		Of ethical obligations he has no notion whatever , being a very startling em - bodiment of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's ideal of the
Uehermensch	LOCATION	.

		Nothing like a scruple is ever known to him , and he is in equal measure hated and feared by his men .

		Under this rough tutelage the man of let - ters turned ship 's drudge learns many things not set down in the books , and develops a strength and a resourcefulness that he would othenvise never have known .

		Thus the story becomes essen - tially an account of the development of charac - ter under extraordinary conditions , and its aspect as a narrative of adventure is obscured by its aspect as a psychological study .

		It is not a pleasant tale to read -- it is too strongly seasoned to be that , -- but it acquires a certain fascination in the course of its telling , and fairly grips the attention in its culminating passages .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's technique becomes , if anything , .

		more refined with each new work that he puts forth , but his substance grows thinner than ever .

		A forced and mechanical invention marks the plot of ` Whosoever Shall Offend , ' and the charac - ters are but slightly modified variations of the types that he has been fashioning for the past score of years .

		The new novel is concerned , with a polished villain , who murders his Avife and seeks to murder his stepson , all with the sordid object
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , IT of gaining their fortune for himself , and in the end is trapped and punished according to his deserts .

		It is all very cleverly managed , but the interest is of the mildest .

		In ` The Farm of the Dagger / Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	resorts to the scene , the period , and even the special theme of his ` American Pris - oner . '

		Once more we are taken to rural
Dart	PERSON	- moor in the
early nineteenth century	DATE	, and once more we are made acquainted with the grim walls of the Prince Town prison .

		By way of a variation , however , the hero is not an American prisoner but an English gentleman , although one of our captured fellow-eountrj-men plays an important part in the story .

		The `` substance of the book is a
Montague	ORGANIZATION	and Capulet feud imder English skies , ending , unlike that of
Terona	LOCATION	, with the happy union of the lovers .

		The parents are sacrificed instead , which is much more satisfac - tory .

		Ml '' .


Hall Caine	PERSON	has chosen to entitle his new novel , ` The Prodigal Son . '

		The scene is Ice - land , used by the author as the stage-setting for one of his earlier novels .

		His ` Prodigal Son ' is a despicably weak person , pleasure-loving , and incapable of resisting temptation .

		He becomes morally responsible for his wife 's death through neglect coupled with infatuation for another woman .

		He goes abroad , breaks the most solemn pledges , becomes a gambler and a cheat , and forges his father 's name .

		But with all these sins to his account , he develops into a musical genius , assumes a new name , and wins both wealth and fame .

		Returning to
Iceland	LOCATION	, he becomes fully acquainted with the misery he has wrought , and makes what tardy reparation is still within his power .

		The story shows a confused sense of moral values , and fairly reeks with cheap sen - timentality .

		Its style is common and its situa - tions theatrical .

		Altogether it is a poorer per - formance than was to be expected even from the author of ` The Christian ' and ` The Eter - nal aty . '

		The new novel of Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	is called ` The Betrayal . '

		Its hero is an impe - cunious pedagogue of refined sensibilities but imfortunate parentage .

		Its heroine is the daugh - ter of a noble lord whose chief public interest is the development of a plan for the defence of the nation against foreign invasion .

		This plan requires the utmost secrecy , and the committee in charge hit upon the obscure pedagogue as the proper person to act as their secretary .

		He is scrupulously honest and painstaking , but despite his best efforts the plans of the committee some - how leak out and are sold to the enemy .

		The mystery lasts a long while , and is finally solved by the revelation that the duke who is the head of the organization is the traitor , having fallen into a financial pit , and seeking to recoup his fortunes b ^ ' these infamous means .

		In the end , his treachery discovered , he conveniently com - mits suicide , the hero and heroine marry , and the skies are once more clear .

		The story is ani - mated and exciting , and the leading characters are limned with a considerable degree of skill .

		• The Closed Book , ' by Mr.
William Le Queux	PERSON	, is undeniably a ` shocker , ' but it is fairly well wi-itten , and the plot is striking .

		It concerns two buried treasures -- the jewels of
Luerezia Borgia	PERSON	and the plate of
Crowland Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		A mediaeval manuscript written by an Italian monk discloses the secret of both , and nearly puts an end to the lives of several people , its leaves being impreg - nated w-ith the mysterious poison of the
Borgias	LOCATION	.

		The quest for the treasure is pursued by two rival sets of discoverers , which makes the story very exciting .

		The main lines of the narrative are worked out to a tolerably satisfactory conclusion , but several threads that promise to be important are dropped during the process , and we are left in dark perplexity concerning the connection with the plot of several of the secondary figures .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's novels are apt to be loose-jointed , and based upon somewhat unnatural situations .

		The leading character of ` The Truants ' is an Englishman who , having done nothing in particu - lar to justify his existence , is afraid that his wife will come to feel contempt for him , and so resorts to the device of leaving her until he shall have achieved fortune or reputation upon the score of his personal merits .

		His first effort is made in
America	LOCATION	, where he falls among thieves .

		Then he ships as a common sailor on a North Sea trawler , and gets a taste of rough life .

		But this does not seem to lead to anything , so he finally enlists in the French Foreign Legion , does hard service in
Algiers	LOCATION	, and wins distinction for his bravery .

		The real fact of the matter is that he should not have left his wife at all , for she is of the kind that is sure to seek consolation -- a trait of which he was fairly warned before he went away .

		When he learns , in his African camp , that she is on the point of finding and accepting consolation for his desertion , he becomes a deserter himself , escapes through
Morocco	LOCATION	to the coast , and returns to
Europe	LOCATION	just in time to thwart the villain who has designs on his honor .

		There is a good deal of variety about this romance , but it is not a yeiy oiganic piece of work .

		The best part of it is that devoted to the
Foreign Legion	ORGANIZATION	, of which the author seems to have made a special study .

		It is fairly new ground for the average reader , in spite of that ` soldier of the legion ' who ` lay dying at
Algiers	LOCATION	, ' and whose story is embalmed in one of the most familiar pieces of sentimental verse .

		Mr.
Marriott	PERSON	's new novel , ` Genevra , ' is a study of a woman 's temperament , framed in the Cor - nish setting that the author knows so well how to describe .

		The story has as little as possible of the dramatic ; a few other people have to be intro - duced as foils to the principal figure ; there must even be a man capable of awakening her love , for otherwise her character would be only half revealed .

		She is one of those self-repressed women whom few understand ; except for one unguarded hour she keeps the citadel of her soul from invasion .

		The traditions of her race are dignified , and her life remains in keeping with them , even when beset by the vulgarities of a shrewish sister-in-law and a sleek suitor .

		Only in her poems does she offer her soul for the inspec -
18	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, tion of others , and those who surround her are blind to any revelation of that kind .

		The man to whom she yields herself for a time proves a crea - ture of common clay -LRB- although a famous artist -RRB- , and the tragedy that comes with her realization of that fact leaves her spirit chastened but unbroken .

		Her life-story is a tapestry of severe • design and sombre hue ; the life is her own , not another 's , and we are left in no doubt that it must remain so in the unrecorded years to come .

		` The Divine Fire ' is a title that fairly sug - gests the theme of Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	's novel , which is a full-length study of the poetic tem - perament , framed in a varied and curiously inter - esting environment , and drawn with a firmness of hand that excites one 's admiration .

Sinclair	PERSON	may be we know not , but if this is her first novel , she has made a promising beginning .

		The work has six hundred closely printed pages , and they are none too many for the delight of the reader .

		The poet whose fortunes are followed through all this maze is no abstract creation of sentimental fancy , but a man of flesh and blood , a man , moreover , placed amid the most depress - ing surroundings -- a
London	LOCATION	bookshop , a Blooms - bury boarding-house , and the fellowship of semi - bohemian journalistic life .

		He is a cockney by breeding and circumstance , and he struggles des - perately to preserve his aspirates .

		But with all this he is a poet , and his genius forces its Avay to self-expression .

		The author is daring enough to give us an occasional illustration of his poetical powers , which is rather unwise , because the son - nets she prints , although tolerable imitations of
Eossetti	LOCATION	, are by no means up to the level of such a genius as she describes .

		Of the purification of this genius , and of the moral quixotism of the poet 's life , this book is one long and minutely - ■ detailed chronicle .

		It rises , moreover , to real dis - tinction of style , besides being of absorbing inter - est from cover to cover .

		It is the sort of book that one begins by skimming , and ends by giving the closest attention to paragraph and phrase .

		Granting the initial possibility of two men so • closely resembling one another as to deceive their closest friends -- and even the wife of the one who is married -- granting this , there is no further difficulty of an insuperable nature in accepting the plot of Mrs.
Thurston	PERSON	's ` The Masquerader . '

		Of the two men who agree to exchange identities , one is a gifted but obscure person ; the other is a rising statesman , a member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and a leader of the opposition .

		Unfortunately , he is also a morphino maniac , and he provides himself with an official substitute in order that he may retire from the world from time to time for indulgence in the vice which has mastered him .

		The man who impersonates him upon these occa - sions develops a genius for politics , and eventu - ally leads his party to power .

		Incidentally , he falls in love with the wife of the man for whom he thus acts as a substitute , and the wife unsus - peetedly finds herself caring for her husband ; that is , for the man whom she believes to be her husband .

		Here is where the author takes the bull by the horns and grows audacious in her inven - tion .

		For when the wife makes discovery of the imposture , she is not outraged , as a conventional heroine would be , but remains faithful to her newly-awakened affections .

		This difficult relation is treated with a delicacy that can give no offense , but the moralist is sure to find in the denoument a stumbling-block .

		For when the real husband dies of an overdose of morphine , and the lovers are left to face the future , they decide that their feelings for each other constitute the all-impor - tant factor in the perplexing situation , and that it is best for them to continue the imposture indefi - nitely , without regard to such unimportant mat - ters as property and inheritance .

		It is a con - elusion to take one 's breath away , but it at least offers a refreshing contrast to the artificial means that any other novelist would have devised for getting out of the difficulty .

		And the story is so ingeniously told and cleverly constructed that its very boldness is in a measure justified .


William Morton Patxe	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		Essays hy the hermit of ^ helbume .

		In no dilettante spirit does Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	approach his task of criticism .

		Two years of solitary meditation in a secluded spot on the
Androscoggin	LOCATION	, where the recluse lived much after the manner of
Thoreau	LOCATION	at
Walden	LOCATION	, revealed to him that his work was to be the criticism of others ' writings , not the production of master - pieces of his own .

		`
Shelburne	LOCATION	Essays : First Series ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a collection of literary , psychological , and ethical studies , of unusual seriousness and power .

		The first essay is on
Thoreau	LOCATION	, but our forest hermit is no natui-alist ; he respects nature 's secrets , and refrains from the botanist 's and entomologist 's and ornithologist 's prying curiosity .

		To the problems of the soul , as presented in literature and life , he devotes his energies .

		An excellent study of Hawthorne dwells on the romancer 's loneliness and pictures the inevitable solitariness of every soul as the theme that most poAverfully appealed to the creator of
Hester Prynne	ORGANIZATION	and
Ethan Brand	ORGANIZATION	and
Hepzibah Pyncheon	ORGANIZATION	.

		An essay on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is per - haps all the better for being not wholly in sym - pathy with the Transcendentalist .

		Appropriately enough thei-e follows a chapter on
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	, in which the writer says some things that have not been said before , but allows himself to assume as beyond dispute that
Carlyle	PERSON	's marriage was a ` pathetic tragedy , ' and even does his part toward increasing the pathos .

		After this one is not unprepared to find him calling
Froude	PERSON	's life of
Carlyle	PERSON	` one of the two great biographies of the language , ' the other of course being
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's
Johnson	PERSON	.

		A somewhat minute study of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's decadent verse would seem a waste of energy except for the psychological interest to be found in these poems , as the essay - ist observes , by those that are curious to follow the varied currents of modern thought .

		In the recent Irish literary revival , Mr.
More	PERSON	, ` wearied of the imperialistic arrogance of Kipling the
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 gi-eat and the lesser Kiplings , ' had hoped to find the promise of better things ; but he is somewhat disappointed , a note of defeat seeming to him predominant in the tones given forth by
Erin	PERSON	's harp .

		In other words , it is decadence we again meet with here , though quite a different one from the decadence of a Baudelaire or a
Symons	PERSON	.

		Count Tolstoy is to our author a false prophet , in whose humanitarianism he sees nothing but the ` vicious circle of attempting to unite men for the mere sake of union . '

		Yet surely the connotations of * brotherly love ' forbid its interpretation as an empty end in itself .

		Discussing the religious ground of humanitarianism , Mr.
More distin	PERSON	- guishes between unworldly or religious motives and those impulses that properly apply to the daily life and conduct of the world 's i > eople ; and he maintains that ` to intrude the aspirations of faith and hope and the ethics of the golden rule of love ' into worldly affairs is * a mischievous folly . '

		Is religion then to be merely for
Sunday	DATE	use , and a cloistered virtue the only one practic - able ?

		Perhaps something more of the spirit and less of the letter of religion may help toward solv - ing the diflSculty .

		Our essayist may be thought at times to take himself and his hermit experience , and his ' long course of wayward reading , ' a little too seriously .

		But he is not yet old , and he has a right to enjoy the seriousness of youth while it lasts .

		Poets , too , are seldom richly endowed with humor ; and Mr.
More	PERSON	is not unknown as a poet , -- indeed , his essays are embellished here and there with verses of his own .

		chiefly translations .

		A constant tendency to find analogies in Hindu liter - ature is conspicuous in this ex-professor of Sanskrit .

		However , he has certainly read widely and wisely , and his essays are unquestionably full of meat .

		The third volume of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's ` Historv of
Scotland	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & ` Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has to do with the period from the accession of
Charles I.	PERSON	to the end of Argj-U 's rising , 1G25 to
1688	DATE	.

		The impression received from this work is that the author is not attempting to write a formal history of
Scotland	LOCATION	, but is rather using the materials he has collected and studied to test the accuracy of earlier works by well-known authors .

		The result is that while those who are intimately familiar with the details of Scottish historj ' will find Mr.
Lang	PERSON	intenselj ' interesting as a critic and as a shrewd investigator , uncover - ing new sources of information , the ordinary reader must frequently be puzzled to understand the connection and relation of events .

		The author takes for granted his reader 's knowledge of the general course of Scottish history , even to the extent of omitting any general outline .

		His most striking characteristic is his dispassionate , judicial , possibly even cynical , attitude towards persons and incidents in relation to the contests over religion with
Charles I. Thus	PERSON	he writes of the Covenant by which Scotch Presbyterians bound themselves to resist the liturgj - of Charles I. : *
Scotland	LOCATION	was once more in the happy pos - ture of

		Nothing was absent but the sig - nature of the other high contracting party . '

		* The friends of freedom , as ever , allowed ru > freedom to any but themselves .

		The zealots of liberty of conscience permitted no liberty of conscience to exist among persons of other opinions .

		In what respect their conduct was better than the king 's -LRB- which was as bad as possible -RRB- it is diflScult to discover ; but historians usually prefer the cause of popular to that of individual tyranny . '

		* They -LSB- the Covenanters -RSB- on the other hand , to repeat Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's eloquent words , `` had long been led astray , and had now returned to the
Shepherd	LOCATION	and Bishop of their Souls '' ; not only so , they butted other sheep who would not enter the fold . '

		It may be doubted whether a mental tem - I > er and attitude so far removed from the intense religious feeling of the time of which he is writ - ing , does not preclude an author from really undei `` standing and judging fairly the men of that time .

		But in respect to exact statement of doubt - ful events at least , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's work is a fine example of modem scholarship , being based on a careful analysis of the documents and other sources available for the study of Scottish his - tory .

		After all the years Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	has devoted to the study of birds , it is not strange that he has learned to borrow some of their ways .

		His latest volume of essays , ` Far and Near ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , tells how he has taken to himself wings and flitted as far as
Alaska	LOCATION	for one season , and to
Jamaica	LOCATION	for another .

		On these flights his bird-like keenness of vision has served him well , and the messages he brings back are good to listen to .

		Among the specialists of the
Harriman Alaska Expedition of 1899	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	was , so to speak , a generalist ; yet he had enough spe - cial knowledge in many fields to report with zest the discoveries made by the ` fiends ' in rocks , plants , glaciers , birds , and bears .

		Meanwhile he kept his eye on the landscape , and tells the untravelled reader what he most wants to know , and tells it in his own expressive way .

		The hills of Wj ` oming are ` almost as plump and muttony in places as the South DoAvns of
England	LOCATION	' ; in the
Bad Lands	LOCATION	, ` the earth seems to have been flayed alive , -- no skin or turf or verdure or vege - table mould anywhere , -- all raw and quivering . '

		Alaska itself ` is covered with an unbroken carp -RRB- et of verdure ... Green , white , and blue are the three prevailing tints all the way from
Cook Inlet	LOCATION	to
Unalaska	LOCATION	; blue of the sea and sky , green of the shores and lower slopes , and white of the lofty p > eaks and volcanic cones , -- they are min - gled and contrasted all the way . '

		True to his northern instinct , Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	finds
Jamaica	LOCATION	a place ` cursed with perpetual
summer	DATE	, ' and com - plains that he can not make love to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	there .

		` Nature in the tropics has little tenderness or winsomeness .

		She is barbaric ; she is painty and stiff ; she has no sentiment ; she does not touch the heart ; she flouts and revels and goes her own way like a wanton .

		She has never known adver - sity ; she has no memory and no longing ; there is 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, no autumn behind hei - and no spring beiore . '

		Nevertheless , no blossom of southern woods , no significant feature of the land , no bird-note , no star new to northern eyes , escapes this treasurer of beauty .

		But after all , it is in the interludes of ^ Near ' between these two themes of the ` Far ' that we find Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	most himself .

		The nature-lover who writes the little comedy of the water-thrush family , and the little tragedy of the frozen baby rabbits , is the same who long ago won our hearts with stories of similar home-hap - penings .

		The records of far journeys in this new book may not add greatly to his reputation , but they serve the gracious purpose of showing us an old friend in new surroundings .


Sheridan	PERSON	and To the already extensive list the closing days of historical monographs relat - or the Civil War .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the period of the Civil War there is added a sprightly and vivid account of the operations which brought that war to a • close , namely , the eleven days ' operations from
March 29	DATE	to
April 8 , 1865	DATE	, by
Sheridan	PERSON	and his cavalrymen in front of
Petersburg	LOCATION	and
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		This is from the pen of Brevet Brigadier-General
Henry E. Tremain	PERSON	, and is entitled ` Last Hours of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's Cavalry ' -LRB-
Bonnell , Silver & Bowers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		General
Tremain	PERSON	was himself as aide-de-camp to
General Crook	ORGANIZATION	, an active participant in many of the scenes which he here describes .

		He has com - piled his book from notes taken by him on the field , which have heretofore been published in the newspaper press , and have been subjected to the comment and criticism of other actors in the same drama , much of which is here reproduced and made appendant to the principal narrative .

		The result is an unusually valuable compilation of contemporary notes .

		In quite full detail , and occupying over 400 pages , the writer carries his readers rapidly , but not too hastily , through the vicissitudes of an exciting campaign .

		This is the campaign in which it has been said that ` Grant commanded both his own and
Lee	PERSON	's army . '


Sheri	PERSON	- dan 's work in weaving the final toils around the fated Confederacy is here graphically narrated , and the reader has an hourly view of the keen insight and circumspection with which the great commander performed the task for which he was summoned from
the Valley of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the evening of
April 6	DATE	is reached , and one reads again
Sheridan	PERSON	's terse despatch to
Grant	LOCATION	, ` If the thing is pressed , I think
Lee	PERSON	will surrender , ' and when the next day sees the Federal pursuit of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	more warm and eager than ever , the reader is prepared to share
Sheridan	PERSON	's confidence in the expected result .

		.

		There is considerable ` bite ' in Mr.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	's short essays , ` Imaginary Obli - gations ' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as those who have read them in ` The
Bookman	PERSON	' and elsewhere can testify .

		Mr.
Colby	PERSON	possesses a good measure of shrewd sense , a wholesome hatred of humbug and a keen eye to detect it , a practised pen , and a knack of terse , incisive , and often striking expres - sion .

		But with these qualities go their defects : aiming to be brilliant and sententious , he occa - A dogmatic essayist .

		sionally exaggerates and makes phrases .

		The modesty of careful utterance is shocked by such an assertion as that ` false hvunor-worship is the deadliest of social sins ' ; and the writer illus - trates the vice he on another page inveighs against -LRB- phrase-making -RRB- Avhen he allows the fol - lowing to escape his pen : ' There is nothing more amazing to the reader than the way a mind can be wrapped in a `` policy . ''

		Many a decorous news - paper is edited by a moral papoose .

		In private life ' ' the policy ' ' would make you talk in epitaphs of last year 's opinions , hook your fancy to a foregone conclusion , turn your mind into a bare card-catalogue of the things you used to think . '

		A vocabulary is a fine thing , and so is a small boy 's new drum ; but so also is moderation .

		How - ever , Mr.
Colby	PERSON	is still a young man .

		Perhaps when he is older he will not bristle with so many positive convictions , and possibly he will express himself more often in the form of query and sug - gestion .

		The neutral tints of doubt may tend now and then to displace the glaring primarj ' colors of certitude .

		Something of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's ` twilight of dubiety ' will perchance soften his mental horizon-line , as he sits , pen in hand , enter - taining us with his views de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis .

		Some of his best chapters have to do with ` The Business of Writing ' and ` Liter - ary Compulsion . '

		` The Literary Temperament ' is treated in a way that makes the reader , if he be also a Avriter , squirm in his chair . '

		The Temp - tation of Authors ' contains a wai ` ning to success - ful and pi'olific writers .

		` The danger in spread - ing one 's self thin is that the time surely comes when it is done unconsciously .

		A man thinks it is his thought flowing on like that , when it is only his ink . '

		The fitness of Mr ,
Colby	ORGANIZATION	's title , ` Imagi - nary Obligations , ' is somewhat imaginary , in spite of his explanation in the preface .

		But a book must have a title , and for a collection of loosely related essays one will serve about as well as another .

		Among the subjects rescued from vague speculations and transfeiTed to the field of descriptive inquirj ^ none is more inviting , and also more baffling , than the nature of personality .

		The change of front which modern psychology presents in contrast with older points of view has been active in this field , and has made it evi - dent that personality , like other eomjilexes of psychological processes , is itself the result of growth and accordingly may be subject to var - ious lapses and degeneration .

		A recent work by Dr.
Boris Sidis	PERSON	and Dr.
Simon P. Goodhart	PERSON	, entitled ` Multiple Personality , an Experimental Investigation into the Nature of Human Individ - uality ' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , represents both the kinds of inquiry and the nature of the results typical of the modern point of view .

		The most original as well as most interesting portion of the volume is given over to a painstaking account of a remarkable loss of personality , in many respects the most complete on record .

		It is the most com - plete , not only because so large a portion of the normal mental processes Avere lost , reducing the subject to a condition of a curiously modified TJie nature of Personality .

		infancy , but also because the new personality has been so interestingly developed by education , and ultimately united with the old .

		On the basis of this and similar cases , certain of which justify the title of ` Multiple Personality , ' these investi - gator indicate the contribution of these abnormal forms toward the right understanding of the nature of personality .

		While this xmderstanding is by no means complete or easily summarized , the trend of the results is such as to lay emphasis up > on the normal participation of the sub-con - scious activities in the formation of that memory - continuum by which the material fgr the sense of personality is supplied .

		Equally do such inves - tigations discountenance the supernatural and transcendent theories which have done so much to confuse the conceptions involved .

		In brief , the study of the abnormal distinctly reinforces the naturalistic conceptions of personality that result from a psychological study of the growth of this precious sense .


Sweden	LOCATION	is the healthiest coun - try in
Europe	LOCATION	; it boasts a death-rate of only sixteen and a half per thousand , and a correspondingly high average term of life .

		In their evolution from the Suiones , these people have been but little affected by extraneous influences ; they have received no impress from Roman culture , Roman law , or the feudal system that ruled mediaeval society .

		Christianity came to them through the Normans of
France	LOCATION	; the Roman church exercised a nom - inal sway in the country for two centuries , but it was never very effective .

		In that period , how - ■ ever , the country produced a great personage in Saint
Brigitta	PERSON	-LRB- Bridget -RRB- , who was influential in bringing about the return of the Popes from
Avignon	LOCATION	to
Rome	LOCATION	in the fourteenth century .

		A far greater national hero was
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	, whose defense of Protestant principles brought
Sweden	LOCATION	prominently into the field of European polities in the
sixteenth century	DATE	, a prominence which ended with the loss of
Finland	LOCATION	, after that of Pomerania and the Baltic Provinces , early in the nineteenth century .

		The country has shared its king -LRB- since 1814 -RRB- with
Norway	LOCATION	, though each country ' has its own constitution .

		In
Sweden	LOCATION	the < ?

		ost of education is defrayed by the state or parish , is absolutely free to the recipient , is thorough , and is so prolonged that men usually postpone their marriage until they are thirty years of age .

		It is the original home of what is tnown in this country as ` sloyd , ' -- a system of industrial education which makes deft fingers and ` develops mechanical practice and general handiness . '

		These characteristics and many more that might be mentioned , give interest to Mr. 0 .

		G.
Yon Heidenstam	ORGANIZATION	's voliune on ` Swedish Life in Town and Country , ' in the series describ - ing ` Our European Neighbors ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The ■ chapters on the literature , arts , and economics of the country are highly entertaining ; but of sur - passing interest are the few paragraphs which inform us of
Sweden	LOCATION	's successful solution of the • drink problem with which other countries have : grappled in vain .

Madame Adam	ORGANIZATION	is best known narrative of her for her journal of the
Paris	LOCATION	literary life .

		g ^ g ^ g ^ j ^ g ^ ` Nouvelle Revue ' which she founded and for many years edited , and her salon which , with her Review , exerted a recognized political influence .

		Her account of her earlier life has already been noticed in these columns .

		With short intermission , now follows its sequel in ` My Literary Life ' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which brings the record down to the later sixties -- or at least this is to be inferred ; for hardly a date appears in the whole book , whose chief defect -LRB- or excellence -RRB- is its haj > - hazard garrulity , extending to the length of 542 pages .

		Such an outpouring necessarily contains , for the foreign reader at any rate , much that is lacking in inter - est. .

		The reproduction of long conversations between i > ersons of far less than world-wide fame on themes of not exactly universal concern is a prominent feature of the book .

		Is it from short - hand notes , or from memorj - aided by imagina - tion , that these pages of talk are taken ?

		What appears to be an absurd mistranslation enlivens one of them .

		A certain Dr.
Maure	PERSON	, an epicure , relates of Cousin , with great contempt , ` Would you believe me , that one day arriving in the mid - dle of luncheon I heard him asking his governess for some veal , and it was pheasant !

		! '

		That gouvemante may mean housekeeper as well as governess seems not to have impressed itself on the anonymous translator .

Liszt	ORGANIZATION	,

		The narrative closes , as shall this notice , with Mme. d'Agoult 's recipe for founding a salon .

		` You need , ' she writes to the author , ` twenty men friends and five women to found a salon .

		You have them .

		Mine wOl remain the big winter salon , yours will be the little

		The land of mirages A study of the American des - erts that has quite as much atmosphere as Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	's ` Land of Little Rain , ' and that seems to get even closer to the strange heart of the matter , is the little volume of sketches entitled ` In Miners ' -RSB- Mirage-Land , ' by Mrs.
Idah Meacham Strobridge	PERSON	.

		The book is published by the author from her own bindery in
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, in an autograph edition limited to one thousand copies .

		The cover - design and chapter-headings are the work of Mr.
J. Duncan Gleason	PERSON	, and a reproduction of Mr.

		` Mirage of Water or Mirage of a Mine !

		It mat - ters not which it may be , the end is the same for him who follows after the Siren who is always in league with Death . '

		This quotation will ser \ - e to show how Mrs.

		` Women in the Fine Arts ' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Clara Erskine Clement	PERSON	, is a compendium of miscellaneous information about all the women artists that the author could dis - cover between the seventh century B. C. and the twentieth A. D. Among the thousand names included , the late nineteenth century is most fully represented .

		As the greater part of the material about contemporary painters was furnished by themselves , we may assume that it is correct ; and as Mrs.
Clement	PERSON	's aim was to include all the names and all the facts she could get , we can not criticise her selection or proportion .

		Being alpha - betically arranged , the book is a convenient man - ual from which to extract information about artists who have not yet got into the encyclopae - dias .

		The author professes to have made the remark - able discovery that there are two voices in man , the one of the larynx and the other of the oesoph - agus ; and that these two possess unique rela - tions to the ` soul ' element of speech .

		Tortuous and commonplace repetitions and variations of this theme make up the volume ; which , indeed , has no claim to consideration except as an exam - ple of the confusion which may be the fruit of interest and enthusiasm unfortified by apprecia - tion of what scientific investigation is or what it has accomplished .

Percy Robert Colwell	PERSON	, is a hand - some volume published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selection is a generous one , although in the nature of the case a single volume can give hardly more than a taste of `
Jason	PERSON	, ' `
Sigurd	PERSON	, ' and ` The Earthly Paradise . '

		There is an introductory essay , a limited bibliography , and a few notes .

		The same publishers have issued , in style uniform with the above book , an anthology of ' The Greek Poets , ' edited by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.

		The range of the selection is from Homer to Meleager , and the translations represent a greater number of hands than the authors themselves .

		They are taken from writers old-fashioned and modern , and .

		the editor contributes a number of his own .


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		` Light on the
Hills	ORGANIZATION	, ' edited by Dr.
Charles Car	PERSON	- roll
Albert	PERSON	son , is a devotional anthology published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selection of poems is not altogether discriminating , but the book con - tains much that is of enduring spiritual value .

		` The Government of
Ohio	LOCATION	: Its History and
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Professor
Wilbur H. Siebert	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their ` Hand - books of

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		publish this volume .

		Miss
Ella Isabel Harris	PERSON	has translated the trag - edies of

Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, ' translated with the author 's permission by 3Jj8s
Maude Barrows Dut	PERSON	- ton , is published as a booklet by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is one of the most valuable pieces of musi - cal criticism produced of recent years , and deserves a very wide circulation .

		Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's masterly prose translation of ` The Tragedies of Sophocles ' may now be had in a single volume unencumbered by Greek text or ' commentary , and thus brought within the reach of modest purses .

		This translation , so much more desirable than any other , is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	for
the Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		`
Murray 's Small Classical Atlas	ORGANIZATION	, ' edited by Mr.
G. B. Grundy	PERSON	, and published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	at the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, is accurately de - scribed in the preface as a ` good and at the same time inexpensive ' work .

		Colored contours and legible type make the maps exceptionally clear .

		They are fourteen in number , preceded by an elab - orate index .

		The German text of ` Parsifal , ' facing an English translation made to fit the score by Mr.
George Turner Phelps	PERSON	, is published in a small volume by Mr.
Kichard G. Badger	PERSON	.

		It well illustrates the utter hopelessness of attempting to sing the work with English words and at the same time preserve more than a small fraction of its poetical impres - siveness .

		Mr.
Turner	PERSON	has struggled manfully with an impossible task .

		The editorial supervision of
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,

		2T NEW GRAND CANYON HOTEL ,
EL TOVAR	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nearly everything worth while in the
Southwest	LOCATION	dates back to
Francisco Vasquez Coronado	PERSON	, the Spanish governor of
Galacia	LOCATION	, who left
Mexico	LOCATION	in the year
1540	DATE	, accompanied by several hundred warriors , in search of the mythical seven cities of
Cibola	LOCATION	.

		Coronado and his men found no gold , but they discovered
New Mexico	LOCATION	,
Arizona	LOCATION	, and other sections of the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their most spectacular '' find '' was the Grand Canyon of
Arizona	LOCATION	.

		Chief among
Coronado	ORGANIZATION	's lieutenants was a brave conquistador named
Pedro del Tovar	PERSON	, captain of the detachment that explored and conquered the province of
Tusayan	LOCATION	, now known as
Mokiland	LOCATION	.

		While among the
Mokis	PERSON	,
Tovar	PERSON	heard of the Grand Canyon , which borders old
Tusayan	LOCATION	on the west .

		He reported the tale to
Coronado	ORGANIZATION	, and
Cardenas	PERSON	was sent out to verify it .

		Though not the first white man to see this titan of chasms , Tover was largely instrumental in its discov - ery , so when the
Santa	LOCATION	Fe needed an appropriate name for the new hotel at Bright Angel , '' El Tovar '' was selected .

		It is true that
Don Pedro	PERSON	, etc. , waited nearly four centuries for immortality , but better men have waited a thousand years -- and still remain unknown to fame .

		It is a far cry from
1540	DATE	to
1905	DATE	.

		Early in Jan - uary will be opened the most unique , the most com - fortable , the most costly hotel in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, under management of Mr.
Fred Harvey	PERSON	, whose reputation as a caterer is national .

		Occupying a site 7000 feet above sea-level , close to the rim of the grandest of canyons , at the railway ter - minus and not far from the head of Bright Angel trail ,
El Tovar	ORGANIZATION	commands a prospect without parallel in the world -- a perpendicular mile from rim to river -LRB- seven miles by trail -RRB- and thirteen dizzy miles across to the opposite Canyon wall .

		The roaring
Colorado	LOCATION	below looks like a silvery thread and its tumult seldom reaches the stillness of the upper air .

		On three sides are the fragrant pines of
Coconino	LOCATION	, a
Government	ORGANIZATION	forest reserve , and the largest continuous belt of pine timber in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Everywhere a riot of color and beauty of form , a vision unspeakable .

		EI
Tovar	PERSON	is a long , low , rambling edifice , built of native boulders and pine logs .

		Expressed with exact - ness , the width north and south is 325 feet and from east to west 200 feet .


El Tovar	ORGANIZATION	is to cost more than a quarter of a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		No money has been spared to get the most up-to-date equipment possible .

		Take the item of fur - niture : it is all from special arts and crafts designs , combining use and beauty .

		Among the minor comforts may be mentioned a telephone in each room with direct office connection .

		There is not a room in the house where the son fails to enter at some period of the day .

		The protection against fire is very complete , the reserve supply of water in the steel tank being 125,000 gallons .

		The plant furnishing heat , light , power and water is far enough removed to be unobjectionable .

		There are stables and corrals where horses and teams are kept for trips along the rim and down to the river .

		A searchlight has been ordered , to light ap the wierd canyon depths at night .

		Adjacent is a Hopi bouse , built of stones and adobe , exactly reproducing one of the unique dwellings of the Hopi Indians .

		In this picturesque structure will live several families of Hopi weavers and potters , plying their strange handicrafts .

		A museum of rare Indian curios will be installed and photos sold .

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	has selected Air .

		Chas .


A. Brant	PERSON	as local manager , a gentleman favorably known in hotel and club circles .

		The opening of
El Tovar	ORGANIZATION	on
January 10 , 1905	DATE	, will add another strong reason to the many already existing why the Grand Canyon of A ^ zona should be visited on the way to
California	LOCATION	over the
Santa Fe	LOCATION	.

		The canyon itself needs no endorsement .

		It is the greatest scenic wonder of the world .

THEODORE THOMAS	PERSON	.

		The great musician whose beneficent life was ended on
the fourth of this month	DATE	was a Ger - man by birth , but became one of the foremost of Americans , and as such our bereaved nation does honor to his memory , and pays its heart - felt tribute of gratitude for his half-century of activity in furthering the highest interests of American culture .

		The part taken by music in the impressive services of his burial , two days later , had a closer fitness than that of merely emphasizing the particular nature of his life work ; it acquired a peculiar special significance from the relation of the selections performed to the ideals to which
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	had given unswerving allegiance through all his years , and to the essential memory of the art which it has been his mission to interpret for the sweetening of human existence and the ennobling of human character .

		It has some - times been ingeniously argued that music is a form of entertainment , a titillation of the sense without any bearing upon the conduct or the purpose of life .

		If ever a claim seemed hollow , it was during the hours consecrated to this mans memory , when music was invoked to express the thoughts and feelings , far beyond the power of words to reach , of the mourning multitude .

		At the church services , the mighty spirits of
Bach	PERSON	and
Beethoven	PERSON	took possession of the sacred edifice .

		An organ prelude , followed by the rugged measures of Luther 's hymn , gave to the hour its religious key .

		Then the wind choir of the orchestra intoned the divine choral melody of the Xinth Symphony with its mes - sage of human brotherhood , so deeply felt by all those present , as they recalled the inspira - tion that it had been to them in time past , and associated that inspiration with their sense of gratitude toward the dead leader .

		Finally , the note of personal grief came from the organ with those strains from the close of the Passion according to
St. Matthew	ORGANIZATION	which are the supreme expression at once of tenderness , pathos , and sublimity .

		A few hours later , when the remains had been laid to rest , a great company gathered in the
Orchestra Hall	ORGANIZATION	, and listened silently , with bowed heads , to the following programme of memorial music :
Chorale Bach Symphony No. 3	ORGANIZATION	, ' Eroica '
BeetJuwen Allegro	PERSON	con brio
Marcia	PERSON	funebre Siegfried 's Death
March	DATE	, ` Die Gotterdam - merung '
Wagner	PERSON	Tone Poem , ` Tod und Verklarung '
Strauss	PERSON	THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, Here again , in exquisite and harmonious sequence , were stirred the emotions fitting the occasion .

		First came the note of religious resig - nation , then the note of chastened joy that is never far removed from tears , followed by that of mourning , unrelieved and black .

		Then came the same solemn note of mourning , but this time relieved by tender and heroic memories , and then , last of all , came the note of hopeful - ness , of
Verhliirung	LOCATION	, of buoyant life reasserting its claim , of heart renewed for the future .

		It was a perfect hour , perfectly embodied in the divine symbolism of the deepest of the arts .

		It is not easy to adjust our minds to the fact that Theod ` ore
Thomas	PERSON	is dead .

		Those who , like the present writer , have heard something like five hundred concerts given under his lead - ership during the past thirty years , who owe to him practically their whole acquaintance with orchestral music , must be simply dazed by their loss .

		To such , he has stood for all these years as the beginning and the end of miLsic .

		almost as their sole means of access to its fountain of inspiration .

		The contrast , l3etween those who have had the inestimable opportunity of long continued contact with his work and those who have not is like the contrast between persons who have all their lives had the use of a com - prehensive collection of English poetrv * and the persons who have had within reach only some ` Library of Poetry and Song ' or `
Golden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	' of excerpts .

		It is only by thus trans - ferring the case to its literary parallel that it is possible to realize what such a loss means , or to imagine how much poorer life would have been without his labors for its enrichment .

		There are in this country -- there are in
Chicago	LOCATION	alone -- many thousands of men and women who have enjoyed a liberal education in music through his agency , and who could not without that agency have had anything but a casual and fragmentary acquaintance with the art which for the past two centuries -- from
Bach	LOCATION	to
Brahms	PERSON	-- has contributed at least as largely as any other art to the upbuilding of the spiri - tual life .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	was in his seventieth year when ke died , and sixty of his years were spent in the country of his adoption .

		It is easily within bounds to say that no other musician during those years has done so much as he for the development of musical taste in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		And the secret of his achievement -- if we may call it a secret -- is found in his stead - fast devotion to the highest ideals of his art .

		His rugged and uncompromising temper , in all questions directly concerning his art .

		often made him enemies , but of a kind for which his followers loved him all the more .

		It is barely ten years since , in the city which he had honored by choosing for his permanent home , that he was made the victim of a vicious and virulent attack , accompanied by every imaginable form of mean and malicious insinuation , solely because he refused to lower his standards for the sake of a cheap popularity , or to prostitute his art to commercial considerations .

		And even after the fury of that outburst was past , and those responsible for it had been revealed in all their contemptible insignificance , there were still raised against him from time to time the voices of those who should have been better advised , urging that he make concessions to the ignorant humor of the public , and give them the .

		music for which they clamored instead of the music which he knew that they ought to hear .

		To all these appeals Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	turned a deaf ear , and continued in his imperturbable ` course .

		And if we accord him all honor for this attitude , we must permit the honor to be shared with the men upon whose invitation he had come to
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1891	DATE	, and who gave liim unfailing support to the end .

		It was a loyal body of public-spirited citizens -- fifty at first , the number afterwards dwindling to much less than that -- who made with him in the beginning the solemn compact that only artistic considerations should prevail in the manage - ment of the enterprise , that the question of box - office receipts should never be allowed to modify a standard of excellence which art alone should dictate .

		How well that promise Avas kept , and at how gi * eat a personal sacrifice on the part of those who kept it , is a matter of history .

		Some further historical recapitulation becomes appropriate at this point .

		After meet - ing large annual deficits , amounting in the aggregate to about half
a million dollars	MONEY	, for twelve years , the men who had been keeping the orchestra in existence felt that the time had come to call upon the larger public to share the burden .

		Accordingly , in
1903	DATE	, they declared their belief that an endowment fund of three - quarters of a million must be raised , and a per - manent home provided for the orchestra .

		Thus , and thus only , would • its lasting continuance he insured .

		They announced that they were prepared for one more year to meet the losses of the orchestra , which must then come to an end unless the public was willing to give prac - tical expression of a wish for its preservation .

		A popular subscription was then inaugurated , which in the course of the year following pro- duced from upwards of eight thousand sub - scribers nearly the required sum .

		In
May	DATE	of the present year , ground was broken for the new building , during the
summer	DATE	and fall the work of construction went on , and its doors were opened on
December 14	DATE	for the dedicatory con - cert under the leadership of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	.

		Two concerts in the regular series followed , and then , on Christmas eve , the veteran conductor
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 8 $ laid down his baton forever .

		He had lived to see realized his fondest dream ; he died knowing that his work would live after him , not merely in memory , but in actual prosecution upon the foundation for which he so long had labored .

		This knowledge must have been an unspeak - able consolation to him in his dying hour , and it offers a kind of consolation to those of us who are left to mourn his loss .

		Had his life been lessened by even a single year , it is not likely that the subscription would have been carried on or the building erected .

		In that case , the body of musicians to whom he had been giving such masterly training for the twelve years past would in all probability have been dispersed , and one of the two or three chief agencies of musical education in this country would have come to an end .

		THE FATE OF ENGLISH LITERATURE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		For eleven years I have had to confront the ghosts of the entrance requirement texts that are still perched on the threshold of enterprise and success in the right teaching of Enelish litera - ture .

		They are as much substance as ghost , secretly terrifying teachers whose mouths are gagged by a discretion that enables them to keep their pyositions .

		Superintendents and principals ignorantly or helplessly crook the hinges of their knees exactly as they did ten years ago to the demands of that examination which must be passed at the gates of the universities .

		High school walls , on which are the glowing , dragon - like shapes of mechanical drudgery devices and pedantic details required by the teaching of the over-edited texts , move toward enervated teach - ers and pupils .

		Will friendly arms be reached out to save , as was the case when at the last moment
Poe	PERSON	's unfortunate escaped the Pit ?

		A prominent bookman , when questioned by me in regard to what he thought of the texts , replied , ` My business is to sell all the English texts required by the colleges , but the reason why I know so little about what you ask is that I entered college by means of them , and to this day I have never had any taste for English , for mechanical outlines ,
Jack	PERSON	pudding farce essays , and plagiarized critical comment . '

		Another friend of mine , a teacher , had to fight for three years over the feasibility of publishing connected poetic masterpieces with a background of the various historical periods in the develop - ment of English literature .

		A principal of one of the finest high schools in the country , after examining his book in manuscript , said to him , * You are ten years ahead of your time .

		You will never get that book published with the entire educational system against you ; the committee down East will not brook it for a minute .

		No publisher will touch it .

		I thoroughly believe in your book and wish I could use it in my school , ' In order to ascertain the need for such a book with the general school public , the author sent out over a hundred circular letters to the teach - ers of English in large and small high schools .

		He received fifty answers , forty of which were in favor of anthology work ; but of these forty teachers very few were doing anything of the kind , simply because , as they said , * The course as mapped out at present does not permit . '

		To his astonishment , ten of these forty teachers refused to sign their names to the letters ; they were afraid to go on record as heretics or apK -RRB- S - tates .

		Many wrote long letters to show how exceedingly dissatisfied they were with a lack of system in teaching the requirement texts , stating that these were unconnected and would be gladly eschewed if ` the powers that be ' would take their fingers off the schools .

		These letters from all parts of the country showed that the pulse of American secondary school education is not in the wrist of college authority ; and by them my friend convinced men of the vital method of such a book , and that a reaction had set in against texts , which manacle the minds of both teacher and pupil to a detailed mastery of a few isolated masterpieces and their historical pyeriods in the development of English literature .

		Last year I visited a fine high school , and while in the preparatory English recitation heard the teacher say , ` Remember , girls and boys , that the learning of English is nowadays as difficult as your Greek and Latin , and now have I not always placed emphasis on the time element ?

		English demands exactly as much as you spend on your Latin . '

		I made careful inquiry concerning this teacher , and found out that she required so many themes that those which did not fill her waste paper basket were pardoned the padding from encyclopaedias because she felt sure that Greek or Latin time had been spent in their prepara - tion .

		On the black-board I noticed a list of questions on ' The Vicar of
Wakefield	ORGANIZATION	' as formid - able as ` What is this ? '

		` What is this ? '

		found every week in the College English column of * The Journal of Education , ' and outlines reminding one of the Cretan labyrinth .

		The text they were reading had no connection with its predecessor .

		3 @ THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, But was the teacher to be blamed in this respect ?

		Are not all the texts disconnected , -- is there any unity of development ?

		There was but one end to all her work , -- the great gate down College lane toward which her literary bankrupts were scrambling .

		Another phase of the tragedy seemed to me to be that almost all of the third and fourth year pupils were in her classes .

		In the third year there were forty pupils , all intending to go to college .

		I thought of the thirty who would never go , and blushed for their knowledge of English literature .

		Not so much did I worry as to what the world would think of their knowledge but as to what they themselves would afterwards suffer , when they would realize how they had been duped into thinking college entrance require - ments a fine knowledge of the great , developing body of English literature .

		I inspected the work of the teachers of English who were giving the
General Course	ORGANIZATION	, and here I found literature .

		English poetry and prose were systematically taught .

		There was little forced work .

		It was good to breathe in the air of taste and appreciation ; and I thought .

		Now if I were in a college which set of pupils would I desire to come to me ?

		I would wish interest , spon - taneity , and some definite critical and apprecia ^ - tive power .

		At recess I wandered into the school library , where a Senior girl sat in front of several opened volumes .

		I asked her what she was doing .

		* 0h !

		I am padding an essay on '' Macbeth '' . '

		^ Are you taking material from books , ' I asked .

		` No , not so much that , as I am practising phrasal and sentence extension .

		My theme must fill six pages and I 've got to fill out . '

		` Dear me ! '

		I said , ` do you enjoy your work in that course ? '

		` No , ' she replied , ` but maybe I 'll go to college some day , and then I 've asked the prin - cipal if I could go into the English literature of the
General Course	ORGANIZATION	, but he wo n't let me ; then it is the crack course , our preparatory course .

		English is the only study I don ' t like in it , but I want what all the pupils get from the course -- favors and recognition from those who run the school . '

		When I left that building I felt full of gaiety , but lalso felt horror treading on my heels as the question came : Is the
High School	ORGANIZATION	fated to be a feeder for a college ?

		If so , I could endure it in all but the giving up of my English literature .

		The high school that I visited was doing fine work in everything except the English require - ments .

		The teacher of English knew her subject but she taught under the incubus of the texts ; she was simply magnetized by the distant college walls .

		All of her pupils were going to college , and whatever they lost in high school they would gain there .

		I went to another high school and the situation was not much better .

		Through the occult power of the colleges the
General Course	ORGANIZATION	had been rele - gated to the rear , so that only two courses were paramount , -- the Preparatory and the Commer - cial .

		Everybody desired to make an effort to study for the university .

		The brightest pupils from the lower grades had been recommended to the
Preparatory Course	ORGANIZATION	, and those ranking next had been urged to it by their parents and teach - ers .

		Its course was considered the finest , and therefore it received brains and numbers .

		Is there any school where favors do not go to the brightest and most assertive ?

		But does English literature rightly taught go to them ?

		No ; and at the present writing the delicate problem is yet to be solved .

		In the larger secondary schools , pupils who do not go away to college receive a much better course in English literature than those who da go .

		They receive a systematic course in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can and English literature with the historical background .

		The entrance requirement texts of high intrinsic worth are used when they naturally come up in the historical development of litera - ture .

		No attempt is made to make the great body of English poetry and prose dance about disjecta membra of itself , for such indeed is the dance of death for literature in secondary schools .

		If the teachers of English literature could avoid the requirement - text-system , they could divide the school body during the last two years and give to all the broad , liberal , historically developing literature which fits not only for col - lege but also for after life .

		Then the pupils would be safe , and the entrance requirement texts would not mar those unfortunate girls and boys who , after leaving the high school , can not go to college .

		All would be satisfied with this equalization of the two courses , the General and the Preparatory , since in the study of English literature the high school would be the people 's college and the university 's college .

		A summary of the situation in the high schools is as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The colleges do not hurt the English composition and rhetoric work of any course in the first year .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The colleges do hamper the work in English literature of the third and fourth years of the
Preparatory Course	ORGANIZATION	by requiring the abominable text-system .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- The colleges cause the requirement texts to be regarded as more meritable than any - thing offered in any other course in English literature .

		Therefore , the systematic study of American and English literature in the second , third , and fourth years of the
General Course ^	ORGANIZATION	in which are the English ,
Geiman	PERSON	, and
Latin	LOCATION	- Scientific divisions , is presented to the minority of the school body .

		The college is especially detrimental to English literature in secondary schools by reason of its academy where the study does not exist .

		When high school graduates come up for the entrance examination , they are not passed on literature but on the amount of theme work and the required texts .

		Hence the disappearance of English liter - ature in the adjacent high schools .

		Not long ago a principal of a high school said to me , ' I hate to see English literature go , but the presence of our city college demands it .

		In its academy there is no literature , and why should I have it ?

		As a defensive policy for increasing our numbers and holding our own with
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		ST that academy , I have made our
Preparatory Course	ORGANIZATION	identical with its
Preparatory Course	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now since the high school offers the same course as that given by the academy of the college , and since it does not cost anything to send children to the high school , the city parents will patronize a free school , the graduates of which are always prepared to enter not only our college but any other college in the land .

		Of course the ques - tions naturally arise : Should citizens be taxed to suppKjrt an academy ?

		Why should not the citizens receive remuneration as the college receives it from the pupils who are preparing for their college course ? '

		As I have already suggested , the salvation and solution of the English problem lie in giving the Preparatory pupils the same English literature that is given to the pupils of the
Greneral Course	ORGANIZATION	, and in asking the colleges to prescribe or pro- scribe teachers , letting the texts take care of themselves .

		There can be and should be uni - formity in these two requirements .

		The
University Departments of English	ORGANIZATION	are keenly feeling the presence of weaklings who have entered their courses by means of the thimib screws .

		The universities are tired of their own ad nauseum entrance method and are suffer - ing the nemesis of forced , unnatural work so much that they are now seeking to be motive powers to form a backwater , which ` in .

		gurgit * vasto ' will go up the stream to smooth the ruf - fled waters and right the current .

		A child may read the signs of reformation , but who is mature enough to set the high water - mark by supplying * a general substitution of vital methods , which are diflScult , for mechanical methods , which are easy , in the work of our teachers of English literature , high and low ? '

		I wish every secondary school teacher of Eng - lish in the country would read the editorial in The Dial of
November 16	DATE	last , and Mr.
Abra	PERSON	- ham
Flexner	ORGANIZATION	's article on ` The Preparatory School ' -LRB- especially p. 372 -RRB- , in the
September	DATE	number of ` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . '

		And their cry rises tingling to the stars .

		Ena-lish litera - ture in the schools shall not be termed the texts prescribed by - the colleges .

		The passing of English literature in the schools has been taking place for the last ten years ; but from
America	LOCATION	's educational
Aval	ORGANIZATION	on an
Arthur	PERSON	is coming , and thrice as fair , to separate the t ^ xts from colleges which have never made their teach - ers satellites to a few disconnected masterpieces .

		` Man is freest , when freest bound , ' when in the imiversity he gives fruit instead of thistles and methods ; and when such comes from the colleges to the secondary schools , we will receive him , reverencing him as our conscience , saying , ` Let the King reign ! '

		I can not tell what he will bring , but as the humblest of his forertmners I think it will be largely ' ^ ■ ital methods , which are diflBcult , ' modeled after those which are now foimd in the very few best text-books on English literature for secondarv schools published during 1903-1904 by the book houses .

		* How richly stored with pleasant memories of authors a publisher 's mind may become after years of work at his calling , was shown to the delight of his many readers by the late
James T. Fields	PERSON	.

		But there are publishers and pub - lishers , and the charm of Mr.
Fields	PERSON	's reminis - cences was due quite as much to the story-tell - er as to the eminent persons a < bout whom he wrote .

		Other publishers have written reminis - cently since Mr.
Fields	PERSON	's book appeared , but few have approached in attractiveness of manner and interest of matter the still popular ' Yes - terdays with Authors . '

		And now the retiring head of another old and honored publishing house brings forth his store of anecdotes and impressions of the famous men and women with whom a half-century of business dealings brought him in contact , and with many of whom he stood on terms of cordial friendship .

		These octogenarian reminiscences are from the pen of Mr.
Edward Marston	PERSON	, whose name at once calls up those of his sometime associates ,
Sampson	PERSON	Low and son ,
Searle	LOCATION	, and
Eivington	LOCATION	; and with the names come back faint or vivid remembrances of books that bore their imprint , -- good old three-volume novels by
Willde Col	ORGANIZATION	- lins ,
Blackmore	PERSON	, Black ,
Eeade	LOCATION	,
George Mac	PERSON	- donald ,
Clark Russell	PERSON	, and others , and many excellent books of travel by such famous ex - plorers as
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, Mounteney-Jephson ,
Parke	PERSON	, MacGahan ,
Schweinfurth	PERSON	,
Xares	LOCATION	,
Markham	LOCATION	,
Bumaby	LOCATION	, and
Butler	PERSON	, The pleasant pages of Mr.
Marston	PERSON	's book are not especially distin - guished for elegance of style or charm of man - ner , or even for very great attention to order - liness of arrangement and accuracy of detail .

		But as they give in rapid succession glimpses of live men and women whom one is always glad to meet , the book is excellent company for a winters evening .

		At the age of twenty-one he went to seek his fortune in
London	LOCATION	, where he soon became connected with
Sampson	PERSON	Low in the book-publishing busi - ness .

		A partnership with the Lows , father and son , followed in
1856	DATE	, and with several changes of location from one street to another , and under a varying firm-name , he continued to pub - lish books , apparently with increasing success , for more than forty years .

		A memorable inci - dent of his early life in
London	LOCATION	was the death and grand public funeral of the Duke of Well - ington , the pageantry of woe being witnessed by him as the parade passed the company 's warehouse at 47
Ludgate Hill	ORGANIZATION	,
Nov. 18 , 1852	DATE	, on its way to
St. Paul	LOCATION	's , where the remains were interred .

		As the writer names

William Milburn	PERSON	, the famous blind chaplain of the

		After giving an account of the culpable careless - ness of the doctor who wrought the irreparable mischief in
Milbum	LOCATION	's boyhood , the writer quotes from a familiar poem that Mr.
Milburn	PERSON	used to recite in giving his lecture on blindness .

		The verses , probably known to many , begin thus , -- * I am old and blind , Men point to me as smitten by God 's frown . '

		They are entitled '
Milton	PERSON	's Prayer of Pa - tience , ' and have often been attributed to the blind poet himself .

		Mr.
Marston	PERSON	ascribes them to
Elizabeth Lloyd	PERSON	, ' a lady of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	. '

		But , unless we are in error , they were written by
Elizabeth L. Howell	PERSON	, to whom they are cred - ited by Miss
Edith Granger	PERSON	in her admirable and accurate ' Index to Poetry and Eecitations . '

		After quoting many letters from
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, and relating much that is of inter - est about him , the author gives an account of the lively competition among publishers for ' In
Darkest Africa	LOCATION	. '

		` On
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's return I went to
Egypt	LOCATION	to meet him , at his special request by cablegram , and I spent a delightful time with him : while there X wrote that curious little book , `` How Stanley wrote ` In
Darkest Africa	LOCATION	, ' '' It tells the whole story of ray visit , and I shall not attempt to tell the story over again .

		I carried away from
Cairo	LOCATION	a largo ; portion of the manuscript of `` In Darkest Africa . ''

		The competition which I had to encounter , and the correspondence which it involved with pub - lishers over the whole of
Europe	LOCATION	and a good deal of
Africa	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, would fill a large volume .

		I successfully overcame them all .

		I arranged for publication in

Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Portugal	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Norway	LOCATION	, Den - mark ,
Holland	LOCATION	, and
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		I am not sure that there were not two languages in the latter country .

		The competition for the American issue for this work was very great : it narrowed down eventu - ally to the bids of
Messrs Harper Brothers	ORGANIZATION	and
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		I was placed in the invidious position of being obliged to arbitrate on the competition of two friends .

		The simple method was to fix a time and accept the highest bidder .

		Before it was known by
Messrs Scribner	PERSON	that the settlement was wholly in my hands , young Mr.
Scribner	PERSON	had started for
Cairo	LOCATION	, determined to win by a coup de main .

		We passed each other in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	almost within hail , he outward bound and I homeward bound .

		Mr.
Scribner	PERSON	's visit to
Cairo	LOCATION	, though unnecessary as regarded arrang - ing for the book , was as pleasant as mine had been .

		On opening the sealed offers of Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	and Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, I found that Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	had won .

		Their offer was a magnificent one , amounting to many thousands of pounds , and Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	's was not very far behind it . '

		Speaking of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's journalistic activity in
Spain	LOCATION	during the Carlist War , the author con - cludes with this unintelligible sentence , -- ' Most unfortunately he lost the whole of his correspondence on this subject , which had appeared in '' The
New York Herald	LOCATION	, '' and this can hardly now be replaced . '

		But is not the '
Herald	ORGANIZATION	' on file in not a few large libraries ?

		A frankly communicative letter from
Captain Mahan	ORGANIZATION	contains autobiographical matter of interest , and may well be drawn on at this point .

		` Finally , I may say that the term , `` sea power , '' which now has such vogue , was deliberately adopted by me to compel attention , and , I hoped , to receive currenc3 \ Purists , I said to myself , may criticise me for marrying a Teutonic word to one of Latin

		I do not know how far this is usually the ease with phrases that obtain currencv ; my impression is that the origi - nator is himself generally surprised at their taking hold .

		I was not surprised in that sense .

		The effect produced was that which I fully purposed ; but I was surprised at the extent of my success , `` Sea power , '' in English at least , seems to have come to stay in the sense I used it .

		`` The sea Powers '' were often spoken of before , but in an entirely different manner -- not to express , as 1 meant , ' at once an abstract conception and a con - crete fact .

		It may seem odd to you , but I do not to this day understand my success .

		I had done what I intended ; I recognize that people have attributed to me a great success , and have given me abundant recognition .

		I enjoy it and am grate - ful ; but for the most part I do not myself appre - ciate the work up to the measure expressed by others . '

		Many will remember the fright suffered by the English at the prospect of a Channel tun - nel .

		The recent friendly agreement concluded between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	has given fresh hopes to the advocates of such a tunnel .

		Mr.
Marston	PERSON	shrinks at the bare thought , and quotes Captain
Mahan	PERSON	to the following effect : ' Such a tunnel would be a bridge between
France	LOCATION	and
Great Britain Historically	ORGANIZATION	, every bridge is an element of danger It may safely be predicted that once built it will not be destroyed , but that throughout any war reliance will be placed upon its defences .

		History teaches us again and again the dangers of surprise -- the dan - gers of over-confidence .

		You will have continually in your midst an open gap , absorbing a large part of your available force for its protection .

		As to the effect upon the sea power of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, it is obvious that your navy , were it tenfold its present strength , can neither protect the tunnel nor remedy the evils incurred by its passing into the hands of an enemy It is an odd kind of thing -- making one lay down the pen and muse -- to think of an open passage to
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the hands of a foe , and British ships , like toothless dogs , prowling vainly round the shores of the island . '

		And to the advocate of disarmament and inter - national confidence , it is also an odd kind of thing -- making one lay down the pen and muse -- to think of
Great Britain	LOCATION	recoiling in terror from a little round hole in the ground , which a large part of its available force is unable to protect .

		Two visits to
America	LOCATION	contribute to Mr.
Marston	PERSON	's book sundry items that will be of especial interest to cis-Atlantic readers .

		But they will wonder what sort of a whim it is that makes the writer refer to the historic seat of our oldest university as *

Pebcy F. Bickxeli	PERSON	* The Ideals of the
East	LOCATION	.

		* The fundamental difference between the
Occi	PERSON	- dental man and his brother of the Orient is psychological .

		Try as tiiey may , it is impossi - ble for Siem to think quite alike .

		Divergent mental processes stand in the way of complete mutual understanding .

		A wide gulf separates the man who naturally gives expression to even his most imaginative thoughts in direct if not prosaic diction , from him who is wont to clothe his ideas , ordinary as well as other , in pictur - esque and symbolical imagery .

		Nor is this all .

		The difference is more than one of language merely : it is also the thought relation to the accumulated beliefs , traditions , and customs of the respective races .

		To the difficulty of bridg - ing the chasm we have the testimony of
Lafca	ORGANIZATION	- dio Heam , who still felt himself an alien at heart after fourteen years of intimate associa - tion with and close study of the Japanese peo - ple , -- ^ years during which he identified himself with them in every possible way .

		Because of this difference , and because the art of a people is the expression of what is highest and noblest in their culture , it has long been realized that comprehensive interpretation of the content of Japanese art is beyond the capacity of any for - eigner .

		In making this statement it is necessary to guard against misconception .

		The art of the
Orient	ORGANIZATION	is not to be judged by a standard differ - ent from that which we should apply in consid - ering other art .

		As to its aesthetic value , it speaks for itself .

		In this respect art is a uni - versal language .

		There is not one philosophy of art for the East and another for the
West	LOCATION	.

		The aim of the artist is everywhere the same .

		His impulse is creative ; his purpose is to give organic balance and internal beauty to an arrangement of lines , masses , light and dark , and color .

		The measure of the result as art is the power and skill and insight with which these elements have been handled .

		It does not depend upon accuracy of representation , which belongs to the domain of science , nor upon any story - * The Ideals of the

		As to these and other extraneous things , all that is needful is that they be so dealt with as not to interfere with the aesthetic enjoyment of the spectator .

		But while the subject-matter with which artists have to do is only the vehicle for their aestlietic appeal , it necessarily brings into their work a host of associated ideas .

		And so , in con - sidering the art of a people so widely removed from us as the Japanese , we feel the need to imderstand much more than the art itself as such .

		Attempts at interpretation have been many : some of them are more than creditable to their authors and of undoubted value as far as they go .

		But even in their measure of success they make it apparent that the autlioritative utterance must emanate from one to the manner born .

		The more welcome , therefore , is the mes - sage conveyed in ' The Ideals of the
East	LOCATION	, ' from the pen of one eminently qualified for the task .

		The author ,
Okakura Kakuzo	PERSON	-- to follow the Japanese custom of placing the family name first , -- is a distinguished scholar and connois - seur whose name is well known to every student of his country 's art .

		If that art is to retain its ancient and distinctive characteristics , and not go down before the blighting onslaught of commercialism and foreign ideas , it will be due in no small degree to his efforts , and to the influence of the academy known as the
Nippon Bijitsuin	ORGANIZATION	, of which he is the founder and President .

		The book in which Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	has sketched the evolution of Asiatic art-ideals is written with a wealth of knowledge and penetrative insight that quite disarm the alien critic , who , lacking the broad range of information and intuitive comprehension of Oriental thought , can not hope to speak with a certainty equal to that of the author .

		Yet so widely does his reading of Indian , Chinese , and Japanese his - tory vary from what we have hitherto con - ceived , that it is difficult to accept all that he says without question .

		How far , we ask , has he built on solid ground , and to what extent on mere fable ?

		His statements are put forth with such calm assurance that it may be he has had access to sources of authentic information of which we as yet remain in ignorance .

		But the burden of proof , as the lawyers say , would seem to be upon him to show that there is not a large admixture of myth in the alleged facts upon which he bases his theory when dealing with the early history of the
East	LOCATION	.

		That , however , may be dismissed as a detail not necessarily affecting the force of the author 's argument , and the more readily when we consider the skill and accuracy with which he has handled the facts of the later periods .

		In his purview , `
Asia	LOCATION	, the great Mother , is for - ever One . '

		The transforming and unifying force , he shows us , was not so much Buddhism as Indian idealism , of which the religion of
Gautama	LOCATION	is but a phase , though the chief vehi - cle by which the culture was diffused .

		With comprehensive vision , Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	traces its progress step by step - , and has set it forth in a brief though clear and convincing summary .

		This occupies more than half of the book ; the rest is given over to a rapid survey of the his - tory of art in
Japan	LOCATION	viewed in relation thereto .

		In its larger aspect , Japanese art is thus seen to be the symbol and expression of all Asian cul - ture , -- the mirror in which its soul is reflected .

		To prevent its debasement by Hhe scorching drought of modem vulgarity ' is the cause to which Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	's talents have been devoted .

		But , as he rightly says , it is to
Asia	LOCATION	herself that the appeal must be made .

		The outcome , to quote his final words , must be ' Victory from within , or a mighty death without . '

		Eveiy sentence in this remarkable and sig - nificant book is so charged with meaning that the reviewer is constantly tempted to linger over the separate statements , instead of keeping to the argument as a whole .

		Inviting , too , are the felicitous turns of phrase to be found upon every page , and the skill with which concep - tions involving great difficulty in their verbal expression have been clearly set forth .

		The master -RCB- ^ of the English language which Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	displays is indeed amazing .

		For the misspelling of his personal name on the title page -- Kakasu instead of Kakuzo -- it may be assumed that he is not responsible .

		It is possi - ble that the reader not steeped in Oriental lore may find the book too compactly written , some of its statements too condensed and allusive for easy comprehension .

		The commentary , it is to be hoped , will be supplied by the same hand at no distant day , in the shape of a more extended and amply illustrated work upon the subject . '

		The Awakening of
Japan	LOCATION	' is marked by the game epigrammatic style and forceful utterance that characterize ' The Ideals of the
East	LOCATION	. '

		Listen to the opening words : ' The sudden development of
Japan	LOCATION	has been more or less of an enigma to foreign observers .

		She is the country of flowers and ironclads , of dashing heroism and delicate tea-cups , -- the strange border - land where quaint shadows cross each other in the twilight of the New and the Old World .

		Until recently the
West	LOCATION	has never taken
Japan	LOCATION	seriously .

		It is amusing to find nowadays that such success as we have achieved in our efforts to take a place among the family of nations appears in the eyes of many as a menace to
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		In the mys - terious , nothing is improbable .

		Exaggeration is the courtesy which fancy pays to the unknown .

		What sweeping condemnation , what absurd praise , has not the world lavished en
New Japan	LOCATION	?

		We are both the cherished child of modern progress and a dread resurrection of heathendom -- the Yellow Peril itself ! '


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 Were not the opinion so frequently expre ^ ed , it would be incredible that anyone should con - sider it possible for
Japan	LOCATION	to have reached her present stage of development in fifty years by a sudden emergence from a state of half - civilization but little removed from barbarism .

		How different is the reality , Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	shows in this impressive review of the causes that led to the downfall of the feudal system and fitted the people to assimilate and utilize extraneous knowledge when put within their reach .

		Before the awakening came from without , the national consciousness had already been stirred by the voice within , -- the tyranny of the Togugawa regime had nearly run its course .

		What Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	pleads for so eloquently in both of his books is the preservation of Asiatic culture .

		With impassioned fervor he asks : ` If the guilty conscience of some European nations has conjured up the specter of a Yellow Peril , may not the suffering soul of
Asia	LOCATION	wail over the realities of the `` White Disaster ! '

		And again : ' The venerable East still distinguishes between means and ends .

		The West is for progress , but progress toward whatf When material efficiency is complete , what end , asks
Asia	LOCATION	, will have been accomplish ^ !

		When the passion of fraternity has ■ culminated in universal cooperation , what purpose is it to serve ?

		If mere self-interest , where do we find the boasted advance ! '

		WTiere indeed ?

		Are not stocks and bonds better than art ?

		Is not the smoke of factory chimneys grateful to the nostrils of the truly enlightened man ?

		Is it not better to be an operative than to remain an independent pro- ducer ?

		Is not cheapness more desirable than quality ?

		That the West can ever accept the views of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	scholarship in regard to such matters , is asking too much .

		Does it not assert that * aggressive nations have no conscience , ' and that ' In the West , international morality remains far below the standard to which indi - vidual morality has attained ? '

		Notwithstanding the imminence of the White Peril , Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	's attitude is far from despondent .

		He finds a solid foundation for his hopes in the strength of the national spirit and the revivals of ancient customs now in progress .

		But he is not happy in citing the names of
Katsuo	PERSON	,
Zesshin	LOCATION	,
Hogai	PERSON	, and Gaho , to prove that the art of old
Japan	LOCATION	still lives , for
Zesshin	PERSON	and
Hogai	PERSON	were ` gathered to their fathers ' some years ago .

		Fortunately ,
Gaho	PERSON	and
Natsuo	PERSON	are not the only eminent men among living Japanese artists ; but in their effort to uphold the glories and traditions of the past , they have to contend against ' the unfortunately con - temptuous attitude which the average Westerner assumes toward everything connected with
Ori	PERSON	- ental civilization , ' which , as Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	points out , tends to destroy the self-confidence of the Japanese in their canons of art .

		The menace is from the inroad of Western ideas : the great dif - ficulty ' lies in the fact that Japanese art stands alone in the world , without immediate possibil - ity of any accession or reinforcement from kin - dred ideal or technique . '

		Yet to Western ideas as such , Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	displays no aversion .

		Only as they tend to destroy the characteristic flavor of Asian culture do tiiey arouse his hos - tility .

		In other fields he bids them weloome , as , for example , the elevation of the social status of womEui , which he warmly commends and asserts to be * the elevation of the race . '

		A
Napoleonic Aftermath	ORGANIZATION	.

		* For his two-volume work on
Napoleon I.	PERSON	, published some three years ago , Mr.
J. Holland Kose	PERSON	received a very general approval , both on account of the method of presentation and because of the inclusion of new material dis - covered by researches in the archives of the Brit - ish foreign office .

		The same author now pre - sents a volume of essays most of which deal with incidents in , or aspects of , the Napoleonic career that could not consistently be treated at length in the more formal work , but which yet have interest in themselves .

		All but four of these essays have been published in various magazines , and those thus published are quite distinct from the others in that they are , with one exception , largely technical , referring to disputed incidents which are primarily of inter - est to the historical student alone .

		Such , for example , are the essays on ' A British Agent at Tilsit , ' an attempt to determine the identity of the man who discovered the secret of the plans adopted by
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Alexander	PERSON	in their famous interview on the raft at Tilsit , and '
Britain	LOCATION	's Food Supply in the Napoleonic War , ' a statistical examination of prices to esti - mate the effectiveness of the continental block - ade .

		The four new studies deal with larger questions of wider interest , though even here the reader must have a general familiarity with the events of European history during the Napoleonic period to understand what Mr.
Eose	PERSON	is writing about .

		The purpose of the first of these new essays , '
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Fichte	PERSON	, and the Idealist Revolt against
Napoleon	PERSON	, ' is to examine the attitude of literary men of genius at the incep - tion of the French revolution , and to show how and why that attitude was changed by the course of political events .

		Briefly put , Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's •
Napoleoxic Studies	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
J. Holland Rose	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, analysis of this change is that these writers , and others like
Coleridge	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	and Czar - toryski in
Russia	LOCATION	, passed from extreme admira - tion to extreme hatred for Fraace , because the French people were content to sacrifice humani - tarian and idealistic principles to material bene - fits and military glory .

		In the case of Words - worth , this was due not so much to dislike for the person and activities of Napoleon himself as to bitter sorrow at the failure of
France	LOCATION	to fulfill the glorious promise of the early revolu - tion , when the youth of the nation rejoiced in projects full of generous intentions for the peoples of all
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The early feeling of the German writers was much like that of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, but was in addition strikingly lacking in any patriotic national sense , the gene - ral tendency of German literature being to deny the principle of national or race unity .

		For such men the humiliation and suffering of Ger - many under
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's control acted as a cura - tive medicine , developing the inherent but hith - erto undiscovered sense of loyalty to country , and permitting them a patriotic enthusiasm in later life that did much to compensate for the loss of earlier enthusiasm for French ideals of equality .

		There is nothing in Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's exami - nation that has not previously been brought out by other writers in separate essays on the vari - ous individuals enumerated , but they are here grouped as representative of a world-wide movement which had its unmistakable influence in uniting
Europe	LOCATION	against
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		The one reprinted essay of general rather than technical interest is ' The Religious Belief of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, ' previously published in * The Quarterly Review ' for
October , 1903	DATE	.

		Most historians have treated very briefly , or have passed over in silence the question of actual religious belief , though some have defended
Napoleon	PERSON	as having high moral perceptions even though he made no attempt to realize such per - ceptions in practise .

		With such writers moral perceptions are made to stand in the place of religious belief .

		It is with the latter alone that Mr.
Rose	PERSON	is concerned .

		He finds that
Napoleon	PERSON	in early life was in no way guided by religious belief , and that in the years when he was an enthusiast in the cause of the revolution , his indifference became contempt .

		But when
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon became a leader and ruler of great masses of men , he was quick to recognize the power of religious conviction upon others and to utilize it as a tool in executing his political plans .

		Thus when at
St. Helena	LOCATION	, in discussing his alliance with the Pope in
1800	DATE	, and his deter - mination to make
France	LOCATION	Catholic rather than Protestant , he said : / These parties , by tearing one another to pieces , would have annihilated
France	LOCATION	, and would have made her the slave of
Europe	LOCATION	, when my ambition was to make her the mistress of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		With the aid of Catholicism I should more easily attain all my great results .

		Abroad , Catholicism would keep the Pope on my side ; and with my influence , and our forces in
Italy	LOCATION	, I did not despair of having , sooner or later , by one means or another , the direc - tion of this Pope .

		And thenceforth what an influ - ence !

		What a lever of opinion for the rest of the world !

		Never in all my quarrels with the Pope have I touched a dogma . '

		In his earlier career he even applied political and military measurements to spiritual author - ity , instructing the French minister at
Rome	LOCATION	to ` treat with the Pope as if he had 200,000 men , ' but later he became convinced that such spiritual authority had not the weight of a feather in the game of world politics .

		In
1807	DATE	when , just after the battle of Essling , the papal nuncio found him and read to him the bull of excommunication ,
Napoleon	PERSON	replied , ' You have done your duty ; you are a very brave man ; I esteem you ' ; but he added , ' What can the Pope do ?

		I have 300,000 men under my orders .

		With his lightning can he make the arms fall from my soldiers ' hands ? '

		From these and similar incidents , Mr.
Rose	PERSON	seeks to show that
Napoleon	PERSON	's attitude toward religion ` was at bottom determined by political considerations , ' and he also denies any real religious change in the later years spent at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		Regarding the new essays in this volume it is sufficient to say that they serve to emphasize the value of the research Avork which Mr.
Rose	PERSON	has done in the British archives , and to prove that in spite of the great number of scholarly studies of the Napoleonic era , large deposits of unused material still exist .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	is at his best when dealing with diplomatic history ; his chief study has been in that direction , and it is therefore natural that the principal value of the present volume should lie in the essays which are diplomatic studies .

		The remaining three of the new papers are of this character . '


Pitt	PERSON	's Plans for the Settlement of
Europe	LOCATION	' is a resume of new material bearing on the vari - ous proposals made for such settlement during
Pitt	PERSON	's two administrations . '


Egypt	LOCATION	during the
First British Occupation	ORGANIZATION	' describes among other incidents the squabbles of British and French officials over the possession of collections made by French savants , the terms of the French capitulation having forbidden the carrying away of historical or scientific relics ; the
Mari	PERSON	- etta stone was involved in this controversy . '


Austria	LOCATION	and the
Downfall of Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	' places more emphasis than has been customary in his - tory upon the importance of the position and acts of
Austria	LOCATION	in
1813	DATE	and
1814	DATE	.

		All of these topics are treated in such a way as to make them of general interest , though the proof fur - nished is in each case new and of a technical nature .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	has in fact reached that .


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTATi 4a fortunate position where , with a reputation for scholarly and careful work solidly established , he is able to select larger topics for presenta - tion without feeling it necessary to burden his readers with an undue amount of mere material in way of proof .

		The new essays in the pres - ent volume are an excellent illustration of this .

		A WOMAX 'S REMryiSCENCES OF Peace and TTar .

		* It is not often that we are given at the same time two such entertaining and instructive vol - umes of reminiscences as those of Mrs. Clay and Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	, both of which recently appeared .

		Both cover the same period -- the fifties and the sixties ; and both depict the same places and scenes and people --
Washington	LOCATION	in the decade before the .

		war ,
Kichmond	PERSON	and the Confederacy , and the ruin of the South .

		Mrs.
Clay	PERSON	was a brilliant , wise , witty woman of the worid in the time she describes , a leader in
Washington	LOCATION	society ; Mrs.
Prjor	PERSON	was also of that society , but more inclined to the pleasures of the domes - tic circle .

		Her book gives us a better under - standing of the life of Confederate women than does that of Mrs.
Clay	PERSON	, who writes princi - pally of official personages .

		Mrs. Pr3or is the wife of one who has had a varied career , -- newspaper editor in
Richmond	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	, special minister to
Greece	LOCATION	, elected in
1856	DATE	to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and after secession a
Confederate Congressman	ORGANIZATION	, a colonel , a general , and a private soldier .

		Since the war he has become known as one of the ablest of
Xew York	LOCATION	law -RCB- - ers , a prominent politician in
Xew York state	LOCATION	, and judge of its Supreme Couri ; .

		Mrs.
Pnor	PERSON	devotes six interesting chapters to her
Washington	LOCATION	life , -- to descriptions of the official society and the notable persons whom she knew , the fashions and manners of the fifties , the entertainments of ante-bellum
Washington	LOCATION	, and of the stormy session of the last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the old
Union	ORGANIZATION	.


Washington	LOCATION	was then in some respects a provincial capital , with only a political and therefore floating population ; but we have Mrs.
Prs	PERSON	` ors word that it was a very pleasant place in which to live , and in the
spring	DATE	a very pretty country town .

		Though the ` old residents ' held aloof , official society was then composed of people who were there because they were of importance at home ; there were few of the modem ' plutocrats ' who now go to Wash - ington to get the social privileges denied them elsewhere .

		In those days , literary men found
Washington	LOCATION	a pleasant place to live in ; and President Fillmore gathered about him su ch • Remixiscences of Peace and War .

		men as
G. P. R. James	PERSON	,
John P. Kennedy	PERSON	,
Washington Irving	LOCATION	, and other men of letters .

		But when sectional passions ran high , everj ' - thing was forgotten save politics , and the death of Irving was almost unnoticed on account of the hanging of
John Brown	PERSON	.

		Under
Pierce	PERSON	and
Buchanan	PERSON	, and with the growth of the Republi - can party , sectional lines began to be drawn in social
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Extremists seldom and seldomer met .

		Naturally , imder Democratic Presidents the official society was predominantly Demo - cratic ; and among the Democrats the influence of Southerners , men and women , was strongly felt .

		It was Admiral
Porter	PERSON	's theory , that had
Washington	LOCATION	been a livelier place , with more amusements and diversions , during the last two administrations before the war , the Southerners would not have seceded .

		On account of family bereavement , Mrs.
Pierce	PERSON	did not entertain ; and
Buchanan	PERSON	was a solitary old bachelor who did not understand the meaning of amusement .

		However , Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	describes a splendid regime in those few years before the end .

		Wash - ington suppers of the late fifties almost rivalled the feasts of the Roman emperors .

		But there were drawbacks .

		At one of President
Buchan	PERSON	- an 's dinners , Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	was taken in by a backwoods Congressman who had stimulated himself too freely , and distressed Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	by winking at Miss
Harriet Lane	PERSON	, the niece of the President .

		The coming of the first Japa - nese embassy was an event in
Washington	LOCATION	his - tory , and Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	became the proud first American possessor of a Japanese fan .

		Of fashions and dressmakers of the period , Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	has much to say .

		Her philosophy of dress will be interesting to the present age .

		Those were leisurely , spacious , expansive times , when there was still plenty of room in the world , and people dressed accordingly .

		We are told that the immense hoopskirts and marvel - lous headgear were not ugly , but were weU suited to expensive dressing .

		Incidentally it comes out that dresses were extremely low in the neck , and that sermons were then preached against them ; but having been invented about
1280	DATE	and preached against since then , Mrs. Pr -RCB- or predicts they will survive .

		That men have no business interfering in affairs of dress , she evidently believes , and illustrates by Mr.
Marcy	PERSON	's case .

		He , when
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, ordered American ministers abroad to appear only in plain civilian dress .

		At several courts the ministers were informed that to wear such dress would be considered disrespectful .

		Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	, in
England	LOCATION	, when
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	opened , ' had nothing to wear , ' and his absence came near causing an inquiry in
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment .

		Finally he appeared at court in the pre - scribed civilian dress , but wearing a sword ` to distinguish myself from the upper court serv - 44 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Such was the effect of a man 's med - dling with matters of dress .


Washington	LOCATION	life on the eve of war was not pleasant .

		People were restless and fevered with anxiety ; political questions affected society , and there was no longer much intercourse between people of the South and those of the -RSB- !

		^ orth .

		Mrs.
Douglas	PERSON	cut all her husband 's opponents ; and many others did likewise .

		The Battle of the
Giants	ORGANIZATION	was on in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and members spoke for days on the state of the country .

		All else was neglected for this .

		Mem - bers were wild with passion , and bitter lan - ^ age aroused bitter feelings .

		Friends of many years no longer greeted one another .

		President
Buchanan	PERSON	prayed that secession might ` not • come in my time , ' and almost died of anxiety .

		When
South Carolina	LOCATION	seceded he was at a wed - ding-party ; and it fell to Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	to break the news to him .

		She says that he was stunned .

		After the inauguration of President Lincoln , Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	went with her husband to the great gathering of the Virginians , who came from all over the world when the rallying-cry was the exhortation of old Sir
George Somers	PERSON	of the ' Sea Venture , ' -- ' Be true to duty , and return to
Virginia	LOCATION	. '

		Few failed to obey the call . '

		* The very earth trembled at the tramp of the Virginians , as they marched to the assize of arms of the Mother of them all . '

		Then fol - lowed the enthusiastic preparation for the impending conflict .

		Volunteers were fitted out jand sent to the front .

		At first Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	endeav - ored to keep near her husband , who was in the army ; but this was difficult , so she sent her • children to relatives while she herself nursed the sick and wounded in the hospitals .

		During the last years of the war she gathered her little family together in
Petersburg	LOCATION	, almost within the battle-lines ; and there , in the midst of the siege , in danger and in want , she fought the wolf from the door , just as did so many other Southern women .

		Her
Washington	LOCATION	finery was made over and sold to the wives of speculators in
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		Such expedients carried the family through the last dark days before the surrender , when the husband and father was in a , Northern prison .

		Some of the letters quoted tell more than has been generally known before of the desper - ate condition of the poorer people of Eichmond long before the war ended .

		There is a descrip - tion , for instance , of the rising of the women in the ` Bread Eiot . '

		The original account of Gen - eral
Lee	PERSON	's bit of borrowed bacon is here given .

		On one occasion he had two biscuits for break - fast , and gave one of them to an Irish member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	who was visiting him .

		Lee 's quarters at
Petersburg	LOCATION	were near Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	's home .

		The plundering propensities of Federal sol - diers are compared with the conduct of the Confederates under Lee and of the British under Comwallis , to the discredit of the former .

		McClellan , Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	declares , was a gentie - raan , but some of the other Federal command - ers were not .

		There is a ludicrous glimpse of
Sheridan	PERSON	, who , after seizing Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	's house for his own use , sends her his photograph .

		And there was a
New England	LOCATION	officer who , after having taken General Pr ^ ` or 's fine horse , wrote back informing the General of the horse 's good health , and asking for its pedigree .

		There was nothing to do in
Virginia	LOCATION	after the war .

		So Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	pawned her watch and ring , and with the money ,
Roger A. Pryor	PERSON	, ex - ' rebel ' General and Congressman , went to
New York	LOCATION	to start anew .

		These memoirs show unconsciously the differ - ence between the
Border South	ORGANIZATION	and the Lower South of
1861	DATE	.

		In secession the Virginians held back , and there was a strong Union party until the last , but it died in a day when Lincoln called for troops .

		Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	criticizes some - what the policy of the Confederacy , -- directed , it will be remembered , by men of the Lower South , -- blaming the leaders for the war and for dragging it out after longer resistance was hopeless .

		She did not expect secession when it came , and , like other Virginians , expected much from the
Virginia Peace Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		She says that in
1860	DATE	the people of
Charleston	LOCATION	turned the cold shoulder to the Northern delegates to the Democratic Convention , thus widening the breach between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Rich - mond admtnstration is mildly but persistently criticised .

		In this connection Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	calls attention to a rather important fact : There never was any official recognition of gallant action by the Confederate government , no men - tion in orders , no medals , no promotion on the field .


Davis	PERSON	, the author believes , opposed
Pryor	PERSON	's further promotion after he had been made brigadier-general ; consequently
Pryor	PERSON	resigned and entered the ranks as a private soldier .

		It should be remembered , however , that the Presi - dent was also severely criticised by the
Gulf States Congressmen	ORGANIZATION	for partiality to Virginians , and especially for making Pryor a brigadier - general .

		It will always be difficult for Vir - ginians to understand how much the Lower South sacrificed for
Richmond	LOCATION	during the last years of the war .

		The reminiscences are brightly told ; there is little dwelling on the dark side of things , and the tendency of the book is irenic .

		As a contri - bution to the history of the period it is of value not so much for the facts set forth as for the color and feeling that can be found only in these first-hand accounts .

		THE DIAL 45 IX THE Realm of the Bibee .

		* Recent years liave seen notable progress in the conception and statement of the character - and scope of biblical theolog -RCB- ' .

		German works in considerable numbers have devoted their pages to its treatment , but it was conceded that `` the final word had been by no means spoken on this vital theme . '

		The International Theologi - < ?

		al Library ' projected a work on this line sev - eral years ago .

		and secured the consent of Pro- fessor
Davidson	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	to prepare it .

		Years swept by with no visible completion of the task , until the death of Dr.
Davidaon	PERSON	in
1902	DATE	, As a consequence of this calamity ,
Prin	PERSON	- ■ cipal Salniond undertook to edit the manu - scripts that were probably designed , at some later date , to constitute the promised volume on the Biblical Theolog -RCB- ^ of the Old Testament .

		The editor found no easy task in preparing for publication manuscripts that had had several revisions at the hand of the author .

		But the work has been done ^ ith great conscientious - ness , and as a rule with eminent success ; and it lias given iis in permanent form some of the fundamental principles of the Old Testament : as seen and interpreted by one of the leading Old Testament scholars of this age .

		The chap - ter arrangement of the volume is significant , as embodying in the authors mind the dominating ideas of the Old Testament .

		The chapters dis - < niss -LRB- 1 -RRB- the science of Old Testament theology , -LCB- 2 -RRB- the doctrine of God , -LRB- 3 -RRB- the Divine nature , -LCB- 4 -RRB- the Spirit of God , -LRB- 5 -RRB- the Divine attri - butes , -LRB- 6 -RRB- the doctrine of good and evil , -LRB- 7 -RRB- sin , -LRB- 8 -RRB- the doctrine of redemption , -LRB- 9 -RRB- supra - human good and evil , -LRB- 10 -RRB- priesthood and atonement .

		-LRB- 11 -RRB- the doctrine of the last things -- ^ the Messianic idea , -LRB- 12 -RRB- immortalitv * .

		These themes are treated not by the chronological but by the topical method .

		Dr.
Davidson	PERSON	's known views of the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment led us to expect a discussion of each theme on the basis of its development or growth .

		But in this we are somewhat disappointed .

		Though a cautious critic , his caution seems to have restrained him from giving everywhere an up-to - date scientific treatment of Ms subject .

		He accepts the analysis of the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	, of the historical books , and of the double assignment of Isaiali .

Hastings	PERSON	's * Dictionary of the
Bible	LOCATION	, ' com - pleted in
1902	DATE	, in four volumes , is a monu - mental work .

		But its compass and treatment could not include all the themes which a
Bible	LOCATION	- student of to-day expects to find in such a dic - tionary .

		Besides , the last five years have seen several important discoveries that affect the interpretation of the Old and New Testaments , and these should be put within the reach of Bible-students by men who can speak authori - tatively .

		As time progresses , there are more and more themes that must demand the careful consideration of every student of the Scrip - tures .

		An ' Extra Volume ' has been prepared and published to meet just this new require - ment .

		It contains thirty-eight articles by spe - cialists , covering several of the most important side-issues of the Bible-students .

		Some of the most notable , for the newness of matter or the length of the contribution , are the following : ' Agrapha , ' by Professor Eopes of
Harvard	LOCATION	; ' Code of
Hammurabi	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
Johns	PERSON	of Cam - bridge ; ' Papyri , ' by Professor
Buhl	PERSON	of
Copen	PERSON	- hagen : ' Eeligion of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and x ^ ssyria , ' by
Professor Jastrow of University of Pennsylva	ORGANIZATION	- nia ; * Eeligion of
Israel	LOCATION	, ' by Professor Kautzsch of
Halle	LOCATION	; ' Sermon on the Mount , ' by
Professor Yotaw of University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	; and ' Textual Criticism of the New Testament , ' by Dr.
Mur	PERSON	- ray of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each of these contributions puts into the hands of Bible-studente matter of authoritative value , and the best that we may hope to have for some years to come .

		The arti - cle on the ' Eeligion of
Israel	LOCATION	' covers 123 double-column pages , is very exhaustive , and would make a large volume as books are made to-day .

		The last 200 pages contain the working apparatus for the entire work , inclusive of this extra volume .

		They include the name of each ^ \ - riter and his contributions , an alphabetic list of all themes discussed in the entire work , an index of Scripture passages and other literature , a full list of Hebrew and Greek words , an index to the all-too-few illustrations .

		46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, and a list of the thirteen maps that embellish the five volumes .

		The completion of this great work for Biblical students and scholars is a tri - umph .

		Its comprehensiveness , its scholarship , its progres & iveness , and its aggressiveness , give it first place among all dictionaries of the
Bible	LOCATION	in the English language .

		Professor
Genung	PERSON	's ' Epic of the Inner Life / a study of the
Book of Job	ORGANIZATION	, has won a place in the literature of that noble book .

		The same author has now turned his attention and thought to another book of the Old Testament that has proved to be a riddle to many readers .

		This work is based on sound scholarship , and pro- ceeds along the highway of literary excellence .

		About the first half of the volume is given to a frank discussion of ' The Book and its World , ' followed by *
Koheleth	PERSON	's Response to his Time , ' '' The Issue in Character , ' and ^ The Literary Shaping . '

		The author is at his best in dealing with current questions regarding this puzzling book .

		His discussion reveals a well-balanced sense of the literary and spiritual values that are to be found in
Koheleth	LOCATION	, that is , the preacher .

		The long-discussed and troublesome questions as to the authorship of
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	are surveyed so as to give the reader an idea of some of the problems that must be dealt with in any interpretation that may be adopted .

		The last half of the volume is a new translation of the book out of the Hebrew , with a summary of thought on the margins .

		On the lower part of each page there is a commentary , in smaller type , which puts certain words and phrases under the exegetieal microscope .

		In summing up , the author says : ' The new question in vir - tual control is .

		What is that thing reward after all , -- that object to which all life and labor are so prevailingly keyed ?

		The truest answer to all questions is in conclusion '' Fear God and keep his commandments , for this is the sum of manhood . '' '

		moved among his fellows .

		The attempt is always a bold one , and he who makes it must be excep - tionally endowed with sympathy and penetrative insight .

		Among the most ingenious and success - ful experiments upon this baffling theme must surely be reckoned the little two-act drama of Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	, by him entitled `
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, Pedagogue and Poacher , ' and made to deal with the deer-stealing episode of the poet 's legendary youth .

		Here we have the young
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, hardly more than a lad , but some time since entrapped into marriage with a shrewish and puritanical woman several years his senior , and already planning for emancipation and the free life of
London	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , he has already des - patched to a friend in the city the first fruits of his invention , a comedy entitled ` The Taming of a Shrew , ' for which his own domestic experiences have afforded abundant material in the way of characterization , although for the taming process he must perforce draw upon his imagination .

		The deer-stealing escapade is the central feature of Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's play , and in consequence thereof Shakespeare and the scholars who have joined him in the moonlight adventure are haled before the outraged justice of Sir
Thomas Lucy	PERSON	.

		Sir
Thomas	PERSON	is by way of being a euphuist , and
Lady Lucy	PERSON	, who once had secret leanings toward the yooithful poet , is piqued that he should have become the possession of
Mistress Hathaway	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the close , he is saved from condign punishment by the api > earance of
Lord Leicester	LOCATION	, who comes as a. messenger from the Queen -LRB- to whom the comedy has been read -RRB- and bears the poet away to the court .

		W ^ e quote the lines in which
Ann Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	advises Sir
Thomas	PERSON	that the lash would be a proper punishment for her erring spouse . '

		Long have I groaned o'er
William	LOCATION	's evil courses .

		And mourned to know my household fed by rapine , And my own stomach 's pure integrity Polluted by his depredations .

		How oft when spit hath turned , or caldron bubbled .

		Mid savoury smells and steams have I with voice Gentle and low , an excellent thing in woman .

		Demanded ,
William	LOCATION	, whence this venison ?

		And he would laugh , and cite some silly tale Of Theseus or the ghost of Heme the
Hunter	PERSON	.

		Pardon I pray not then , but penalty Conducive to his reformation ; Like lightning , sanctifying where it strikes , And in my poor conceit , the lash , applied By loving spirits wielding arms of flesh Best scared this poaching devil out of him . '

		He is not to be punished too severely , but just enough to make him helpless for a few days , , wherein the faithful wife Taay find her oppor - tunity to chide him for his misdeeds . '

		Beseech you then of your great charity Suffer the sinner 's weal to overpoise The burdened scale of his transgressions , Using such nice adjustment of the lash As but a week may bind him to his bed .

		Where he may call Repentance to efface The long score he hath run up with the Fiend , And be his own inquisitor , things past Summoning to sessions of sweet silent thought .

		Save when I moralise the spectacle . '

		Shakespeare 's defense in court is of a nature to enrage Sir
Thomas	PERSON	beyond measure , and the luckless poet is condemned to the three-fold pen -

DIAX	ORGANIZATION	.

		47 alty of flogging , imprisonment , and banishment from the shire .

		Handed over to the constable for execution , the latter says : ' Sir
Thomas	PERSON	, I 'm afeared to touch the man .

		Thou heardest ?

		he hath a familiar spirit .

		Perchance an impish sootikin , but haply Tail-switching Lucifer , Hell 's emperor . '

		To this
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	replies : '
Aye	PERSON	, man , I hold in fee ten thousand spirits .

		And more can summon from the vasty deep .

		Who at my word shall seize thy knight and thee And set bemocked upon the public stage .

		Stuff for the himaourous world 's derision . '

		It will have been noticed from the above extracts that Dr.
Gamett	PERSON	has made a large use of Shakespearian lines , distributing them impar - tially among the several characters .

		This is one of the noteworthy features of the drama , and may be further illustrated by the following striking words , placed in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's mouth when he announces to his wife his early departure for ^ prodigious
London	LOCATION	' : ' And I will seek a manly soul , and wear him In my heart 's core , even in my heart of hearts .

		And in high verse I will eternise him .

		Blazoning his beauty forth , his name concealing To set the wide world wondering who he was .

		And sharp debate shall drain the inky stands Of sage and scholar labouring to divine If worth it was of his , or wit of mine . '

		Such is Dr.
Gamett	PERSON	's way of accounting for the mysterj - of the sonnets .

		` The Sin of
David	PERSON	, ' by Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, is a modem version -LRB- not too modem -RRB- of the adulterous love of the King of
Israel	LOCATION	and the wife of Uriah the
Hittite	ORGANIZATION	.

		The scene is Eng - land , the epoch that of the Cromwellian wars .

		Sir
Hubert Lisle	PERSON	, commander of a section of the Parliamentary forces , is captivated by the young wife of Colonel
Mardyke	PERSON	, an aged and austere puritan , and , to clear his path , despatehes the latter upon an errand that means ceii ^ in death .

		For several years thereafter , he enjoys the fruits of his despicable act as far as an uneasy consci - ence will permit , but in the end is sadly stricken by the judgment of God in the death of the child that the woman has borne to him .

		Her eyes also are opened by this calamity , and she at first turns from her husband with loathing , but afterwards consents to a sort of chastened reconciliation .

		This old story of sin and expiation is told in the simplest form ; the work is bare of ornament or accessory , and its poignancy is all the more effect - ive for the severe priming of the author 's imagi - nation .

		The verse is , as we had a right to expect from Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, dignified and filled with a haunting melodious charm .

		It is best exhibited by passages of one or two lines , such as ` Thou hast unlocked the loveliness of earth , ' or as ' And I must bide , till this full beauty drop `` Which even divinity did flush to dream , ' or as ' How o'er the Fenland hath grown fairy land And all these levels gleam as passionate As the high gardens of Assyrian Kings . '

		Longer passages are not so easy of extraction , but the one following may , perhaps , be held an adequate illustration of this latest work of an accomplished poet in its more sustained flights .

		The passage is all but the closing one of this three-act drama . '

		Our former marriage , though by holy bell And melody of lifted voices blest , Was yet in madness of the blood conceived And bom of murder : therefore is the child Withdrawn , that we might feel the sting of flesh Corruptible ; yet he in that withdrawal Folded upon the bosom of the Father , Hath joined us in a marriage everlasting ; Marriage at best of spirit , not of sense .

		Whose ritual is memory and repentance .

		Whose sacrament this deep and mutual wound .

		Whose covenant the all that might have been .

		And to this troth majestic shadows throng .

		And stand about as in dumb sympathy .

		In presence of these silent witnesses .

		And one perchance that carrieth now a babe , I take in mine thy hand and call thee wife -- Wife , wife , till the grave-shattering trumpet ! '

		If the public of a century ago was startled and shocked by the , audacity of
Byron	PERSON	's '
Cain	PERSON	, ' it is interesting to speculate concerning what its emo - tions would have been could it have foreseen the `
Cain	PERSON	' of Mr.
George Cabot	PERSON	Lodge .

		For Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	has still further allegorized the Biblical allegory , and boldly presented the flgure of the first murderer as that of a Prometheus or Savior of mankind .

		He slays Abel , not from envy or a sudden fit of anger , but with reasoned and elo - quently defended purpose , because he sees in the cringing and submissive nature of his brother a menace to the future generations that might
spring	DATE	from his loins . '

		The cause is grave beyond thy power of thought And holds dominion both for thee and me .

		Who share the self-same trust and equally Safeguard the sacred heritage of life .

		We are not merely men but more than men Since we are pregnant of futurity .

		We are not measured by the fretful years That span our being , since we store the seed Of myriad generations yet unborn .

		We are the start of young humanities !

		We are the
spring	DATE	and freshet of mighty streams .

		That thro ' the reach of the imending years .

		As thro ' vast fields where darkness wars with dawn .

		Shall keep their fruitful and resistless way !

		We have within us such an utterance As once proclaimed shall peal forevermore .

		Echoed and multiplied from age to age , Down thro * the endless labyrinth of time I We are the scabbard of a sword of flame .

		We are the wardens of the
House of Life	ORGANIZATION	, We are the guardians of a sacred fire .

		We are the gates of Dawn , -- the
First of Men !	ORGANIZATION

		Such is the cause !

		-- for this we shall not yield The torch of freedom to the winds of fear .

		Nor blight the burgeon from the seed of truth With frost of lies or dust of ignorance !

		Nay , we must shield the torch and gruard the flower ; We must be perfect in our sacred trust ; We must preserve , in strength and faith and love .

		Our whole inheritance that all may share !

		-- Not for the safety of a mean content .

		Not in the terrour of a wrathful God , Shall we renounce the treasure and the task .

		Or sell the birthright of the Sons of Man ! '

		And so , deliberately and with love for his brother in his heart ,
Cain	PERSON	slays Abel , and , seek - ing their mother afterward , justifies his act .

		Wrung by her grief , she is nevertheless persuaded by his eloquence , and blesses him in the end . '

		Till now my tears have blinded me ; at last I see and know -- thou art the Son of Man , Thou art the Saviour -- and my son , my son !

		Love and forgive me !

		for the blood of
Abel Rose	ORGANIZATION	, a red mist between thy soul and mine !

		Now I am weak no more ; I say to thee : 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	> Go forth , go forth ; lonely and godlike man !

		My heart will follow tho ' my feet must stay . '

		After this tender and moving scene of parting ,
Cain	PERSON	goes forth to take up his burden , much as Prometheus goes to meet his doom in Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's poem of ` The Fire-Bringer . ' '

		Farewell !

		my will and mine alone Has made me outcast from the laws of men .

		And from God 's laws , and from the homes of men .

		I am the man I am : no cause but this Hast cast me naked and lonely from the pale .

		To wander , alien in the
Academe	LOCATION	, Cursed and derided in the market-place .

		Slandered and scourged before the shrines of God .

		O I shall weary with all the woes of the world !

		And when I shall lift up the immortal light Like dawn in the dark places of men 's souls .

		All men shall hail it as a ruinous fire Born for their world 's destruction ; they shall rise .

		Nerved with ferocious fear , and hale me forth .

		Seize me , traduce me , judge me , and condemn , -- And press the hemlock to my unshrinking lips Or nail my scourged flesh naked to the cross ! '

		The solemn burden and the stately march of this fine poem has been impressively illustrated by the foregoing passages .

		It remains to give one brief example of Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	's diction in a tender and lyrical mood .

		The words are
Abel	ORGANIZATION	's , just as he is about to make his sacrifice at the altar . '

		The golden sandals of reluctant day Climb the broad shoulders of the heavenward hills .

		Earth fills with darkness like a shallow bowl And sleep weighs down the weary lids of life .

		peace of God , vigil of God 's great love , 1 feel you now , in vast serenity .

		Brood like a benediction on the world ! '

		The scheme of this work is as simple as possi - ble .

		The only speakers are Adam , Eve ,
Cain	PERSON	, and Abel , unless we add the voice of God , heard from time to time .

		Of the three acts , the first belongs mainly to
Adam	PERSON	and Eve , the second to the brethren and the tragedy , the third to
Cain	PERSON	's reconciliation with his mother .

		The diction of the poem is almost as severe as its outline , and is sustained throughout at a lofty pitch .

		The three dramas thus far described are strictly closet affairs ; no one would think of plac - ing them upon the boards of any actual stage .

		With Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's ` Judith of
Bethulia	LOCATION	' the case is different , for this drama was written not only with an eye to stage-production in general , but as a vehicle for the talent of a particular actress .

		The actual performance , with
Miss O'Neil	PERSON	in the titular part , took place in
Boston	LOCATION
last October	DATE	.

		The four acts of the play , moreover , are based upon the author 's poem of `
Judith	PERSON	and Holo - f ernes , ' from which lines and lengthy passages are freely borrowed and incorporated into the dramatic work .

		We select for reproduction the climacteric passage , the monologue of
Judith	PERSON	in the tent , just before she slays the sleeping Holofemes . '

		I did not longer dare to look on him .

		Lest I should lose my reason through my eyes .

		This man -- this man , had he been of my race , And I a maiden , and we two bad met -- What visions mock me !

		Some ancestral sin Hath left a taint of madness in my bra , in .

		Were I not I , I would unbind my hair And let the tresses cool his fevered cheek , And take him in my arms -- Oh , am I mad ?

		Yonder the watch-fires fiare upon the walls .

		Like red hands pleading to me through the dark ; There famished women weep , and have no hope .

		The moan of children moaning in the streets Tears at my heart .

		O God !

		have I a heart ?

		Why do I falter !

		Thou that rulest all .

		Hold not Thy favor from me that I seek This night to be Thy instrument !

		Dear Lord , Look down on me , a widow of
Judea	LOCATION	, A feeble thing unless Thou sendest strength !

		A woman such as I slew Sisera .

		The hand that pierced his temples with a nail Was soft and gentle , like to mine , a hand Moulded to press a babe against her breast !

		Thou didst sustain her .

		Oh , sustain Thou me That I may free Thy chosen from their chains !

		-- Each sinew in my body turns to steel , My pulses quicken , I no longer fear !

		My prayer has reached Him , sitting there on high !

		The hour is come I dreamed of !

		This for thee O
Israel	LOCATION	, my people , this for thee ! '

		This is probably the finest page of a book that is dignified and impressive throughout , a book not unworthy of the trained artistic hand which brings it to us as a gift .

		` Tristan and
Isolde	PERSON	' is a tragedy by Mr.
Louis K. Anspacher	PERSON	.

		Structurally , it is weakened by being dragged out through five acts , instea-d of the three in which the unening dramatic instinct of
Wagner	PERSON	realized that it must be moulded .

		In the present work , the voyage to
Cornwall	LOCATION	is sup - pressed altogether , its happenings being related after the discovery of
Tristan	ORGANIZATION	's faithlessness .

		Mr.
Anspacher	PERSON	has also introduced several subsi - diary characters whose presence tends to make the action diffuse .

		As an example of his verse , we quote a passage spoken by
King Mark	ORGANIZATION	in the third act . '

		We three can never dwell beneath one roof ;
Tintagel Castle	ORGANIZATION	, where
King Uther	PERSON	died , The mighty founder of a line of Kings , Is now too small to hold its three possessors .

		My human pity never learned revenge ; There is no malice in my punishment .

		The pillory of public banishment Will not be pressed on thee ; but thou must go .

		Parting as secretly as thou hast come .

		Thou art not pure enough to seek the Grail ; For he who compasses that high devoir Must guiltless be , and pure as virgin lilies .

		Go , then , thy better self will pray for thee ; Devote thyself to vows and blessed works ; Until the saints , whose joy is saving souls .

		Absolve thy heart .

		I , too , in time , shall add What prayers forgiveness may find tongue to speak .

		My blessings go as wayfarers with thee .

		Go , go ; I never wish to see thy face again . '

		As will been seen from these lines , which are among the best to be found in the drama , the work is uninspired and mechanical .

		It is aa exercise in metrical composition rather than a creative product .

		Under the title of ` The Red Branch Crests ' Mr.
Chai-les Leonard Moore	PERSON	has versified three Celtic legends .

		The poems are dramatic in form and each is in from six to ten scenes .

		The form is a verse of seven syllables and four accents , and the lines are in rhymed couplets .

		There are a few irregularities , but the verse keeps fairly close to the norm .

		It is favorably illustrated by the closing passage , the lament spoken after the - death of
Cuchulain	PERSON	and his men . '

		Slaughtered host and slaughtered King Lie in one vast battle ring .

		From his final field of fame Bear the matchless form of flame !

		The three sections of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's poem , united into one fateful web , are respectively entitled ` Deirdre , ' ` Meve / and ` Cuchulain . '

		They exploit with vigor and dramatic effect what is perhaps the most familiar cycle of Celtic legend .

		The experiment is interesting and fairly successful from a poetical point of view , although its mate - rial must ever be alien to English modes of con - sciousness .

		We can take to our hearts nearly all the forms of classical and Teutonic legend , but the Celtic treasury , rich though it be , seems to us a thing of remote imaginings , motives , and agencies .


William Morton Txynh	PERSON	.

		Briefs ox Xew Books .

		Dr.
William Everett	PERSON	, at the begin - The modem • ^ l - i imi .

		itcaian poets .

		^ ^ S 01 tis volume upon The Italian Poets since
Dante	PERSON	' -LRB- Serib - ner -RRB- , makes some cogent remarks upon the recent English neglect of the most charming of mod - em literatures .

		Time was when the best English poets got their finest inspiration from Italian sources , and when Italian literature was known as familiarly to cultivated people as French or Ger - man literature is now .

		But that time has van - ished , and the Italian ` language holds by no means the same place in our courses of study as the German , which was little more than a collec - tion of imcouth dialects centuries after
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, and
Boccaccio	PERSON	had made their tongue the vehicle of the loftiest , the tenderest , and the wittiest ideas . '

		Thus it has come about in our own day that ` manj ' men and women would be ashamed to confess ignorance of
Heine	PERSON	and
Uhland	LOCATION	, of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and
Verlaine	PERSON	, who would see no disgrace in admitting that
Guarini	PERSON	and
Alfieri	PERSON	,
Leopardi	PERSON	and
Carducci	PERSON	, were sealed books to them . '

		Dante alone we read and know ; his successors are little more than names to us .

		It was for the purpose of calling renewed attention to this great and unduly neglected literature that Dr.
Everett	PERSON	prepared the course of
Lowell Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute lectures that are reprinted in the present volume .

		He entered upon the task with an enthusiasm bom of a large and loving acquain - tance with the poets of
Italy	LOCATION	, and he succeeds in imparting no little of this emotion to his readers .

		* For this work , ' he says , ' I claim one qualifica - tion .

		The sound of their beautiful language has sung in my ears from my very earliest infancy .

		On the sacred soil of
Florence	LOCATION	and
Fiesole	LOCATION	, before the memory of events begins , I drank in the music of Tuscan equally with the notes of my own tongue .

		I can remember no hour in which every - thing Italian was not set before me as a source of supreme interest .

		Many here know
Italy	LOCATION	bet - ter than I do ; none but a native can love her more . '

		Of the eight chapters in Dr.
Everett	PERSON	's book , three are devoted to
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Ariosto	PERSON	, and
Alfieri	PERSON	.

		The other five discuss an average of three poets each , from
Pulci	LOCATION	to
Leopardi	LOCATION	.

		In each ease the biographical and critical characteri - zation is followed by a series of representative selections , given sometimes in the author 's own translation , sometimes in that of others .

		The work is luminous and vivid in style , and a delight to the instinct of every lover of literature .

		Nor is it made any the less delightful by the infusion of the author 's individuality , and the occasional exhibition of a fine old crusted prejudice .

		We think none the less of him for saying that ` Boiardo 's avoidance of all melody might entitle him to be named
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, ' for he takes pains to inform us upon another page that he cares nothing for music .

		And so he will prob - ably to the end of his days cherish the delusion .

		that the author of ` Die Meistersinger ' -- the most melodious of all musical creations -- was incapable of melody .

		A bit of old fogyism crops out now and then , as in the judgment of the modem fashion ` which thinks it high criticism to say that Homer is not the perfection of poetry , and `` Marmion '' is not a p > oem at all , ' or in the remarks about
Columbus	LOCATION	and his contemporaries , * whose colonial exploits we are now so absurdly undervaluing in order to crown with laurels the mythical
Leif	PERSON	and
Thorwald	ORGANIZATION	. '

		But many idiosyn - eracies may be pardoned a writer who can give us -LRB- p. 138 -RRB- the eloquent panegyric ui > on
Milton	LOCATION	, and many another purple patch revealed in these pages .

		The only words we carmot quite forgive him are those in which he speaks of ' the ferocity of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	. '

		From the point of view of the scholar , little exception is to be taken to this work .

		It is true that Dr.
Everett	PERSON	takes as unquestioned the identity of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's Laura with the wife of
Hugh de Sade	PERSON	, and that he makes the amazing misstatement that
Carducci	PERSON	died last year .

		But in general , his book is of such a nature as to avoid controverted matters of fact , and is thus spared the attack of the scientific critic .

		To say that the book is readable is to do it much less than justice .

		The latest Dr.
William J. Rolfe	PERSON	's new Life of life of Shakespeare -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is not an in -
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		dispensable book .

		It contains no new material of importance , and almost no new inferences from the old .

		The author seldom pre - sents his own views of current Shakespearian questions except those that centre about the 50 THE DIAJL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, Sonnets ; and even the literary comments upon the plays , in which the book unnecessarily abounds , he quotes from easily accessible sources .

		This is the more to be deprecated because a Shakespearian student of Dr ,
Rolfe	PERSON	's experience must surely have opinions that are worth expressing .

		He can not point out the ` Spenserian flavour ' of ` The Lover 's Complaint ' except in the words of
Verity	ORGANIZATION	and
Malone	PERSON	-LRB- page 214 -RRB- , and he even spares himself the trouble of describing in his own language the Choruses of

		The following , on ` Love 's Labour 's Lost , ' fairly represents his method -LRB- p. 163 -RRB- : ` It is `` a play of conversation and situation '' -LRB- Furnivall -RRB- , in which `` depth of characterization is subordinate to elegance and sprightliness of dialogue '' -LRB- Staunton -RRB- . '

		Nor are the quoted comments always chosen with judg - ment .

		Baynes 's silly moralizing on the ` Bidford challenge ' is quoted at length -LRB- pp. 102 , 103 -RRB- without comment , and two pages -LRB- pp. 229 , 230 -RRB- are given to

Venice	LOCATION	. '

		Five pages -LRB- pp. 264 - 268 -RRB- of quotation and comment are devoted to the question whether the marriage of Benedick and
Beatrice	PERSON	was happy .

		Indeed , the quotation from
Hazlitt	PERSON	on ` Lear ' -LRB- p. 413 -RRB- may not unfairly be taken to express the biographer 's mistaken con - ception of his task : ` We wish that we could pass this play over and say nothing about it .

		All that we can say must fall far short of the subject , or even of what we ourselves conceive of it ; ... yet we must say something . '

		There is an abundance of the profitless conjec - ture that few biographers of Shakespeare have had the good taste to avoid .

		Though the book was originally printed
two years ago	DATE	, the present reprint ought certainly to have been brought up to date .

		The author says -LRB- p. 235 -RRB- of
Morgann	ORGANIZATION	's ■ ` Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir
John Falstaff	PERSON	' that it is ` unfortunately long out of print , ' though it was reprinted in
Nichol Smith	PERSON	's `
Eighteenth Century Essays	ORGANIZATION	on Shake - speare ' early in the past year .

		Nor does he refer to Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	's admirable discus - sion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's classical scholarship in his recent ` Studies in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' ^ discussion that must henceforth be taken into consideration `` by anyone who would treat
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's educa - tion and learning with intelligence .

		The illustra - tions of the book are entirely commonplace , and the index is incomplete .

		For the purpose for which it was first written , -- to introduce a sub - scription edition of Shakespeare , -- the biography is perhaps not useless ; but its republication , with the volumes of Halliwell-Phillips and
Sidney Lee	PERSON	accessible to everyone , seems to us quite unjusti - fied .

		A veteran Mr.
Henry HajTiie	PERSON	, correspondent journalist 's for many journals from many reminiscences .

		p ^ rtg of the world , but for the last twenty years a resident of
Paris	LOCATION	, tells us in his book of reminiscences entitled ' The Captains and the
Kings	PERSON	' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , that during the period just mentioned he has written ` something like three thousand articles , or above six millions of words , ' and that nearly every article was signed with his own name .

		` To be anonymous in writing , whether private or public , ' he declares , ` is fre - quently to be unfair if not cowardly . '

		Mr.
Hay	PERSON	- nie 's own style is frank and straightforward , with no suspicion of giving aught but the truth , except perhaps a slight tendency to convey an impression of intimacy with an incredible num - ber of celebrated persons .

		His pages are lavishly sprinkled with the names of eminent men and women , access to whom has been gained by this energetic , quick-witted , and resourceful journalist and interviewer .

		Possibly he himself helps to explain this when he openly acknowledges that ` to be the chronicler of grand personages it is not necessary that one should have ever been on familiar terms with them , nor do we need to be very precise and exact as to their goings and comings in daily life . '

		But , with all the allow - ance this confession calls for , the book is to be commended .

		It is interesting from cover to cover ; and , while it has chiefly to do with per - sons , is free from objectionable personalities .

		Mr.
Haynie	PERSON	's long presidency of the
Foreign Press Association of Corresi	ORGANIZATION	> ondents in
Paris	LOCATION	has brought him into contact with many persons one is glad to read about , especially those < ^ f his own calling .

		What he writes about the late M. de Blowitz is particularly worth reading .

		The author 's amusing outbreak against ` that abomin - ation called grammar ' gains point from his own occasional lapses from Addisonian English , as where he writes , ` On the return of my wife and I to
America	LOCATION	... ' Another slip , of a dif - ferent sort , occurs on the page facing
Gladstone	PERSON	's portrait , where he describes that statesman as clean-shaven , although the well-remembered gray whiskers are plainly visible in the picture .

		With the exception of a personal letter from the Rev.
James Sharp	PERSON	, the information collected appears to be drawn from the standard sources .

		Nevertheless the lit - tle book is at least a handy manual , and besides history and statistics it gives many a pleasant anecdote .

		Just why the author has assumed in his readers a less than elementary knowledge of English literature is not apparent .

		He stops to explain that
James Boswell	PERSON	, who studied at
Edin	ORGANIZATION	- burgh and
Glasgow Universities	ORGANIZATION	, was ` the author of the Life of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	, an immortal book , and most assuredly a landmark in literature . '

		Furthermore , he says of
Boswell	PERSON	that almost nothing is known of him , -- and so we must try to be thankful for what he has here told us .

		After styling Bums ' a genius , but not altogether a gentleman , ' he condescendingly characterizes
Scott	PERSON	as ' a gentleman and almost a genius . '

		Though this work has been given decided preference over
Vasari	PERSON	's sketch by no less an authority than
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, it seems never to have appeared in satisfactory English translation .

		Now the deficiency is sup - plied by the scholarly and fluent rendering of Mr.
Herbert P. Home	PERSON	, published in a limited edition by Mr.
D. B. Updike	PERSON	at the
Merrymount Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Something more than a translator 's share in the volume has been taken by Mr.
Home	PERSON	, for the ` Montallegro ' type here used for the first time is of his design , and he is resjwnsible also for the book 's decorative features and general arrangement .

		The type is perhaps the most suc - cessful adaptation from the early Italian founts that has yet appeared ; it is thoroughly simple and legible in character , with lines just hea \ ` j' enough to avoid any effect of weakness in the printed page .

		Though Mr. Ui > dike 's typograph - ical tenets are usually sound , we can hardly subscribe to all of them .

		We realize that thiu spacing in Xyp ^ composition is essential to the best artistic effect ; but when it is carried so far as to interfere with readability , as is often the ease in the present volume , its virtue is de - cidedly open to question .

		The presswork shown in the book could hardly be improved upon , being delightfidly clear and even throughout , and the handmade paper used is excellent in quality .

		Altogether , the volume is one in which the biblio - phile no less than the art student will rejoice .

Warreu Stoddard	PERSON	's ` Island of Tranquil Delights ' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	:
Herbert B. Turner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a little disappointing in its lack of sus - tained interest and convincing reality .

		Fact and fiction chase each other rather bewilderingly through his glowing pages , and the whole effect is vague and impressionistic .

		A
California	LOCATION	cir - cus story entitled ' A Sawdust Fairy , ' in which the fairj - , when divested of tights and spangles , is a stimted little street gamin , is the only realis - tic chapter in the book .

		In most of the others we have glamour and charm and sensuous sug - gestion of things ineffable and delightful ; but this prolonged riot of the imagination wearies the plain reader .

		Somewhat too imqualified are Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's praises of the virtue that he finds accompanying the unclothed condition ; and some - what tiresomely frequent are his pictures of the sea-bathing natives of his beloved Otaheite .

		But his fondness for the gentle savage is sincere , and he is not unsuccessful in depicting his attractive qualities .

		We have described the plan of this series in previous reviews ; it is stifficient to say here that each volume has a special editor , who provides a critical or biographical introduc - tion and other helpful matter .

		Two of the five new volumes are devoted to lyrics by
Ridiard Wagner	PERSON	-LRB- for tenor and soprano , respectively -RRB- and have been prepared by that veteran conduc - tor , performer , and teacher , Mr.
Carl Armbruster	PERSON	.

		They give us -LRB- with German and English text -RRB- the most important lyrics of the music-dramas , from •
Rienzi	PERSON	' to ' Parsifal . '

		The soprano volume has in addition the ' Trois Melodies ' of
1840	DATE	and the ` Fiinf Gedichte ' of
1857	DATE	-- the latter written fbr verses by

		Two other volumes , edited by Mr.
Philip Hale	PERSON	, are made up of songs by modern French eomjwsers , fifty in number , arranged alphabeti - cally from
Bemberg	LOCATION	to
Widor	PERSON	.

		The editor 's introduction is a thoroughly competent piece of critical work .

		Finally a volume containing ten of Liszt 's ` Hungarian Rhapsodies ' is edited by Messrs.

Daumier	PERSON	and
Gavami	PERSON	.

		Like many other modem French artists and draughtsmen , these two did most of their work for the illus - trated comic jotimals , a fact which doubtless accoimts in large measure for the small regard in which their names are held today .

		Critical and biographical notes on
Daumier	PERSON	are translated from an essay by
M. Henri Frantz	PERSON	, and
M. Octave Uzanne	PERSON	writes of
Gavami	LOCATION	.

		Both essays are exceedingly interesting , not only in relation to the partictdar artists under discussion , but also as suggesting reflections about the whole class of modem art-work which is being poured out in vast quantities day by day , meant solely for the cheapest reproduction , and yet in many cases strong , original , expressive of salient phases of modem civilization , and deserving of more atten - tion than the mere laugh it provokes at the break - fast table .

		The essays are after all mere intro - ductions to the plates , which include one hundred and twenty reproductions in black and white , and twenty in color and photogravure .

Thorndike	PERSON	's book is intended entii-ely for the student , and for him it supplies a distinctly felt want .

		In psychology and sociology , groups of phenomena are fre - quently dealt with which express averages , rela - tions , variations , con-elations of sets of measure - ments , from the analysis of which important con - clusions are to be derived .

		There are well rec - ognized principles that determine the working up of such statistical material .

		These principles the student has had , until now , largely to learn incidentally by precept and example .

		Dr.
Thorn	PERSON	- dike has provided an extremely practical and well-planned volume , that supplies the student with both the principle and the practice of the treatment of such relations as they occur in psychology and sociology .

Brandenburg	ORGANIZATION	's investigation of the immigration question , if his book on ` Imported Americans . '

		-LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- should reach those in authority , or even those whose interest in the subject gives them influence in matters related to it .

		That the immigration question still remains an important national problem , in spite of all efforts made to solve it , is undisputed .

		The most earnest efforts to provide proper laws for the exclusion of undesirable aliens , with an efficient system for securing the enforcement of such laws , has resulted in little more than an evasion of them by the least desirable emigrants .

		Mr.
Brandenburg	PERSON	traces the causes of this failure by an investigation as thorough and complete as it i -RRB- erhaps is possible to make .

		The two clos - ing chapters , on ` Legislation and Evasion ' and ` The Immigrant , ' give a synopsis of what has been done and what might be done in the way of improving present conditions .

		After reading Mr.

		The notable addresses which accompanied the nominations of these can - didates are here reproduced verbatim .

		Thus an exceedingly valuable contribution to the current political literature of the counti * y lias been made by the enthusiastic compiler .

		He has heretofore prepared and published in like permanent form the full recoi ` ds of each of the twelve preceding national conventions of the same party .

		The whole series serves to perpetuate , in the precise language used in each convention , the history of a political party , in convenient foi-m for both pub - lic and private libraries ; and within its limited field , it furnishes a faithful pen-picture of the discussions of the times .

Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a clear , simple , and thoroughly practical man - ual , and will doubtless help to popularize a handi - craft which is at present fascinating but very mysterious to most persons .

		Miss White begins with a description of the tools and materials needed , then tells how to work by hand and on the potter 's wheel , and how to decorate and glaze the pots .

		She also explains the general princi - ple of the kiln .

		As in the basket books , there axe a number of excellent plates , ajid dii'ections tell exactly how to reproduce the objects illus - ti-ated .

		The pictures present a considerable variety in style and aim , tending , however , to the older and standard forms rather than to the Arts and Crafts styles so popular at present .

		They do not , of course , reproduce detail or color , but they make clear the general scheme of work , and they are interesting as showing what is being accomplished by American decorators .

		` The Younger American Poets , ' according to Miss
Jessie B. Eittenhouse	PERSON	's book thus entitled , are eighteen in number , eleven of them being men .

		We have no particular fault to find with the selec - tion , since the one serious omission , that of Mr.

		Certainly the eighteen writers discussed are deser \ - ing of serious consideration , and

		It is primarily addressed , of course , to students of medicine and surgery , and contains the necessary plates and directions for diagnosis and treatment .

		It scarcely need be said that Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	believes emphatically in surgery as the only remedy applicable when the disease has manifested itself ; and the notes of the cases that have come within his own knowledge prove that his apprehensions regarding delay are well founded .

		At the same time he goes far toward removing the fear of the surgeon 's knife , so common every - where , by similar proof of his statement that ' Ideal appendicectomy ought not to require more than an inch-and-a-quarter incision , ten minutes of anaesthesia , and four days in the hospital . '

		No scar remains to mark the entrance of the surgeon 's knife , and in most cases the subcutaneous injec - tion of a local anaesthetic suffices , it being needful to remain in bed on a light diet only one day there - after .

Messrs. A. C. MeClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, are able to promise its defi - nite appearance in
April	DATE	.

		This book , as already announced , is to be called `
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	: A Musical Autobiography , ' and will consist of two large volumes -- the first devoted to his life work , and the second almost entirely to programmes .

		It was Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's original intention to confine the autobiography to the musical events of his boy - hood and first public appearances , but as the work proceeded he became more and more interested , and made it complete by bringing it down to the pres - ent orchestral season .

		The same volume will also contain an appreciation by Mr ,

Thomas	PERSON	's life as a man and work as a musician and conductor , in which much additional informa - tion will be set forth .

		The second volume will contain all his representative and most significant programmes from
1855	DATE	to
1905	DATE	, which may be called the period of his public career , carefully edited and explained when necessary .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has added interest as well as authority to this volume by contributing a series of terse essays upon vari - ous musical subjects of interest to the general public hardly less than to the musician .

		The work of the recent
St. Louis	LOCATION	conference of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	perhaps does not form so good a basis for a general smmning up of the aims and achievements of modem library work in
America	LOCATION	as might some of the previous conferences ; but as strongly emphasizing many of the highest of these aims and tendencies , it was unequalled in the annals of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was intended , as Presi - dent
Putnam	PERSON	said in his opening address , to deal at this meeting with the larger phases of the library movement ; to the neglect , if neces - sary , of the customary discussions of practical detail .

		The cosmopolitan character of the attendance and the scientific elevation of the themes gave to all the work a character that fairly represents the increasing breadth and deration of modem library aims in generaL One of the chief ideals of modem library work , as of all economic and social life , is cooperation .

		` No bibliothecal body has ever emphasized and developed this fundamental social aim as has the
American Library Associ	ORGANIZATION	- ation , -- not forgetting the work of the
Boyal Society	ORGANIZATION	or the
Institut de Bibliographic	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its achievements in this line are well known , -- the
Poole	PERSON	's Index and its successors and imitators ; the standardization of methods in cataloguing , and in cards and other materials ; the adoption of the metrical system of measurements ; the publication of catalogue cards , cooperative lists of periodicals , the ` A.L.A. ' Catalogue , and so on .

		The
St. Louis	LOCATION	conference showed much coopera - tive work , of one sort or another , being done in
Prussia	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Xorway	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Great Britain	LOCATION	; and the cosmopolitan character of modem library aims was illustrated by such results of cooperation on an international scale as the
International Catalogue of Scientific Literature	ORGANIZATION	, the Ziirich Index , and the work of the
Institut de Bibli	ORGANIZATION	- ographic , by the proposals to extend interna - tional catalogues to oflBcial literature , historical periodicals , and manuscripts , and by the Hand - book of Learned Societies .

		It took concrete form in two proposals for organized interna - tional cooperation , on both of which special committees were appointed : Mr.
Jasfs	PERSON	propo - sition from the Library A ^ ociation of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	for cooperation with the 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, ' A. L. A / in establishing uniform cataloguing rules , and the suggestion of President
Putnam	PERSON	and President
Francis	PERSON	for the afl & liation of the library associations of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The most significant recent result of cooper - ation is undoubtedly the published catalogue card , as developed especially by the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the
John Crerar Library	PERSON	, and the
Publishing Board	ORGANIZATION	of the *
A. L. A.	PERSON	' Librarians are no longer tolerant of the economic waste of expending over and over again the expert work required in cataloguing , and the mechanical work in reduplicating cards by manuscript .

		The present aim is to relegate manuscript work in cataloguing to the same position now occupied by manuscript processes in the production of books .

		Two indications of aim and achieve - ment in this field are Mr.
Lane	PERSON	's proposal of cooperation to supplement existing card publi - cation , and the announcement that printed cards for all the titles in the new `
A. L. A.	PERSON	' Catalogue would be distributed by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The significance of this latter plan lies in the fact that it affords a method of utilizing card publication by the small library , whereas this system has hitherto been chiefly of advantage to the large libraries .

		Another more or less distinctively modem aim of American library workers is to encour - age scientific bibliography -- that most impor - tant aid to the librarian 's work .

		This idea was indicated at the
St. Louis	LOCATION	conference by the formation in connection with the meeting of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, and largely from among its members , of the American Bibliographical Soci - ety .

		The membership and officers of this new organization are such as point most encourag - ingly to marked results in the bibliographical field .

		One of the most significant movements in modern scientific library administration in
America	LOCATION	was represented at
St. Louis	LOCATION	in the meeting of the state librarians .

		When the *
A. L. A.	PERSON	' was formed , and for ten years afterward , there were hardly half a dozen librarians in
America	LOCATION	to whom the word ` archive ' meant anything practical .

		Today archival science is developed to a high degree in many states .

		To the careful observer of library progress there are few achievements in American library work so valuable in themselves and so promising of future scientific usefulness as that of which Mr.
Owen	PERSON	's work in
Alabama	LOCATION	is perhaps the best type , but which is now being done in many states .

		Perhaps , after all , most of the indications of achievement brought out at the
St. Louis	LOCATION	meeting might be grouped as efforts tending to promote the familiar triple aim , ' the best read - ing , for the largest number , at the least cost . '

		The aim to secure the best reading was typically illustrated by the `
A. L. A.	PERSON	' Catalogue , dis - tributed at this time .

		The modern library idea is to guide the reader , and especially to guide the librarian who is to guide the reader , to the best literature .

		To this end there are now many publications issued each year intended to aid in the selection of books , but the new '
A. L. A.	PERSON	' Catalogue , whatever may be said in criticism of its details , stands as the type and personification of the spirit of helpfulness in selection that is one of the definite aims of modem library work .

		Other straws pointing in the same direction were the appointment of a committee to cooperate with Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	in the preparation of his work on fiction , and in the demand of the library commissions for special select lists to be used in their work .

		In its efforts to serve the ' largest number , ' modern library work has taken on an immense number of secondary aims and activities , many of which were in evidence at
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		The modem aspect of this general aim may be said to be this : to educate continuously every mem - ber of the community .

		This purpose takes the special form of -LRB- 1 -RRB- cooperation with the work of the schools , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- continuing the work of the school from the point where the school lays it down , and carrying it to the end of life .

		This has become one of the most generally recognized aims , and has been the inspiration of much of the best and most aggressive work in the popular library field .

		It was mentioned by Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	, the most untiring promoter of the conception , and was implied by the work of the library commissions .

		Another modem aspect of this aim to serve the largest number was illustrated by the spe - cial exhibit at
St. Louis	LOCATION	of the
Pennsylvania Free Circulating Library	ORGANIZATION	for the Blind .

		This exhibit is a type of the tendency to provide for the special needs of every worthy class in the community , and makes evident the remarkable progress in recent years in the provision for this particular class by the public libraries .

		The purpose to provide for every class and condition of men has its counterpart in a grow - ing tendency to provide all sorts and conditions of things for all .

		Musical scores are now sup - plied in many libraries , and Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	's address on the limits of state aid advocated the purchase of pictures , lantern-slides , perforated rolls for mechanical music , etc. .

		While this idea opened the way to some pleasantries about ' enriching the repertory of the organ-grinder , ' and a pretended fear that the principle would lead to rivalry with the pawn-shop , it repre - sented a recognized aim to serve every man 's peculiar intellectual need through the medium of the library .

		1905 -RSB- THE DIAL .

		76 Still another aspect of this aim to serve the many may be found in the so-called missionarj - work of pushing out the library frontiers by the founding of new collections .

		This mission - ary spirit in modem library work permeates radically the whole atmosphere ; modern libra - rians are irrepressible expansionists .

		The best result of this spirit is shown in the work of the state library commissions .

		A league of these commissions was formed at this conference and active steps are being taken to promote its work .

		The same spirit was also especially indi - cated at
St. Louis	LOCATION	by the decision to hold the
Association	ORGANIZATION	's next annual meeting at
Portland	LOCATION	, for the avowed purpose of doing what could be done to promote the extension of libraries in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another indication of this same general aim of serving the largest number may be seen in the extension of their service rendered by the already established libraries .

		To this aspect belongs what is known as ' library extension / in its narrower sense , -- library lectures and devices intended to encourage the use of libra - ries or to extend their field of influence in the community .

		Mr.
Jast	PERSON	's paper was something of a revelation to many of the greater results accomplished in this direction by British as compared with American libraries .

		Connected with this improvement in the use of present facilities is the matter of the inter - library loan .

		The progress made in this direc - tion of supplementing the facilities of libraries by lending to one another was clearly brought forth at
St. Louis	LOCATION	; but more clearly still was brought out the fact of the inferiority as yet in this regard of American achievement to
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean .

		However , the very knowledge of such inferiority establishes a stimulus , and it may be said that one of the most definite aims brought out by this conference is the extension of the inter-library loan .

		This in turn brought forth what may be called a sub-aim , -- the determination to secure , if practicable , some reform in the rates of postage for library books necessary before the inter-library loan system can be properly developed .

		Perhaps one of the most suggestive indica - tions as to the tendency in library expansion was the discussion of the conference over the limits of state aid , and similar questions raised at the meetings of the state librarians and the state library commissions .

		There is a signifi - cant growth in the tendency to apply to the fostering of library interests in the state the same principles that have been applied to its schools ; and state commissions , travelling libra - ries , travelling librarians , grants , and other fostering aids are being more and more freely extended , and are resulting in very remarkable success in the way of serving the greatest number .

		The problem of how to secure at the least cost all the worthy objects touched upon in the foregoing statements is one that gives the mod - em library worker a great deal of concern .

		Low cost to the individual user must , in the last analysis , be inseparable from economy of administration .

		It is true that profuseness of state or municipal aid does not involve any direct expense to the non-tax-paying reader , who is perhaps in the majority .

		But such pro- fuseness , if not economically administered , means for the individual user so much less advantage ; or , in short , it increases the cost to him of what advantages he does enjoy .

		At any event , economy in purchase and economy in administration are two very live problems of modern library work .

		The matter of economy in purchase was represented at
St. Louis	LOCATION	by the remarkably interesting report of the committee on relations with the book trade , concerning eco - nomical methods of purchase and especially the matter of increased cost of books to libraries under the present net price system of book publishing .

		To the subject of economy belongs also the remarkable growth of organization in library administration .

		Attention was directed to this , first of all , by the fact that the
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	was the President of the conference ; then by the fact that many of the ablest partici - pants in the conference were heads of depart - ments of one or another of the great libraries ; then by the fact , emphasized by President Put - nam in his address , that there are now fifty - nine libraries in
America	LOCATION	having over 300,000 volumes each ; and , finally , by the facts brought out in the report on gifts regarding the
Carnegie	LOCATION	branch libraries , especially those in
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The marked development of the great libraries and the multiplication of their activities have demanded a corresponding development of their organization .

		Subdivision of labor , the analysis and coordination of dif - ferent functions in different departments , -- in short , all the matters belonging to the economi - cal administration of a great business , have had earnest attention and show striking results .

		Without any depreciation of the work of the great public municipal libraries which have shown such expansion and development of organization in their branch systems , or the work of such libraries as the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	, the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	, the
Columbia University Library	ORGANIZATION	, and others , it will not be invidious to say that the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	offers an example of concrete achievement in the way of multiplied activities , well organized on economical lines and producing practical results .

Panizzi	PERSON	.

		Yet it is fair to say , too , that this spirit of practical business organization is also produc - ing among many of the smaller libraries some most interesting results in the way of sharp organization and economy through subordina - tion of function -- that primary aspect of eco - nomical administration by which the more highly paid is not allowed to do the work of the less highly paid .

		The removal of this lat - ter standing reproach against the old-fashioned organization is closely connected with the ques - tion of skilled labor , and the library schools have greatly helped in developing both theory and application by tending to draw the line between skilled and unskilled labor .

		It may be noted in this connection that the multiplication of branch libraries and distributing stations reduces the cost to the individual user by saving him time and money in getting at the books .

		Any account of the aims and achievements of American libraries as suggested by the
St. Louis	LOCATION	conference would be incomplete without reference to the fact , brought out in the meet - ing by President
Putnam	PERSON	, that at the time of the
Louisiana Purchase America	LOCATION	had but one hundred libraries , with 50,000 volumes ; whereas today she has 10,000 libraries , with more than 50,000,000 volumes .

		This in itself is a splendid record of achievement , but it is not the end .

		It is a primary aim of American libraries collectively to have at least one copy of every book needed for serious use in this country .

		Assuming that 5,000,000 of the best forei ^ books form the ultimate basis , it is true that probably half of this number may be found in American libraries ; and ninety per cent , of the remainder are easily obtainable , either in the originals or in fac-simile reproduction .

		This particular development of our American libra - ries is an aim second only to the vital prac - tical purpose of serving the life-long education of the average citizen .

		The splendid contribu - tions now made by municipal , state , and national authorities , supplemented by remark - able gifts from private sources -LRB- shown in the
St. Louis	LOCATION	report to amount to more than
$ 6,000,000	MONEY	and 137,000 volumes during the previous year -RRB- , is producing a record of results on both counts of which we may well be proud .

		But there is still much to do , and one of the chief aims of modem library work must be to make the consciousness of the necessity of library work for the education of the mass of the people and the progress of the higher civili - zation so vivid and ever present that means for essential development of all varied activities may be multiplied .

		BIBLIOGRAPHY IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		Bibliography begins to be cultivated only after many other literary and scientific studies are already well established .

		It depends upon the existence of large collections of books in which its facts may be industriously gathered ; it is seldom pursued for pecuniary profit ; it implies a certain leisure on the part of well - informed persons who , not having the spark of genius that kindles original production , are content to review what others have done and have the skill to record it in systematic ways and make it useful to those who , basing their work on facts already established , c ` arry forward the outposts of discovery .

		Another task that engages the bibliographer is the unravelling of some of the perplexities that beset the history of human progress , where , because of the failure of the ordinary records , the succession of events or the relations of cause and effect have to be painfully determined by out-of-the-way investigations and by infer - ences drawn from sources where the less - instructed reader would not expect to find help , until at last the truth comes out with new dis - tinctness .

		Such is the work of the historical bibliographer , especially in everything that connects itself with the history of the book , printed or manuscript , and upon his help the historian proper must often depend .

		A humbler service , but a most useful one , is that of the commonplace bibliographer , the practical librarian whose time and strength are given to answering the every-d'ay questions which the readers in his library ask .

		If he has the happy faculty of quickly taking the point of view of the inquirer , and the instinct that tells him where to direct his search , he accumulates a store of practical bibliographical information which may become liighly valua - ble , and if he does his work systemati - cally he is prepared to serve the cause of bibliography by shaping his material into num - berless hand-lists and reading guides such as every library bulletin is glad to print .

		All these varieties of bibliographical activ - ity , -- the record of production , the historical study , and the popular guide , -- have begun to flourish on American soil .

		Careful and thorough work has been carried on in each field , and in paths that lead from one field to another , and favorable conditions have not been lacking .

		Considering the fact that bibliographical studies are relatively young with us , it is remarkable how little work of a slipshod char - acter has been put forth and how much work , undertaken on an elaborate scale and depending for its value on great accuracy and complete - ness , is already under way .

		The practical bibliography , also , -- not .

		Articles of a bibliographical char - acter occasionally appear in the library jour - nals , or in the literary and historical periodi - cals ; but in general the former journals con - cern themselves almost exclusively with mat - ters of library administration , and the latter hold that strictly bibliographical contributions interest but a limited number of their readers .

		What shall be the task of the new Biblio - graphical Society of
America	LOCATION	?

		What kind of bibliographical work shall it take up , and in what way can it be most helpful to the progress of American bibliography ?

		It has no endow - ment and can not expect to have one , at least until it has proved its usefulness and shown that it can be trusted to administer its affairs wisely .

		Depending upon the yearly fees of its members , it can not take up great projects requiring generous and continued support , such as only governments or endowments can afford .

		Such projects , however , may for the present be safely trusted to the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	, to the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- if its present liberal and enlightened policy continues to receive the support of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and to some of the larger societies , such as the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bibliography of a popular kind , -- the current recommendation of good books , the preparation of reading lists on current topics , and the com - pilation of more extensive works , if their prin - cipal field of usefulness is in public libraries , may be left to the larger libraries , to some of the library commissions , and especially to the
Publishing Board of the American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, which enjovs the use of a fund of
$ 100,000	MONEY	, estabHshed by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, the income of which is to be applied primarily to the prosecution of just such work .

		To edit a good journal of bibliography , -- one which should be a medium for the publica - tion of articles in the field of historical and descriptive bibliography , should keep its read - ers informed of work in progress and preserve a record of work published elsewhere , and should gather up the news in regard to books , new and n THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, old , which book-lovers want to know , -- such would be a useful task not at present performed by any other agency in
America	LOCATION	, and it is to be hoped that the new Society may be able to take up this function and discharge it successfully .

		Such an enterprise , however , can not be entered upon unadvisedly , and the Society must be assured that material of an interesting charac - ter exists in sufficient abundance , that contribu - tors who have the time and inclination to put it into shape are ready to do so , and that read - era will be willing to support such a periodical by their subscriptions .

		There is other appropriate work , also , for the Society to take up , such as the publication of certain useful bibliographical records or com - pilations which depend upon material to be found in different places and which can there - fore best be prepared by cooperation .

		One such catalogue has been announced as its first publi - cation , -- a ' List of Incunabula in American libraries / Other publications of a similar character suggested to the Council of the Soci - ety include a list of early manuscripts in American libraries ; a list of special collections in American libraries , designed to show inquir - ers where material relating to their special studies can best be found , and indicating the character of the material accessible ; a classified list of current bibliographical records , includ - ing not only journals which make bibliographi - cal records their principal aim , but also those which regularly contain , in addition to other matter , reviews , lists , or notices of works on particular subjects .

		Other possibilities of larger scope lie hazily in the distance , -- such as a comprehensive bibliography of all American publications ; a bibliography of bibliographies on a more com - plete and extended scale than has been attempted before ; a list of periodicals accessi - ble in American libraries ; and other similar dreams that the enthusiastic bibliographer often revels in .

		But these all belong to a later stage in the Society 's history , if they are to come into its history at all , for they demand wide cooperation and the maintenance of a strong staff of paid workers .

		Whatever the
Society	ORGANIZATION	undertakes to do , it is evident that it should strive to make its mem - bership desirable to all classes of book lovers , -- book makers -LRB- authors and publishers -RRB- , book sellers , book distributors -LRB- librarians -RRB- , book collectors , and book readers .

		It hopes to become a common meeting place for all these interests , and to find the means to perform some useful service in which many will cooperate and which will be acceptable to all .

		Theodore Watts-Dunton .

		* Kossetti once said of Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	that he ' had sought obscurity as other poets seek fame . '

		There may be a trifling exaggeration in the statement , but it is certainly true that this distinguished man of letters has been careless of his reputation , has left it to shift for itself , and has never resorted to anything like self - advertisement .

		He has even neglected the pre - cautions that most writers take naturally and as a matter of course for the permanent pres - ervation of their work , and has throughout hij career remained indifferent to the applause of the larger public .

		Thus it came about that '
Aylwin	PERSON	' was withheld from publication for many years after it was written , that the poems were widely scattered in print -- or even lent in manuscript f oitai to friends , and lost -- but not collected into a volume until a comparatively recent date , and that the great mass of the critical writings must still be sought in the files of the periodicals to which they were first contributed .

		This condition of things , a cause of deep regi-et to those of us who long ago learned to honor the name of
Theodore Watts	PERSON	, was remedied in part some six or seven years ago by the publication of '
Aylwin	PERSON	' and ` The Coming of Love , ' and some further rem - edy is now offered by the volume which serves as the subject of the present review , and which has been prepared with the consent of Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	by one of his younger friends .

		The object of Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	in this work is to give a general view of the man and his writings .

		As far as the man is concerned , the work is by no means a formal biography , but rather a series of dissolving views of a strong personal - ity , illustrative of his wide interests , his varied scholarly acquirements , the keenness and sym - pathy of his critical temper , and the genius for friendship which has brought to him richer rewards than fall to the lot of many men of letters , however fortunately they may be cir - cumstanced .

		As far as the writings are con - cerned , Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	leaves them to speak for themselves , for something like two-thirds of his book is occupied with reprinted essays and poems , or fragmentary illustrations of the longer compositions .

		His own commentary is rambling and possibly overwrought , but will be found serviceable as a sort of connective tissue whereby the reprinted passages are held to - gether , or as a sort of transparent jelly in which they are embedded .

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAi .

		79 spared the extracts from '
Aylwin	PERSON	' and ' The Coming of Love , ' since those books are now within everybody 's reach , but we are heartily grateful for the reprinted criticism , since that has been hitherto practically inaccessible .

		As the purpose of the work was to represent its subject in his triune character of critic , poet , and writer of imaginative prose , all three species of composition had to be included in something like equal measure , but it is for the critical writing alone that the volume is really to be treasured .

		Even in this character , we are bound to regard it as a makeshift .

		The writer whom Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has called ` the first critic of our time , perhaps the largest-minded and surest - sighted of any age , ' is not to be preserved for posterity by any collection of extracts ; nothing less than his entire work will satisfy the stu - dent and lover of literature .

		No matter if it * would fill several folio volumes , ' it is too pre - cious to be lost , and too uniformly weighty to be sifted .

		It is fundamental criticism , of the t3rpe which
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	has hitherto chiefly rep - resented in our literature , and it has an insight equal to that of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, besides resting upon a basis of knowledge broader than was possessed by the older critic , with all his excursions into strange poetical and philosophical realms .

		It must all be brought together at some time , and if its author is unwilling to do us this final service , it must be done for us -LRB- and for him -RRB- by another hand .

		As a student of the poetry of his and our own time , Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	has seen clearly that a new spirit has come over the most refined contemporary thought as exercised in imagina - tive directions , and this manifestation he has happily named ' The Renascence of Wonder . '

		We are not sure that this is * the greatest phil - osophical generalization of our time , ' as Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	seems to think it , but it is a felicitous phrase , in any event , and makes a text for a singularly penetrative piece of critical writing .

		A special introduction to one of the later edi - tions of '
Aylwin	PERSON	' first introduced the words to the public .

		` The phrase , the Renascence of Wonder , merely indicates that there are tvro great impulses gov - erning man , and probably not man only , but the entire world of conscious life : the impulse of acceptance -- the impulse to take unchallenged and for granted all the phenomena of the outer world as they are -- and the impulse to confront these phenomena with eyes of inquiry and wonder . '

		In the noteworthy essay contributed to the new edition of
Chambers	ORGANIZATION	's * Cyclopaedia of Eng - lish Literature , ' this principle is carefully elab - orated .

		` It would seem that something works as inevi - tably and as logically as a physical law in the yearning which societies in a certain stage of devel - opment show to get away , as far as possible , from the condition of the natural man ; to get away from that despised condition not only in material affairs , such as dress , domestic arrangements and econ - omies , but also in the fine arts and in intellectual methods , till , having passed that inevitable stage , each society is liable to suffer -LRB- even if it does not in some cases actually suffer -RRB- a reaction , when nature and art are likely again to take the place of convention and artifice . '

		Speaking of the sense of wonder that came into English literature with the Elizabethan eclosion , the author goes on to say : ` It is that kind of wonder which filled the souls of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, of
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	, of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, of
Webster	PERSON	, of
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, of
Cyril Toumeur	PERSON	, and of the old ballads : it is that poetical attitude which the human mind assumes when confronting those unseen powers of the universe who , if they did not weave the web in which man finds himself entangled , dominate it . '

		Twice since the * spacious times ' of which these words are written has the same sort of reaction from reality been witnessed in our lit - erature : a hundred years ago we called it the romantic revival ; in our own time Mr.
Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	calls it the renascence of wonder .

		It seems to be the same thing over again , although in its latest appearance it assumes a more reg - ulated form , and its vagabond tendencies are more strictly restrained by the greater amount of exact knowledge at our command .

		When in the mood of romance or of wonder , whichever we may call it , the spirit tries to get away , not only from reality of the barren prac - tical sort , but also from seli-consciousness .

		Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	brings out this fact very strik - ingly when he contrasts the genuine with the sophisticated type of nature-worship .

		` How hateful is the word `` experience '' in the mouth of the litterateurs .

		They all seem to think that this universe exists to educate them , and that they should write books about it .

		They never look on a sunrise without thinking what an experience it is ; how it is educating them for bookmaking .

		It is this that so often turns the true Nature - worshipper away from books altogether , that makes him bless with what at times seems such malicious fervour those two great benefactors of the human race .

		Caliph Omar and
Warburton	PERSON	's cook . '

		The impulse which led to the writing of these lines is that which forced the writer to reject , with sure instinct ,
Arnold	PERSON	's famous definition of poetry as a ' criticism of life . '

		The truth of the matter is that poetry is not life criticised but life expressed , with intensity and clarity , and that just so far as poetry becomes criticism it ceases to do its proper office .

		Closely allied with this repudiation is that of ' the mod - em Carlylean heresy of work , ' concerning which we read : ` It is not a little singular that this heresy of the sacredness of work should be most flourishing at the very time when the sophism on which it was originally built is exploded ; the sophism , we mean , that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	herself is the result of Work , whereas she is the result of growth .

		One would have thought 80 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, that this was the very time for recognizing what the sophism has blinded us to , that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's per - manent temper -- whatever may be said of this or that mood of hers -- is .

		the temper of Sport , that her pet abhorrence , which is said to be a vacuum , is really Work .

		We see this clearly enough in what are called the lower animals -- whether it be a tiger or a gazelle , a ferret or a coney , a bat or a butter - fly -- the final cause of the existence of every conscious thing is that it should sport .

		For this end it was that `` the great Vishnu yearned to create a world . ''

		Yet over the toiling and moiling world sits Moloch Work , while those whose hearts are withering up with hatred of him are told by certain writers to fall down before him and pre - tend to love . '

		One of the most eloquent of the essays here reproduced for us by Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	has for its subject the
Bible	LOCATION	, and more particularly the Book of Psalms , and was published as long ago as
1877	DATE	in ' The Athenaeum . '

		From this essay we wish to make several quotations . '

		A great living savant has characterized the Bible as '' a collection of the rude imaginings of
Syria	LOCATION	, ' ' `` the worn-out old bottle of Judaism into which the generous new wine of science is being poured . ' '

		The great savant was angry when he said so .

		The `` new wine '' of science is a generous vintage , undoubtedly , and deserves all the respect it gets from us ; so do those who make it and serve it out ; they have so much intelligence ; they are so honest and so fearless .

		But whatever may become of their wine in a few years , when the wine-dealers shall have passed away , when the savant is forgotten as any star-gazer of
Chaldaea	LOCATION	, -- the `` old bottle '' is going to be older yet , -- the
Bible	LOCATION	is going to be eternal .

		For that which decides the vitality of any book is precisely that which decides the value of any human soul -- not the knowledge it contains , but simply the attitude it assumes towards the uni - verse , unseen as well as seen .

		The attitude of the
Bible	LOCATION	is just that which every soul must , in its highest and truest moods , always assume -- that of a wise wonder in front of such a universe as this -- that of a noble humility before a God such as He `` in whose great Hand we stand . '' '

		And the secret of the English Bible is that it is written in the Great Style , which , ' Both in literature and in life , is unconscious power and unconscious grace in one ... Out of the twenty-three thousand and more verses into which the
Bible	LOCATION	has been divided , no one can find a vulgar verse ; for the
Great Style	ORGANIZATION	allows the stylist to touch upon any subject with no risk of defile - ment .

		That is why style in literature is virtue .

		To reproduce the
Great Style	ORGANIZATION	of the original in a Western idiom , the happiest combination of cir - cumstances was necessary ... That noble heroism -- bom of faith in God and belief in the high duties of man -- which we have lost for the hour -- was in the very atmosphere that hung over the island .

		And style in real life , which now , as a consequence of our loss , does not exist at all among Englishmen , and only among a very few English women -- having given place in all classes to man - ner -- flourished then in all its charm .

		And in lit - erature it was the same : not even the euphuism im - ported from
Spain	LOCATION	could really destroy or even seriously damage the then national sense of style . '

		These extracts from a remarkable essay must suffice , although it is hard to refrain from quot - ing also what is said of the contrast between the Psalms in the Authorized Version , and their doggerellized perversion by
Hopkins	PERSON	and
Stern	PERSON	- hold ,
Tate	LOCATION	and
Brady	LOCATION	.

		For the '
Hopkins	PERSON	ele - ment ' must be taken into account by all who would understand the English character .

		` When
St. Augustine	ORGANIZATION	landed here with
David	PERSON	he found not only
Odin	PERSON	, but
Hopkins	PERSON	, a heathen then in possession of the soil . '

		Leaving these serious matters , we will now devote what little space remains us to such bits of anecdote as may seem best to illustrate the lighter side of this absorbing book .

		Professor
Minto	PERSON	, in charge of ` The Examiner , ' was the first editor to secure the regular services of
Theodore Watts	PERSON	as a contributor .

		The first article which he wrote for that paper was the occasion of the following scene , which took place on the
evening of the day	TIME	when the article had appeared , and at the house of
W. B. Scott	PERSON	.

		`
Bell Scott	PERSON	, who took a great interest in the `` Examiner , '' was especially inquisitive about the new writer .

		After having in vain tried to get from
Minto	PERSON	the name of the writer , he went up to
Watts	LOCATION	, and said : `` I would give almost anything to know who the writer is who appears in the ` Examiner ' for the first time today . ''

		`` What makes you inquire about it ? ''

		said
Watts	PERSON	.

		`` What is the inter - est attaching to the writer of such fantastic stuff as that ?

		Surely it is the most mannered writing that has appeared in the ` Examiner ' for a long timel '' Then , turning to
Minto	PERSON	, he said : `` I ca n't think ,
Minto	PERSON	, what made you print it at all . ''

		Scott , who had a most exalted opinion of Watts as a critic , was considerably abashed at this , and began to endeavour to withdraw some of his enthu - siastic remarks .

		This set
Minto	PERSON	laughing aloud , and thus the secret got out . '

		Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's first meeting with Bor - row is described in his introduction to * Lav - engro , ' Borrow figuring under the fictitious name of Dereham .

		` Dereham loved
Richmond Park	LOCATION	, and he seemed to know every tree .

		I found also that he was ex - tremely learned in deer , and seemed familiar with every dappled coat which , washed and burnished by the showers , seemed to shine in the sun like metal .

		Of course , I observed him closely , and I began to wonder whether I had encountered , in the silvery-haired giant striding by my side , with a vast umbrella under his arm , a true `` Child of the Open Air . ''

		`` Did a true Child of the Open Air ever carry a gigantic green umbrella that would have satisfied
Sarah Gamp	PERSON	herself ? ''

		I murmured to
Gordon	LOCATION	, while
Dereham	PERSON	lingered under a tree and , looking round the Park , said in a dreamy way , `` Old England !

		Old England ! '' '

		Probably the most interesting of all these personal passages is that which relates the con - versation between the author and Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	upon the occasion of their first meeting , but it is too long to quote , and will not suffer mutila - tion .

		This fascinating book tempts to endless quo - tation and comment , but it is just as easy to stop here as it would be later on .

		A final word should be said of the illustrations , which include
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTATi 81 Welsh and English landscapes , works of art by
Rossetti	PERSON	and others , and both outside and inside ; views of
The Pines	LOCATION	, which for many years has j been the joint home of Mr , Watts-Dunton and the great poet with whose name his own will forever be associated .

		It is not for rhetorical i effect that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has just dedicated ; the new collected edition of his poems ` to my j best and dearest friend , ' or that he further says : i ` It is nothing to me that what I write should find immediate or general acceptance ; it is much to know that on the whole it has won for me the right to address this dedication and inscribe this edition | to you . '

		A few intimate glimpses of this association are given us from time to time by Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	, but we are deprived of anything more than these glimpses by the unwillingness of both Mr , Watts-Dunton and Mr ,
Swinburne	PERSON	to permit the privacy of their home to be unveiled .

		Such a series of volumes , prepared according to a uniform plan , can not fail to prove of great interest , not only to librarians , but to all interested in the history of American civiliza - tion , as describing the development of one of the most potent agencies for culture .

		The vol - ume imder review is the first to appear , and it is very fitting that it should deal with the institution that has grown to be , in fact if not in name , the library of the nation .

		It deals with the formative period of the

1800	DATE	; Establishment of the Library , 1800-1805 ; Growth of the Library , 1805-1814 ; Destruction of the old Library and Purchase of the Jefferson Library ; The Development of the Library , 1814-1829 ; The Library in PoUtics ; The Devel - opment of the Library , 1829-1851 ; Development of the Library , 1852-1864 ; Other Libraries of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and of the Government ; The
Smith	PERSON	- sonian Institution and Plans for a
National Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The documents reprinted in the last chapter cast a curious reflection on the appreciation which
Congress	ORGANIZATION	up to that time had shown towards its Ubrary .

		In fact .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	never regarded it as being more than its name implied , a Ubrary established for the use of its members .

		That the privilege of using the library was from the beginning open to the President and Vice - President of the
United States	LOCATION	, and was gradu - ally extended to the judges of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, to foreign ministers , to the heads of departments , and then to all officers of the government , serves only to emphasize this nar - row point of view .

		Voices were heard , however , almost from its establishment , urging that it ought indeed to be the Library of
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	, and claiming for it a wider scope and a larger usefulness than it could have if merely intended for the members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the officials of the government .

		As the years went by , its scope was enlarged , and its collections outgrew the original purpose of its founders .

		But Con - gress still treated it as merely an adjunct to itself .

		The history of the
Library	ORGANIZATION	during the period covered by Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's first volume is largely one of slow accumulation , disastrous fires , and congressional indifference .

		But it is also a history of large plans .

		Scientific men and writers in current periodicals were tireless in outlining plans for its development , and many members of the
Joint Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the
Library	ORGANIZATION	took a deep interest in its welfare .

		Among the successive members of the committee we find men like
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	,
Edward Everett	PERSON	,
George Perkins Marsh	PERSON	,
Rufus Choate	PERSON	,
Horace ; Mann	PERSON	, and
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	. '

		The prin - cipal function of the committee , ' the author states , ` was the selection of books for the Library . '

		But no uniform plan was followed .


Mahlon Dickerson	PERSON	, who was chairman from
1817	DATE	to
1828	DATE	, * would have made it a library of science ' ;
Edward Everett	PERSON	, who served on the committee , though never as chairman , from 82 , THE DIALi -LSB-
Feb. 1 , 1835	DATE	to
1835	DATE	, ' would have made it a library of literature ; still other members of the com - mittee thought it necessary to cater to the various tastes and peculiar fancies of divers and many members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, members of the diplomatic corps , heads of departments , and others to whom the privileges of the Library were extended , who wanted anything new , and everything , if possible , entertaining . '

		One mem - ber of the committee proposed a plan ` of filling up each department of the Library in succes - sion , ' and a contemporary writer ' said that under the proper direction the annual appro - priation of
$ 5,000	MONEY	might be so utilized as to make the Library in twenty years one of the first libraries in the world .

		It might even have been possible , ' Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	adds , ' by agreeing further to buy great collections of books as opportunities offered , to have made the Library the first of the great libraries of the world . '

		At this period the prices of books in the anti- quarian market were still very moderate ; few American collectors had yet appeared on the scene .

		But the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	was not in the field , and to European booksellers *
America	LOCATION	meant chiefl -RCB- ' ^
New York	LOCATION	and
Providence	LOCATION	. '

		It was in
1790	DATE	that a committee of Con - gress , with Representative
Elbridge Gerry	PERSON	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	as chairman , was appointed ' to report a catalogue of books necessary for the use of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, with an estimate of the expense , and the best mode of procuring them . '

		The committee reported in
June	DATE	, recommending an appropriation of
$ 1,000	MONEY	.

		The report was laid on the table .

		Not until
1800	DATE	, upon the removal of the Capital to
Washington	LOCATION	, was the matter again taken up ; the sum of
$ 5,000	MONEY	was then appropriated ' for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for tlie use of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. '

		At first no annual appropriations were made for the purchase of books ;
$ 5,000	MONEY	was again set aside for this purpose in
1806	DATE	, and in
1811	DATE	another
$ 5,000	MONEY	.

		In
1816	DATE	,
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	' * ^ library was purchased for
$ 23,950	MONEY	.

		From this year on , annual appropriations were made , at first varying between
$ 1,000	MONEY	and
$ 2,000	MONEY	, until in
1825	DATE	it became
$ 5,000	MONEY	, at which amount it remained during the whole period covered by the present volume -- with the single exception of the year 1852-53 , when
$ 85,000	MONEY	was set aside to replace the loss caused by the fire of
1851	DATE	.

		The Librarian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was from the begin - ning chosen by the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, and in 1802
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	appointed
John Berkley	PERSON	, who at the time was Clerk of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		When Berkley died , in
1807	DATE	, his successor as Clerk of the
House	ORGANIZATION	,
Patrick Magruder	PERSON	, was also made Libra - rian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		During
Magruder	PERSON	's incum - bency , which lasted imtil
1815	DATE	, as well as during that of his predecessor , the actual management of the Library seems to have been left to the Assistant Librarian .

		Magruder resigned in
1814	DATE	, and in
1815	DATE	George VVatterston , a Wash - ing ` ton litterateur , was appointed .

		Much space -- too much space -- is given by Mr. J ohnston to the biography of this man , who may have been a prominent figure in the Capital in his days , but who was but a mediocre librarian .

		During the whirlwind caused by
Andrew Jack	PERSON	- son ,
Watterston	PERSON	was removed , and
John Silva Meehan	PERSON	was appointed in his place .

		The change was hardly for the better .

		Meehan was removed in
1861	DATE	, being regarded as a Southern sympa - thizer , and Dr.
J. G. Stephenson	PERSON	succeeded him .

		Stephenson resigned in
1863	DATE	, and on the
last day of 1864	DATE	President Lincoln appointed as his successor
Ainsworth R. Spofford	PERSON	, who since
1861	DATE	had served as Chief Assistant Librarian .

		Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	had already rendered valuable service to the Library , especially in preparing the alphabetical author catalogue of
1864	DATE	, which he followed up in
1869	DATE	with an ' Index of Subjects . '

		An interesting episode in the history of the
Library	LOCATION	during this period is the visit to this country of
Alexandre Vattemare	PERSON	and the begin - ning of the system of .

		international exchange of documents and other publications between libraries of all countries .

		The founding of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution also falls within this period ; the discussion of the proposed forma - tion , through the Smithson Fund , of a national library is treated at great length and forms one of the most interesting chapters in the book .

		Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's work is something more than a history -- and also something less .

		It is a collection of documents strung together on a rather thin thread of narrative .

		This , one may suppose , was done advisedly , as the most fitting treatment of the material in hand , the mass of which is certainly appalling .

		What has been given is , consequently , not so much a history as material for a history .

		But as such it is of great value .

		The index is rather meagre .

		It seemed to me as if I had myself written the book , in some former life , so sin - cerely it spoke my thought and experience . '

		Michael de ^ Montaigne died on the 13th of
September , 1592	DATE	; one week later there was published in
London	LOCATION
Eobert Greene	PERSON	's ' A Groatsworth of Wit , ' containing the first printed allusion to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sainte -
Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's wisest of Frenchmen makes his bow and retires from the stage just as the wisest of Englishmen enters to fill it for all time .

		But how vast is wisdom to express herself with such absolute divergence .

		No man ever lived , surely , who so took both men and fools into his confidence as did Montaigne .

		The most enter - taining biography in all the world , the journal intime of a spirit as honest as it was wise and as vivacious as it was simple , is yet to be con - structed out of the immortal ' Essais . '

		Of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, we know noth - ing .

		The author of the greatest drama litera - ture has produced remains so shrouded in mys - tery , under a world-wide blaze of publicity , that an elaborate theory has grown up , not indeed that the player ,
WiUiam Shakespeare	PERSON	, did not exist , but that he did not write the works generally known by his name .

		The first edition of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's '
Eesais	PERSON	' was published in
1580	DATE	.

		The breadth of experience they show , the infinite variety of historical and classical allusion , their extraordinary philoso - phical insight into men and things , very nat - urally led to the supposition , of Villemain among others , that the author had been a con - siderable traveller .

		But at that time Montaigne had been , in his own language , ' scarce out of sight of the vanes of his own house . '

		In fact he had gone no farther afield than the beaten path between his native
Perigord	ORGANIZATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		That path he had traversed many times , first as counsellor of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	and later as gentle - man of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's bedchamber to
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		The outlook of the ' Essais ' on the world is jiist Montaigne . '

		When I travel , ' he says quaintly , ' I do not look for Gascons : I have left them at home .

		I rather seek for Greeks and Persians . '

		Montaigne 's most extended search for Greeks and Persians took place during the years
1580	DATE	and
1581	DATE	, when he travelled leisurely to
Italy	LOCATION	through
Germany	LOCATION	and
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		His Journal of these travels is even more inter - esting in its way than the * Essais , ' for Mon - taigne on horseback seeing the world is more uniformly attractive than Montaigne in his tower saying some things certainly that he had better not have said .

		He displayed the instinct of the genuine traveller in his fondness for devising tours off the main route , just as the mood seized him , counting on getting lost from his more prosaic companions .

		When they remonstrated with him , he explained conclu - sively that he seemed to be like ' one who reads some delightful story or good book , and dreads to turn the last page . '

		Naturally , the bent of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's mind led him to observe the way of life of foreign folk , how they lived and what sort of social and political institutions they had developed for themselves .

		For this reason , the philosophical Frenchman is the most interesting traveller in an age of travel .

		His diary furnishes all sorts of valuable and curious information about the Elizabethan Germans and Italians .

		Some of this information found its way into later edi - tions of the ' Essais , ' and doubtless the reason why the Journal was not published by Mon - taigne or by his family was that he regarded it largely as material for future ' Essais . '

		It is a little difficult to understand Mon - taigne 's regret that he had not taken a cook along , for it would be fairly easy to concoct a German meal or to furnish an Italian house from the Journal .

		And just as in the ' Essais ' the most incongruous subjects jostle one another , so here we learn in one sentence that in
Ferrara	LOCATION	the streets were paved with bricks and they served fruit on plates .


Florence	LOCATION	, a smaller town than
Ferrara	PERSON	, was paved with flat stones without pattern or regularity .

		He found glass in the windows of even the smallest Swiss cottages , but the windows of Italian inns were open , except for huge wooden shutters that excluded sun , light , and air in bad weather .

		At
Lucca	LOCATION	, a fashionable watering-place , his bed was a movable frame resting on trestles and furnished only with a mattress and coverlet .

		Linen of all sorts , salt , cooking utensils , and candlesticks were rented extra .

		Dishes , glass - ware , and knives , the traveller bought himself .

		The cost of travel is recorded as high in Ger - many , cheaper in
France	LOCATION	, and cheapest in
Italy	LOCATION	, but Montaigne thought the German prices * quite justified ' by superior accommodations .

		There is an echo of Elizabethan music in the note of
Fano	PERSON	in the Marches , ' Rhymesters are to be found in almost every inn , ' and * there is a musical instrument in every shop , even the stocking-darner 's at the corner of the street . '

		Later , of
Empoli	LOCATION	, near
Florence	LOCATION	, we read that the peasants have * lutes in their hands and the pastoral songs of Ariosto on their lips -- which thing indeed may be observed all through
Italy	LOCATION	. '

		Toleration is a striking quality of this acute observation .

		Swiss cooking Montaigne found the best he had ever met with .

		So also he praises German stoves and feather coverlets and Italian oil .

		Pass - ing through
Fomovo	PERSON	on his way home , he does not mention the great French victory there .

		84 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, in
1495	DATE	, while he goes omt of his way to visit the battlefield of
Pavia	LOCATION	where
Francis I.	PERSON	lost all save that negligible piece of property he called his honor .

		Nowhere is Montaigne 's large-minded tol - eration more marked than towards religions differences .

		In
Augsburg	LOCATION	he ` attended a
Luth	PERSON	- eran baptism , in Eome he witnessed a Jewish circumcision .

		Curious facts of the change of religions turn up here and there .

		At
Lindau	LOCATION	the priest said there were only two or three Catholics in the place , but Montaigne observed that the priests and nuns still performed the service and drew their incomes .

		At
Kempten	LOCATION	in
Bavaria	LOCATION	he heard the mass celebi * ated on a
Thursday	DATE	with all the ceremonial of
Easter Sunday	DATE	at
Notre Dame	LOCATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	, but nobody was present but priests .

		Montaigne himself lived and died in the Catholic faith .

		He kissed the Pope 's toe , and has left here , I fancy , the most entertaining account of that performance , throwing in a highly picturesque and just description of the Bolognese Pope ,
Gregory XIII	PERSON	.

		At
Loreto	LOCATION	he bore witness to his piety by setting up to Our Lady a silver memorial of himself , his wife , and his daughter .

		But he goes on to say almost immediately , ' I have a suspicion that they melt down the old silver plate and put it to other uses . '

		Tlie Holy City he testifies enjoyed less liberty than Ven - ice .

		Burglaries were common and the streets were notoriously unsafe after nightfall .

		Again , the Eoman revenue ofl & cers searched his boxes , turning over ` even the smallest articles of apparel , ' while other Italian towns were sat - isfied by the presentation of the luggage for search .

		His Eoman experience with his books is characteristic .

		The books , among them a copy of the * Essais , ' were all seized and kept for a long w ` hile .

		Montaigne writes : ' This evening they brought back to me the vol - ume of my Essais , castigated and brought into harmony with the opinions of the monkish doctors . '

		It developed that the censor , unable himself to read French , had asked for the judgment of a French monk .

		Montaigne declined to agree with his countryman that he was in error on various points , -- for instance , that it is cruel to inflict on men greater pain than is necessary to kill them , or that children should be brought up to look at all sides of a question .

		The censor , * a man of parts , ' he records , ' completely exonerated me , and was anxious to let me see that he set small value on these emendations . '

		His book of Hours fell under suspicion because it was a
Paris	LOCATION	imprint , and ` La republique des Suisses ' was not returned to him , ` because they had found out that the trianslator was a heretic , though his name did not appear any - where in the volume . '

		In Eome ,
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	sought and obtained for himself the title of Eoman citizen . '

		It is a vain title , ' he says , ` nevertheless I take great pleasure in the possession of the same . '

		` Voila un aimable philosophe , ' observes
Sainte	PERSON	- Beuve , ' qui paye ouvertement son tribut ii I ` illusion est a la vanite humaine . '

		But it was not wholly vanity that prompted the amiable philosopher to secure Eoman citizen - ship .

		Montaigne was by nature a citizen of the world , and Eome was to him of all cities the one most filled with the corporate idea , the one in which differences of nationality counted least .

		He felt at home there , the very air he thought the pleasantest and wholesomest he had ever breathed .

		He was in the city negotiating the business of citizenship during Holy Week , and he has considerable to say about the pomp and grandeur of the religious ceremonies .

		He hears a bull excommunicating the Huguenots read before the pope from the great portico of St.
Peter	PERSON	's , he attends service in the
Sistine Chapel	LOCATION	, and one day on his way out after mass he stops , full of curiosity , to watch a priest exorcize an insane man .

		The shoes • and breeches of the flagellants on Good
Friday	DATE	sug - gested to him that they were persons of meian condition most of whom had hired themselves out for the occasion .

		This Eoane full of appeal to sight and sense was all for the court and the nobility .

		He noted that there were no main streets of trade , but that gardens and palaces abounded everywhere .

		These palaces built over the antique ruins of classic Eome Montaigne compared to the nests of martins and crows on the roofs and in the walls of the French churches destroyed by the Huguenots in
Peri	LOCATION	- gord .

		Here is the real Montaigne , profoundly impressed by the spell of Eome .

		Going about the city with his favorite authors ,
Plutarch	PERSON	and
Seneca	LOCATION	, in his head , he was delighted to find that he needed no other guide , and he declared that the only Eome he recognized was the sky above his head and the
august	DATE	sites beneath his feet .

		What he saw was the sepulchre of the ancient world , and the vastness of a world in ruins suggested to him , he said , not compre - hension , but respect and reverence only .

		Much of the interest of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's travels comes from his habit everywhere of seeking out and talking with all sorts and conditions of men .

		In
Basel	LOCATION	he supped with
Felix Plater	PERSON	and saw , for the first time , in the great physi - cian 's house an articulated skeleton .

		He made a point in
Ferrara	LOCATION	of going to see the unhappy Tasso in his prison-house , and he dined in
Florence	LOCATION	with the
Grand Duke	LOCATION	,
Francesco dei Medici	PERSON	, and his Venetian wife ,
Bianca Capello	PERSON	.

		He thought the Grand Duchess a hand - some woman , according to Italian taste , with

		THE DIAL , 85 an agreeable and inspiring face .

		On the whole , it is clear that
Montaigne	PERSON	did not see much beauty abroad .

		One pretty exception to the monotony of comments on the plainness of Grerman and Italian women is the record of his secretary , made in Stertziag in the
Tyrol	LOCATION	: * M. de Montaigne , having espied a fair young girl in a church , asked if she could speak Latin , deeming she was a scholar . '

		From these conversations , or from reflections to which they gave rise , there flows a steady stream of engaging wisdom .

		He went to a dance of country folk in the great hall of the
Grand Duke	ORGANIZATION	's palace in
Florence	LOCATION	, and reflects , ' I have a notion that this licence , which they enjoy on the great feast day of the city , seems to them a sort of shadow of their lost liberty . '

		Of
Pistoia	LOCATION	, with its gonfalonier and nine priors living in great state in the grand ducal palace during their short term of office , but essentially imprisoned there for the two months , he writes : * I felt pity at the sight of men thus satisfied with these apish tricks . '

		At the baths of
Lucca	LOCATION	two physicians wait upon the traveller and beg him to act as umpire in their consulta - tion over the case of a nephew of Cardinal de Cesis , * whereupon , ' says Montaigne , * I could not help laughing in my sleeve , ' adding , ' Medicine after all is a poor affair . '

		For some reason the French ambassador was denied access to the
Vatican Librarj	ORGANIZATION	- to which Mon - taigne was admitted without difficult -RCB- ' .

		He philosophises , -- * A11 things come easily to men of a certain temper , and are unattainable by others .

		Right occasion and opportunity have their privileges , and oftentimes hold out to ordinary folk what they deny to kings . '

		Montaigne 's Journal was first translated into English by
William Hazlitt	PERSON	, and annexed to his edition of
Charles Cotton	PERSON	's translation of the Essays in
1842	DATE	.

		Curiously enough , Mr.
W. Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	, in a recent reprint -LRB-
1902	DATE	-RRB- of his father 's work , omits the translation of the Journal for the whimsical reason , entirely gratuitous , that the diary is all in the third person and was dictated by Montaigne to his secretary .

		As a matter of fact more than half of the story of the journey , the last half , was written by
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's own hand , as
William Hazlitt	PERSON	expressly notes when he comes to the break .

		But
Hazlitf	PERSON	s translation is now out of date , and Mr.
W. G. Waters	PERSON	has done a real service to letters by making a new one .

		His book has been beautifully printed by BaUantyne of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, and is enriched by photogravures of Montaigne and of his tomb in the vestibule of the
Hall of Faculties	ORGANIZATION	at
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, together with nine plates from
Piranesi	ORGANIZATION	's ' Views of

		THE liUXUKTES OF AXTIQUARIAXISM .

		* The rich man has his luxuries -- yachts , automobiles , palaces , mostly vanities of the senses to the austere philosophic mind .

		Why should not the poor scholar have his , -- vast libraries , rare manuscripts , recherche fac - similes , vain and non-productive though these things may sometimes seem to tiie utilitarian rich ?

		` Ah , why Shoald life all labour beT the Lotos-Eater -LRB- the Natural Man -RRB- pointedly inquires .

		Not quite the same is the inquiry of the antiquarian scholar on the American side of the great waters , who is trying to cooperate in the modem movement for the resuscitation and re-interpretation of the past in its richer and more significant and more vital epochs .

		Rather his plaint is : Why , if life is to be labor , should labor be with such imperfect materials and means ?

		Why , with such wealth behind us and around us , must American libraries of research , generous in some of their beginnings , be so few , so slow of growth , so hampered and neglected ?

		Why is it that our university libraries are almost uni - formly unendowed and ill-housed , confined to a modicum of books in print , and few of them rich in the older material , much of it still pux - diasable , which makes true historical and lit - erary research possible ?

		But , even as he puts the question , are not riches and learning already striking hands ?

		Is not the time now come when books as well as laboratory and museum material shall begin to bulk in uni - versity budgets and in the gifts of our Car - negies and our Rockefellers ?

		In
England	LOCATION	at least , if not in
America	LOCATION	, things are being done in more liberal measure .

		There is the incomparable library of the British Museum , and a score of others that are supple - mentary ; publishing societies , like the Early English Text Society , are supported , even though meagrely ; there , too , facsimile edi - tions of the Shakespeare folios and of the first Chaucer folio are being published ; the
Palaeographical Society	ORGANIZATION	has been re-established ; and , as a striking single illustration of the trend over there , the present magnificent photo - graphic facsimile and transcript of an often - cited but little-known Elizabeiian manuscript in the library of the Duke of
Northumberland	LOCATION	has just been given to the world .

		The manuscript itself is valuable , and brings to light some new material .

		-LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, deeply grateful for the gift thus made to the learned public .

		It is to be hoped that more of the many existing manuscripts of this sort may be similarly produced .

		But , aiter all , the thrifty and frugal mind must query whether the value in this case is commensurate with the outlay .

		As it stands , we have a beautiful monu - ment of palaeography ; but what if the tran - script alone had been printed , in modest form , and the rest of the sum here expended had been turned in to the scanty treasury of the Early English Text Society ?

		Would we not be bet - ter off if that had been done ?

		And so this vol - ume seems to us to be one of the luxuries of antiquarianism , set forth by the munificence of a patron .

		Yet who will be socialist enough to say that the taste and personal preference of this patron should not be allowed ?

		The manuscript , which dates about
1597	DATE	, and seems to have been written for one of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's kin , perhaps in
Bacon	LOCATION	's own scriptorium , con - tains in its present mutilated form some nine pieces , six of them by
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	himself , -- two or three of these latter being well-known tracts or speeches of his , one a copy of speeches for a court ` Device ' -LRB- two of them unknown before the discovery of this MS. in
1867	DATE	-RRB- , one a brief essay * Of Magnanimitie or heroicall virtue ' never before printed , and another , ' An Advertisement touching private Censure , ^ dealing with the toleration question , never before printed .

		There is also a brief speech ` ffor the
Earle of Sussex	ORGANIZATION	at ye tilt , an : 96 , ' never before printed and of unknown author - ship , and the well-known letter of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	to Queen Elizabeth against the
Anjou	LOCATION	marriage .

		The bulk of the volume , however , is taken up with that choice anonymous specimen of Elizabethan personal abuse and political invective known as * Leicester 's Common - wealth . '

		■ There is something monumentally impudent yet delicious in the ending of this latter piece , where the author , after pursuing Leicester through some eighty folio pages with unrelenting and atrocious abuse , craves par - don ` of my Lord of Leicester for my boldnesse , if I have been too plaine with him ' !

		The
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	material that is new presents little of great value .

		The part not new is instructive for various varianis from the accepted texts , and thus the volume is important for students of
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		But the manuscript as we have it here is mutilated .

		The outer sheet , among numerous scribblings , seems to present a list of the orig - inal contents , omitting , however , four of the pieces actually contained in the group .

		If we may trust this list , there was once in the vol - ume , along with additional essays by
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	, the lost play of ' The He of Dogs ' by
Nash	PERSON	, and ` Asmund and
Cornelia	PERSON	' ; also two Shake - spearian plays , the ` Kichard II . '

		and ` Rich - ard III . '

		Among the scribblings , too , along with entries of tiie names of
Thomas Nashe	PERSON	.

		Bacon , and
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, in separate lines , occurs in one line the mysterious con - junction ` By Mr.
ffrauncis William Shake	PERSON	- speare . '

		Another proof , of course , of the Baconian authorship of Shakespeare !

		Of the evidence of such furtive inference , of innuendo , and of laborious intricate vaticination , like that of medicine man , astrologer , or alchemist in all ages , is that theory built up !

		What May We Believe ?

		* Science , speaking objectively , is concerned with physical realities ; a scientific concept is one which has for its basis sense-impressions , regarded by us as tokens of an external world of being .

		Metaphysical conceptions are those resulting from the projection of normally - derived concepts , in various combinations , into regions where they are beyond the test of expe - rience .

		We may postulate a third region of Metapsychics , conceivable in the sense that the metaphysics , or even physics , of some superior being might be wholly metapsychical , i. e. , unthinkable , to us .

		Certainly , as we descend in the scale of life , there must soon come a point where our metaphysics become metapsychic , and eventually one where our physics are equally so , and self-consciousness finally sinks in the infrapsychic .

		The mind of man , thus confined within nar - row limits of clear perception , has always been restless .

		In truth , this is not because of the smallness of his field , but rather because of the obscurity of its boundaries , and their varia - bility according to individual and race .

		The man of science is ever for enlarging his domain , but he purposes that it shall be his indeed , from wall to wall ; his notion of property is that understood by the law , not that of the artist who owns the distant landscape by virtue of his enjoyment of it .

		The idealist refuses to recog - nize boundaries , and insists upon planting his choicest flowers on the other side of the wall ; where , perchance , the wild beasts devour them , and the man of science says ' I told you so . '

		The reconciliation of these quarrelsome indi - viduals is no light task .

		Your modem idealist denies the proposition , so admirable to common sense , that a bird in the hand is worth two in • Science and Immortality .

		THE DIAL .

		87 the bush .

		He even ventures to urge that it is not worth one in the bush , when that one hops cheerfully and sings sweetly .

		Wliat is one to say to such an unreasonable individual ?

		Must we prove that it ts in the hand , after all , to bring about an agreement ?

		That , possibly , is not worth while ; it is too much like breaking the cup to prove its fragility .

		The three books at present under review attempt , in their several ways , either to move the wall or justify the individual who would cUmb over it .

		It is hardly possible to take a precisely neutral position , although that is here and there attempted .

		Dr.
William Osier	PERSON	, Professor of Medicine ,
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, just now appointed
Regius Professor of Medicine	ORGANIZATION	in the
University	ORGANIZATION	- of
Oxford	LOCATION	, delivered the Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	in
1904	DATE	.

		Coming after
James	PERSON	,
Fiske	PERSON	, and others of high renown , he was justified in the expression of a certain modest timidity ; but as we close the little book we feel proud to be of the English - speaking race , with a language capable of being put to such worthy use .

		The argument is not of the strenuous sort ; the words flow gently and naturally , as they expose the mellowed thought of a mature and reverent mind .

		As we found in reading
James	PERSON	, the very mildness of the insistence , the very modesty of the presenta - tion , lends to it a force which is not at all inherent in many a fist-aided pulpit oration .

		We may be permitted a single quotation , suf - ficiently long to give a good idea of the lan - guage and the meaning . '

		A word in conclusion to the young men in the audience .

		As perplexity of soul will be your lot and portion , accept the situation with a good grace .

		The hopes and fears which make us men are insep - arable , and this wine-press of Doubt each one of you must tread alone .

		It is a trouble from which no man may relieve his brother or make agreement with another for him .

		Better that your spirit 's bark be driven far from the shore -- far from the trembling throng whose sails were never to the tempest given -- than that you should tie it up to rot at some lethean wharf .

		On the question before us wide and far your hearts will range from those early days when matins and evensong , evensong and matins sang the larger hope of humanity into your young souls .

		In certain of you the changes and chances of the years ahead will reduce this to a vague sense of eternal continuity , with which , as
Walter Pater	PERSON	says , none of us wholly part .

		In a very few it will be begotten again to the lively hope of the Teresians ; while a majority will retain the sabbatical interest of the Laodicean , as little able to appreciate the fervid enthusiasm of the one as the cold philosophy of the other .

		Some of you will wander through all phases , to come at last , I trust , to the opinion of
Cicero	LOCATION	, who had rather be mistaken with Plato than be right with those who deny altogether the life after death ; and this u my own confessio fidei : -LRB- Pp. 42-43 . -RRB-

		The volume entitled ' Ideals of Science and Faith ' consists of a series of essays by various British writers , edited by tiie Eev .


J. E. Hand	PERSON	, who provides a rather prosy introduction .

		The essays are of various degrees of merit , the best being * A Physicist 's Approach , ' by Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	, * A Biological Approach , ' by Professors
J. A. Tliomson	PERSON	and
Patrick Geddes	PERSON	, * A Sociolog - ical Approach towards Unity , ' by Mr.
Victor V. Branford	PERSON	, and * An Educational Approach -- A Technical Approach , ' by Professor
Geddes	PERSON	.

		The Eev .


John Kelman	PERSON	, in * A Presbyterian Approach , ' frankly accepts the teachings of science , and sums up his position thus ; ' Looking forward , we wait for new light , not only without trembling for the faith , but with eager cnriosity that we may understand our faith more perfectly .

		Looking back , along the line of the his - tory of Presbyterianism , we see a long controversy , due mainly to a misunderstanding .

		But behind and beneath all controversy , we are proud to recognize in Presbyterian faith the basal principles of all true science -- the demand for unity and order , and the assertion of the rights of intellect . '

		-LRB- P. 2Ao . -RRB-

		On the other hand , Mr.
Wilirid Ward	PERSON	, speaking for the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	, says : * The results of the scientific movement , as they come to us from the hands of the opponents of Christianity , the church can not accept .

		They are not pure science .

		What is advanced as science is in reaUty often subtly coloured by the prepossessions of its advocates .

		Only learning and thought among Christians themselves , fairly equal in extent and quality to those of their opponents , can afford the means for the desired synthesis . '

		-LRB- P. 322 . -RRB-

		Mr.
Branford	PERSON	's essay is a very suggestive one , setting forth the view that human activities continually tend to run -- not exactly ' to seed , ' but to barrenness in formalism and ceremonialism .

		That which was first symbolic is at length taken for the thing it symbolizes , while the thing itself is forgotten .

		In religion the outcome is , of course , idolatry ; in industry it is finance , whereby the manipulation of the tokens of wealth is supposed to be equivalent to the production of goods , and the rich man has often no more relation to the sources of his gains than the idol has to the God -LRB- or , if you like , idea -RRB- he was originally intended to typify .

		In literature and art , the equivalent of idolatry is found in the work of the stylists , who are satisfied with clever technique , though the result may be idiotic or beastly to the man who looks beneath the surface .

		In politics , the expression of a living need or sentiment tends at length to crystallize into a rigid law , which presently assumes superiority over the people for whose good it was made , and compels those who would make necessary readjustments at times to resort to revolutions .

		Will our readers be scandalized if we suggest that the
United States Constitution	ORGANIZATION	is already too much like an idol ?

		Science does not escape from the tend - ency to formalism any more than religion , poli -

Feb. 1	DATE	, tics , industry , or art .

		If it now seems free , it is because in the more civilized countries it is growing rapidly ; but those who are intimately acquainted with its condition are well aware that ` eternal vigilance is the price of liberty , ' in science as elsewhere .

		There have been times when science was almost the least progressive of human activities , and our author intimates that certain phases of mathematics today come dangerously near to pure formalism .

		Mr.
Orlando J.	PERSON	.

		Smith , in his book called ` Balance , ' endeavors to deduce human immor - tality , and other things , from
Newton	LOCATION	's postu - late that * to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . '

		In other words , to revert to the simile given at the beginning of this article , he undertakes to prove that these things are not really outside the wall .

		The result is unsat - isfactory to the materialists , who do not accept his demonstration as valid , and equally so to those who like the other side of the wall , because it is the other side .

		The little book was sent to a large number of persons -LRB- mostly D.D. 's , but including Messrs.
Mallock	PERSON	,
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	, etc. -RRB- before publication , with requests for a review , and these reviews , favorable and unfav - orable , have been published with it .

		Further review is therefore perhaps superfluous , though there are many things one would like to say .

		An Indictment of the Policy of the

Siam	LOCATION	, that kingdom botli new and old , and across the waters to the northern
United States	LOCATION	, the recent books of travel afford more than a glimpse of a world in which the one salient fact is human sympathy and earnest endeavor at understanding and interpretation .

		All these books , -- some of them as beautiful as modern color processes for real works of art can make them , most of the others with photo - graphs reproduced in half-tone , -- survey the foreigner with pleasure and in friendship , seek - ing to bring the people of the world together on a basis of common sympathy and apprecia - tion , and succeeding to a marked degree .

		No one will rise from a reading of these numerous works without being more amicably disposed toward those of other climes and races , with - out a widening of sympathies as well as a deeper comprehension of facts .

		And this is very modem and significant .

		The most beautiful of these books is that for which Mr.
Hallam Murray	PERSON	has made a devout pilgrimage ` On the Old Road through
France	LOCATION	to
Florence	LOCATION	. '

		In the earlier half of his jour - ney , from
Rouen	LOCATION	to the confines of
Italy	LOCATION	at
Mentone	LOCATION	, he was accompanied by Mr.
Henry W. Nevinson	PERSON	, in the latter half , on to the beauties of
Florence	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	Car - ` michael .

		The text of the book is subordinate to the illustrations , of which there are no fewer than forty-eight in color , admirably printed on paper more dull and hence more grateful to the eye than usual , besides eighteen sketches printed in the text .

		The cover shows the fleurs - de-lis of
France	LOCATION	and of
Florence	LOCATION	, with the scallop shell of
Normandy	LOCATION	and the pilgrim , a commendable and appropriate bit of symbolism .

		The narrative , however , refuses to stand upon a lower level even than Mr.
Murray	PERSON	's beautiful pictures , being informed with the spirit of true literature , filled with historical references , and not without the glamour of poetry from the lands where the world of modem poesy came into being .

		There is , for example , a chapter in Mr.
Nevinson	PERSON	's account on ' Minor Saints Anglo-French Agreement .

		THE DIAL , 89 and Prophets / from which the following is worth reprinting : ' Minor saints , minor poets , -- the whole of this country of
Languedoc	LOCATION	and
Provence	LOCATION	has been full of them .

		They are the great benefactors of man - \ kind .

		The times that produce great saints and great | poets can look after themselves .

		When St.
Francis	PERSON	or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is at work , no one is likely to forget the worship of the Holy Ghost .

		But it is during the years when the spirit of man burns low , when peo - ple live and die with souls unkindled , wallowing in the common round , the daily task , the struggle for an average and uninspired existence -- it is then that the minor saint , the minor poet , fulfill their benefaction and maintain the tradition of that holy spirituality which neither strives , nor cries , nor pays . '

		To build a boat in the mountains of
Switzer	PERSON	- land , convey it to
Lake Zurich	LOCATION	, and thence navigate it -LRB- when it was not being towed -RRB- down the
Ehine	LOCATION	through
Germany	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	and across to the mouth of the Thames , surely make up an achievement sufficiently remarkable to deserve commemoration in book form .

		Hence Mr.
Donald Maxwell	PERSON	's * Log of the ''
Griffin	PERSON	'' ' will be found full of strange events , told with the utmost good humor , and -- as the purpose of the long voyage was rather the making of pic - tures than anything else -- full also of charm - ing sketches of German and Dutch scenes , partly the work of the author and partly that of his first mate and sole companion , Mr.
Cot	PERSON	- tington
Taylor	PERSON	.

		There were some exciting events during the voyage , -- the *
Griffin	PERSON	* was twice shipwrecked , -- and the manner in which it was greeted by the inhabitants along the river is really illustrative of national char - acter : it was not until the little ship was in the Thames that it was subjected to ridicule !

		Without being in any way a serious work , the narrative c-ommends itself as well-told , vera - cious , original ; while in its artistic aspect the book is beautiful .

		As evidence of what can be done by the strenuous traveller in a very short time , tiie book by Mr.
John TJ	PERSON	.

		Higinbotham , a busi - ness man of
Chicago	LOCATION	, entitled ` Three Weeks in
Europe	LOCATION	, ' is noteworthy .

		Within the brief period named , the author contrived to see some - thing of Xaples ,
Capri	LOCATION	,
Pompeii	LOCATION	,
Eome	LOCATION	,
Flor	PERSON	- ence ,
Venice	LOCATION	, !


Milan	LOCATION	,
Lugano	LOCATION	,
Lucerne	LOCATION	,
Berne	LOCATION	,
Zurich	LOCATION	,
Shaffhausen	LOCATION	,
Bale	ORGANIZATION	, and had three days in
Paris	LOCATION	and as many in
London	LOCATION	.

		The narra - tive is good-natured , quite without pretension , and readable ; and it is provided with numerous illustrations , reproduc-ed from photographs , apparently of Mr.
Higinbotham	PERSON	's own taking .

		Mr.
Gilbert Watson	PERSON	's ' Sunshine and
Senti	PERSON	- ment in
Portugal	LOCATION	' is a curious book , in which fact and fiction are so commingled that it is difficult to distinguish each from each .

		We make out that the author fell in love with a very pretty Portugese girl while accompany - ing an expedition for excavating certain lime - stone caves near Faro , and that nothing par - ticular came from either the love affair or the excavation , except the present book .

		It justi - fies its name , for it is bright and sunny , and succeeds in giving an idea of certain unin - spected sides of the Portuguese character , induc - ing the reflection that very little is known , about a country that appears to improve mightily upon intimate contact .

		The illustrations , which are rather indifferent , appear to be by the author .

		There is little in the book of Dr.
Hugo Ganz	PERSON	concerning the Bussia of to-day that adds to - the recent knowledge poured forth so profusely concerning that unhappy land .

		He proves it to be indeed * The Land of Biddies , ' as many a traveller has done before him ; but he does - this largely out of the mouths of distinguished individuals whose names he withholds .

		Him - self an Austrian , with prejudices under full control , he made no special preparation for his sojourn imder alien skies , -- his chief concern seemingly having been to escape the courtesies of the
Bussian	PERSON	secret police , about whom he had every reason to feel apprehensive .

		He has much to say about von Plehve which seems to indicate that his taking off was a great national benefit .

		One searching chapter on the imperial family is perhaps the most enlightening series of statements in the book , -- certainly the most significant at this time .

		With a kindness of heart and intention that can not be gainsaid , there is nevertheless in the Czar a weakness of judgment described as ` almost pathological , ' and this with an intellect which Dr.
Ganz	PERSON	says can best be characterized as ` subtle . '

		After reading the book ,
Busia	LOCATION	still remains the land of contradiction .

		The translation , by ^ Mj - .


Herman Bosenthal	PERSON	, is into excellent English .

		Old
Galloway	PERSON	, especially that portion of it known as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright , is exploited by Mr.
S. B. Crockett	PERSON	in his * Baider - land , ' both historically and in a literary sense .

		He has gathered together the old legends of a spot long independent of settled law as under - stood by its neighbors , and has scattered these legends through the work , giving it th.e air of a collection of more or le `` doubtfiQ history but of excellent literary material .

		About these - episodes are woven fragments of descriptioni and statements taken from the authentic his - tories , bits of modem experiences , and descrip - tions of natural scenes and beai * ties .

		The work concludes with ` The Diary of an Eighteenth - Century
Galloway Laird	PERSON	, ' one
William Cun	PERSON	- inghame of
Coprington	LOCATION	, who spent much time in
Virginia	LOCATION	as manager for the tobacco lords of that day .

		The book has an index , and the drawings of Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	are , as always , , delightful .

		90 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, Mr.
Moussa Aflalo	PERSON	, author of ` The Truth about
Morocco	LOCATION	, ' although a British subject , was for almost a lifetime continually connected with the courts of successive Sultans of that little known land .

		His book is written with an eye single to overthrowing that policy of
Great Britain	LOCATION	which may be best described as giving
France	LOCATION	a free hand for the annexation of the
Morocco	LOCATION	territory to its other northern African possessions , in return for a freer hand accorded
England	LOCATION	in the settlement of questions now agitating the
Far East	LOCATION	, -- in effect a partial abrogation of the alliance between
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is , in the main , an attack upon
Lord Lansdowne	ORGANIZATION	's policy in respect to
Morocco	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	's commercial interests there , and devotes itself to showing how great the loss will be when
France	LOCATION	has assumed control , and how thoroughly everything painfully done to • raise British prestige through a long series of years has been overturned by a scratch of the pen .

		The book presents a thorough statement of the attitude of
Morocco	LOCATION	toward the outer world , by one in possession of the facts .

		The Hon.
Elbert E. Farman	PERSON	was for many years United States Consul-Oeneral at
Cairo	LOCATION	, and as the highest official representative of his country in
Egypt	LOCATION	at the time of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's visit to that interesting region in
May	DATE	and
June of 1877	DATE	, he was thrown into intimate association with that distinguished soldier dur - ing his tour up the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		By skilfully blend - ing with his descriptive narrative , ` Along the Nile with
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, ' a really profound knowledge of Egyptian antiquities and of the most modern developments , Mr.
Farmian	PERSON	has succeeded in keeping his book fully up to the times in one respect , while presenting an excel - lent portrait of Grant on the other .

		To Amer - icans , nothing can be of more interest than the report of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's conversation during the jour - ney , given in the
General	ORGANIZATION	's own words .

		` When I went to
Washington	LOCATION	to take command of the armies , I had in mind three plans for a move - ment upon the forces under
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	.

		One was that which I adopted .

		A second was to divide the army of the Potomac into three divisions , and with ten days ' rations cut loose from
Washington	LOCATION	and move quickly to the northwest of ESchmond and compel Lee to fight immediately a decisive battle .

		If I had then had two generals that I had known as well as I afterwards knew Generals
Sherman	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	, and in whose ability I had had the same ■ confidence that I afterwards had in theirs , I should have adopted this plan .

		I would have taken com - .

		inand personally of one of these divisions and placed the two Generals each in command of one of the • others .

		But I had no generals that I then dared to trust with so important an undertaking ... I adopted the first because I regarded it as certain • of success , though I knew it would involve hard fighting and great sacrifices . '

		/ Dar-ul-Islam , ' the title of Mr.
Mark ^ Sykes	PERSON	's really enjoyable volume , signifies ` the heart of Mohammedanism , ' and is most apt .

		His wanderings began at
Beyrut	LOCATION	, in
November , 1902	DATE	, and ended at the Eussian frontier not far from
Mount Ararat	LOCATION	, apparently in the mid - dle of
1903	DATE	.

		His journey took him to
Damascus	LOCATION	,
Palmyra	LOCATION	,
Aleppo	LOCATION	,
Zeitun	LOCATION	,
Diarbekr	PERSON	,
Nisibin	ORGANIZATION	,
Sulimanieh	PERSON	on the Persian frontier ,
Mosul	LOCATION	,
Bitlis	LOCATION	, Van , and
Mosuna	LOCATION	, and thence home by way of
Orgoif	LOCATION	, Tiflis ,
Batum	PERSON	, and the Black Sea .

		Mr.
Sykes	PERSON	, it seems , is an Irishman , and he brings to his book a keen sense of the ridic - ulous which compels liis delighted readers to share with him many wonderful things he came upon during his extended tour , some of it over lands little known to the Caucasian of to-day .

		Of these he drew sketch maps , and his text corrects some errors of the guide-books , whidh in the main , however , were found accurate .

		He shared the life of the people among whom he sojourned , and he has kindly words to say for the Turk at all times , -- many more , in fact , than for the degraded races to which the Otto - man empire , in spite of impressions to the con - trary , is still bringing peace and enlighten - ment .

		He dwells on the democracy of the
East	LOCATION	, too firmly a part of the daily life to require argument regarding it .

		We reproduce a passage describing an incident witnessed by the author at
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		` We passed the funeral of a
Hamal	LOCATION	porter .

		In Moslem countries it is customary for the friends of the dead to carry them to the grave , taking turns to put their shoulders beneath the load ; but this poor , rough coffin was only borne by three , and no one followed to mourn or help .

		In the midst of the bustle of the street , the cracking of whips , the cries of the hawkers , the laughter and playing of children , this sad , shuflSing , laboring group had a piteous and forlorn appearance .

		On the other side of the road walked a Palace aide-de-camp tightly laced in a smart Prussian uniform ; he jingled his spurs and clanked his sword in the manner of the continental oflScer ; he curled his mustache like a fop and smoked his cigarette with an air of languid condescension , in excellent imitation of the lieuten - ant of
Western Europe	LOCATION	and his marvelous swagger , bom of years of peaceful armament ; but still when this man saw the funeral , he hooked up his sword , threw away his cigarette , and , stepping out into the street , put his shoulder under the coffin and strode along sharing the burden with the three ragged porters . '

		Mr.
H. Valentine Greer	PERSON	, an Englishman , was associated with the researches conducted by
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	on the site of ancient Nippur in
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	, and with Pro- fessor
Flinders Petrie	PERSON	in the excavations in
Egypt	LOCATION	; and he has combined the results of his experiences in a book entitled ' By
Nile	ORGANIZATION	and
Euphrates	LOCATION	. '

		So far as the valley of the latter river is concerned , he has a tale of its inhabi - tants and their rulers , the Turks , varying con - sidertably from that of Mr.
Sykes	PERSON	, in the book last mentioned , -- it may be assumed , becaiLse he was brought into little contact with the
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTAT .

		91 Turks as individuals .

		Of the scientific and his - torical results of his various excavations he has almost nothing to say , those being reserved for the official publications of their directors .

		One of his experiences at
Bahsamun	LOCATION	, near
Fay	PERSON	- oum , is worth reprinting .

		` In one tomb I had a curious experience .

		Ali had just cleared the entrance from the shaft as I came upon the scene , and as I looked into the chamber by the light of a candle it seemed as if the place had never been touched .

		There were more than a dozen bodies , which were ranged around the walls , and the floor was covered with a thick layer of dust .

		The minute I stepped into the cham - ber I broke the crust of dust , and before my aston - ished eyes the whole contents of the tomb crum - bled away instantly .

		It was rather an uncanny sight , but the explanation was simple enough .

		The dust had settled over the bodies , after the last burial , and becoming moist had practically taken a mould of everything that lay under it and hard - ened sufficiently to keep its shape as the shrinkage and sinking of what lay beneath had taken place .

		Utterly undisturbed , it had been strong enough to support its own weight , but , naturally , when I trod upon it the lot crumbled to powder . '

		The author gives an account of the misunder - standing which sent him back to
England	LOCATION	after he had reached the site of Nippur , in full accordanc-e with Professor
Hilprecht	PERSON	's state - ments .

		The book is well illustrated with repro - duced photographs .

		In a portly volume entitled ' Inner Jeru - salem , ' filled with illustrative photographs of places and scenes , Mr.
A. Goodrich	PERSON	- Freer has contrived to answer a great many interesting questions regarding life in the
Holy City	LOCATION	, so that the reader rises from the work with a sense of having at last learned just what Jeru - salem means to its widely assorted inhabitants , especially to those who comprise the European colonies there .

		The knowledge displayed in the book is such as could have been acquired only by long residence , and is used with dis - crimination and a sympathetic outlook upon the curious ramifications of temporal and spir - itual power .

		Mr. Freer gives some statistics concerning Protestant missions in
that quarter	DATE	, which go to show that the expense of bringing an occasional unbeliever to the Cross is some - what disproportionate to results achieved else - where .

		He summarizes the results of the activities of the
Church Missionary Society	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Anglican -RRB- , from
1895	DATE	to
1901	DATE	inclusive , as follows : ' In seven years there has been a total expenditure in Palestine of # 114,370 ... The number of adult baptisms has been nine , ... at the cost of
# 12,707	MONEY	per head . '

		It is to be observed that here the Protestants are debarred from attempting to convert members of other Christian churches , and from pros - elytization among Moslems , as matters of essen - tial comity and policy .

		England appears to be exceedingly backward in everything that could add to her prestige in this region , while the comparatively recent visit of the German Emperor has been productive of striking results .

		A number of Siamese officials gathered together at the recent
Louisana	LOCATION	Purchase Expo - sition in

		Siam has taken long strides for - ward in recent years , as the statistics adduced bear ample witne ^ ; and there seems to have been a hand sufficiently restraining to keep the people of the kingdom from the specious advances of

		Perhaps the chief interest of the book to us lies in its revelation of these differences of library organi - zation , management , and ideals , -- these in tum being conditioned by the nature of the communi - ties which the libraries serve .

		The book oi -RRB- ens - with a brief outline of public library history in

		Chapters two , three , and four deal with , organization , classification , and cataloguing , and such minor details as book - repairing , correspondence , reports , helping read - ers , and what to do in emergencies .

		Chapter five treats of librarj ' extension work , a branch of public service less developed than with us .

		The final chapter is really the only one dealing specifically with the library assistant , for whom the book Avas written .

		Matters of pei-sonal con - duct and obedience to superiors ai'e discussed , and fatherly advice is freely offered to the ambi - tious subordinate who hopes to rise .

		The impor - tance of general information , of knowing some - thing of everything rather than everything of something , is dwelt upon .

		The usefulness of this smattering of knowledge in library work is , perhaps unfortunately , not to be denied ; yet our authors would have done well to advise in addi - tion a scholarly application to some one branch of learning .

		A few matters of no value to American library workers will be found in the book , such as the numerous references to the * indicator ' and its proper use .

		Since the old
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	indicator was discarded , thirty years ago , this cumbersome and in large libraries impracticable method of showing what books are in and what are out , has rarely if ever been emploj ^ ed in our libraries .

		In the chapter on cataloguing , which might well have discussed more at length the various kinds of catalogues , the usefulness in many instances of a title entry together with subject and author entries is insufl & ciently recognized .

		As a work of literature this jDrimer leaves some - thing to be desired .

		In a treatise emphasizing again and again the importance of accuracy and of attention to details , it is startling to meet with so slovenly a sentence as this , having refer - ence to these very matters of detail : ' But if , as is often unfortunately the case -- especially when a new library has to be prepared for opening in a very limited time -- they are neg - lected , it will be found very diflScult to after - wards teach the staff the wisdom of so doing .

		Dr.

College of Engineering	ORGANIZATION	in
Japan	LOCATION	in the seventies ; and his monument may be beheld not only in the title * Emeritus Profes - sor
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	' of Tokio , and in the bronze bust upon a column which his Japanese admirers have raised in his honor , but also in the superb material results visible in the army , navy , railways , factories , and multifarious oper - ations in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		At the end of each of his twenty chapters he gives a bibliography ; but in his text he quotes entirely too much fi * om Pro- fessor
Chamberlain	PERSON	and other British writers , thus revealing his limitations on the ideal side of life .

		The style of the book is pragmatic , and not calculated to thrill ; but in one point Dr.
Dyer	PERSON	has excelled all other writers on
Japan	LOCATION	.

		He shows clearly and forcibly , as well as copi - ously , what the great aimy of
Yatoi	LOCATION	, hired assist - ants and salaried organizers and advisers , in the days of their youth and strength thirty years ago , did for the Japanese in raising their ideals and pointing the way to future success .

		In cer - tain chapters , -- like those on the fall of Feud - alism , the Japanese Mind , Transition , Education , etc. , -- Dr.
Dyer	PERSON	shows little acquaintance with the native literature or history apart from what one can pick up by reading foreign books ; but his other chapters , on Industrial Developments , Art Industries ,
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	,
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, and
Finance	ORGANIZATION	, are handled in a bold and masterly Avay .

		Like all who have served the Japanese longest as co-Avorkers and brothers in sympathy , Dr ,
Dyer	PERSON	scouts the idea of any ' yelloAV peril . '

		He finds more to dread in the future from the royal and imperial pharisees of

		To meet this need has been the aim of Prof.

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is the outgrowth of a series of lectures given to the classes in biology at the Woman 's College of

		The plan
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 93 followed in the treatment of the subject is some - what different from that which has become con - ventional in popular lectures and treatises on evolution .

		The first half of the book , roughly speaking , is occupied with a very condensed out - line of the theoiy of organic evolution as it is held by the majority of biologists at the present time , together with a brief account of some of the more important objections that have been urged against it .

		The stock evidence usually adduced in its support is presented separately in the second half of the book under the head - ing ' The Phenomena Explained by the Theory . '

		Aside from this departure in the grouping of the material , the treatment does not differ essen - tially from that usually followed bj * popular writers on the subject .

		An excellent account is given of the principal facts regai ` ding coloration in animals .

		One of the concluding sections is ■ devoted to the relation of man to evolution , in which the author earnestly urges the importance of educating public opinion to the necessity of attention to those principles of good breeding , in the literal sense , which are essential to true evolutionary progress in the human si > eeies .

		Two features of the book are especially praiseworthy : first , the clearness and distinctness with which essentials are presented ; second , the wealth of illustration .

		It is safe to say that no previous popular treatise on evolution has been so com - pletely and so well illustrated as this .

		The fact that the figures are for the most part copied fi'om other sources necessitates a considerable A'ariation in their quality , but the occasional shortcomings in the matter of quality are amply compensated for by quantity .

		The chief criti - cism to be made regarding the book as a whole is its failure to give any adequate account of the important results of many of the recent investigations in the field of '' evolution .

		One especially misses an account of the results of the application of statistical methods to the problems in this field .

Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly ' -- with one exception , ' The Life of a College Professor , ' which was printed in * Scribner 's ' before the writer had exchanged the professor 's for the editor 's chair .

		His title - chapter balances , in a keenly appreciative and discriminating manner , the conflicting claims of amateurism and professionalism in the great business of life , and leaves us to hope with the author that * this combination of qualities , this union of the generous spirit of the amateur with the method of the professional , ' is not an impos - sible ideal .

		The second essay deals with a quality quite opposed to that of the amateur , the lover , -- indifferentism .

		Voltaire 's
Sismor Pococurante	PERSON	is made to serve as type of the indifferentist , if the word may be allowed .

		The author 's search for those subtle elements in character and train - ing that produce ' pococurantism ' in all its varied forms fails , apparently , to hit on what would seem to be a not infrequent cause , -- exalted idealism combined with a too insistent consciousness of the yawning gap forever sepa - rating conception and realization .

		Perhaps , how - ever , he would make the resultant discourage - ment and listlessness merely another form of ttat weakness of the will which he names , or of the hypercritical temperament which he also recognizes .

		The chapter on ' Hawthorne at North
Adams	PERSON	' is admirable , written as it is by a true lover and skilful interpreter of Haw - thorne , and also a native of that rugged little comer of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	dominated by
Greylock Mountain	ORGANIZATION	and the Hoosac and
Taconic	LOCATION	ranges .

		The six short studies as a whole reveal a certain fine artistic detachment in the writer 's nature .

		He has something of
Signor Pococurante	PERSON	in him , and also a suflSeient infusion of Candide .

		both of them characters for whom he manifests a liking .

		In short , to apply to hjm words of his own , he is one of the * speculative , amused , imdeluded children of this world . '

Wellington	LOCATION	, by Mr.
William O'Connor Morris	PERSON	.

		The book takes the form and scope made familiar to us by the preceding volumes of the series ; and the aim of the editors , -- to select characters * about whom have gathered the great traditions of the nations to which they belonged , and who have been accepted , in many instances , as types of the several national ideals , ' -- has been abun - dantly realized in the choice of
Wellington	LOCATION	.

		The sub-title , too , -- ' the revival of the miUtaiy power of
England	LOCATION	' -- is suggestive of the identifica - tion of the period with the man .

		Judge O'Con - nor
Morris	PERSON	seemed especially fitted for his task by his exhaustive researches for his earlier suc - cessful work on ' The Campaigns of
1815	DATE	' : and the fact that ten of the thirteen chapters of the present book are devoted to
Wellington	LOCATION	's mili - tary career , while only three describe his polit - ical life , is fairly indicative of the relative importance of these two periods to English his - tory .

		In his estimate of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's achieve - ments , Judge
Morris	PERSON	does full justice to his great opponents
Napoleon	PERSON	and Soult , while pro- testing against the extravagance of
Napier	ORGANIZATION	's eulogies on both these captains ; and he concedes
Wellington	LOCATION	's inferiority in strategy to * the greatest of strategists , ' while claiming for him the merit of being * a comsummate leader of men in battle , which largely atoned for imdoubted strategic errors , ' The book is well indexed , and abundantly supplied with apparatus of maps , 94 THE DIAL -LSB-

		In a note appended to the preface by Mr.
H. W. C. Davis	PERSON	, the editor of the series , we are informed of the death of the author shortly after reading - the last proofs of this volume , and before he had time to pre - pare the index .

		Mr.
Davis	PERSON	remarks in the con - cluding sentence that ' the Judge 's conclusions , although they have been challenged by some high authorities , deserve the attention due to acute independent study of the original sources of information ' ; a statement which will probably be indorsed by most readers of the book .

W. Davenport	PERSON	Of XtiC UTCLIUXQ ' t '' T 1 - I T , * j _
Adams	PERSON	has endeavored to provide the student and the general reader with a * handy means of reference to the leading facts of the history of the theatre in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	. '

		The scope of the work is such that it seeks to give information about playhouses and their designers , plays and their writers and per - formers , their scenic and musical illustrators , and stage literature generally .

		Names of plays are alphabetically entered , followed by the place and date of their first performance , with details of their first east , as well as records of their principal revivals .

		Sj > ecial attention has been given to the stage ^ history of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays and other classics of dramatic literature .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's Dictionary will prove invaluable to stu - dents of the drama .

		Being an English work , however , considerable more attention is given to English histrionic nomenclature than to Amei -- ican ; for instance ,
Charles Frohman	PERSON	,
America	LOCATION	's leading theatrical entrepreneur is merely referred to as follows : '
Charles Frohman	PERSON	became lessee of the
Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre ,
London	LOCATION	, in
1897	DATE	. '

		This would hardlj ' ^ prove satisfactory to an American student in search of historical or biographical data .

		The work is divided into two parts , the present being Volume I. , A -- G .

		The second volume is promised for early issue .

		A new As fine specimens of the art of Oriental the Oriental rug-weaver become Rug-book .

		rarer and their market price advances , the literature about them grows more voluminous , as might naturally be expected .

		The latest addition to the list of works dealing with the subject is Mrs.
Mary Churchill Ripley	PERSON	's ' Oriental Rug Book ' -LRB-
F. A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In her desire to be thorough the author has gone far afield in search of information .

		Every page bears witness to painstaking investigation , and to earnest effort to answer all questions that may be asked .

		But excess of enthusiasm has its dangers .

		Though the book contains much that is new and of value , the useful items are so over - laid by a liberal embroidery of irrelevant matter that their separation from the overcharged con - text is attended with some difficulty , notwith - standing the aid afforded by the chart with its columns entwined with * flowers of thought . '

		Such information as that given on page 57 con - cerning tests for determining the age of rugs .

		and the explanation on page 110 of the way the mottled effect of the centres of antique Ghiorde & rugs was produced , will be appreciated by every lover of these beautiful fabrics .

		Excellent , too , is the advice to become thoroughly acquainted with methods and materials before attempting to draw conclusions from the patterns employed , , and in studying the latter to avoid ' all effort to force the eye to see what does not exist , and to twist the designs of adventition into those that shoAV deliberate intention . '

		Pattern , however , is - a topic fascinating to the author , who fairly revels in the reading-in of meanings against which she warns others .

		Her point of view is - shown in the absurd definition , ' ornament is decoration that has evolved from patterns that were based on symbols used by primitive peoples - to express thought . '

		And so , in addition to con - stant references here and there , she devotes a whole chapter to ' Legends and Myths that may be illustrated by designs in rugs . '

		-LRB- The italics are ours . -RRB-

		Despite its discursiveness , the book has substantial merit , though its usefulness would be much greater if it could be stripped of some of its redundant verbiage .

		The illustra - tions , eight of which are in color , deserve special comm , endation because of the typical character of the rugs selected for reproduction .

Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will undoubtedly be a disappointment to the reader who is looking for literaay charm or for any strong infusion of the human interest .

		It is a dry , concise chronicle , in which first place is given to facts about the
Avriter	ORGANIZATION	's own scientific activity and published work , -- professedly a record of his intellectual history first of all .

		As such it will add something -- perhaps not very much -- to our knowledge of the particular doctrines with
Avhich Professor Bain	ORGANIZATION	's name is connected ; but the wider interest that belongs to a revelation of inner conflict , and emotional response to the problems of life , is - almost wholly lacking .

		The narrative parts are more particularly disappointing .

		Famous names - meet us frequently in his pages ; but it is usually in the way of colorless statements , Avhich give little sense of the men themselves .

		Perhaps as - vivid a touch as any is the account of a meeting in
Paris	LOCATION	with Comte , and the desci-iption of the famous philosopher , with his short , paunchy figure , round cropped head , and hard features , his bright colored di * essing gOAvn , his moods of abstraction alternating Avith vehement and magniloquent monologue . '

		I may say again , with regard to Comte , that I never knew or could imagine such a case of the nega - tion of humor .

		His whole attitude Avas that of severe denunciation or self-aggrandisement , and his only smile was a giin . '

		However , to him AA-ho can appreciate it , and who does not ask for what there is no pretense of giving , the book has a certain power in spite of -LRB- perhaps to some extent of account of -RRB- its severity of ti-eatment and lack of extraneous charm .

		Personally one may not find either the temperament or the philosophy
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 of Professor Bain altogether attractive .

		But no one can deny a tribute of respect and admiration to the fearless , straightforward , clear-thinking personality , who , by sheer force of hard work , praxitical good judgment , and intellectual acumen , at last attained for himself the influential posi - tion from which prejudices and cliques were so long successful in debarring him .

Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, Political Institu - tions , etc. , -- only one of its sixteen chapters ti-eating of the things for which
Italy	LOCATION	chiefly stands in the minds of most persons , its Art , Language , and Science .

		That the book is dull is thei-efore not surprising ; but that it is also full of errors is both surprising and inexcusable .

		Even so simple a matter as the topography of
Rome	LOCATION	contains blunders obvious to the most casual visitor .

		For example , two errors occur in a single paragraph -LRB- p. 392 -RRB- : the statue of Gior - dano
Bruno	PERSON	is wrongly placed in the
Piazza Navoua	PERSON	-LRB- indeed , an earlier page of this same book locates it correctly in
Campo	LOCATION	di
Fiori	PERSON	-RRB- , and the dome of the Pantheon is alluded to as * the glorious dome built by
Agrippa	PERSON	. '

		Now it has been a matter of common knowledge , settled by unquestionable evidence a dozen years ago , that
Adrian	PERSON	, and not
Agrippa	PERSON	, was the builder of the Pantheon dome , its portico only dating from the time of Agrippa .

		The picture of the Roman Forum is fully five years out-of-date , showing conspicuously a row of modem houses long since pulled down from its northern border which for - merly concealed the beautiful ruins of the
Basil	LOCATION	- ica
Emilia	ORGANIZATION	, the pavement of the Sacred Way , and the ancient Sepulcretum of pre-historic
Rome	LOCATION	now to be seen there .

		And when was it ever time of this spot -LRB- certainly it is not true now -RRB- that it appears a * miserable desert where at most a couple of inquiring foreigners or bored sight-seers are wandering about ' ?

		On the con - trary , it is the enthusiasm and the large numbers of sight-seers , -- students , and lecturers with classes in their trail , -- which one is sure to encounter there at any hour of the day and any season of the year , that is the chief drawback to one 's enjoyment of this classic spot .

		If the book is no more trustworthy in its imposing tables of statistics than in these simple every - day matters , it is certainly not to be regarded as an authoritv .

		The latest tiography of Lincoln Dr.
Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer	PERSON	has undertaken to arrange for a series of biographies , twenty-five in num - ber , of the men who had to do in one way or another with the American Civil War , from

		Competent men are to write the books , Southern men those giving the Southern side , and Northern men the other .

		The series is to be known as ' The Ameri - can Crisis Biographies , ' and is to be published by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor has opened the series with a life of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, a book of about the size of the single - volume bi -LRB- ^ raphies of the * American Statesmen Series , ' and following much the same plan .

		At first thought , one wonders why another life of Lincoln of this kind should be written , for there are already several excellent short biographies of * the first American . '

		But the series demanded it , and the author has produced a well-balanced , readable , compact book , that gives the important facts of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life , and shows him as pos - terity will be likely to see him , not as a demigod , but with full appreciation of his character and genius .

		Belonging to a later generation , the author is free from the bias that is inevitable in one who lived near the days of the war ; and he has brought to his work historical training and a practised hand .

Walt Whitman	PERSON	is the latest issue of the ` Beacon Biographies ' of eminent Americans , published by
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like its predecessors in this trim and attractive series , the biography is selective and compact , consisting of less than 150 pages all told , yet remarkably complete and clear in its detsiils .

		The author is a lover of his poet ; but his presentation in this essay is so sane and so wholly free from extravagances that it is quite likely to win the heart of an unprejudiced reader .

		Indeed as a quiet , straightforward , sympathetic appreci - ation and interpretation of ` the good gray poet , ' this little volume is altogether worth while .

		The internal arrangement of the book includes a chron - ology and full bibliography , and there is a portrait .

		` The Works of
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	, ' in sixteen volumes , edited by Prof.
Gustavus H. Maynadier	PERSON	, are pub - lished by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the ` first complete edition of the writings of the first great realist . '

		We can not help won - dering how many readers of average general intel - ligence could name off-hand enough of the ` works ' of Defoe to account for even half of the number of volumes .

		`
Bobinson Crusoe	PERSON	' fills three of them , `
Moll Flanders	PERSON	, ' ` Colonel
Jaeque	PERSON	' and ` The
Fortun	PERSON	- ate Mistress ' two each , and the other seven contain single works and collections .

		Each volume has an etched frontispiece and a special editorial introduc - tion , and the set is sold at a very moderate price .

		The editor , who is already responsible for similar editions of Fielding and
Smollett	PERSON	, is a competent authority upon eighteenth century literature , and has done his work with commendable scholarship .

		Two new volumes in ` Newnes ' Art Library * -LRB- Wame -RRB- are devoted respectively to
Kaphael	PERSON	and Constable 's Sketches .

		They are made up , like the previous volumes of the series , of a brief mono - graph upon the life and art of the painter , followed by about sixty half-tone reproductions of his works .

		The binding is in paper boards with vellum back .

South Kensington Collection	LOCATION	, which is the basis of the present volume .

		` Government and the
Citizen	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr ,

West Hoboken	LOCATION	schools , is a brochure of seventy pages , packed full of enthusiasm and loyalty for the old academy , and breathing a high-spirited devotion to the things of the mind and the heart that does one good to encounter .

		Though written primarily at the request of graduates of the academy , and of chief interest to them , Mr.
Waters	PERSON	's pleasant little pamphlet will prove unusually interesting even to the general reader .

		The subscription edition of ` The Novels and Stories of
Ivan Tourguenieff	PERSON	, ' published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, is at last complete in sixteen vol - umes , and we have to congratulate those respon - sible for the enterprise upon the extremely satis - factory way in which they have performed their task .

		Here at last we have the entire work in fiction of perhaps the greatest of all novelists presented in admirable English and in beautiful mechanical form .

		Miss Hapgood 's introductions to the several volumes are of great value for their presentation of the Russian critical estimate of the author .

		Volumes XIV , to XVI. , now published , include ` Spring Freshets , ' thirteen short stories , and the exquisite ` Poems in Prose . '

		Mr.
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	's editing of
` Fifty Songs of Franz Schubert	ORGANIZATION	, ' which he has just done for the ` Musician 's
Library ' of Messrs. Oliver Ditson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has been conspicuously a work of love , and this is by no means the first occasion upon which he has expressed -LRB- and imparted to others -RRB- his enthusiastic appreciation of ` the greatest of the song-writers . '

		Indeed , when we look through this collection , ranging from the `
Gretchen am Spinnrade	PERSON	' of
1814	DATE	to the ` Am
Meer ' of 1828	DATE	, we do not find much difficulty in agreeing with his view that in these fifty songs ` there is as much genius , and almost as much variety ' as in the editor 's earlier collection of ` Fifty Mastersongs by
Twenty Composers	ORGANIZATION	, ' included in the same series of volumes .

		The eighteenth annual volume of the English ` Book-Prices Current , ' covering the auction season of 1903-1904 , has recently been sent us by the publisher , Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		So long have the accuracy and inclusiveness of this stand - ard reference work been established that its value requires no further emphasis at this time .

		With its American prototype , it should find place on the shelves of every well-ordered public library .

		From the compiler 's introduction , we learn that the sea - son covered in this latest volume was by no means satisfactory to the trade .

Seager	PERSON	baa written what is probably the best text-book on the elementt e / ee0nomics that hat yet appeared ... The feature of the book is the exhauatiTe treatment of the subject of distribution , to which eight chapters are devoted .

		The mental balance of the writer is here moat evident , for in spite of bis Anatrian training , he finds himself unable to follow th Austrian writers in their extreme poaitions .

		His acceptance of much of the thinlring of the classical school in combination with the more conservatiTe portions of modem theory , results in a prasentation which , far from being wmTeiing and indefinite , as one might fear , is c < Miaistent , sane , and satisfying . ''

		NOTES 131 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 132 A POETS RETROSPECT .

		The great English poet who is now approach - ing his seventieth year , and who remains the solitary sumvor in the twentieth century of the great group of nineteenth-oentury poets with whom he is associated , is now engaged in super - intending a uniform republication of his poet - ical writing .

		Since these writings occupy twenty-four volumes of various sizes , since they are expensive and in some cases out of print , and since they are , neveri ; heless , indispensable to every lover of poetry , it is a cause for thank - fulness that all of them will soon be obtainable in a shape both uniform and definitive .

		The lyrical section of this new edition is already complete and in the hands of the public ; the dramatic section , we are assured , will soon follow .

		In addition to the debt under which Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has thus placed us , we have also to thank him for having seized this occasion to take us iato his confidence by publishing a retro - spective view of his poetical activity , which has now extended over nearly half a century .

		How - ever clearly a poet may reveal himself in his writings , there is always a peculiar satisfaction in the supplementary sort of revelation that is offered when he deigns to tell us something of their liistory , and to give us some glimpse of the light ia which they present themselves to his own consciousness .

		This is what Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne has now done in the lengthy ' dedicatory epistle ' which inscribes his collected poems to his ` best and dearest friend . '

		It is no doubt true that a poet is not always the best judge of his own poems , and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is as likely as others to err in this respect , but the interest of such self-criticism as he gives us is not to be questioned , and we can not help wishing that
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	had likewise left U6 some similar subjective measure wherewith to test our own objective estimate of their work .

		In an introductory paragraph Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	sets forth his theory of the poefs attitude toward his public in this matter of appraise - ment and explanation , * It is impossible for any man to undertake the task of commentary , however brief and succinct , on anything he has done or tried to do , without incurring the charge of egoism .

		But there are two kinds of egoism , the furtive and the frank : and the outspoken and open-hearted candour of
Milton	LOCATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Comeille	PERSON	and Hugo , is not the least or the lightest of their claims to the regard as well as the respect or the reverence of 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, their readers ... Whether i | fc is worth while for any man to oflfer any remarksj or for any other man to read his remarks on his own works , his own ambition , or his own attempts , he can not of course determine .

		If there are great examples of absti - nence from such a doubtful enterprise , there are likewise gi-eat examples to the contrary .

		As long as the writer can succeed in evading the kindred charges and the cognate risks of vanity and humility , there can be no reason why he should not undertake it .

		And when he has nothing to regret and nothing to recant , when he finds nothing that he could wish to cancel , to alter , or to unsay , in any page he ha * ever laid before his reader , he need not be seriously troubled by the inevitable consciousness that the work of his early youth is not and can not be unnat - urally unlike the work of a very young man . '

		In other words , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	says again , from the vantage point of his mature years , what he said of the Toems and Ballads ' when they Avere published in
1866	DATE	, that they were ' bom of boy 's pastime , ' that they were not such poems as a man would write , but that , allowing for the limitations and the exuberance of youth , they were produced in all artistic sincerity .

		He has told us since , in imperishably beautiful verse , how his life outgrew that boyish phase of riot - ous imaginings , how he rode * the red ways of the revel through , ' 'Till on some winter 's dawn of some dim year He let the vine-bit on the panther 's lip Slide , and the green rein slip , And set his eyes to seaward , ' and how , in the end , ` The sweet sea 's breath Breathed and blew life in where was heartless death .

		Death spirit-stricken of soul-sick days , where strife Of thought and flesh make mock of death and life , And grace returned upon him . '

		The critics have long since recovered from the hysteria which overcame them when they first sought to pass judgment on the ' Poems and Ballads , ' and they hardly need now to be reminded that the dramatic studies contained in that volume were neither confessions of a vicious personal experience nor exercises of an unregulated imagination .

		` There are photographs from life in the book ; and there are sketches from imagination .

		Some which keen-sighted criticism has dismissed with a smile as ideal or imaginary were as real and actual as they well could be : Others which have been taken for obvious transcripts from memory were utterly fantastic or dramatic .

		If the two kinds can not be distinguished , it is surely rather a credit than a discredit to an artist whose medium or material has more in common with a musician 's than a sculptor 's . '

		It was , as the author says , a ' quaint reception ' '' that the book received , and * the clatter aroused by it ' was to him a source of no little amuse - ment .

		Writing of his next book , the glorious * Songs before Sunrise , ' Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	disclaims the notion that he was merely engaged in the task of translatingj `
Mazzini	PERSON	's gospel into verse . '


Mazzini	PERSON	was no more a Pope or a Dictator than I was a parasite or a papist . ' '

		I never pre - tended , ' he goes on to say , * to see eye to eye with my illustrious friends and masters ,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and
Giuseppe Mazzini	PERSON	, in regard to the positive and passionate confidence of their sublime and purified theology . '

		In this con - nection , the author gives us the keynote to all that he has ever written upon the two subjects of religion and politics .

		On the former theme he says : ` That the spirit and the letter of all other than savage and barbarous religions are irreconcilably at variance , and that prayer or homage addressed to an image of our own or of other men 's making , be that image avowedly material or conventionally spiritual , is the affirmation of idolatiy with aU its attendant atrocities , and the negation of all belief , all reverence , and all love , due to the noblest object of human wox-ship that humanity can realize or conceive . '

		These words are the rational basis upon which rest such poems as ' Ileriha , ' ' Before a Cruci - fix , ' the ' Hymn of Man , ' and ' Tlie Altar of Eighteousness . '

		He claims consistency in his political doctrine when he says , comparing his later poems with the ' Songs before Sunrise , ' that ` Every passing , word I have since thought fit to utter on any national or political question has been as wholly consistent with the principles which I then did my best to proclaim and defend as any apostasy from the faith of all republicans in the fundamental and final principle of union , voluntary if possible and compulsory if not , would have been ludicrous in the impudence of its inconsistency with these simple and irreversible principles .

		Monarch - ists and anarchists may be advocates of national dissolution and reactionary division ; republicans can not be . '

		The poet then gives us a running commen - tary upon his dramatic verse , beginning with ' The Queen Mother , ' ' written while yet under academic or tutorial authority , ' and acknowl - edging it to be imitative of the Elizabethan model .

		In ' Chastelard ' he thinks that ' some - thing of real and evident life ' is discernible . '


Bothwell	PERSON	' he calls an ` epic drama , ' and quotes Avith pardona -RSB- -RRB- le pride the praise bestowed upon it by Hugo .

		` Occuper ces deux cimes , cela n'est donne qu'a vous . '

		`
Mary Stuart	PERSON	' was coldly received by the public , but Sir
Henry Taylor	PERSON	applauded it , and the author avows : ^ I think I have never written anything wortliier of such reward than the closing tragedy which may or may not have deserved but which certainly received it . '

		Of the two Greek plays , he thinks the `
Atalanta	ORGANIZATION	' too exuberant , effusive , and in-egular , and doubts whether the whole is greater than any part of it .

		` The ' Ereehtheus ' he views with greater satisfaction , and this must surelv be the ver -
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 11 ^ diet of the critic who considers the two works in their entirety .

		Little is said of the four later plays , but the author is careful to remind us , in speaking of them , that he writes , like
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, for antiquity . '

		When I write plays it is with a view to their being acted at
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	, the Red Bull , or the
Black Friars	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Speaking of his hTical work , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	gives the highest place , and justly , in our opin - ion , to the two great Pindaric odes , '
Athens	LOCATION	' and ' The Armada . '

		` By the test of these two poems I am content that my claims should be decided and my station determined as a h-ric poet in the higher sense of the term ; a craftsman in the most ambitious line of his art that ever aroused or ever can arouse the emulous aspiration of his kind . '

		He happily characterizes and links together the ' Hymn to Proserpine ' and the ' Hj-mn to Man ' as ' the death-song of spiritual decadence and the birth-song of spiritual renascence . '

		Of his lyrics of nature he writes with exquisite charm , and his doctrine is thus expressed : ` Mere descriptive poetry of the prepense and formal kind is exceptionally if not proverbially liable to incur and to deserve the charge of dulness : it is unnecessary to emphasize or obtrude the per - sonal note , the presence or the emotion of a spec - tator , but it is necessary to make it felt and keep it perceptible if the poem is to have life in it or even a right to live . '

		To know how faithfully Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has fol - lowed this precept we have but to recall a few such poems as ' A Forsaken Garden , ' ' In the
Ba	ORGANIZATION	-RCB- - , ' and * By the
Xorth Sea	LOCATION	. '

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's personal and memorial poems have often brought upon him the charge of extravagance in praising , and it is only nat - ural that he should take some account of this accusation , ` If ever a word of tributary thanksgiving for the delight and the benefit of loyal admiration evoked in the spirit of a boy or aroused in the intelligence of a man may seem to exceed the limit of demonstrable accuracy , I have no apology to offer for any such aberration from the safe path of tepid praise or conventional applause . '

		Confessing to rare good fortune in both friends and enemies , he declares that it should be ` Always a subject for thankfulness and self - congratulation if a man can honestly and reasonably feel assured that his friends and foes alike have been always and at almost all points the very men he would have chosen , had choice and foresight been allowed him , at the very outset of his career in life . '

		Most of all was he fortunate in winning the friendship of Landor ,
Mazzini	PERSON	, and Hugo , ' the three living gods , I do not say of my idolatry , for idolatry is a term inapplicable where the gods are real and true , but of my whole-souled and single-hearted worship . '

		What wonder that he should have sought to find expression in song for the joy of such friendships , and that he should have found terms for the expression in some degree commensurate with his gratitude ^ The two great misapprehensions of the gen - eral public concerning Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	` si work are that it is prevailingly sensual and that its verbal affluence conceals poverty of thoughti Both these notions are supremely ridiculous / The first of these notions is the exact opposite of the truth , and could not possibly be enter - tained by anyone familiar with the work as at whole .

		In all but a few of his pieces , he is a poet of spirit rather than of sense , and austerity is perhaps the most fitting epithet to apply to - liis work .

		Nor does it take a very prolonged study of that work to discover that it is rich - in thought and varied in intellectual interesli beyond the work of most other poets .

		Mr
^ Swinburne	PERSON	would be the last person to deny that poetry must be the embodiment of ideas ^ or fail absolutely in its mission .

		His own words are these : ` There is no music in verse which has not in it sufficient fullness and ripeness of meaning , sufficient adequacy of emotion or of thought , to abide tha analysis of other than the published scrutiny of prepossession or the squint-eyed inspection ot .

		maUgnity . '

		By this test he is clearly willing to be judged ^ and we have no doubt that when judged by it fairly and fully , he will not be found wanting .

		THE AMERICAN LITE RARY INSTINCT .

		Geographical and racial explanations of the evolution of genius have become somewhat faded of late .

		Even
Taine	PERSON	modified his theories considerably after the publication of his ' His - tory of English literature . '

		But one would like to call his spirit up and propound the following problem to him : * There is a country , sir , larger in extent than
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is a land ; of extremes .

		In
summer	DATE	it is throughout nearly its whole extent a part of the tropics .

		In winter the north pole is seemingly situated in every city .

		Its geographical features are on an enor - .

		mous scale , -- tremendous mountain systems ^ ^ vast rivers , limitless plains , unending forests .

		.

		It is inhabited by eighty millions of people drawn from all the great stocks of the world .

		^ It is a new ark where descendants of all of N'oah 's family are reunited .

		And they are fused together by one system of laws and the use of one language .

		What , sir , in your judgment ^ should be the resulting literary instincte and development of such a people ? '

		Can we doubt that our critic 's ashes would lighten with his wonted fires , that his ghost -LSB- eyes would glitter with delight , and that he would say , though in far more vivid phrase , * ^ 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, fiomething like this : ' Excellent !

		Superb !

		You ere describing the place and the moment for an ideal outburst of literature .

		The muster of races in your new empire should bring together all the instincts and ideals of the world .

		The North should send you its cloudy gods , its dreamings and its doubts .

		The South should bestow upon you its clear divinities , its passions and its fire .

		Your literary population should be a cast of stars .

		Your geographical immensities should raise to the nth power all the forces and faculties of the migrating personages of older mythologies and literatures .

		A brighter Hamlet should jostle a darker Othello , The Greek Achilles , the
Gennan Siegfried	PERSON	, the
Celtic Cuchulain	ORGANIZATION	should reincarnate themselves in more splendid forms .

		Art should be the inherit - ance of your whole people .

		Your brilliant and intoxicating atmosphere should cause them to talk business in blank verse , do their love - making in song , go to church in a galliard , and ijome home in a coranto .

		^ So perhaps it should be -- but so certainly it has not been .

		If one were exactly to reverse ifchis imaginary picture one would be nearer the anark .

		Once indeed in our history , back in the iforties and fifties , there was a stir of intellec - Ttual life in this country .

		Foreign philosophies - were imported and retailed , native folk-lores `` ivere investigated , our men of intellect stood at ithe stiBet comers and crowds assembled to listen tto iflrem , there was a cry that we must have a national literature .

		And a very remarkable if not absolutely great artistic production resulted .

		Even then the careers of the greatest were fresh illustrations of the fact that when God creates ^ genius , he signs a lettre de cachet , a sentence of life imprisonment in the world .

		Poe was practically starved out .

		Hawthorne would have .

		`` hared his fate but for the accident of his ihaving a personal friend in
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	.

		Lowell ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and
Bryant	PERSON	wasted their Ibest years in dry professorial or newspaper ?

		iw > rk .

		Yet the difference between then and now is enormous .

		If these people were not rewarded ■ greaily , they were listened to and discussed .

		` They felt they had a public .

		It is safe to say that there was , not relatively but absolutely , twenty times as much sympathy for and appre - ciation of things of the mind in their time as there is today .

		A recently translated book , ' Success among IN ^ ations ^ ' by a brilliant Hungarian ,
Emil Reich	PERSON	, • devotes a chapter to American possibilities , intellectual and political .

		The author has no ■ great admiration for us and no grave fear of • our dominating the world in either way .

		He dscribes the inferiority which he attributes to • 08 to three causes : First , the overwhelming imfluence of our women ; second , the lack of outward pressure which would drive us to an intenser inward life ; third , our almost exclu - sive preoccupation with commerce and industry .

		Woman and Genius are enemies of old .

		Pos - sibly the root of their hostility is that they both bear children .

		Another reason is that society is the creation of woman and that the rough , sayage Orson-like Genius is a creature of soli - tude , and seldom comes into society except to revolt against it and try to shake it down .


France	LOCATION	is the only nation where woman has a power and influence comparable with that which she exercises in
America	LOCATION	.

		M. Brunetiere , in an admirable essay , has sought to determine the amount of success with which woman has wielded her sceptre in
France	LOCATION	.

		He is most polite ; he makes out the best case he can for the ladies ; but in the end he is forced to confess that not a single Frenchman of first-class talent has ever bowed to feminine domination .

		Third - rate thinkers , lap-dog poets , a long train of Abbes and Academicians has thronged their salons .

		But Rabelais ,
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, Cor - neille ,
Lafontaine	PERSON	, and their like , have shoul - dered their way on without the aid of feminine plots or applause .

		It is not that these men did not feel the charm and beauty of womanhood .

		Genius generally feels it too deeply .

		But they declined to submit first-rate intellects to the domination of second-rate ones .

		It is precisely in those countries where woman is kept in the background , in
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, that the ideal of womanhood blooms most gorgeously in the pages of the poets .

		Neither
France	LOCATION	nor
America	LOCATION	can show anything in their literatures to match the women of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		And
America	LOCATION	at least has but few of those lyrics of love and admiration which are as numerous in the literatures of other nations as the songs of their birds in
spring	DATE	.

		Think of the long roll of English love poems , -- the epi - thalamiums of Spenser , the Elizabethan son - nets , the verse of
Donne	ORGANIZATION	, the Cavalier lyrics , the triumphant strains of Bums and
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	's picture gallery of fair women !

		With us ,
Poe	PERSON	's few mystical notes of adoration , two or three southern love-songs , and some rather cold poems by the
New England	LOCATION	men , are about all that our women have been able to inspire .

		Probably they do not care ; having the reality of reign they may not need verbal homage .

		But their throne has been built up mainly by the poet .

		Every educated man sees in his mistress 's face not only her own beauty , but the shadow of the beauty of the heroines of song .

		She sums up for him all that ideal seraglio which has filled his brain since boy - hood .

		She is
Rosalind	PERSON	and
Viola	PERSON	and
Imogen	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	's Miranda , and
Burns	PERSON	's
Mary Morison	PERSON	.

		And to keep her power alive she needs to be
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTAT .

		115 able to compel men to create new images of her grace and charm .

		Should women ever suc - ceed in having poetry dismissed from the ser -
Tice	PERSON	of mankind , should they kick down the ladder by which they have risen , they will soon themselves be relegated back into the rank of squaws and serfs .

		Our Hungarian author holds that the strength of
Europe	LOCATION	is in its division , that the hard-won boundaries of the different lands have preserved national peculiarities , have fostered varietv ' and stren ^ h of character , have fenced out influences which vrould have resulted in a Chinese uniformity .

		The view is sound .

		Here in
America	LOCATION	we have established a certain form of civilization and then set it in motion on its Juggernaut course to crush and roll out all originality and level the natural elevations and depressions of humanity into one desert of commonplace .

		Everybody must be alike through twenty degrees of latitude and fifty of longi - tude .

		Even if the type of civilization which we have evolved were the highest possible , such sameness would be soul-depressing .

		Everj ' ^ one , I suppose , has revolted against the Miltonic idea of heaven because of the monotony of amiabilit -RRB- ' and harp-playing which prevailed there before Lucifer put some variet -RCB- ' into the place .

		The slightest acquaintance with foreign • countries is enough to convince one that the cultivation of personality ' , of eccentricity even , adds greatly to the delight of human inter - course .

		And of course it is the salt and savor • of literature .

		Compare two contemporary nov - els , one English and the other American , and it will be seen at once that English life is infinitely richer in varied types of humanity than American .

		It would be interesting to speculate as to the results if the Southern Con - federacy had succeeded in breaking up our nation .

		A great slave-holding aristocracy left to develop at its own will would probably have given birth to magnificent personalities .

		One sign of the spirit of conformity which prevails in
America	LOCATION	is the liking for the study of law , which has obtained here from the beginning .


Edmund Burke	PERSON	said in one of his speeches that `` there had been more copies of
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	sold in the Colonies than in the mother country .

		Now law is a narrowing study .

		It is apt to make men as sharp and bright and as like as pins .

		I remember once , in a dispute with my old law preceptor , I drew on a piece of paper a perpendicular line and beside it a circle .

		The straight line , I said , represented the legal mind , the circle the poetical .

		* Yes , ' answered my friend , ` the lawyer is an integer and the poet a cipher . '

		The rejoinder was clever , and it is odd that men have accepted the same sign as .

		a sjrmbol of nothingness and of the universal .

		Commercialism , I fear , is ingrained in Amer - ica , -- it is blood of our blood , bone of our bone .

		Other nations , of course , have been and are commercial , and as long as we must eat and have clothes to cover us there is no help for it .

		But in other nations there is a saving sense of something better .

		The secret desire of an Englishman is to be a Lord .

		The secret desire of a Frenchman is to be a Member of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The secret desire of a German is to write a big book on the Dialects of the Turanian Tribes .

		These ambitions are a ferment that elevate and lighten life .

		I have cast about a good deal for a formula which would express the honest ambition of the average American , and the other day I found it in the first line of an insurance advertisement which met my eye .

		It ran thus : ' To live better and save more is the big idea which goes to bed with us all . '

		Obviously this sage of the shop does not mean by his ' live better ' the same thing which
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	meant when he said , ' Even in a palace life may be lived well . '

		No !

		He means by it to have more food and better clothes and a bigger house and greater social importance .

		There is no harm , indeed there is good in these things ; but to make them the ` big idea which goes to bed with us all , ' -- why , the Hottentots have a higher hope .

		No real religion , or art , or literature , no science save that which ministers to material wants , can flourish in a community obsessed by such ambition .

		Yet as all men crave permanence , and strive to leave some record of themselves , as the savage carves pieces of bone or scratches hunting scenes on the wall of his cave , so we are forced to some kind of art .

		And the kinds of art which are accepted and are successful among us express our popular instincts .

		As a corollary to the dominance of woman in our life we have a worship of prettiness and decorum .

		We do small things delicately .

		We are much concerned with style , and import the last year 's fashions from
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	and make fetiches of them .

		As women approve authority , we are fond of maxim-makers and moralists and writers who tell us how to succeed in life .

		I have always thought that people must be very bad to need to go to church as much as they do ; and similarly I think the nation must be weak mentally and morally which requires so many props of moral phrases and axioms to support it .

		On the otlier hand , our women - instructed minds shrink from strong passions and tragic situations .

		We must apologize for indulging in tragedy , as Snug the
Joiner	PERSON	apol - ogized for bringing a Hon into the presence of the ladies .

		Wihitman was perfectly right in his characterization of our lady-like literature .

		-LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, If he had only had the ability to visualize his ideas , to create instead of merely making cata - logues of possible characters and giving hints of situations rank from the soil , he would have been a great literary reformer .

		That he would have been popular is another thing .

		Poe , our profoundest thinker and artist , is not popular ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	, a tragedian of the spirit , is not popular .

		Cooper is only read by boys ;
Herman Melville	PERSON	and
Brockden Browne	PERSON	are not read at all .

		Hardly anything , indeed , is read today except that which deals gracefully with the commonplace , touches on the domestic emo - tions , or gratifies our social vanity by reviving the names and deeds of our not very remote forefathers .

		The corollary to the uniformity of our life is a notable lack of depth and variety of person - alities in our books .

		It is hardly too much to say that there are more vivid , original , eccen - tric characters in a single novel of
Smollett	PERSON	or Dickens than in our whole novel literature .

		Our striving is for good taste , -- we are going to be genteel if we break something ; and our books reflect the general insipidity and tame - ness .

		The corollary to our commercialism is a distaste for the ideal and a craving for cheap amusement .

		Life is not enacted in Wall or Wake street as it is in the plays of Shakespeare or the dramas of
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Dealers in sugar and cotton and manipulators of the stock mar - ket are not going to believe in gods and ghosts and elves and heroes and heroines of romance .

		When they need relaxation they swap doubtful stories , or read the productions of our immortal American humorists ; or go to see the light and frothy performances of our stage .

		I have in mind a famous club where rich men congregate and where the haMtues sit around and listen to the news from the stock ticker , and when there is any great fluctuation in the market they get their pencils out and calculate how much each of their friends has gained or lost by the operation .

		That is an intellectual diver - sion of a kind , -- but ah !

		how different from the conversation in a street of
Athens	LOCATION	when
Socrates	PERSON	had gathered a crowd about him , or the talk in the circles of the Mermaid Inn or
Johnson 's Club	ORGANIZATION	, or the intercourse in the court of
Saxe	PERSON	-
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		In one of
Keats	PERSON	' s letters he describes himself as standing in a central street of
London	LOCATION	and looking north , east , south , and west , and seeing nothing anywhere but dulness .

		We can not always tell at a given time what ferment is going on about us , what rich and glorious fabrics of thought and art are rising like exhal - ations , silently and unseen .

		But certainly there is little in
America	LOCATION	today to encourage a lover of the things of the mind .

		Our poets are driven into business , our artists into exile .

		Our thinkers become college professors , where they dry up and blow away .

		Sir
Richard Temple	PERSON	said once that ' None was ever a great poet who did much apply himself to anything else . '

		We can not expect a great literature if we do not support and back the persons who can pro- duce .

		But Americans do not want a great literature .

		They want , in the inspired words of our insurance advertisement , ' to live better and save more . '

Milton	PERSON	on his blind - ness to have been written by
Elizabeth Lloyd Howell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Marston	PERSON	is also correct , for
Lloyd	PERSON	was Mrs.
Howell	PERSON	's maiden name .

		She changed both her name and her religious denomination on her marriage ; and although really best known through an allusion to her by
Whittier	LOCATION	, -- the poem describing a

		She was a woman of some beauty , but was charged by some of the ladies at the

Quaker	ORGANIZATION	poet would have found , I am sure , some hearty amusement .

		THE DIAL 117 Cj ^ e Hcto g00ks .

		A WORDSWORTHIAX IK REMDTISCENT Mood .

		* Any book from the pen of Dr.
William Knight	PERSON	, the
Wordsworth	PERSON	scholar and
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	professor of philosophy , is sure to be richly worth the reading .

		His ' Eetrospects / of which the first yolume now appears , is a treat such as his long acquaintance with men of let - ters , his yeai-s of work side by side with them in the field of literature , and his mastery of the art of pen portraiture , would have led one confidently to expect .

		After noting , in his preface , the indisputable benefit to be derived from communion , whether personal or through books , with ' characters that are strong , ' orig - inal , exalted and benign , that are many-sided , fertile-minded and ideal , ' he says a word con - demnatory of that distorted presentation of a man 's life which is not seldom found in the so-called critical biography . '

		What is posterity the better , ' he asks , ' for knowing the verdict of A , B , and C upon `` the great of old , '' whose spirits still '' rule us from their urns '' ; more especially when there is much more of the A , B , and C , the new critics , than of the departed sage or seer in the books which the former write ?

		What it surely needs much more is to have an adequate and trustworthy re-presenta - tion of the past , and new pictures of the men and women -- these '' great of old '' -- as in a mirror , so that the living may be able to realize the dead as they lived and moved and had their being in the flesh . '

		Without conscious idealization , therefore , or any embroidery or amplification of plain facts and spoken words , Professor Knight has produced some chapters of fragmentarv ^ biography that are as fascinat - ing as they are convincing , their very charm indeed largely lying in their evident truthful - ness and their admirable restraint .

		* I lack the power , ' he says , ' of recasting or recon - structing a conversation out of a minimum of actual fact .

		In no instance is an attempt made to reproduce a lengthened conversation with those whose letters are printed .

		^ Many detached remarks are given , but no continuous discus - sion . '

		Without further preliminaries , let us now plunge in medias res .

		Here is a glimpse of
Carlyle	PERSON	and his wife : ` We were sitting in the `` golden silence '' he loved so much , and yet ignored so often , when Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	entered .

		I was struck by her gracious air .

		That afternoon it was most gracious .

		She was pre - paring tea , when her husband made a disparaging remark on one of our modern writers ; and she said , ■ with the utmost naivete , `` Oh ,
Tom	PERSON	, you 're so * Retrospects .

		By
William Knight	PERSON	.

		Volume I.
New York	LOCATION	: Imported by
Charles Scrlbner	PERSON	's Sons .

		eccentric . ''

		`` Yes , '' exclaimed -- ^ I may say growled -- her husband ; `` Yes , hut can you find my cen - tref '' ' A visit to
Tennyson	PERSON	in
1890	DATE	is described .

		The grace and dignity with which the aged poet bore his weight of years was impressive . '

		There was the keen eagle eye ; and though the glow of youth was gone , the strength of a ^ e was in its place .

		The lines of his face were like the furrows in the stem of a wrinkled oak-tree ; but his whole bearing disclosed a latent strength and nobility , a reserve of power , combined with a most courteous grace of manner .

		I was also struck by the neglige air of the man ; so differ - ent from that of
Browning	LOCATION	, or
Arnold	LOCATION	, or
Lowell	LOCATION	. '

		From the conversation recorded , all noteworthy , a paragraph on the sonnet may be quoted .

		* He said he thought the best in the language were
Milton	PERSON	's ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's , and
Wordsworth	PERSON	's ; after these three , those by his own brother
Charles	PERSON	.

		`` I at least rank my brother 's next to those by the three Olympians . ''

		He added , `` A sonnet arrests the free sweep of genius , and if poets were to keep to it , it would cripple them ; but it is a fascinating kind of verse , and to excel in it is a rare distinc - tion . ''

		I ventured to refer to the metrical and structural necessity that its last line should form the climax , both of thought and expression , in a sonnet ; and that the whole should be like a wave breaking on the shore .

		He said , `` Not only so ; the whole should show a continuous advance of thought and of movement , like a river fed by rillets ; as every great poem , and all essays and treatises , should . '' '

		The memoir of Tennyson by his son has made us familiar with the poet 's firm belief in the immortality of the soul , a belief that also finds frequent attestation in his poems .

		Worth recording in this connection is his assertion to Professor Knight that * the idea of annihila - tion would be more horrible to me than the idea of everlasting torments . '

		The charm of Dean
Stanle	PERSON	-RCB- '' s radiant , ver - satile , many-sided personality is well conveyed .

		Let us quote an incident illustrating his imper - turbable good humor .

		` On another occasion he was journeying in the same neighborhood , when two fellow-passengers in his carriage , ignorant of who he was , began to abuse the heretical and latitudinarian Dean , unstinting in their denunciations .

		When he reached his sta - tion , and was about to walk to a carriage in wait - ing , he suddenly remembered that he had left his umbrella in the train and returned for it , when the passenger who had used so many bad words about him had taken it up , and found the name -LRB- the Dean of Westminster -RRB- on the handle .

		He apologized profoundly , and said that he did not know who it was who was travelling with him .

		`` Never mind , '' said the Dean .

		`` You have given me a good deal to think about , and I am much obliged to you . '' '

		This chapter , one of the longest and best in the book , closes with a lecture by
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	on *
The Mutual Eelations of Religion	ORGANIZATION	, Science , and 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Literature , ' which he delivered at
Dundee	ORGANIZATION	in
1875	DATE	, and which has never before been pub - lished except as a newspaper report .

		Of
Gladstone	PERSON	's phenomenal memory , and of his wide reading in general literature , we have heard much .

		Following is .

		an anecdote illus - trating both : ' I well remember a dinner-party in
London	LOCATION	at which Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was the principal guest , although there were many representatives of
Latera	PERSON	- ture and Science as well as Politics present .

		After dinner the conversation turned to the number of lines in the great poems of the world ; and Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was asked : How many are there in the `` Iliad '' ?

		He at once replied , and to a second question gave the number in the `` Odyssey . ''

		`` In the ` Divine Comedy ' ? ''

		inquired one guest .

		Instantly the number in the `` Inferno , '' the `` Pur - gatorio , '' and the `` Paradiso '' were told .

		In `` Hamlet , '' `` Paradise Lost , '' `` Faust '' -LRB- I only remember these -RRB- , the answer came without a pause , as if out of a brain in compartments , where the facts had been stored away , and which now opened as by a
spring	DATE	.

		I was asked by our host if I could tell the number in `` The Excursion '' and in `` The Prelude , '' and by some one else how many there were in `` The White Doe of Bylstone . ''

		In each case I had to shake my head in ignorance .

		I said it had never occurred to me to estimate poems by their quantity .

		`` No , '' said
Gladstone	PERSON	, `` none of us do that -- the test is a qualitative one -- ^ but liter - ary statistics are bf use . ''

		It seemed to me , how - ever , as if the instinct of the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been at work in the brain of the Premier in reference to the great poems of the world , and that the chambers of memory were full to overflowing .

		On telling this afterwards at
St. Andrews	LOCATION	to his old Oxford tutor -- Bishop
Charles Wordsworth	PERSON	-- he said that
Gladstone	PERSON	's memory was superlative .

		`` I remember sending him , to the country house in which he was then residing , a Latin version which I had just written of one of the hymns in the ` Christian Year . '

		He replied at once , and quoted in his letter another excellent rendering of the same hymn in
Latin	LOCATION	, made long ago by a friend of his , which he said was still as vivid to him as if he had received it yesterday . '' '

		Among lesser notables , the author gives excel - lent pictures of those ardent apostles of the true and the beautiful ,
James Smetham	PERSON	,
William Davies	PERSON	, and
J. Henry Shorthouse	PERSON	, and a vei-y readable chapter on that woman of rare scholarship ,
Anna Swanwick	PERSON	.

		Smetham , the artist and poet , w ^ as one of those whose patient strivings are not destined to be crowned with conventional success - -- which , however , was the last thing desired in his case . '

		In my secret heart , ' he declares , ' I look upon myself as one who has got on , and got to his goal , as one who has got something a thousand times better than a fortune , more real , more inward , less in the poAver of others , less variable , more immortal , more eternal ; as one whose feet are on a rock , his goings established , with a new song in his mouth , and joy on his head . '

		In his memories of
Whitwell Elwin	PERSON	, rector of Booton in Nor - folk , and editor of the ' Quarterly Review ' from
1854	DATE	to
1867	DATE	, Professor Knight quotes from one of
Elwin	PERSON	's letters a curious anecdote showing how painstaking
Wordsworth	PERSON	was in applying the file to his verses .

		Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	is the ultimate authority for the story , and is quoted by
Elwin	PERSON	as follows : ` One day when they were living at Grasmere -LRB- no post-office there -RRB-
Wordsworth	PERSON	walked over to Amble - side -LRB- more than four miles -RRB- to post some poem that was to be included in a volume just being printed .

		After dinner , as he sat meditating , he became dis - satisfied with one line , and grew so restless over the - thought that towards bedtime he declared he must go to Ambleside and alter it ; for `` in those days : postage was very heavy , and we were obliged to be very prudent . ''

		So he and
Miss Wordsworth	PERSON	set off after nine o ` clock , walked to Ambleside , knocked up the post-office people , asked for a candle , got the letter out of the box , sent the good people to bed again , and sat in the little parlour , `` puzzling and puzzling till they got the line right '' ; when they replaced the letter , put out the candle , and softly stole forth , and walked home in the
winter	DATE
midnight	TIME	. '

		Having now had a glimpse of this , that , and the other of our authors contemporaries , let us take a look at the writer himself .

		In a letter that he prints from
James Martineau	PERSON	is a pro- posal that Mr.
Knight	PERSON	should succeed Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	as minister of little
Portland Street Chapel	LOCATION	, a position
Martineau	PERSON	was forced to resign in
1872	DATE	.

		Although the offer was declined , the letter attests the broad liberality of both writer and recipient .

		` As I muse upon the matter , I come round again and again to the one only thing which , as I believe , would hold and save these people , and prevent the ' virtual sacrifice of their spiritual life : viz .

		your removal to
London	LOCATION	to take charge of them .

		It is ; a daring , and I fear an impracticable , thought .

		I see all the difficulty of such a move after so recent a declaration of Trinitarian opinion -- though not as ; identified with Christianity , but only as an after - thought of philosophical speculation .

		I hear before - hand the outcry of your opponents , that their sus - picions are justified .

		I anticipate scruples on the - part of my own people .

		Nevertheless , beneath all this , the natural affinities and realities are on the side of such a solution .

		And if my people had the magnanimity to rely on the-se and offer you a free pulpit , trusting that adequate theological sympathy would work itself out ; and if you , on the strength of this unpledged attitude , felt encouragement to - brave reproach , and take a position involving no retraction and only the engagement to go whither the truth of God might lead ; it is my sincere per - suasion that a work would open before you here - more congenial and of higher character than any which the Free
Kirk	PERSON	can have in reserve for you .

		You are appointed , I must think , to draw upwards those who would otherwise have less faith than you : and your faculties will never move with their power unhindered till you have to deal with such an audience . '

		Other most interesting chapters , of which lack of space forbids further notice , are on
Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Frederick Denison Maurice	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Iroquois Confederacy .

		* This will surely be remembered as an era of historical reprints , so far at least as the
United States	LOCATION	is concerned .

		Xever before , probably , has there been such a veritable flood of old his - torical books reissued in new dress .

		What is more to the point , the books themselves are in nearly every case books of real value , -- books which have not been , and often could not be , replaced by later works in the same field .

		It is also a notable fact that , either directly or indirectly , a large proportion of these books throw light upon the history and the manners and customs of the Indian tribes ; and several are devoted especially to that most remarkable of Xorth American tribes , the Iroquois .

		Xot long ago ,
Cadwallader Colden	PERSON	's ' History of the Five Indian Xations of
Canada	LOCATION	' appeared in a neat little reprint , in two volumes ; but without that indispensable adjunct of a history of any sort -- an index .

		Xow we have two other books dealing with the same tribe : Mor - gan 's ` League of the Iroquois , ' and
Canfield	PERSON	's ` Legends of the Iroquois . '

		Though published more than half a centurj - ago ,
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's ' League of the Iroquois ' still remains the best and most authoritative work on the subject .

		It is not absolutely free from historical and other errors , -- indeed , what work is ?

		-- but they are all of comparatively minor importance , and the book is , as
Francis Parkman	PERSON	described it , a ` production of singular merit . '

		The present edition -- for it would be most unjust to call it merely a reprint -- presents not only a scru - pulously accurate printing of the edition of
1851	DATE	, but is enriched with voluminous notes by the present editor , Mr.

Charles T. Porter	PERSON	, the * only survivor of th `` three co-laborers in the original book ' ; a sketch of
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's life , with a bibliography of his writings , by the editor ; biographical notes on
Ely	PERSON	S. ''
Parker	PERSON	and
Charles T. Porter	PERSON	; and last , but by no means least , an excellent index , including a partial vocabulary of Seneca names .

		The illustrations include a portrait of
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	, and a map of the Iroquois country prepared by the Rev.
Wm. M. Beauchamp	PERSON	, S.T.D. .

		A fact worthy of special commendation is that the editor has availed himself to a very large extent of
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's own emendations of his original text , whether contained in his subsequent works or in the form of manuscript notes .

		In this way we have in many cases
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's cor - rections of his own mistakes -- mistakes which he was led into in the
1851	DATE	book , through insufficient information , but which his own sub - sequent investigations proved to be false or inaccurate .

		For his editorial notes Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	has drawn upon every source of information , and they reveal his wide and discriminating reading of literature on the Iroquois .

		There is just onfe criticism that must be made , and that applies not to the substance but to the arrangement of the notes .

		These are thrown into a bulky Appendix at the back of the book , and are arranged in such a fashion that reference to them is anything but convenient .

		Possibly - a good deal of this is due to the fact that in the present edition the two former volumes are thrown into one , while the paging remain ^ distinct .

		Had the book been paged in a single series through the two volumes , much of the confusion might have been avoided .

		However , this is a minor point .

		One can not easily overestimate the import tance and value of
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's ` League of tb ^ Iroquois . '

		If only as a reliable record of th ^ political and social organization of an extremely interesting tribe , it would be a work of per - manent interest .

		The Iroquois had no written language ; their laws and history and traditions were carried down from mouth to moutlu Though greatly reduced in numbers , they stili retain their individuality as a tribe , or group of tribes ; but it is probable that even now much of the material contained in Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	's book would have been unobtainable , had the ' League of the Iroquois ' never been written , -- and within a comparatively short time , when the last remnant of the once all-powerful Confederacy disappears in the surrounding mass of Aryafi stock , the history of the great League would !

		have become a lost chapter in the history of
America	LOCATION	.

		Morgan 's entiiusiasm for his worlj ^ and a natural gift for presenting even the dry - est facts in a graphic and interesting way , oom ^ 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, bine to make the ' League of the Iroquois ' not only a work of prime importance to all students of Indian life and character , but a book that one reads with genuine enjoyment for its own sake .

		.

		Perhaps an even deeper interest attaches to this work on the Iroquois , -- so far , at least , as the author himself is concerned , -- by reason of a vast investigation which grew directly out of it , and to which
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	devoted the latter half of his life .

		In studying the manners and customs of the Senecas , he had been struck by the peculiar system of relationship which existed in that tribe , -- a system under which the familiar relationships of father , mother , sister , brother , uncle , aunt , etc. , were extended apparently beyond the usual limits of consan - guinity , in a most bewildering fashion .

		To othersj as the Rev. Dr.
Mcllvaine	PERSON	has pointed out , this apparent confusion of relationships , though often noticed before , had suggested nothing but the confusion of a savage mind and the reign of unreason .

		To Morgan it was the first step upon a great linguistic trail , which he was to follow throughout the remainder of his life , and which led him to results far transcending his expectations .

		It led him , ^ rst of all , to the discovery that the Iroquois method of characterizing kinship was substan - tially the same as that of the
Dakotah	ORGANIZATION	tribes in the
Far West	LOCATION	.

		This induced him to conjec - ture whether , if such an extraordinary system were common to two tribes so remote as the Iroquois and the
Dakotah	ORGANIZATION	, it might not be • found to be common to all the tribes of North and
South America	LOCATION	.

		• Here one may note the two characteristics which , above all others , marked the nature of
Lewis Morgan	PERSON	, and were chiefly responsible for his successful conclusion of a task that can only b6 described as gigantic ; these were his ver -RCB- ' remarkable power of generalization -- a power which seemed to have in it something very like intuition , -- and his indomitable perseverance .

		He followed this intellectual trail with all the obstinate persistency of one of those Iroquois wa : rriors for whom he possessed such genuine sympathy .

		As the first of these characteristics Jed him to generalize as to the probable exist - ence of a system of consanguinity common to all the American tribes , with all the important conclusions to which such a fact would inevi - tably lead , so the second induced him to devote ten long years to an investigation of the sub - ject , which not only embraced all the available literature , but included personal visits to every important tribe on the continent .

		The result -RRB- Fas a complete vindication of his theory .

		But the trail did not end here ; it led him still farther afield .

		If the system of relation - ship first discovered among the Iroquois was now proved to be common to all the aboriginal tribes of North and
South America	LOCATION	, was it not possible that the same system might be found among the Turanian and Polynesian families ?

		Another ten years were given to this investi - gation , schedules of questions being prepared and sent through the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution to missionaries and American consuls in every quarter of the globe .

		Again
Morgan	PERSON	's broad and pregnant generalization proved to be cor - rect .

		Dr.
Mcllvaine	PERSON	, whose reminiscences form an interesting feature of the appendix to the ^ League of the Iroquois , ' tells us that during this period
Morgan	PERSON	lived and worked under great mental excitement . '

		I well remember one occasion when he came into my study saying , `` I shall find it , I shall find it among the Tamil people and Dravidian tribes of
Southern India	LOCATION	. ''

		At this time I had no expecta - tion of any such result ; and I said to him , `` My friend , you have enough to do in working out your discovery in connection with the tribes of the Amer - ican continent ; let the peoples of the old world go . ''

		He replied `` I can not do it , -- I can not do it ; I must go on , for I am sure I shall find it all there . ''

		Some months afterward he came in again , his face all aglow with excitement , the Tamil schedule in his hands , the answers to his questions just what he had predicted ; and , throwing it on my table , he exclaimed , `` There !

		What did I tell you ? '' '

		But again the trail led him onward .

		If the same common system of relationship and affin - ity was common to all the members of the ancient Turanian and Polynesian stocks , as well as to the aboriginal tribes of
America	LOCATION	, it might also prove to have prevailed in early days among the two other great groups of the human family , the Semitic and Aryan races ; in a word , it might , and probably would , prove to have been absolutely universal , and would lead back from each of the linguistic groups to the prehistoric race which was the progenitor of them all .

		Here was a problem to stir the blood , -- one whose solution might satisfy any ambition .

		To quote again from Dr.
Mcllvaine	PERSON	: ` When he broached this final generalization to me I was appalled , not having the least expectation that it could be verified .

		But with his customary enthusiasm and energy , almost superhuman , he immediately addressed himself to another series of vast investigations , with a similar result in the end .

		He found overwhelming evidence that the system had once prevailed in all the Arabic or Semitic peoples , including the Hebrews , in all the Sanscritic or Aryan branches , the Brahmans , Per - sians , Greeks , Romans ,
Gothic	ORGANIZATION	, Celtic and Sclavonic nations , among our own ancestors , -- in a word , throughout the human race , over three-fourths of which his investigations extended .

		This last gener - alization stands perhaps unequalled for its vastnesj and grandeur , and for its fruitfulness in results , by anything in the history of science known to me except that of the Newtonian theory of gravita - tion . '

		1905 -RSB- THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, 121 The results of these long-continued investi - gations were published by the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution , in
1871	DATE	, in a large volume entitled * Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family . '

		The re \ aewer well remembers the amazement with which he first looked through this great work and realized the stu - pendous nature of the task which had been brought to such a successful conclusion .

		The conclusions which grew inevitably out of a care - ful examination and analysis of these data went far beyond Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	's most sanguine expec - tations .

		It not only became clear that the appar - ently meaningless system of relationship which he had proved to be common to every branch of the human family established beyond question the existence in prehistoric times of a universal system of communal marriage , but as the voluminous material was more exhaustively ana - lysed and compared , facts of startling signifi - cance emerged , -- the curtain of countless gen - erations rolled back , and the prehistoric world , with its primitive social organization , and its primitive mental and moral structure , stood revealed .

		As
Morgan	PERSON	had gathered together in his * Systems of Consanguinity ' an immense body of new facts , new data , so in his later work ion * Ancient Society ' he interpreted these facts and drew from them conclusions and generali - zations of the utmost importance to Ethnology and all its sister sciences .

		As the editor of the present book rightly says , ' ^ lorgan 's work in the domain of Ethnology is quite comparable to that of
Darwin	LOCATION	in another field . '

		So much space has been given to Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	that it will be impossible to deal at length with the other author under consideration .

		Can - field 's * Legends of the Iroquois ' is one of the most important volumes in the admirable series which the
Wessels Company	ORGANIZATION	has been issuing for some time past , under the general editor - ship of !

		Mr.
Kufus Rockwell Wilson	PERSON	.

		These volumes do not profess to be much more than reprints , with such notes as are absolutely indis - pensable ; but in type , paper , and general makeup , they are all that could be desired .

		The * Legends of the Iroquois ' present what is from several points of view the most fascinating side of Indian character , the poetic and imaginative side .

		If space permitted it would be worth while to quote one of these legends , -- for instance , the Birth of the Arbutus , as delicate and charm - ing a little allegory as one could find anywhere , but of which no just impression could be given without quoting it entire .

		It may be said for this book that while , like
Morgan	PERSON	's ' League of the Iroquois , ' it has a distinct value to the stu - dent of Ethnology , or anyone who is interested in the study of Indian life and character , it will also appeal with equal force to the reader who seeks only entertainment ; for we venture to say that anyone who dips into this book of legends - ^ one might almost call them fairy tales -- will find them as fascinating as a book of verses or a metrical romance .

		* The time of the Tudors , beginning with the accession of
Henry VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		in
1485	DATE	and ending with the death of Elizabeth in
1603	DATE	, was one of the greatest periods in English history .

		It included the reigns of
Henry YIL	ORGANIZATION	,
Henry YIIL	PERSON	,
Edward YI.	PERSON	,
Mary	PERSON	and
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		It embraced the entire sixteenth century , which saw the rise of absolute monarchy , the Reformation extended and
England	LOCATION	made Protestant , the Renaissance active in that country , the printing-press busy , a noble literature developed , the birth of mod - em science , and men 's minds lifted to a new view-point of the universe and far above that from which they had previously observed nature and natural things ; it saw also the greatest of commercial revolutions consequent upon the discover -RRB- ' of a new ocean route to
India	LOCATION	, and a new world in the west opened for exploration and colonization - It was an age of great men ; more than two thousand English names from that century have been found worthy of a place in the ` Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	, ' -- three times as many as appear from any previ - ous century .

		The gravitating point in this great historical period lay principally in
London	LOCATION	.

		By far the greatest number of events which made the time of the Tudors so important and so interesting occurred in that city , which , as the trade of the East deserted the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	lines and the older commercial capitals lost their rank , rose in greatness .

		It was there that the lives of the two
Henrys	ORGANIZATION	, of
Edward	ORGANIZATION	, of
Mary	PERSON	and
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, were chiefly spent .

		It was there that the revo - lutions which marked the period found their storm-centre .

		It was in the city of
London	LOCATION	that executions occurred for witchcraft , for political causes , or for conscience 's sake , the most numer - ous and notable in aU history .

		As
London	LOCATION	was
England	LOCATION	to so large an extent , we are naturally curious to learn all we can about the city at that interesting period .

		The late Sir
Walter Besanf	PERSON	s quarto volume on ' Lon - don in the
Time of the Tudors	ORGANIZATION	' goes far toward gratifying our curiosity .

		It is in the same sumptuous form as the same author 's *

		122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, for the most part reproductions of contemporary prints ; chief among them is a panorama of the city , extending over three double-pages of the book , originally drawn by
Anthony Van	PERSON	den Wyngaerde in
1543	DATE	, well illustrating the map folded into the cover , embracing 12 pages , and being a reduced reproduction of
Ralph Agas	PERSON	's map of about
1560	DATE	.

		The city thus presented to us was not a place of narrow crooked streets and closely-built houses , but a straggling town where parks and gardens and trees abounded , in the midst of which were to be seen such massive structures as the Tower of
London	LOCATION	,
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's , and many pal - aces , hospitals , and monastic buildings .


London	LOCATION	had not in those days assumed the gigantic uniformity of the modem metropolis , nor was it as yet wholly absorbed in the whirl of business life .

		It was not , as at present , a province covered with houses , but a city of moderate size , with walls and gates beyond which lay pleasant suburbs .

		It is difficult now to arrive at any correct estimate of its popula - tion .

		There could not have been less than thirty or forty thousand souls within its walls in the twelfth century ; and in the succeeding cen - turies , while other towns in
England	LOCATION	were stead - ily declining ,
London	LOCATION	was growing .

		It was estimated that in the reign of Mary the city had a population of from 150,000 to 180,000 , and that this rose to 300,000 in
1607	DATE	.

		All this was in spite of frequent visitations of the plague , causing a heavy death-rate , -- as , for example , in
1564	DATE	, when 23,660 died , more than 20,000 of them of the plague .

		The number of foreign residents was probably not less than 10,000 at the
end of the sixteenth century	DATE	.

		The business of the city , as well as its domes - tic operations , were largely carried on in the streets , much in the manner of a tropical city .

		Its red brick , half-timbered houses , with high gables , oriel windows , and terraces , and its citi - zens in picturesque and even gay attire , -- ^ all gave to the city the color and stamp of origin - ality .

		The Thames was crossed by but one bridge ; its waters were clear , and gardens and meadows lined its banks , -- though it is said to have given employment in
1594	DATE	to 40,000 men as boatmen , sailors , fishermen .

		It was a pleas - ure-loving city in those days .

		The barbers ' and tobacconists ' shops were favorite places of resort .

		Of the latter there were no less than seven thou - sand in the city ; and in some of them instruc - tion was given in the art of smoking .

		St.
Paul	PERSON	's was a rendezvous for promenaders and idle folk .

		Smithiield had its Fair on certain days .

		At
Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	's Fair were puppet - shows and exhibitions of curiosities , and in
Southwark	LOCATION	were bear-baitings .

		There were bowling alleys , cock-fighting , and ' tent-pegging in the tilt-yard . '

		Toward the end of the period arose the theatre , to surpass in popularity all other forms of amusement , notwithstanding the fierce invectives hurled against it by the
Puri	PERSON	- tans .

		The city was full of inns ; and wherea & these had formerly been places of lodging , and some of them , like the Inns of Court , were col - leges of residence , and totally distinct from the ^ taverns and cookships whose business it was to furnish food and drink , it now became the function of the Inns to - provide food , and they were consequently made the meeting-places of those famous constituents of the early clubs .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's work is rightly called a survey .

		It is not a history ; it is not a story .

		It is especially happy in its accounts of how people lived and dressed , what they ate and drank , what customs they pursued at their wed - dings and at the burial of their dead , -- from the king and queen down to the ` prentice , who at this period was at the height of his power and importance , chiefly as a disturber of the peace , and whose business it was to attract customers by calling out in front of the shops , * What d'ye lack , gentles ?

		The
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	to Date .

		* Magazine writers in
America	LOCATION	have for sev - eral decades past found agreeable occupation for their pens in discussing and explaining President
Monroe	PERSON	's declaration concerning the attitude of
America	LOCATION	toward the interests of European nations on this continent .

		With each fresh possibility of a foreign entanglement has - appeared a new exposition of the proper
Ameri	PERSON	- can policy ; and more or less difference of opin - ion has been developed , owing to the failure of commentators to examine the subject exhaus - tively .

		The events of recent years have not only renewed but intensified the public interest in the subject , and have furnished so much new material for consideration that what has here - tofore required space for a magazine article now demands a treatise .

		The appearance of Mr.
Thomas B. Edgington	PERSON	's compendious vol - ume on the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	is therefore timely ^ The author , an attorney of over forty years ' practice at the bar of
Memphis	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, has brought to his task a long professional experi - ence , and an extended study of original sources * The

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 123 of information .

		The modest thesis of Mr.
George F. Tucker	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	-LRB- 1885 -RRB- has been drawTi upon , and followed in part ; but the pres - ent author has availed himself of the wealth of new material which recent international epi - sodes have introduced , and has brought down to date his discussion of the phases of Monroeism which have been made prominent in the debates of later years .

		Among other subjects thus pre - sented are the treaty establishing the Ha ^ e Tribunal , the Venezuelan Boundary case , the settlement of the European claims against
Venezuela	LOCATION	, and the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal treaty and concession .

		Mr.
Edgington	PERSON	preserves a calm and historical spirit in all his comments on the interesting subjects of which he treats , and the argumentation in which he not infrequently indulges is that of a candid jurisconsult rather than that of a partisan .

		Indeed , it would be diflScult for a stranger to discover from these pages the author 's political predilections .

		As authority for the positions he assumes , he makes numerous citations from well-established legal treatises , and from documents of historical ver - ity .

		The whole work may be called a glossary upon the leading features of recent American diplomacy , with the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	kept in view as the cardinal feature .

		Mr.
Edgington	PERSON	's exposition of the true scope and purport of President
Monroe	PERSON	's declaration is correct and discriminating , and states clearly the present general understanding at home , and the same with which we are credited by most of the European states .

		AMiile the authoi ^ s general purpose is historical and not prophetic , he does not hesitate to point out in several respects what course the
United States	LOCATION	should pursue in order to preserve a just consistency with our past .

		The '
Calvo	PERSON	doctrine ' is expounded at length , exposing its errors , and its trangressions of international law ; and the author explains that it can not be combined with the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	' in any American system , ' and urges that `` the fact should be made known by the
United States	LOCATION	to the European powers that it does not indorse the
Calvo	PERSON	heresy . '

		At the same time , ` the policy of this government should be to induce the Spanish-American republics to adopt the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	each for itself . '

		And as the modem substitution of steam for sailing vessels has made coaling sta - tions necessary , we may well concede the use of such stations in this hemisphere to the European powers , as not inconsistent with the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, while we , without violating our own precedents , secure the use of similar stations abroad ; and ' it would be a sound international policy for the
United States	LOCATION	to take the initia - tive in this matter . '

		These , though the sugges - tions of an advocate rather than the comments of a historian , are timeh ' , and may well receive careful consideration .

		On the vexed question of
Canning	ORGANIZATION	's claim to the authorship of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Edgington	PERSON	seems to be unusually undecided .

		What is apparently his conclusion on the sub - ject correctly avers that ' The term ''
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine '' simply became a new name for an old policy of the government .

		It was a policy recognized by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and sustained by the Federal and Anti-federal parties , as it is now by the Eepublican and Democratic parties . '

		This conclusion makes superfluous the authors previous statement that ' Canning thereupon , operating through
Richard Kush	PERSON	and
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, became the real author of the
Monroe	PERSON	declaration . '

		Xor should we , in justice to our own statesmen , concede , as does the author , that
Hhe Monroe	PERSON	message , if not inspired by Mr.
Canning	PERSON	in whole or in part , was at least in conformity with his general pol - icy . '

		The facts are , that the policy to which
Canning	ORGANIZATION	vainly endeavored to commit the Mon - roe administration differed materially from the *
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	' ; that the essential elements of that ' Doctrine ' were definitely adopted by the
Monroe	PERSON	administration , and recognized as a part of * the old policy ' of this country , as early as
1820	DATE	, when we were first confronted with the schemes of the Holy Alliance ; that
Monroe	PERSON	and
Adams	PERSON	and Rush fathomed at once the British selfishness which inspired the ' Canning doc - trine , ' turned coldly away from it , as their correspondence shows , and persisted in the course previously adopted ; and that while Canning undoubtedly welcomed the .

		results which followed the
Monroe	PERSON	declaration , no part of the credit therefor belongs to him .

		The American * aloofness ' was pronounced , and
Canning	ORGANIZATION	's failure to draw us into an ` entan - gling alliance ' was conspicuous .

		The results of the action of the
Monroe	PERSON	administration in
1823	DATE	must be ranked among the accomplish - ments of American diplomacy .

New York	LOCATION	:

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, mitted in a biographical dictionary .

		He has vivified the personalities of these half-dozen men , -- More ,
Sidney	PERSON	,
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, -- and has made them show - forth almost the entire activity of the age .

		The introductory chapter designs to give in brief prospect the spirit of the century as a whole , so as to make a sort of frame - work into which the succeeding chapters may be fitted , -- in this respect being an improvement on the opening lecture , which surveyed in general terms the nses to the public of the ' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Much that Mr.
Lee	PERSON	says is of course trite enough .

		One can not write of this century without frequent repetition of twice-told tales , such as the Archbishop of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	's prophecy of More 's greatness , or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's munifi - • cence toward his wife in leaving her his second - best bedstead .

		Yet the book is no mere rehash - ing of the commonplace .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	endeavors to place these men before us in the light of their personal environment as well as in the greater light of their relation to their time .

		Thus he points out the moral paradox in the minds and consciences of the men of this period , -- More 's liberalism in his ` Utopia , ' and his intolerance in his own religious faith , intolerance which led him to the block ;
Ealeigh	ORGANIZATION	's elevated altruism in his ' Historic of the World , ' and his dishonesty and greed of ^ old in his public life ; and , most noted of all .

		Bacon 's lofty philosophic spirit in his books , and his petty sycophancy and treachery in his ■ career on the bench .

		And in lesser degree the paradox existed in
Sidney	LOCATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and Shake - speare ; for all these men came with the
Renais	PERSON	- sance and lived into the Reformation .

		It was no mere personal peculiarity , but something char - acteristic of the time ; the great Queen herself was perhaps the most puzzling paradox of all .

		It is especially the relation these six bore to the Renaissance that most interests Mr.
Lee	PERSON	.

		Each man represented some striking phase of this wonderful movement , and combined they practically make up its totality , taking the term Renaissance in its widest sense .

		More stood for its culture as comprehended by a man still within the church portals ;
Sidney	PERSON	embodied the personal charm of the courtier and the enthu - siasm of the man of letters ;
Raleigh	LOCATION	was the product of the spirit of adventure with its unquenchable desire to discover new worlds ;
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	gave expression to the newly awakened sense of form and color , of Greek sensuousness and media3val chivalry ; Bacon was the great apostle of those who took all knowledge to be their province ; and Shakespeare incarnated all these human activities and aspirations in the men and women of his dramas .

		The last two chapters of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's book are a popular and brief presentation of his
Life of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first , on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's career , shows again that his life is not a tissue of uncertainties and conjectures , spun by pseudo - scholarship from the sonnets and the plays .

		The subject of the last chapter , the foreign influences on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, was evidently chosen to show how the New Learning affected liter - ature in one specific case , as well as to show how Shakespeare , as it were , gathered up into his work all the phases of this new learning .

		The last chapter is thus in a measure the com - plement of the first .

		The mere matter of the chapter is familiar enough .

		We have all heard over and over again of the little Latin and less Greek , of the superficial French , of the influence of
Ovid	LOCATION	, and the rest .

		Yet these facts are worth noting , because they show , as perhaps nothing else so well can , that the spirit of the Renaissance was not local , that it was diffused throughout
Western Europe	LOCATION	, and that , as Mr.
Lee	PERSON	says , it is to this diffusion of the
Renais	PERSON	- sance and the personal preeminence of Shake - speare 's genius and intuition that we must look if we would understand any part of Shake - speare 's work .

		THE DTAT .

		125 nothing more than an illusion imposed upon our senses .

		It is all the world there is for most people , but a few have the spiritual insight to perceive its shadowy nature .

		With such people , if they have the purpose to live lives to some degree corresponding with reality , the ordering of conduct becomes subject to new and uncon - ventional laws ; the motives upon which most men act appear absurdly inadequate , and the goals for which they strive are seen to be not worth the seeking .

		Such people go through life as strangers to their fellows , and are by them set down as impracticable visionaries .

		Any attempt to bring the two books into a closer or more concrete resemblance than this would fail , for they are widely different in all their details .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	gives us a study of the poetic temperament ; Miss TJnderhill presents for our contemplation the temperament of the mystic .

		Her hero is introduced , moreover , in startling fashion .

		He is a child of the
London	LOCATION	slums , lying at the age of ten years upon his death-bed in a hospital .

		His life flickers and goes out , and he finds himself in ' The Gray WorkP -- for this is the book 's title -- among the company of disembodied spirits , blown about a world of which they are ever cognizant , but which has suddenly become curiously intangible .

		To the ghost of this particular boy , this is a most horrible condition of exist - ence , and so , by putting forth all his power of volition , he escapes from it and is bom again , this time into a life of suburban respectability and materialism .

		But as he grows up for the second time , he is h-aunted by memories of the shadowy interregnimi between his two lives , and also recalls distinctly his earlier incarnation .

		A few attempts to impart his strange knowl - edge to others result in such a mingling of incredulity and suspicion that he soon learns to keep such thoughts to himself , and to pretend a belief in the game of life and an interest in its moves .

		But all the time he knows a truth that none about him can comprehend , and this knowledge is reducible to the two essential pro- positions that the actual world is unreal and that the real ' gray ' world , as he remembers it , offers a most dreadful alternative .

		So he gropes upward into the years of early manhood , solitary , viewed askance , yearning for human sympathy and for some ideal means of escape from the obsession of a haunting recollection .

		He is eventually led to contemplate translation into the real world with some degree of hope - fulness , for the belief is gradually borne in upon him that what the soul takes with it out of the world of illusion determines the satisfac - tion with which life is adjusted to the condi - tions of reality .

		The agencies which work this change of attitude are art , the Catholic church , the example of St.
Francis	PERSON	seen through the medium of the Umbrian landscape , and a high - ly spiritualized form of love .

		The following quotation will illustrate better than any words of description the style of the book , a style which , in its best moments , is fairly magical , although its effects are produced by the simplest means .

		The scene is the interior of a Catholic church in
London	LOCATION	, looked upon for the first time by the protaganist of this story of mystic - ism : ` He looked down the long aisles .

		They were misty , half lighted by colored windows in the south .

		Far away , he saw lights burning , and persons who knelt by them .

		It all seemed to him profoundly unnatural .

		He felt as if he had penetrated to the home of a race of beings not entirely human -- an unsuspected world within the world .

		A woman passed by him .

		In the street , he would have known her for a very ordinary , well-behaving person , not to be suspected of vivid emotions .

		Here she was remote , magical ; caught up by the strong love of the initiate .

		He watched her as she made the sign of the cross and knelt , very simply and without shame , before an altar .

		It seemed to him that she stayed there a long time ; he dared not move because of the tension of her attitude .

		Presently she kissed the feet of a statue that stood there , and came away .

		Her face , as she passed
Willie	PERSON	, was serious but very contented .

		No doubt she would go out into the foggy sunshine and take a hansom or the omnibus and go home ; but her real Life had been in the moment when she kissed the image with a convinced sincerity which did not belong to Subur - bia and its gods .

		It was evident that great mat - ters happened in this building . '

		We are by no means sure that the writer has any notion of serving , in this and similar pas - sages , as the propagandist of any particular faith .

		Her creed appears to be expressed , if anywhere definitely , in the following words : * It seems so much easier , in these days , to live morally than to live beautifully .

		Lots of us man - age to exist for years without ever sinning against society , but we sin against loveliness every hour of the day .

		I do n't think the crime is less great .

		Beauty , after all , is the visual side of goodness : it is Christ immanent in the world ; and its crucifixion still goes on . '

		We fear lest we have given the impression that this book is as sombre as its title .

		It is intense - ly serious , no doubt , but it is also animated and even enlivened by touches of a highly effective humor .

		Indeed , its most striking characteristic is found in the fact that the writer has one eye constantly fixed upon the most concrete matters and incidents , while the other is as constantly engaged in exploring the spiritual depths , or in contemplating the eternal verities , of human existence .

		` Three
Dukes	PERSON	, ' by
G. Ystridde	PERSON	, -- this is a fantastic title and a puzzling name .

		The title is explained by reference to a Russian folk-song , and the name we shall infer , upon internal evi - dence , to be that of a woman .

		As already hinted at , the novel is one of Russian life , not the brilliant life of capital and court , nor the 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, melodramatic life of conspiracy and exile , but the life of a country estate far in the Russian interior , dominated by an eccentric nobleman of singular ideas and uncontrollable temper , and made sprightly by the intrusion of a self - possessed and charming English governess .

		The genuineness of the local coloring is undeniable , and the deft manipulation of both characters and incident shows unusual talent .

		These vir - tues of the story are offset by a rambling and incoherent structure , with hardly a vestige of a plot , and an ending which is not so much a conclusion as a breaking-off .

		The book has a charm which these defects almost serve to heighten , and the interest is kept up throughout , although we sometimes wonder why this should be the case .

		Mr.
Eider Haggard	PERSON	has found in the epoch of the Crusades a new field for his romantic invention , and gives us , in ' The Brethren , ' one of the best of his books .

		The courtly figure of
Saladin	LOCATION	, dear to us from the childhood days when we were entranced by ' The
Talisman	ORGANIZATION	, ' is revived almost in the spirit of
Scott	LOCATION	, and is the central object of interast in the present romance .

		A niece of the great
Saracen	PERSON	, bom of the union between his sister and an English knight , has been nurtured in her father 's home , and pro- tected by her two cousins , the ` brethren ' of the tale .

		Saladin determines to gain possession of this young woman , and his emissaries are successful in ensnaring her and bearing her away from her English home .

		Thereupon the brethren , both loving her , follow her to the
East	LOCATION	, bent upon her rescue , and the romance is in full swing .

		Their adventures are many and exciting , and they are eventually successful , although the one who is doomed to disappoint - ment in his love remains in the East to do further battle for the Cross .

		Historically , the romance culminates with the siege and capture of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	by the infidel hosts , and the clem - ency of Saladin toward the inhabitants of the city , the result of the heroine 's throwing herself at the feet of the conqueror with a plea for mercy .

		Romance of a sort made more familiar to us by recent writers is provided by Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	's new book , ` The Abbess of Vlaye . '

		The period is that of
Henry lY.	PERSON	, who has just become reconciled with the Church and recog - nized as King of
France	LOCATION	, but is still far from having set his house in order .

		Particularly in the region of Perigord are conditions unsettled , and a certain turbulent Captain of Vlaye is having things much his own way .

		How the king 's lieutenant restores order in that region , and incidentally wins domestic happiness , is related in a spirited and picturesque way by Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	, whose invention never seems to fail him , and Avhose workmanship may be seen at its best in this performance .

		The psychology of South American politics is the matter which occupies Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	's attention in ' ISTostromo , ' the longest novel he has thus far produced .


South America	LOCATION	has provided a theme for many other works of fiction , but they have been almost without excep - tion performances of melodramatic or opera bouffe quality , making no attempt to look deeper than the picturesque surface of things , and offering no claim to be taken seriously as actual studies of life and character .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	, it need hardly be said , never writes anything that does not make a serious claim upon our atten - tion , and his books set a very high standard of diction , characterization , and penetrative observation .

		It is only upon the structural side that they are conspicuously lacking , and it must be admitted that readers of ' Nostromo , ' although they will find in the book ample reward for their pains in perusing it , will often reach the point of exasperation at its lengthy analyses , its interminable dragging-out of inci - dent , and its frequent harking back to ante - cedent conditions .

		The scene is a republic on the west coast , conveniently indefinite of loca - tion .

		In this country an English family has long been settled , and has had for its stake the government concession of a silver mine , handed down from father to son , and entailing much disagreeable ' squeezing ' from successive presi - dents and dictators .

		The descendant to whom it has fallen when the present narrative opens is the first one to make it a really valuable property , ' and in the development he becomes the greatest power in the state , enlisting foreign capital , building railroads , and carrying govern - ments upon his pay roll .

		A final desperate effort on the part of the greedy politicians to get control of the goose that lays this golden Q ^ g is the main feature of the plot , but , as was observed at the outset , the psychological interest predominates over the adventurous or romantic interest , which justifies the author in naming this novel after one of its characters -- a minor character as far as the main action of the story is concerned , but the one upon whom Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	has concentrated his analytical powers .

		The work is a very strong one , and we can think of no other writer , unless it be Mr.
Cunning	PERSON	- ham-Grahame , who could have done anything like as well with the same material .

		We expect neither psychology nor any other kind of insight from Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	, but we do expect , and generally get , an entertaining story of some sort . '

		The Loves of Miss
Anne	PERSON	' is the latest of these fictions , and the setting is Scotch .

		Miss
Anne	PERSON	is a minx who regards all men as fair game for her coquetry , and who

		THE DIAli 127 practices through four hundred pages upon as many as come within her reach .

		Her devices are sometimes desperately wicked , but she car - ries off her enterprises with a high hand , and never comes wholly to grief , although some - times dangerously close to its verge .

		Her story may be read with a good conscience , which is more than one can say of a good many of oui recent novels .

		Some months ago there was published in Oermany a novel by
Herr August Niemann	PERSON	, entitled * Der Weltkrieg --
Deutsche Traume	ORGANIZATION	. '

		This novel , translated by Mr.
J. H. Freese	PERSON	, is 310W published as ' The Conquest of
England	LOCATION	, ' a more exactly descriptive title .

		For the ^ dreams ' of the German , in the view of this author , are of overthrowing the English power , and of an imperial army taking triumphant possession of
London	LOCATION	.

		That some Germans entertain such dreams we imagine to be true ; that they represent the real ambitions of the ^ eat heart of the German people we take leave to doubt and even to deny .

		Such a denial , of course , to be effective should come from the nation thus traduced , and we may mention in passing that it has recently been most vigor - ously voiced by Professor
Paulsen	PERSON	.

		And surely , no wilder or more criminal ambition could be entertained by any serious German than that of destroying the power with which , above all others ,
Germany	LOCATION	is marked out to march hand in hand toward a common goal of culture and civilization .

		But enough of this .

		The story , considered as a historical romance , is of a type familiar enough , and is related in a workman - like manner .

		The war is foreshadowed by an alliance of the powers inimical to
England	LOCATION	, and actually begins on the Afghan frontier .

		It ends , as we have before suggested ^ with the German occupation of
London	LOCATION	and the division of the lion 's spoils .

		It is a fairly good story , and is curiously interesting from the way in which it represents , upon every possible occasion , the point of view of the German anglophobe .

		Throughout it is taken for granted that
England	LOCATION	is the arch-enemy of civilization , that its foreign policy is a complex network of rapacity and hypocrisy , and that it is deaf to the voice of the higher idealism .

		To us , who know so well ihat this is the exact opposite of the truth , and that among modem nations
England	LOCATION	, whatever its faults or mistakes , stands upon a higher moral plane than any of its rivals , and is much more apt to subordinate expediency or self - interest to ethical principle -- to us who know this the author is merely amusing in the display of his prejudiced animosity , but there is cause for some degree of serious reflection in the fact that such a book as this should have had the popular success that is reported from the coun - try of its origin .

		In reading * Morganatic , '
Herr Max Nordau	PERSON	's latest work , due allowance must be made for the fact that the author is primarily a student of the political and social problems of modem civilization , and only incidentally a novelist .

		He has so wide an acquaintance with the cur - rents of contemporary thought and with the conditions of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	society at the present time that his work , whatever form it may take , and despite its occasional flavor of sensationalism , can not fail to be inter - esting , a proposition of which the novel at hand affords ample proof .

		While the work is open to criticism upon structural grounds , and while it exhibits no great skill in the penetration of character , it makes up for these defects by a rich variety of incident and a dramatic anima - tion of action .

		It is chiefly concerned with the efforts of a designing woman , the morganatic widow of an Austrian prince , to obtain for her - self and her son the social recognition that she believes to be their right , but that are denied them by the chief representatives of the family .

		It is a story of intrigue , of financial speculation , and of the life of aristocrats and operatic artists .

		The efforts of the princess , seconded in only a half-hearted way by her son , are com - pletely unsuccessful .

		She dies an embittered woman , and he takes refuge in a religious order .

		Our sympathetic interest centres about neither of these figures , but rather about that of a young girl of illegitimate birth and lyrical genius who makes a career for herself , softening animosities and overcoming prejudices by virtue of her marked and charming individuality .

		*
Bethany	PERSON	, ' by Mr.
Thomas E. Watson	PERSON	, is a book which describes Southern life , and Georgian life in particular , during the years immediately preceding the Civil War .

		It also includes scenes from the earlier years of the struggle itself , and ends with the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		It is related in the first person , and is apparently a novel of a rambling sort , although the element of truth is much larger than the element of invention .

		It presents the Confederate point of view with much plausi - bility , and such leaders as
Toombs	PERSON	,
Yancey	PERSON	, and
Stephen	PERSON	speak for themselves and their cause at great length .

		It pretends to be a book of boyish memories of the persons and scenes described , and is in this respect essentially genuine , although as a matter of fact the author -LRB- who was born in
1856	DATE	-RRB- would have had to be a few years older to be an intelligent eye-witness of the matters concerning which he writes .

		The fire-eating Southerner has not often been exhib - ited , in either history or fiction , more truthfully and vividly than in the present work .

		One paragraph in the apologetic preface seems to demand a word of comment .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	writes : * When it shall have gradually dawned 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	'' upon all Northern writers that the
Southern States	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	did no more than exercise a right which had been almost universally con - ceded from the founding of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	-- a right in which the seceders believed , and which provocation seemed to call for the use of -- then , perhaps , we shall have historical literature which does not stigmatize us as rebels and our leaders as traitors / We are willing to grant that the argument for secession was a strong one , and that secession itself was carried out with strict regard for legality , but what pos - sible defense can be offered by the author or anyone else for the conduct of those leaders who had taken a solemn oath to support the Constitution , and who in 1860-61 deliberately violated that oath ?

		We are not overfond of using the words ' rebel ' and ' traitor , ' but that application to the leaders in question seems strictly legitimate , and in the case of these men , whatever we may think of others , the excuse of a divided allegiance is the merest sophistry .

		We fear that Mr.
Watson	PERSON	is still sadly in need of reconstruction .

		If our sympathies enable us to make a gen - erous allowance for the influence of Southern birth and environment in expressing our opinion of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's book , there is no reason why we should extend them sufficiently to cover the work of a
Northerner	ORGANIZATION	like Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	.

		` The Law of the Land , ' viewed as a piece of literary workmanship , is far superior to '
Beth	PERSON	- any , ' but its argument is inexcusably pernicious .

		The author plants himself squarely upon the right of the white Southerner to deny everj ' kind of right to the black , and thereby makes himself an apologist for the lawlessness with which the race question is handled throughout the South , The most overbearing acts of license and violence are condoned , and every suggestion of philanthropic endeavor to improve the con - dition of the negro is made the subject of a sneer .

		Of course , being a skilful novelist , Mr.
Hough	PERSON	so shapes his story as to make a strong appeal for the enlistment of our sympathies in the cause for which he argues , and he has the further advantage of fixing his scene -LRB- although somewhat vaguely -RRB- in the reconstruction period , when negro domination threatened the very existence of civilization in many a Southern commonwealth .

		But for all that , his main position is untenable , by any other logic than that of the emotions , for it resolves itself into proclaiming that the powers of law may properly be set aside whenever , in the opinion of the white element of population , they do not operate to keep the negro in his place -- - the definition of that ' place ' being left unreservedly to the white man 's discretion .

		We approach a new detective story with many misgivings , because long experience has taught ua that their mysteries , when finally revealed , are both cheap and artificial , while many minor matters , introduced to whet the curiosity , are neglected altogether in the final edaircisse - ment .

		Of ' The
Marathon Mystery	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
Burton Stevenson	PERSON	, we may however say that the workmanship is exceedingly deft , and that in neither of the respects above mentioned is it open to serious criticism .

		The mystery is - no more artificial than need be , and the details of the plot all turn out to be important cog * in the mechanism .

		This story is distinctly better than ' The
Holladay Case	PERSON	, ' to which it is in some respects a sequel . '

		The Private Tutor , ' by Mr ,
Gamaliel Brad	PERSON	- ford , Jr. , is an amateurish production , without much to tell in the way of a story , but having some very pretty pages descriptive of Eome , where the action is laid , ' Glorified Baedeker or liare ' would do fairly well as a character - ization of these pages , which are the result of a sympathetic intimacy with the scenes described .

		The hero , if we may so style him , is a pleasant young fellow , an artist manque , whom fate has placed in charge of the graceless son of an American millionaire during a
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean trip .

		The father hopes that the boy will get culture , or character , or something of the sort from the tour , but the hope is manifestly vain .

		He turns out to be so mean , so vulgar .

		and so impossibly disgusting , that it is diffi - cult to take his figure seriously as a study of any conceivable kind of real humanity .

		In fact , the author exhibits no power of character - ization worth mentioning , either in this case or in .

		any other , and therein is the essential failure of his novel .

		This defect is hardly to be offset by style and observation , which qualities are in fair measure his .

		The trial here described was on an indictment alleging that

Union	ORGANIZATION	on account of the Embargo Acts , and to re-annex the

		The charge against Senator `` Web - ster , which became the ground of the ease against
Lyman	PERSON	, was printed in this , sheet ,
October 29 , 1828	DATE	.

		Twelve days later ,
Webster	PERSON	, through his counsel , presented the charge as a criminal libel to the
Gi-and Jury in the Supreme Judicial Court	ORGANIZATION	, and this body at once retui'ued an indictment .

		This indictment itself was an imusual document , being based on a principle of English Star-Cham - ber prosecutions never adopted as a part of the common law of the
United States	LOCATION	; and by em - ploying the method of a criminal prosecution rather than a civil action , Mr.
Webster	PERSON	clearly put his opponent at a sei'ious disadvantage .

		The trial , which began
December 16	DATE	, ai'oused greater jxjpular interest and called out a more brilliant display of legal oratorj ' than
Boston	LOCATION	had known in a generation .

		But the outcome was only that the jury failed to agree , and the case was con - tinued until the
March term , 1829	DATE	, whence it was continued again until the
November	DATE	teim .

		When
November	DATE	came , the Solicitor-General proclaimed that inasmuch as every resource had been ex - hausted at the ti-ial of the year before , public justice did not require that the case be tried a second time ; and it was therefore dismissed .

		* It is difficult to believe , ' says Mr.
Benton	PERSON	, ` that Mr.
Webster	PERSON	himself thought it necessary for his per - sonal or official vindication to institute this extraordinai-y prosecution .

		He was doubtless induced to do it only as a part of the bitter jK > litical contest then being waged between the friends of
Adams	PERSON	and of
Jackson	LOCATION	.

		The subse - quent conduct of Mr.
Lyman	PERSON	toward Mr.
Web	PERSON	- ster shows that he considered the case as really political and not personal on the pai ' t of Mr.
Webster	PERSON	.

		The trial for the time interrupted the previous intimate social relations between Web - ster and L \ - man , but in a year or two they became reconciled , and remained warm pereonal friends through life . '

		The histoi-y of the episode is well worked out by Mr.
Benton	PERSON	, and letters and other documentaiy materials are so skilfully employed in the text that the story almost tells itself from the records .

		jg ^ ^ .

		^ j. ^ , difficult matter .

		Although one of the oldest places in Roman history , it has been so long buried that it is one of the newest topographically , the last sis years having done more to uncover and explain its ancient monuments than all the eailier centuiies together had done before .

		So many have been the revela - tions of pick and spade during this time that the traveller returning after only a few years of absence feels himself quite a stranger in the once familiar spot .

		It seems , and is , much larger than as he remembers it , several modem encroachments -- a row of dwellings , a street-car track , a church , a convent , and a garden -- hav - ing been banished .

		Underaeath where they once stood are the remains of ancient basilicas , shrines , temples and tombs , beside one old cem - etery which clearly dates back before
Romulus	PERSON	, before the Forum itself , to the time when the Seven Hills were occupied by tribes of shepherds only .

		Official reports have been made of these things -LRB- in Italian -RRB- by the Director of
Excava	LOCATION	- tions ,
Commendatore Boni	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Hiilsen	PERSON	has published -LRB- in German -RRB- a large pamphlet which furnishes many technical details , measure - ments , and the like .

		But the average English or American traveller has very much needed a smaller work , of equal accuracy but more pop - ular and practicable , as a guide among these new-old stones and pillars and pavements .

		Such a book is now to be had in Mr.
St. Clair Bad	LOCATION	- deley 's ` Recent Discoveries in the Forum ,
1898	DATE	-
1901	DATE	' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has been in close touch with all the work as it went on , and fommately has seen fit to give us many inci - dents of the eventful days , and illustrations showing the scenes of transition .

		For example ^ the fi-ontispiece shows in the process of demoli - tion the shabby house which for yeai `` s had crowded the beautiful
Temple of Faustina	ORGANIZATION	and covered the spot under which was soon to be found the magnificent inscription and comer - stone of the ancient
Basilica Emilia	LOCATION	; another picture shows the section of the Sacra Via which had to be saciificed to reveal the tomb of Romulus .

		These are the things that being left uni'ecorded are sure to be soon forgotten , yet which everyone would wish to know .

		The book is interesting beyond the rule of guide-books ; the map is excellent , and the forty-five illustra - tions are well-chosen .

		One is puzzled , however , to find in a book about the Forum an accovmt of the recent discovery of the Altur of Peace in the
Campus Martins	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although interesting in itself , it has surely no right to a place in this , book , and chi a page whose caption is ` The Forum . '

		The Altar of Peace is one of the great memorials of the Augustan Age in

Winter Quarters	ORGANIZATION	' and ` The Garden that I Love , ' dexterouslj - spinning out sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph with a facile grace of composition , a deft intei-weaving of literary allusion and quota - tion , a ready succession of pleasing ideas , that can not but excite our admiration .


Italy	LOCATION	and things Italian -- a fertile theme -- are the principal topics discussed ; and well does the diarist know his
Rome	LOCATION	and his
Florence	LOCATION	.

		The closing chapter is written in ` The Garden that I Love ' -- the Poet 's home -- and is therefore laiglish in atmos - phere .

		The diarist 's manner is winsome , and it seems ungracious to damn his book with faint praise ; but not even tie most gifted of us , not 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, even a poet laureate , can always attain perfec - tion .

		Perhaps the less excellent books serve a purpose in accentuating the mei-its of the more excellent ; and if a writer fills one volume with harmless banalities , his readers may be impelled , if only by very weariness , to tiu'u for possible relief to some of his others .

		In short , there is nothing so inevitable and compelling about ` The Poet 's Diary ' as to warrant the assertion that its loss would eclipse the gaiety of nations or very greatly imj > overish the public stock of harmless pleasure .

		Changing one word of the Poet 's warn - ing to orators , we may say , ` The gift of diary - writing , like the gift of writing mellifluous poetry , is a sorry and dangerous one unless inspired , sustained and restrained by '' Reason in her most exalted mood . '' '

		Hall and entitled `
The Cincinnati Southern Railway	ORGANIZATION	: A History . '

		The account of the building of the road , coming as it does from several pens , is neither so clear nor concise as could be wished , but it appears that the need of a railway connecting
Cincinnati	LOCATION	with the South was felt with such poignancy as long - ago as
1836	DATE	that a mass meeting Avas held in the western metropolis of that day and a round mil - lion of dollars subscribed for the enterprise -- a huge sum for that time .

		Delay followed delay , the aid of the legislature was sought , and the enterprise was at last on its feet when the Civil War put in the background every consideration except the possibilities of a militaiy road .

		An - other seiTies of delays and disappointments fol - lowed the wai ' , but authorization was finally obtained , not only from the legislature of
Ohio	LOCATION	but from those of
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and in
1873	DATE	the actual construction of the road began with money lent by its trustees from their own pockets .

		In
July , 1877	DATE	, the first division of the road was opened for business .

		Many
millions of dollars	MONEY	were raised by the sale of bonds , and the present situation finds the road in possession of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	,
New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Company	ORGANIZATION	as lessee , the trustees of the
Cincinnati Southern	ORGANIZATION	holding the legal title in trust for the city of Cincimiati .

		The lease , which was for a period of twenty-five years , expires in
1906	DATE	, and the leasing and operating corporation is now paying about
$ 1,100,000	MONEY	a year for its use of the property .

		Whether or not a new lease will be made is a matter now open for discussion .

		The book is profusely illustrated with scenes along the road , portraits of officials and others , views of business houses in cities on the route , and similar material .

		Love affairs Readers of
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	's ` Rec - of a famous ords of a Girlhood ' will recall bachelor .

		sundry rather tantalizing refer - ences to certain interesting complications of a sen - timental nature , in which the artist Lawrence and Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	's two elder daughters ,
Sally	PERSON	and
Maria	LOCATION	, were involved .

		Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	, writing from l-emembrance based on hearsay , and years after the events , is not quite accurate in her state - ments ; and so perhaps it is well to have such a ' full and apparently trustworthy account of the matter as is now given in ` An Artist 's Love Story ' -LRB- Long-mans -RRB- , as told , with the help of some hitherto unpublished letters from the chief characters concerned , by Mr.
Oswald G. Knapp	PERSON	.

		That
Lawrence	PERSON	was an incorrigible flirt , and that the whole story of his successive entanglements and disentanglements with
Sally	PERSON	and
Maria	ORGANIZATION	is a paltry enough chronicle , can not be denied ; but the prominence of some of the actors in this little tragi-comedy , and the amiable qualities of the two beautiful and ill-fated sistei-s , give the affair a certain dignity and pathos .

		Both girls died early of consiunption , and the fascinating Tom Law - rence , after breaking no one knows how many hearts , himself died an old bachelor .

		Two i -RRB- or - traits that are printed of
Maria Siddons	PERSON	, as being both by
Lawrence	PERSON	, are remarkable for their entire lack of resemblance to each other .

		Other portraits , including the familiar
National Gallerj	ORGANIZATION	- painting of Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	by
Lawrence	PERSON	, are also given , and a few autographs in facsimile .

		An episode in `
Wadsworth	LOCATION	, or The Charter Oak , *
Connecticut	LOCATION	is the title of a book written and history .

		published by Mr.
William H. Gocher	PERSON	, of
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		It purports to give all that is ascertainable relating to the hiding of the colonial charter , in
1687	DATE	, in the famous oak tree at
Hartford	LOCATION	, -- an incident of which Captain
Joseph Wadsworth	PERSON	, according to doubtful tradition , was the hero .

		The motive of the deed , it will be remembered , was to keep the charter out of the hands of
Andros	LOCATION	, the newly appointed governor of all
New England	LOCATION	, who demanded its sun-ender in the
King	ORGANIZATION	's name .

		Mi - .

		Gocher has shown commendable antiquarian zeal in prosecuting his researches ; yet his readers will probably wish he had not chosen to weave fact and fiction into the same web in a book that pro- fesses to be history rather than a novel .

		Wads - worth himself is made to tell the story of the charter and its hiding , in language that is undis - guisedly hodiernal , and with many interpolations of matter remotely or not at all connected with the main theme .

		The chapters on the Royal Oak , on
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	, and on the Regicides , are of this irrelevant nature .

		The wording , and still more the spelling , of
Joseph Wadsworth	PERSON	's will , which is printed in full , are so strikingly in contrast with the modernity of his supposed narrative , that not the faintest touch of illusion can cling to the latter .

		But the author frankly indicates in his introduction the true nature of what is to follow .

		` By blending fact and fancy , ' he says , ` it is possible to weave a narrative which enter - tains and at the same time instructs the reader .

		Those who believe it can ; those who doubt it may ; -- so let it go at that . '

		There is reason to believe , as readers of the book would do well to bear in mind , that the original charter ^ was secreted , possibly in the oak tree of tradition , some time before
Andros	LOCATION	's arrival at
Hart	PERSON	- ford , and that a duplicate figured in the historic scene in the council chamber .

Connecticut	LOCATION	' may be consulted .

		Mr.
Gocher	PERSON	's work is lavishly illustrated from old prints , old portraits , and modem photographs , and is provided with numerous footnotes bearing evidence of painstaking research .

		■ In edition The appearance of each new de huce of volume from the Department of the ` GeorgicB . '

		Limited Editions at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	seizes to strengthen our conviction that Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	's work represents the highwater mark , so far as this country is concerned , in fine printing at the present time .

		The
Department	ORGANIZATION	is now installed in a building of its own , with its own special facilities in the way of material and workmen ; the printing will hereafter be done on hand presses , and from the type itself rather than from electrotype plates as heretofore .

		This is all as it should be , and that the new conditions will have a marked effect for good is evidenced by the latest volume from the Press , -- a reprint of the ` Geoi ^ es ' of
Virgil	PERSON	, in Mr.
J. W. Mac	PERSON	- kail 's fine translation .

		The book is octavo in size , printed on handmade paper from a font of old - style italics , with the antique ` swash ' capitals , and is bound in decorated board covers with vel - lum back .

		A charming outline drawing , of classic flavor , is printed in brown at the beginning of each of the four books , there is a graceful panel design for the title-page , and each paragraph has a small decorative initial .

		But the decorative features are here , as in all the Riverside Press books , entirely subordinate to the typ -LRB- ^ aphy ; unlike most of the others who are attempting to do what he has done , Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	has no need to employ garish decoration as a means of diverting attention from crudities of workmanship .

		The marked distinction of his work is the result of an observance of sound typ < ^ raphical principles , combined with a certain amoimt of conservative individual initiative , and an intelligent sense of artistic fitness .

		The ` Georgics ' may be regarded as one of his most successful efforts .

		The story In ` The Story of
Wireless Teleg	ORGANIZATION	- of Wireless raphy ' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , Mr.
A. T. Story Telegraphy	PERSON	.

		j ^ g ^ presented a subject of great and growing imj > ortance in such a manner that the reader without technical knowledge can fol - low the narrative from beginning to end , and at the close emerge from his reading with a fair conception of what has been accomplished even on the technical side .

		The steps leading to Sig - nor
Marconi	ORGANIZATION	's reduction to practice of the knowl - edge existing before him are detailed , but with the emphasis still left upon the condition of the art today .

		It is curious to note that Pro- fessor
Morse	PERSON	himself was successful in using nm - ning water as a conductor for a telegraphic cur - rent in experiments going back to
1842	DATE	.

		The share of Americans generally in the investiga - tions leading to the present triumphs is made quite clear , and the book closes with an accoxmt of Professor
Fessenden	PERSON	's apparatus .

		There are numerous illustrations , whereby the method of operation may be learned , and there is a satis - faetnrv index .

		A new book Lad -RCB- ' Aug ^ ta Gregory continues of iriah legends her efforts for the p -RRB- opularization and folk-lore .

		^ f i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ legends with a second vol - ume , ` Gods and Fighting Men : The Story of the
Tuatha de Danaan	ORGANIZATION	and of the Fianna of Ire - land ' -LRB- imported by Seribner -RRB- .

		The volume is a companion to ` Cuchulain of Muirthemne , ' which it resembles in style and treatment .

		From the most miscellaneous sources , some written but more oral .

		Lady
Gregory	PERSON	has collected fragments of ancient tales of the gods and demigods , piecing them together into a mosaic wherein the joints are skDfully concealed , and telling them in the sort of English used by the Irish peasantry , with quaint idioms of the Erse literally translated and a general air of exoticism which is most allur - ing .

		Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	has written an introduction for the book , and Lady
Gregory	PERSON	pre - pares a series of appendices which are valuable to the beginner , -- one of them particularly so , for it tells how to pronounce the proper names run - ning through the narrative .

		Physically , the book is a handsome one , with a cover design of more than usual merit .

		Notes .

		An informal review , by Prof.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's
Life of Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	will be publiahed immediately by the
A. Weasels Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Natural His - tory is the subject of the new volume , and Mr ,
Champlin	PERSON	has been assisted in its preparation by Mr.
Frederic A. Lucas	PERSON	.

		Two important additions have just been made to the
Columbia University ` Studies in History	ORGANIZATION	, Economics , and Public Law . '

		They are ` Pre-Mal - thusian Doctrines of Population , ' by Dr.
Charles Emil Stangeland	PERSON	, and ` History and Criticism of the
Labor Theory of Value	ORGANIZATION	in English Political Economy , ' by Dr.
Albert C. Whitaker	PERSON	.

		` The

		The leading article in the
January	DATE	issue is devoted to a description , by Mr.
A. H. Smith	PERSON	, of the sculpture at

		A volume on
Samuel de Champlain	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Nar	PERSON	- cisse E ,
Dionne	PERSON	, will be added this month to the ` Makers of
Canada	LOCATION	' series , published by
Messrs. Morang & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Toronto	LOCATION	.

		This series of biographies , in many ways the most important publishing enter - prise yet undertaken in
Canada	LOCATION	, will be complete in twenty volumes , six of which have now appeared .

		In response to a demand from members of various university faculties , the Messrs , Harpers are pre - paring a special `
University Edition	ORGANIZATION	' of their important twenty-eight volume history , ` The Amer - ican Nation , ' five volumes of which have so far appeared .

		This edition will contain exactly the same text , but will be issued in simpler and more suitable form for college use .

		From
Herr J. C. Heinriehs	PERSON	,
Leipzig	LOCATION	-LRB- imported by
Stechert	PERSON	-RRB- , we have ` The Songs of an Egyptian Peasant , ' as collected and translated into German by
Herr Heinrich Schaef	PERSON	er , and from German into English by Miss
Frances Hart	PERSON	Breasted .

		The orig - inal text of the songs , an Egyptian dialect of Arabic , is given with the translation , and the book is charm - ingly illustrated .

		A memorial to the poet
Edward Eowland Sill	ORGANIZATION	has recently been unveiled at
Oakland	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	.

		It is in the form of a bronze sun-dial , mounted on a granite base , and is the gift of three classes of the
Oakland High School	ORGANIZATION	, where Sill was a teacher for a short time .

		The publishers of
Sill	ORGANIZATION	's works ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have for some time past held out promises of a complete edition of his poems in a single convenient volume .

		It is to be hoped on all accounts that such an edition may be given us , Mr.
W	PERSON	,
D. Moffat	PERSON	and Mr , Eobert S , Yard , both of whom for several years past have occupied prom - inent positions in the house of Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , have now gone into publishing on their own account , under the corporate title of
Moffat , Yard & Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		They have also formed a business alliance with the publishers of ` Town and Country , ' in which periodical they have acquired an interest .

		The reprint of the Baron de Lahontan 's ' New Voyages to
North America	LOCATION	, ' which
Messrs , MeClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have had in preparation for some time past , is now definitely announced for publication this month .

		In many ways this will form the most attractive work in Messrs.
McClurg	PERSON	's series of Americana reprints ; for , in addition to its historical value , the narrative of this gay soldier of fortune possesses an intrinsic charm and interest altogether lacking in the relations of his austerer fellow-ex - plorers of the late seventeenth century .

		The edition is in two octavo volumes , with introduction , notes , and index by Dr. E ^ uben Gold
Thwaites	PERSON	.

		From the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	we have just received two publications of exceptional importance .

		One of them is a reprint of
Justin Winsor	PERSON	's mono - graph on ` The
Kohl Collection of Maps	ORGANIZATION	relating to
America	LOCATION	, ' first published by
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	in
1886	DATE	.

		The collection which it concerns has recently been transferred from the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	to the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The other pub - lication is Volume I. of the ` Journal of the Con - tinental
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, ' now to be for the first time printed in full .

		It is expected that this work will occupy about fifteen volumes , and that the publi - cation will require several years .

		It is edited by Mr.
Worthington C. Ford	PERSON	, and has numerous illus - trations in facsimile .

		* Who is this Scotch cur at
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's heels ? '

		asked some one .

		* He is not a cur / replied
Goldsmith	PERSON	; ` he is only a bur .


Tom Davies	PERSON	flung him at
Johnson	PERSON	in sport , and he has the faculty of sticking . '

		It has been the fashion , even among
John	PERSON	- son 's warmest admirers , to belittle and ridicule the man to whose unique achievement in pen - portraiture that very admiration owes its being .

		Macaulay , in a paragraph that exhausts the vocabulary of contempt , calls him ' one of the smallest men that ever lived ' and ' a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect ' -- just after he has extolled the small man 's book as so far superior to all others of its class as to have no second .

		Indeed , according to
Macaulay	PERSON	-LRB- the dictum is now a household word -RRB- it was pre - cisely because
Boswell	PERSON	was such a fool that he was so good a biographer .

		The absurdity of this extreme view of the case is too patent to call for comment , not to speak of the utter unlikelihood that a man of
Johnson	PERSON	's vigorous understanding and sturdy self-respect would have not merely tolerated , but ^ tually enter - tained a warm affection for , a p ^ HlVa so devoid of all claim to his esteem .

		With the master himself we may laugh at the comicalities of his disciple , but it would be taking an unfair advantage of the man 's frank portrayal of his own absurdities to deny him any higher qualities than flatulent conceit and abject sycophancy .

		Let us , if we choose , credit all that has been said of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's delightfully naive exhibition of his own idiosyncrasies .

		Miss Bumey has described his worshipful attention whenever the great Doctor began to speak .

		At such times
Boswell	PERSON	so concentrated his entire thought and energy upon his idol that he would not even answer questions from others .

		His eyes goggled with eagerness , his listening ear almost touched the Doctor 's shoulder , his mouth fell ajar as if to drink in every slightest syllable , and .

		he ap - peared to listen to the great man 's very breath - ings as if they had some mystical meaning .

		He took every opportunity to edge himself close to
Johnson	PERSON	's side , even at table , and was some - times ordered imperiously back to his place like a faithful but obtrusive spaniel .

		In his desire to form his mind after the Johnsonian model , he went so far at times as to out -
Johnson	PERSON	the original .

		His assumption of a more than
John	PERSON	- sonian contempt for women is indicated in a replv to Mrs.
Knowles	PERSON	, the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, who had expressed a hope that the sex ^ would be equal 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, in another world . '

		That is too ambitious / he said . '

		We might as well desire to be equal with the angels . '

		Even the Johnsonese idiom he suc - ceeded to some extent in making his own .

		When a distinction was drawn between moral and physical necessity ,
Boswell	PERSON	thus expounded the matter , -- ' Alas , sir , they come both to the same thing .

		You may be as hard bound by chains when covered by leather as when the iron ap - pears . '

		It was an odd freak of his that once made him refrain from writing to Jobnson for a long time , to see whether his correspondent would finally be induced to write first .

		The older man grew uneasy at this strange silence , though he shrewdly suspected its cause , and upon
Boswell	PERSON	's confession gave him a piece of his mind .

		* Remember that all tricks are knav - ish or childish , and that it is as foolish to make experiments upon the constancy of a friend as upon the chastity of a wife . '

		A comical aping of his master 's exemplary morality reveals itself now and then .

		Wliile suffering grievous prick - ings of conscience for what he admits to have l -RRB- een highly reprehensible conduct , he allays the smart by summoning up pictures of his future blameless deportment .

		Viewing himself as already reformed for the rest of his days , he glows mth prospective virtue and thus rhap - sodizes in a letter to his friend
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, who had sent him a bit of excellent advice , -- ' My warm imagination looks forward with great com - placency on the sobriety , the healthfulness , and worth of my future life . '

		The pious platitudes that sprinkle his pages are highly amusing , and so is his frank record of
Johnson	PERSON	's whole - some advice that he should ' clear his mind of cant . '

		Eecognizing all that is laughable and all that is indicative of weakness and vanity in such revelations as the foregoing , we may yet find much that is admirable in
Boswell	PERSON	both as a man and as a writer , both as a faitliful friend and as a keen observer .

		However often he may have disregarded , merely from excess of animal spirits , the apostolic injunction to give no offense , he certainly showed an exemplary un - willingness to take offense .

		The harsh rebuffs he received from
Johnson	PERSON	dt the very outset would have alienated a man possessed of that smallness of mind and that petty vanity so generally ascribed to our undaunted biographer .

		Drawn like iron to the magnet , he was stoutly determined not to mind a rude repulse of his first awkward overtures .

		It was at
Davies	ORGANIZATION	's lx -RRB- okshop , a place thenceforth sanctified to Bos - well , that the two first met .

		Davies announced the great man 's ' aweful approach , ' and
Boswell	PERSON	nerved himself for the ordeal .

		An unfortunate apology for his Scotch birth brought him snub number one .

		Then , when
Johnson	PERSON	had com - plained to
Davies of Garrick	ORGANIZATION	's refusing him an order to the theatre for old
Miss Williams	ORGANIZATION	, Bos - well , watching for a chance to join in the con - Acrsation , exclaimed , ' Oh , sir , I can not think Mr.
Garrick	PERSON	would grudge such a trifle to you . ' '

		Sir , ' replied the other , with a stern look , ' I have known
David Garrick	PERSON	longer than you have done , and I know no right you have to talk with me on the subject . '

		But in a day or two
Boswell	PERSON	was on friendly terms with
John	PERSON	- son . '

		Poh , poh ! '

		said the Doctor , with a com - placent smile , on being reminded of what had passed at the first meeting , ' never mind these things .

		Come to me as often as you can .

		I shall be glad to see you . '

		Balm to his wounded vanity it was not in
Boswell	PERSON	's nature to refuse , although , after one especially outrageous affront , we find him protesting , in terms that won the masters admiration for their happy picturesque - ness , ' I do n't care how often or how high
John	PERSON	- son tosses me when only friends are present , for then I fall on soft ground ; but I do not like falling on stones , which is the case when enemies are present . '

		The Doctor 's commenda - tion of this image sufficed to atone for the rude - ness that had evoked it ; and though he allowed himself to toss and gore his follower , he in - sisted that others should treat him well .

		It was
Johnson	PERSON	's command that effected the Scotch - man 's election to the
Club	ORGANIZATION	, the dictator having made it known that until
Boswell	PERSON	was admitted no other new member should be added .


Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, in his admirable life of
John	PERSON	- son , long ago pointed out some of the qualities tliat made
Boswell	PERSON	• ' a prince of interviewers ' before the interviewer as we know him was so much as dreamt of .

		A few of these personal traits it may be not unprofitable or uninterest - ing to recall . '

		Perhaps , ' says
Stephen	PERSON	, ' the fundamental quality in
Boswell	PERSON	's character was his intense capacity for enjoyment .

		He was , as Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	puts it , '' gluttonously fond of what - ever would yield him a little solacement , were it only of a stomachic character . '' '

		Like his idol , he frankly enjoyed the pleasures of the table . '

		For my part , ' was
Johnson	PERSON	's declara - tion , ' I mind my belly very studiously and very carefully : for I look upon it that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else . '

		In somewhat the same vein
Boswell	PERSON	ac - knowledges , ' I am myself a lover of wine , and therefore curious to hear whatever is remarkable concerning drinking ' ; and he was always de - lighted when he could induce
Johnson	PERSON	to discuss the matter ethically , statistically , and phil - osophically .

		Now it is this curiosity that seems to me the ' fundamental quality ' of Bogwell the biographer .

		It was a prime essential to the production of his marvellously ' speaking ' like - ness of the master . '

		A generous and elevated a905 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		143 mind , ' he quotes from the oracle , ' is distin - guished by nothing more certainly than an emi - nent degree of curiosity , ' -- a sentiment , it may l -RRB- e noted , that reappears in various form in the pages of the ' Kambler . '

		We are , then , to credit our much-ridiculed
Boswell	PERSON	with a hvmger of the mind corresponding to his less praiseworthy animal appetite .

		It was an insatiable curiosity , often degenerating into a childish inquisitive - ness , and at times it provoked its chief object to an impatient outburst of protest . '

		I will not he baited with what and why , ' * exclaimed poor
Johnson	PERSON	one day in desperation . '

		Why is a c-ow 's tail long ?

		Why is a fox 's tail bushy ? '

		The following , also , must have been called forth after the master had been badgered beyond ^ endurance by his affectionate disciple , -- ' ^ ly regard for you is greater almost than I have words to express ; but I do not choose to be always repeating it .

		Write it down in the first leaf of your pocket-book , and never doubt it again . '

		At another time , when
Boswell	PERSON	was cross-examining a third person about
Johnson	PERSON	in his presence , -- ' Sir , ' he cried , in petulant remonstrance , * ' you have but two subjects , your - self and me .

		I am sick of both . '

		But
Boswell	PERSON	was irrepressible .

		Once when the two were • querying how best to induce a friend to leave
London	LOCATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	said in revenge for some pre - vious offense , ' Xay , sir .

		we 'll send you to him .

		If your presence does n't drive a man out of his house , nothing Avill . '

		Yet the '' unspeakable
Scot	PERSON	' stuck to his victim like a leech , and continued to pry into the minutest details of the great man 's habits and peculiarities , even pushing his investigations as far as the subject of nightcaps and begging to know why his idol never wore one .

		It seems to have been a subject of absorbing interest to him .

		He also noted , with painstaking accuracy , that though
John	PERSON	- son abstained from milk one fast-day , he did not reject it when put into his cup .

		The lex - icographers whistlings and puffings , and his way of saying ' too-too-too , ' were all conscien - tiously recorded ; and on one memorable occa - sion persistence surpassed itself and won a bet by hazarding the inquiry of
Johnson	PERSON	what he did with certain scraped bits of orange-peel that lie had been observed to treasure up for purposes unknown .

		Curiosity in this instance was not gratified , but it certainly was c-arried to an extent that would have made its possessor inval - uable to the modern newspaper as an inter - viewer .

		To be sure , there is much that is unattractive in this eagerness for information , in season and out of season ; but it was accompanied by such innocence of offense , such unfeigned good - humor , and , above all , has resulted so greatly to the advantage of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's readers , that it would be ungrateful and unfair to censure him too severely .


Burke	PERSON	paid his amiable qualities a curious compliment when he said of him that he had so much good-humor naturally it was scarcely a virtue .

		Most vain persons are vain of fancied endowments :
Boswell	PERSON	takes innocent deUght in his real peculiarities , and thinks him - self so charming an object as to need no dis - guise .

		There is no false shame , no pompous regard for imagined dignity , but as cheerful a readiness to join in a laugh at himself as at his neighbor .

		Though the joke be at his own expense , it is none the less worth relating . '

		I owned to
Johnson	PERSON	, * he tells us , in a frank dis - cussion of his own foibles , ' that I was occa - sionally troubled with a fit of narrowness . ' '

		Why , sir , ' was the reply , ' so am I .

		But I do not tell it . '

		The excellence of the implied advice , we may gratefully note , was lost on our amusing Bozzy .

		Other pleasantries of this sort are easily turned up in
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's pages .

		Music , he once confided to Jolmson , affected him in - tensely , producing ' alternate sensations of pathetic dejection , so that I was ready to shed tears , and of daring resolution so that I was inclined to rush into the tliickest of the battle , ' -- a battle , of course , that was purely hvpothet - ical . '

		Sir , ' replied the other , ' I should never hear it , if it made me such a fool . '

		On another occasion
Boswell	PERSON	expressed a wish to fly to the woods or retire into a desert , a disposition promptly checked by one of
Johnson	PERSON	's custom - ary gibes at the considerable extent of easily accessible desert in
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		According to
Johnson	PERSON	,
Boswell	PERSON	was ' the best travelling companion in the world . '

		Imperturb - able good-humor and an unfailing ingenuity and resourcefulness in making talk -- and con - versation was to
Johnson	PERSON	the worthiest occupa - tion of a rational being -- combined to make the lively Scotchman a \ er \ acceptable comrade for the older maiL * If , sir , you were shut up in a castle and a new-born baby with you , what would you do ? '

		was one of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's silence - breakers -- ludicrous and well-night witless , no doubt , but still welcome to one whose greatest horror was the undisturbed companionship of his own thoughts .

		Any remark , however trivial , any expedient however absurd , was justifiable if it could but serve to draw
Johnson	PERSON	out ; and it is with something of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's art that our biographer has contrived to make his hero paint his own portrait .

		In his report of othere ' conversation
Boswell	PERSON	never misses the point of a story , but never thrusts it on our notice .

		The gist of one dialogue after another is deftly noted , and there are few irrelevances in his rapidly moving narrative .

		Just the stroke needed to indicate character or to make clear a possible obscurity is adroitly put in , and we 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, pass to something else .

		The story is so naturally told that we almost imagine it to ha.ve told itself , the writer serving as little more than a phono - graph to be spoken into by his various charac - ters .

		It is the art that conceals art .

		If any one questions this , let him , as
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	sug - gests , try to put into writing , within the same compass , the pith of a brilliant conversation .

		Not only the humble offices of memory , but the higher qualities of artistic selection and repre - sentation went into those paragraphs of club talk and coffee-house discussion .

		Those who regard the chronicler of these conversations as nothing but a toady , an echo , a blind worshipper of his idol , should read again what he says of
Johnson	PERSON	's anonymous pamphlet , written at the request of the government from which he re - ceived his pension , on * Taxation no Tyranny ; an Answer to the Eesolutions and Address of the
American Congress	ORGANIZATION	. '

		* Of this perform - ance , ' declares the biographer , ' I avoided to talk with him ; for I had now formed a clear and settled opinion , that the people of
America	LOCATION	were well warranted to resist a claim that their fel - low-subjects in the mother-country should have the entire command of their fortunes , by taxing them without their own consent ... Pos - itive assertion , sarcastical severity , and extrava - gant ridicule , which he himself reprobated as a test of truth , were united in this rhapsody . '


Boswell	PERSON	was the first biographer in his kind , and he remains so far the greatest that , as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	says , no one has yet successfully com - peted for second place .

		But for him , moreover , it is possible that we might never have had , in anything like their present form , such works as
Lockhart	PERSON	's
Scott	PERSON	, and
Trevelyan	PERSON	's Macaulay , and
Fronde	ORGANIZATION	's elaborate though not wholly judi - cious attempt to picture the prophet of
Cheyne Eow	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not merely a remarkable degree of self - subordination , but also a stanch adherence to truth , regardless of remonstrances , went to the production of our great biography . '

		I will not make my tiger a cat to please anybody , ' declared
Boswell	PERSON	when
Hannah More	PERSON	entreated him to soften some of the burly Doctor 's asperities .

		Toning down , he instinctively felt , would depress the lights as well as the shadows .

		We should not be so deeply affected by
Johnson	PERSON	's kinder qualities did we not see them often masked by an irritability that meant only a manly nature 's unwillingness to reveal the underlying tenderness of heart .

		And all this we owe to one who , in writing his life of the master , counted it time well spent * to run half over
London	LOCATION	in order to fix a date correctly ' ; one who , in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's words , * out of the fifteen millions that then lived ahd had bed and board in the British islands ... has provided us with a greater pleasure than any other individ - ual at whose cost we now enjoy ourselves , per - haps has done us a greater service than can be specially attributed to more than two or three .

Florence	LOCATION	` the peasants have lutes in their hands , and the pastoral songs of
Ariosto	PERSON	on their lips , ' What Montaigne wrote -LRB- he was then writing in Italian -RRB- was that he was struck with three things : one being ' di veder questi eontadini il liuto in mano , e fin alle pastorelle -LSB- the shep - herdesses -RSB- 1 ` Ariosto in bocco . '

		There are no ` pastoral songs ' ascribed to
Ariosto	PERSON	.

		The other error is more difficult to clear away .

		Montaigne says : ` Les instrumans sont en toutes les boutiques jusques aus ravaudurs des carre - fours des rues . '

		Mr. Waters translates these words as follows : * There is a musical instrument in every shop , even in the stocking-darner 's at the comer of the street . '

		It is hardly conceiv - able that Montaigne wrote of ` shops ' of the stock - ing-darners , and described such shops as being at ` the corners of streets . '

		` Eavaudeur ' has other meanings beside that of mender of clothes or darner of stockings .

		Nicot , in his Dictionary , after defining it by ' Sarcinator , ' adds : ` Et par metaphore Ravaudeur est dit celuy qui ne s § ait ce qu ' il die , le propos duquel est tout rappetasse , et celuy qui ne fait rien a droict ni a propos . '

		And Cotgrave essentially translates this by , ' A Botcher ; also an idle or ignorant speaker , one that either confounds or imderstands not what he says ; or one that neither does nor says ought rightly . '

		In this , or in a kindred sense , Montaigne seems to use the word in his essay ` De la Phisionomie ' : ' Sans peine et sans suffisance , ayant mille volumes de livres autour de moy ... j ' emprunteray presentement s ` il me plaist , d'une douzaine de tels ravaudeurs , gens que je ne f euillette guiere , dequoy enrichir le traicte de la Phisionomie . '

		It is in this sense , which continued in use in the next century , and is defined by Littre as ` Celui qui ne dit que des balivemes , ' that the word in
Montaigne	LOCATION	's journal is perhaps to be interpreted , and the passage -- which follows a notice of ` improvisatori ' -- may be translated : ` Instruments are in all the shops and even -LSB- in the hands of -RSB- the idle talkers at the street cor - ners . '

		But if the simple significance of darners be pre - ferred , we may be reminded of the ` old and plain * song of ` the spinsters and the knitters in the sun . '

		Memorials of ax Exolish Patnter .

		* A life of Sir
Edward Buxne-Jones	PERSON	, written by his widow , bids fair , on theoretical grounds , to be a performance of doubtful value .

		The Pre-Eaphaelite painters have already been thor - oughly exploited by skilful hands .

		The career of either EosseHi or
Morris	ORGANIZATION	furnishes a far more dramatic point of deparinire than the less eccen - tric and less varied one of Bume-Jones .

		There is , too , the danger of sentimentality and of rhapsodical criticism , as well as of more dis - agreeable disclosures about Ex > ssetti , and more irritation over KusMn 's peculiar methods of making and unmaking friendships .

		On the other hand , we may expect from Lady Bume - Jones intimate knowledge and sympathetic understanding , which , if good judgment and skilful manipulation are added , should produce a delightful memorial of a fascinating coterie .

		It is only fair to Lady Bume-Jones to say at once that she has avoided every pitfall that lay along her path , and has made the most of every pleasure that the excursion afforded .

		She has transcribed all the joy of living and work - ing , the buoyant enthusiasm , and the vivid , many-sided interest in men and things , which were characteristic of her husband and his friends .

		She has been reserved where reserve was desirable ; and her pari ; iality for her sub - ject has never led her into bathos .

		As for the little touch of affectation in the account of her first acquaintance with her husband and the early days of their marriage , it only adds a bit of quaintness to the narrative .

		She thoroughly appreciates the vivacity and color of her hus - band 's conversation and letters , and uses his notes and correspondence , and those of his old acquaintances , to brighten and vivify her own by no means impleasing style .

		So one 's doubts are speedily dissipated , and supplanted by thor - ough enjoyment of a remarkable piece of biog - raphy .

		The memorial is in two copiously-illustrated volumes , of which the first contains at once the best and the worst of Lady Bume-Jones 's work .

		The account of Bume-Jones 's family , and of his childhood and school-life , is too long .

		It has the interest that belongs to any close study of alert , open-minded boyhood ; further than that it is commonplace , and a large part of the space accorded to it could have been spent to better advantage on later and more unique experiences .

		challenge to life to show forth the best that is in it , their fine achievements of friendship with men and books , -- once Lady Bume-Jones begins upon
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, the reader 's interest is quickened .

		And it never wanes until the second volume is finished ; although the later years , crowded with vast undertakings and pan - oramic with famous personages , lack the special charm of the earlier days .

		Then
Ruskin	PERSON	was a god to be worshipped from afar , Bossetti a giant ,
Morris	PERSON	a hero , the world a place to sketch in , and a sketch the absorbing work of a life - time .

		At
Oxford Bume-Jones	ORGANIZATION	saw much of a tal - ented set of Pembroke college men from his home town of
Birmingham	LOCATION	, but his sun rose and set by
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Both men came to the university with the definite purpose of enter - ing the church .

		Both were bitterly disap - pointed in the religious life of their collie and the state of the episcopacy .

		Both loved art and poetry , and together they discovered the * Morte d'
Arthur	PERSON	, ' fell under the spell of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's mys - ticism , dabbled in mesmerism and church polemics , and read
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Eangsley	LOCATION	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, and above all Euskin .

		One morning
Morris	PERSON	brought
Ruskin	PERSON	's newly - published *
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Lectures ' to Bume -
Jones	PERSON	's rooms , and .

		then , to quote from the lat - ter , ` Everything was put aside until he read it all through to me .

		And there we first saw about the Pre-E ^ phaeUtes , and there I first saw the name of
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		So for many a day after that we talked of little else but paintings which we had never seen , and saddened the Uves of our Pembroke friends .

		* Shortly afterwards , some of the work of MiUais was shown at
Oxford	LOCATION	, * and then , ' Bume -
Jones	PERSON	says , * we knew . '

		During his first years at the university he had cherished the notion of forming a clerical Brotherhood , composed of himself ,
Morris	PERSON	, and the Pembroke set , which should live and work in the heart of the
London	LOCATION	slums .

		But when he decided that painting was his destined career , and
Morris	PERSON	made choice of architecture , the idea of the Brotherhood was gradually abandoned ; or rather it was modified , taking shape in such projects as the joint editorship of the * Oxford and
Cambridge Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, ' and later in the partnership decorat - ing of the walls of the
Oxford Union	ORGANIZATION	, or in the firm of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	,
Marshall , Faulkner and Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		And its mission was not to save men 's souls , but to mend their minds , by giving them new ideals of truth and beauty .

		In
1855	DATE	both
Morris	PERSON	and Bume-Jones left
Oxford	LOCATION	, the latter without waiting to get his degree .

		The next year -LRB- 1856 -RRB- Lady Bume - Jones styles ` Annus Mirabilis . '

		Early in its course came the beginning of acquaintance with 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	,
Buskin	PERSON	.

		Tliis is
Burne-Jones	PERSON	's account , con - tained in a note to a friend : ` I 'm not Ted any longer , I 'm not
E. C. B. Jones	PERSON	now -- I 've dropped my personality -- I 'm a corre - spondent with
BUSKIN	PERSON	, and my future title is `` the man who wrote to
Buskin	PERSON	and got an answer by return . ''

		I can better draw my feelings than describe them , and better symbolize them than either . '

		And below is a drawing of himself prostrate before an aureoled figure intended for
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		A little later came the meeting with
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Wishing to know how the man looked who had drawn the ' Maids of Elfenmere ' and written ' The Blessed Damozel , '
Burne-Jones	PERSON	went to a lecture at the Working Men 's College , and by the good-fellowship prevailing there secured not only the sight he coveted , but an introduction also , and following that an invitation to Eos - setti 's studio by Blackfriars Bridge .

		Writing to a friend shortly after this visit ,
Rossetti	PERSON	s -RSB- > eaks of ' a certain youthful
Jones	PERSON	, one of the nicest young fellows in --
Dreamland	LOCATION	. '

		His liking rapidly ripened into intimacy .

		Morris and
Burne-Jones	PERSON	drew and painted and watched the master paint in
Rossetti	PERSON	's studio , and went with him to see the Brownings , and the
Prin	PERSON	- seps of
Little Holland House	ORGANIZATION	, with whom
Watts	PERSON	was then living , and frequently to the theatre .

		But if the play did not suit
Rossetti	PERSON	, they were dragged summarily away , ' which through wor - ship of him we always assented to obediently , though much wanting to know how the story ended .

		And sometimes we roamed the streets and sometimes went back to Blackfriars to
Gabriel	PERSON	's rooms and sat till three or four in the
morning	TIME	, reading and talking . '

		Rossetti was very encouraging about
Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	's work .

		After having seen his drawings , he refused to allow the younger artist to spend his time in learning the mechanical art of wood - engraving ; and he insisted that
Morris	PERSON	also should abandon architecture and take up paint - ing , as the best medium for expressing the poetry he had in him .

		Poetry ,
Rossetti	PERSON	declared , had almost run its course in
England	LOCATION	, but paint - ing was still an unknown art there , and the next
Keats	PERSON	ought to be a painter .

		So
Morris	PERSON	painted , but his versatile genius also turned to wood-caiTing , and it was at this time too that he l ^ egan designing furniture .

		When the two friends moved into their famous apartment at
Red Lion Square	LOCATION	, the chairs and tables were made after
Morris	PERSON	's designs , and painted by him and
Burne-Jones	PERSON	and
Rossetti	PERSON	with knights and ladies from jVIalory -- ' perfect marvels , ' Burne-Jones calls them .

		Some
four years later	DATE	the Morrises moved into
Red House	ORGANIZATION	, and it was from the necessity of furnishing and decorating this house , and the impossibility of buying any furniture or hangings that
Morris	PERSON	could endviTC to live with , that the idea of a manufactory of all things needed in household decoration took its rise .

		By the end of
1856	DATE
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	had become a l > atron and a dear friend . '

		Today we are to go - and see
Ruskin	PERSON	, '
Burne-Jones	PERSON	writes to
Miss Sampson	PERSON	, his father 's housekeeper .

		And after their return he goes on : ` Just come back from being with our hero for four hours -- so happy we 've been : he is so kind to - ns , calls us his dear boys and makes us feel like such old friends .

		Tonight he comes down to our rooms to carry off my drawing and show it to lots of people ; tomorrow night he comes again , and every
Thursday	DATE	night the same -- isn ' t that like a dream ?

		Think of knowing
Buskin	PERSON	like an equal and being called his dear boys .

		Oh !

		he is so good and kind -- better than his books , which are the best books in the world . '

		The painting of the walls of the
Oxford Union	ORGANIZATION	was
Rossetti	PERSON	's project .

		In it he enlisted Burne-Jones ,
Morris	PERSON	,
Arthur Hughes	PERSON	,
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Munro	PERSON	, the sculptor ,
Valentine Prinsep	PERSON	, who was studying with
Watts	PERSON	, and half a dozen others , each of whom promptly abandoned what - ever he was doing and went down to
Oxford	LOCATION	, because their adored
Rossetti	PERSON	wished it .

		Mr. .

		Prinsep gives a very vivid account of dining
Avith Rossetti	PERSON	on the evening of his arrival .

		` There I found Bossetti in a plum-coloured frock - coat , and a short , square man with spectacles and a vast mop of dark hair .

		I was cordially received .

		`` Top , '' cried
Bossetti	PERSON	, `` let me introduce Val Prinsep . ''

		-LRB-
Topsy	ORGANIZATION	was the name by which
Morris	PERSON	-- ' ' that unnaturally and unnecessarily curly being '' -- wasi known among his intimates . -RRB- ' ' '

		Glad , I 'm sure , ' ' answered the man in spec - tacles , nodding his head , and then he resumed his reading of a large quarto .

		This was
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Soon after , the door opened , and before it was half opened in glided Burne-Jones .

		`` Ned , '' said
Bossetti	PERSON	, who had been absently humming to himself , `` I think you know Prinsep . ''

		The shy figure darted forv ^ ard , the shy face lit up , and I was received with the kindly effusion which was - natural to him .

		` When dinner was over ,
Bossetti	LOCATION	, humming to himself , as was his wont , rose from the table and proceeded to curl himself up on the sofa .

		`` Top , '' '' he said , `` read us one of your grinds . ''

		`` No , .

		Gabriel , '' answered
Morris	PERSON	, `` you have heard them all . ''

		`` Never mind , '' said
Bossetti	PERSON	, `` here 's Prinsep , who has never heard them , and besides , , they are devilish good . ''

		`` Very well , old chap , '' growled
Morris	PERSON	, and having got his book he began to read in a sing-song chant some of the poems afterwards published in his first volume ... To -
this day	DATE	, forty years after , I can still recall the scene : Bossetti on the sofa , with large , melancholy eyes fixed on
Morris	PERSON	, the poet at the table reading and ever fidgetting with his watch-chain , and
Burne-Jones	PERSON	working at a pen-and-ink drawing . '

		`` Gold on her head and gold on her feet .

		And gold where the hems of her kirtle meet .

		And a golden girdle round my sweet , All I qu'elle est belle La Marguerite , '' still seems to haunt me .

		... I confess I returned to the Mitre with my brain in a whirl . '

		In later years a great wall of melancholy surrounded
Rossetti	PERSON	and shut him away from liis friends , but they never lost their admifa -

		As time went on Eugkin also dropped away ; but ^ lorris nerer failed , and other friends came in to fill the vacant places , -- the Glad - stones , Du Maurier .

		Lady
Leighton	PERSON	,
Charles Eliot Xorton	PERSON	and his family , and many more , besides the host of young artists to whom Bm-ne - Jones never refused his advice and sympathy .

		And the pictures went on in never-ending suc - cession .

		So , while the later years have less brilliancy and enthusiasm than the earlier ones , they are happy , ambitious , full of work and new hopes and new interests .

		As
Burne-Jones	PERSON	's personality strengthened and he became more and more the centre of his own world , instead of
Boesetti	ORGANIZATION	's satellite or
Morris	PERSON	's friend , the stream of the biography narrows and deepens , to show more of his character and of his per - sonal aims and methods of work .

		Undoubtedly the most valuable thing about Lady Bume-Jones 's work is the pleasant light it casts across the whole Pre-Eaphaelite move - ment .

		Memoirs of
Rossetti	PERSON	have tended to emphasize the sordid element in the lives of the circle , and tiie unbalanced element in their work .

		Biographies of Morris naturally em - phasize their socialistic leanings , and the Arts and Crafts side of the movement .

		Bume-Jones 's work was confined to the narrower field of painting , and he was even more closely asso - ciated with
Eossetti	PERSON	than was
Morris	PERSON	.

		Like
Rossetti	PERSON	and most of the others of the circle , he was a poor man , harassed b -RCB- - the necessity for petty economies , as well as by continual ill - health , -- privations of which
Morris	PERSON	knew nothing , -- yet there is nothing sordid in Lady Bume-Jones 's outlook upon life .

		She tells a cheerful story , and makes her readers realize that it was the best , and not the worst , of Ros - setti , -- liis greatness , not his eccentricity , -- that his friends cared for ; that there was noth - ing necessarily morbid or decadent in their love of beauty ; and that if they did not attain to all they hoped for , they were the better for the aspiration .

		It is well for this view to be emphasized , particularly when it is tlone as convincingly as Lady Bume-Jones has man - aged to do it .

		There is no doubt about her sincerity ; every page of her writing rings true .

		Lady Burne-Jones wisely refrains from any attempt at criticizing her husband 's work .

		In consonance with this decision , it is only suit - able that the illustrations contained in the two volumes should consist of portraits of the family and their friends , and reproductions of sketches or early drawings .

		Thus the illus - trations partake of the intimate character of the memoir , and add decidedly to its interest .


Edith Kellogg Dcxtox	PERSON	.

		TuE Philosophy of Americanism .

		* Professor
Muensterberg	PERSON	remarks that his book portraying * The Anuericans ' might aj ^ ropri - ately have been given the title that heads the present review .

		Such philosophy is presented imder four heads , to which are referred the inspiring motives that direct the interests , ideals , occupations , institutions , and diaracter of the Americans , , individually and collectively .

		TTiese are the * Spirit of Self-directi -LRB- Mi , ' the * Spirit of Self-Realization or Initiative , ' the ' Spirit of Self-perfection , ' and the ' Spirit of Self - Assertion . '

		With symmetrical consistency these fourfold inspirations serve as the introduc - torv chapters to the fourfold phases of Ameri - can life , -- Political , Economic , Intellectual , Social .

		The justification of this philosophical schedule , and the necessary harmonizing i ^ reof with the course of events and with the present status of affairs in our puzzling democracy , give form and substance to the six hundred pages of the volume .

		Equally influential as a motive to the authors initiative is his frequently uttered conviction that of all peoples , the Americans and the Germans need to understand one another , should contribute cooperatively and sympathetically to the growth of culture , and should mutually receive and offer benefit on the basis of their distinctive civilizations .

		His labors are thus sustained by the conviction that they are to serve as a step toward this interna - tional consummation .

		Practically , the most effi - cient motive in shaping the volume has been the desire to furnish the German reader with a suitable account of the real nature of the Amer - ican people , of their institutions , their prob - lems , their mode of life , their interests , their culture .

		The work was written by the author in German for the Germans ; just as his book enti - tled * American Traits ' was written in English for home consumption .

		The two treatises , we are informed , bear the complementary relation of a pair of stereoscopic pictures : the difference of their points of view i ^ ulting in an added realism of their combined effect .

		Apparently with some reluctance , the English translation has been authorized , and with some omissions -- notably , and regrettably , the chapter on Ger - man-Americans , upon which topic the author 's views would have received special consideration on the part of American readers -- substan - tially reproduces the two volumes of the orig - inal .

		It is likewise to be regretted that the translator has felt his obligations to the original so literally as to force upon the English con - struction t -RCB- - pes of expression , orders of phrase - • The Americans .

		148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ology , and modes of approach to statements , which the American 's keen sense of form -- a trait noted by the German - American autlior -- finds peciLliarly irritating .

		Although the author sets forth that his concern is with ' the lasting forces and tenden - cies of American life / and not with ' the prob - lems of the day / the distribution of the pre - sentations themselves hardly supports this emphasis .

		Viewed objectively , the account of the political organization is most amply pre - sented .

		The pervasive power of political par - ties , the functions of the executive , the mode of procedure and temper of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the status of the judiciary , the complex relations of
State and City	LOCATION	to the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	, form the natural components of American politics .

		With them are considered our internal and external political problems , -- the dominance of the former and -LRB- until recently -RRB- the slight hold of the latter upon the political interest being sharply contrasted , -- and also the special social and ethnological problems of our variously assorted population .

		A particularly incisive account of the indirect but effective way in which public opinion enters to make or mar the political game deserves honorable mention .

		The comprehensive and intensive absorption of the American people in industry and commerce must in every account constitute a vast and impressive aggregate .

		Statistics that im - press and bewilder by their magnitude testify the more strikingly to latter-day strenuosity , by aid of the historical comparisons of the curve of progression through which the present status has been reached .

		As t3rpical and important problems of our economic life the silver question , which has already acquired something of a bygone flavor , and those ominous realities , the tariff , the trusts , and the labor unions , are presented primarily in terms suited to Teutonic assimilation .

		With these obligations realized .

		Professor
Muenster	LOCATION	- berg proceeds with a notably freer handling and more congenial manner , to set forth our status in regard to education , high and low , public and private , good and bad .

		A rather bare chapter on the achievements of science in
America	LOCATION	gives way to a far more sympathetic account of our literary tendencies , successes , and failures .

		The manner in which Americans express themselves in art , and live and move in religious tenets and activities , occupy chapters proportionate to these factors in American culture .

		Our social life is the most briefly disposed of ; the introductory chapter requiring supplementing only by that most characteristic feature of Americanism , writ large in other than the society column , but here ungallantly entitled ' the ' self-assertion of women ' ; and by a portrayal of such aristocratic tendencies as have survived the onslaught of our iconoclastic democracy .

		By plan , selection of topics , and perspective of presentation , the work seems measurably suited to its objective purpose , that of carrying enlightenment to the many highways and by - ways of
Germany	LOCATION	, where conceptions of what really goes on in our midst , and notably of the motives and temper of the participants in the drama , are such as to cry out lustily for some vigorous corrective .

		On this score English read - ers are prepared to make proper allowances , bearing in mind that much of what is familiar and obvious is yet not superfluous when ad - dressed to a foreign public .

		They can not avoid , however , calling to mind the far more vigorous , discerning , and , to the Americans themselves , instructive account which Mr.
Brv	PERSON	` ce has given , though in larger proportions , of the institutiom - : of the American commonwealth .

		The compari - son is provoked by the equally ambitious char - acter of the present volume , and emphasizes how essentially the value of such an undertaking is dependent upon the temper of the artist , as well as upon his particular metier and technique .

		Viewed on its informational side , and yet regarding the critical discernment and vigor without wtdch such presentation is stale and flat though possibly profitable , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's work assumes a value to all readers , and ranks as an independent contribution ; while to Professor
Muensterberg	PERSON	's work must be assigned the more humble virtue of a fair suitability to German consumption .

		In this aspect , however , although the author 's talents and position make his conclusions worthy of distinct consideration , the volume does not demand , and is not likely to receive , a widely extended notice .

		The distinctive note thereof and the contention which it is certain to arouse have as yet been indicated in part only .

		The issue arises in regard to the pertinence of the philosophical key that is presented as unlocking the secret power-house of American thought and activity , and with regard to the judicial deci - sions which permeate through and through every topic considered in the several chapters .

		So much is this the case that the sensitive Amer - ican reader leaves the volume with the feeling of having been unexpectedly liberated from the prisoner 's stand ; while the publishers -LRB- doubtless with no adequate authority -RRB- see fit to herald the volume as ' a vivisection of the American people so incisive , true , and interesting that every American will enjoy reading it . '

		As an offset , the author raises the query whether ' such a eulogy of Americanism before the Americans ' will not unduly stimulate the spirit of self - satisfaction which may likewise be an American trait .

		Surely , in the present connection , eulogy
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 and vivisection are equally out of place .

		The • question is not whether a critical estimate of American ways and contributions is a legitimate or desirable matter , but wholly whether the par - ticular form of holding things in the balance , which dominates this volume , can or does result in any useful or helpful service .

		That it inter - feres essentially with the successful ministra - tion to the several functions which the book was planned to serve , seems clear enough .

		While the positing of a philosophic Americanism and the persistent application of the odium of com - parison are in themselves questionable proceed - ings , equally in regard to the purposes of the author and to the convictions of the reader , the main issue is as to the intrinsic value of such philosophy and of such judicial findings as are here handed down .

		The philosophy helps the reader little , if at all , and certainly weakens , when it seriously affects , the presentation .

		For - tunately it frequently does little more than fur - nish the author with a series of categories by means of which dominant American traits -- the significance of which at times lies in other • directions -- are referred back to one or other of the fourfold motives .

		If one drops the phi - losophy , and plainly sets forth the variety of characteristic ways , pleasant and unpleasant , in which the fundamental American independence of thought and action disports itself , the same • end is accomplished and nothing lost .

		That cer - tain traits and tendencies are expressible in terms of these categories , the author has shown ; but that these have in themselves any explana - tory or illuminating power does certainly not Appear .

		Yet this objection could be ignored , did not Professor
Muensterberg	PERSON	insist that in the potency of these four arch-characters of homo Americanus lies all hope of identifying and comprehending this interesting new-world specimen .

		If the philosophy may be dismissed as of slight eflBciency , yet not detracting from the merits of the work except through its needless obtrusiveness , the same leniency of judgment can not be extended to the array of positive pro- nouncements in which the work abounds .

		That certain , indeed that many , of the positions taken are in their salient features sound , and that real distinctions are shrewdly observed , the acumen of the author guarantees .

		The idealism of American life is particularly well noticed ; though even here love of contrast carries the point into quite inappropriate fields .

		One feels , too , a greater confidence in those judgments that repeat the verdict of the authors previous volume -- ' American Traits ' -- and bring with them no necessity of speaking pro to one public and con to another .

		One is grateful when Pro- fessor Muensterberg points out the haphazard make-up and wastefulness of our direction of the educational machinerj - , and has in pleasant memory bis memorable article in ' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly ' on ' School Reform . '

		When he points out the obvious feebleness of the American drama , and is compelled to admit that it reflects little of that striving for self-perfection which pervades Americanism , we again respond with a chastened ' Amen . '

		When he indicates the dangers of a too rapidly established dominance of feminine ways of thinking , he finds a public that appreciates without distorting his caution , even as it questions the need of it .

		When he indicates -- as so many have done before him .

		-- as one of the serious shortcomings of our aggressive democracy , the tendency to overlook reaUy great men and to magnify complacent bourgeois leaders , we realize that a vital weak - ness has been laid bare .

		This type of criticism so far as it is sympathetically and fairly pre - sented -- and on this score little fault is to be found -- is sure to meet with a fair reception , even when the manner of indicating these weak - nesses is not particularly acceptable to the American type of receptivity .

		These are in the main fairly definite questions in regard to the nature of the cultural tendencies which we col - lectively exhibit , and which the observant stranger in our midst is likely to note .

		The type of judgment , the fault of omission and commission , which is distinctively more certain to arouse protest and antagonism is not 60 easy to indicate .

		The change b `` 5omes appar - ent when the discussion shifts from the indica - tions of objective failings to subjective motives , from what we do and how we do it to that inner perspective of considerations that eventually determines action .

		It is in these attempts to read back of the tendencies and behind the rec - ords what is bred in the bone and graven in the heart of the American that the author 's foreign spectacles -- even though refitted in
America	LOCATION	and accustomed to the vagaries of our atmos - phere -- render inefficient his psychological astuteness .

		It is on this score that the candid critic , however favorably disposed towards Pro- fessor
Muensterberg	ORGANIZATION	's able and good-tempered effort , can not avoid the responsibility of indi - cating that , from the American point of view , the distinctive features of the volume carry but little of conviction or enlightenment .

		This ver - dict conveys with it no intimation of deficiency on the part of the author , except in r ^ ard to temperamental and hereditary traits .

		A less able man might well have written a book of richer insight : for it is notably true that this art of national delineation demands qualities of tem - perament even more than of training .

		The con - trast of attitude may be illustrated by referring once more to the philosophic scheme in whici 150 THE DIAL , -LSB- Mareh 1 , the present exposition finds its guidance .

		In the Teutonic mind this fonrfold partitioning of Anicj ` ican traits and its apparent fitness to the situation arouses distinct gratification .

		In the American as in the English mind , it merely arouses suspicion ; and the American writer , finding himself inclined to fall in love with these categorical muses , becomes scrupulously cau - tious to prevent any unseemly subservience to so symmetrically perfect an ideal .

		The German writer points the finger of emphasis to it in his l > refaee ; the American writer would use the same space to explain or apologize for his hesi - tant willingness to use the scheme at all .

		It is but fair that further instances should bo indicated of the failure of the author 's tempera - mentally guided insight to lead him aright through the mazes of th ^ American character .

		Any transition from an objective description of institutions to a subjective delineation of char - acter is particularly difiicult in
America	LOCATION	on account of the many varieties of typical Ameri - cans .

		Professor
Muensterberg	PERSON	tells us that he is presenting * a study of the Americans as the best of them are , and as the others should wish to -RSB- , -RRB- e. ' As a matter of fact he is frequently describing types that are not suggested by this characterization .

		And yet he misses the inner significance of this very variety itself , -- a vari - ety that will not lend itself to the type of form - ula here regarded as dominant .

		It is quite the same tendency that leads him to posit Washing - ton as the political capital ,
New York	LOCATION	as the commercial , and
Boston	LOCATION	as the intellectual .

		Apart from the inevitable concentration of national politics at the capital , these differenti - ations are misleading .

		If
America	LOCATION	were
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peanised , we would of necessity have commer - cial and intellectual capitals .

		The significant fact about us is that these things are not cen - tralised ; and the insistence of the intellectual superiority of
Boston	LOCATION	, like the recurrent glorifi - cation of the members of the Harvard faculty , can not but arouse a smile where it does not call up a less charitable emotion .

		For the type of national portraiture that is here attempted , the American simply will not -- though possibly he should -- obey the rules of the game .

		The result is that the diversity of American character is slighted , and that the type held up as dominant to the inquisitive German is distinctively mis - leading .

		It carries with it little of the quality of a portrait from the living modelj but rather the conventionalised aeademic grouping of fea - tures that has its source in a prejudiced mental photograph .

		Specifically does it fail by lack of compre - hension of the \ inderlying sterling English group of ideas and modes of reaction which still constitute the core of Americanism .

		The point would bear elaboration .

		In spite of the many variations , the intrinsically English temper of our civilization is most effective .

		Had this trait been appreciated , there would have ^ appeared as ample reason to provide for a chap - ter on self-restraint as for any of the four other types of self-conditioned motives .

		Americ-an self-restraint is not English self-restraint ; but it serves as a common differentium when the American is to be contrasted with the German or the Frenchman .

		The same insistence on this factor of good form and of propriety in the conduct of affairs , the same prominence of the ideals of a ' gentleman , ' pervade American and English life ; and -- as a single instance -- make impossible those frequent relations of personal hostility that mar the high regard that Amer - icans cherish for the German academician .

		These traits are deep-seated ; they are difficult to bring to the surface .

		But it is their omission that imparts the imreality to the portrait .

		And , once more , there is a failure to understand that the American is facile in importing and graft - ing foreign products to native growths , but has no intention of absorbing these into his mode of life .

		What we borro ^ v is so vastly different in its effect upon the national temperament from what we inherit and what we develop .

		Ameri - can ladies import their finery from
Paris	LOCATION	, but without thereby becoming in the least Gallic in appearance or in outlook on things in general .

		The leaders of the intellectual life and in the world of commerce make use of ideas and processes that are made in
Germany	LOCATION	, but they show nothing -LRB- Teutonic in their intellectual make-up .

		The expert may recognize the for - eign traits in the transplanted fruit , but the soil by which the tree grows is thoroughly Amer - ican .

		It is for like reasons that Professor Muen - sterberg 's practical mission seems equally hope - less of result .

		The German and the American are likely to continue to feel such measure of attraction and repulsion for one another as they now cherish ; and no indication , however justi - fied and adequate , of their community of inter - ests and ideals , will alter the effectiveness of those temperamental qualities that -- one may acknowledge with regret -- do form a consid - erable obstacle between the mutual understand - ing of German and American .

		In this estrange - ment and national incompatability , the
Ameri	PERSON	- can finds himself not alone ; but often discov - ers with surprise how the same feeling , though differently motivated , is shared by so many other of the dominant nations of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		While acknowledging gratefully and admir - ingly the objective service which this volume is to perform in the German community , the self - assertive American can not refrain from express -

		MTL.ITARY Rule axd Xatioxal , Expansion .

		* From the organization of the Northwest Ter - ritory in the days of the Confederation , to the events of the past few years resulting from the Spanish war , the
United States	LOCATION	has pursued a fairly consistent , even though not arbi - trarily designed , course of territorial ex - pansion .

		With an energetic and growing population , and with vast stretches of produc - tive lands ever just across the borders , this aspect of our national history has been clearly inevitable .

		It may well be questioned whether we have need to acquire landed possessions across the seas : but that we have , or soon shall have , a real use for all the territories contiguous with our own which we have annexed during the past hundred years , will hardly be disputed by anyone , even though methods employed , as in the case of the Mexican cessions , may not be regarded as always distinctly creditable .

		It is a curious fact that in the mass of lit - erature , more or less worthy , that has grown up about the subject of American expansion , one very important phase of the process has until recently been almost totally n ^ lected .

		The political , the constitutional , the diplomatic , and the commercial aspects of territorial acqui - sition have been pretty well worked out , but as a rule the strictly administrative policies and principles involved have been dealt with by writers only incidentally , or at least with refer - ence merely to single cases of annexation .

		There has been no well-grounded attempt at sys - tematic treatment of the subject as a whole .

		The need for such a piece of work is now in part supplied by Dr.
David Y. Thomas	PERSON	's ' History of
^ Military Government	ORGANIZATION	in newly acquired Ter - ritory of the
United States	LOCATION	, ' a doctoral dis - sertation of rather unusual merit recently submitted to the
Faculty of Political Science of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		and partition , the
United States	LOCATION	has acquired foreign territorv on about a dozen different occasions .

		Usually -LRB- the cases of
Texas	LOCATION	and
Hawaii	LOCATION	being the * main exceptions -RRB- territory - acquired in any of these ways has been com - pelled to pass through a transition stage inter - vening between the occupation of it by the officials and troops of the
United States	LOCATION	and ^ the definite organization of it into ' territories ' in the technical sense .

		During this transition stage , when the authority of previous owners and claimants had been cut off and that of the
United States	LOCATION	could be asserted only through temporary agents , such annexed domains have been held under what is commonly known as
Military Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		What Dr.
Thomas	PERSON	set out to do , and what he may be said to have done with a good degree of success , was to start with
Louisiana	LOCATION	in
1803	DATE	and make a sur - vey of all our annexations of territory with respect to the theory and practice of military government as applied during this preparator -RCB- ' stage by the executive power of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The result , therefore , is not a history of American expansion in general , or of Ameri - can military government in general , but a pointed presentation of the part which military government has played in the intervals , usually brief , between the stationing of commandants by the President in annexed territories and the placing of these territories on a civil basis by action of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The task of preparing such a study , as the author conceived it .

		involved not only a consideration of the legal status of new territory and the legal basis for military gov - ernment and its various administrative activ - ities , but also a description of the actual management of new acquisitions from the time of occupation ixntil the organization of terri - torial or state governments .

		The fullest and most valuable part of the book is that dealing with the four great acqui - sitions of
Louisiana	LOCATION	,
Florida	LOCATION	,
Xew Mexico	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	.

		The preliminary governments of a military character established in these regions are discussed with a very satisfactory apprecia - tion of existing conditions and with a clear conception of the larger political and constitu - tional bearings of the s -RCB- - etem .

		The treatment of military - rule in other annexed territories , --
Alaska	LOCATION	,
Hawaii	LOCATION	,
the Philippines	LOCATION	,
Porio Rico	PERSON	,
Samoa	LOCATION	, and the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal zone , -- is much briefer , and on the whole less satisfactory .

		The author tells us that regarding these he deems it ' unnecessary , not to say improper , to go into details upon the same scale , ' and that * for the most part they must be left to the reader 's memory of partisan accounts , or to the researches of a later historian when the air shall have cleared and the evidence shall be complete and accessible . ''

		Xotwithstanding the 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, spirit of scholarly caution here displayed , it would seem that more than two pages might profitably have been given to
Alaska	LOCATION	, and more than one to
Hawaii	LOCATION	.

		It is fair to say , however , that there is probably nowhere in print a bet - ter summary of military government in
the Philippines	LOCATION	and
Porto Rico	LOCATION	than that given us by Dr.
Thomas	PERSON	.

		The work throughout is based on the best of documentary materials , and these are referred to in the foot-notes with a fair degree of frequency .

		One can not repress the feeling , however , that so elaborate a treatise on a subject of such general interest ought never to be pub - lished unaccompanied by a full and systematic bibliography .

		The index to the work , too , is rather inadequate .

		The Poetry of Mr.
SwrN	PERSON	^ suRNE .

		* Singer last born of all the starry race Whose names make bright the heaven of Eng - lish song , With words that should not do thee wholly - wrong We fain would praise and thank thee for the grace Bestowed of all thy gifts , were not the space Of our slight verse too narrow for the throng Of grateful memories and emotions strong That cluster round thy nam © to find a place .

		But we will bring thee tribute of our love , Because thy song has ever set above All things most cherished since the world began The priceless thing which gives to life its worth , Most sacred of the sacred things of earth , -- The freedom of the body and soul of man .

		It is a great satisfaction to have at last the complete poetical works of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	in a uniform library edition .

		The foremost of liv - ing poets has long been held from his own in the estimate of the larger reading public by the fact that it has hitherto been almost impossible to view his work as a whole .

		The numerous and multiform books which have contained it have heen difficult to obtain and almost prohibi - tive in price .

		The author says : ' It is nothing to me that what I write should find immediate or general acceptance , ' and the sincerity of the statement is beyond question .

		But it is much to all lovers of poetry that the only surviving exemplar of the great Victorian age of song should be easily accessible to them , and such access is now measurably facilitated by the six volumes into which the contents of the earlier sixteen have been brought together .

		Even this collection does not include the dramatic works -LRB- with the exception of '

		theus ' -RRB- , but those works are to follow in a series of five more volumes .

		The sixteen volumes now reprinted include the two Greek dramas , the three series of ' Poems and Ballads , ^ the two volumes of Arthu - rian narratives , ' Songs before Sunrise , ' ' Songs of Two Nations , ' * Songs of the Springtides , ' ' Studies in Song , ' ' A Midsummer Holiday , ' ' A Century of Eoundels , ' ' Astrophel , ' ' A Channel Passage , ' and the ' Heptalogia . '

		The last-named collection of parodies is now first acknowledged by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, although its authorship has been an open secret from the time of its publication a quarter of a century ago .

		All these volumes are reprinted with prac - tically no changes .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is evidently of the opinion that the product of the creative hour had better be left to speak for itself , that any subsequent tinkering is more likely to mar than to mend the original .

		For an artist of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's type , whose verses are forged at white heat , although with no scamping of the workmanship , this appears to be a just instinct , although it is possible that artists of other types may be well-advised in making amendments at the dictate of the reflective years that super - vene .

		The question is one that admits of no general rule of practice , although a recollection of the ^ improvements ' that some great poets have made upon their originals incline us to believe that the labor limce so frequently lauded is more likely than not to be a work of futility .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, at least , has had no doubts as far as his own work is concerned , and beyond a few trifling corrections of the most obvious sort , and a few lines added to the '
Heptalogia	LOCATION	, ' has altered nothing .

		Allied to the instinct which has held him to this course is that which has impelled him to reprint everything con - tained in the volumes as first published .

		He says of the * Notes ' that accompanied and de - fended the famous first volume of ' Poems and Ballads ' that he has ' nothing to retract from them , ' and this statement at least implies that he has nothing to retract from the poems them - selves , or from any of the poems that have fol - lowed them during nearly forty years .

		Even the poems inspired by political passions that now seem remote to us are all scrupulously reproduced , from the curses heaped upon the third
Napoleon	PERSON	and the ninth Pius in the sixties to the denunciation in the eighties of ' the hoary henchman of the gang ' who , in the opinion of the poet , sought the undoing of
England	LOCATION	for the furtherance of his political ambitions .

		Even if the years have lessened the vehemence of some of these old animosities , they were genuine enough at the time of their expression , and the poet probably feels that to delete them from his work would denote a lack of intellectual integ -

		Litera scripta manet , and these things are a part of the historical record from which the final judgment pronomiced upon nineteenth - century men and affairs will be made up .

		In our last issue , something was said of the deeply interesting retrospect which prefaces the first volume of this collected edition .

		The pur - pose of the present review is mainly to discuss the contents of * A Channel Passage and Other Poems / published in
England	LOCATION	as a separate new volume , but in this country -LRB- thus far at least -RRB- only as the final section of the sixth volume of the complete poems .

		A few of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's later poems have seemed to us , as they have appeared from time to time in the reviews , to be unworthy of his genius .

		Although all these pieces are now reprinted , they are in the com - pany of so many others to which the most cap - tious critic would find it diflBcult to take excep - tion , that the impression made by the volume as a whole is that it adds materially to the poefs fame .

		It maintains as high an average level as is reached by most of the preceding volumes , and it fairly outweighs one or two of them .

		Its publication is then , absolutely considered , an event of the first importance , or at least of greater importance than could possibly attad ; to the publication of a new collection by any other known English singer .

		The titular poem is accompanied by a date -LRB- 1855 -RRB- which would indicate that it was half a century old .

		But this date must refer to the experience described rather than to the com - position of the verses , for ' A Channel Passage ' is clearly written in the poet 's matured style , and it is inconceivable that it should really have been produced by a boy of eighteen -- even by as marvellous a boy as he who wrote '
Hesperia	LOCATION	. '

		A few lines will make this fact sufficiently evi - dent . '

		Far eastward , clear of the covering of cloud , the sky laughed out into light From the rims of the storm to the sea 's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white .

		The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade From the cloud 's black base to the black waves ' brim rejoiced in the light they made .

		Far westward , throned in a silent sky , where life was in lustrous tune .

		Shone , sweeter and surer than morning or evening , the steadfast smile of the moon .

		The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold , and deep As life or as death , revealed and transfigured , may shine on the soul through sleep .

		- ' A Channel Passage ' is but one of the nature - poems which are scattered with lavish hand .

		throughout this volume .

		Others of great beautv are ` The Lake of
Gaube	PERSON	, ' ` Hawthorn Tide / and ' The High Oaks . '

		The remEiining contents of the collection -LRB- with one notable exception , to be discussed hereafter -RRB- fall chiefly within the two categories of poems inspired by political passion , and poems of a personal or memorial nature .

		In the first of these categories comes * A Word for the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- which is an old poem not hitherto reprinted -RRB- , * The
Commonweal	LOCATION	, ' ` The Question , ' and ' Apostasy ' -LRB- which date from the home rule controversy of the eighties -RRB- , the poems on recent happenings in
Eussia	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Crete	ORGANIZATION	, and a group of pieces occasioned by the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The poems of this group are greatly inferior to Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's earlier work of similar character , and need not long detain us .

		The ode to
Russia	LOCATION	achieved a certain noto - riety because of the line * Night hath none but one red star -- Tyrannicide , ' which cost the author many a hard journalistic rap .

		The verses ' For
Greece	LOCATION	and
Crete	ORGANIZATION	' yield these noble lines , which may , however , be over - matched a dozen times by passages in '
Athens	LOCATION	/ *
Greece	LOCATION	, where only men whose manhood was as godhead ever trod .

		Bears the blind world witness yet of light wherewith her feet are shod : Freedom , armed of
Greece	LOCATION	, was always very man and very God . '

		Now the winds of old that filled her sails with triomph , when the fieet Boond for death from
Asia	LOCATION	fled before them stricken , wake to greet Ships full-winged again for freedom toward the sacred shores of
Crete	LOCATION	. '

		The memorial poems now collected include pieces inscribed to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Cromwell	PERSON	, Nel - son , Bums ,
Eabelais	LOCATION	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and
Dumas	PERSON	, be - sides personal tributes to
Christina Eossetti	PERSON	, Mrs.
Lynn Linton	PERSON	,
Lord Leighton	LOCATION	,
G. F. Watts	PERSON	, President
Camot	PERSON	, and
Aurelio Saffi	PERSON	.

		There is also a tender dedication -LRB- in the familiar stanza which the poet has made his own for such pur - poses -RRB- to the memory of
WilHam Morris	ORGANIZATION	and
Edward Bume-Jones	ORGANIZATION	.

		These poems have ` the redeeming quality of entire and absolute sin - cerity ' which the author claims for them , be - sides many other admirable qualities concerning which his own voice is silent , but which the critic is bound also to claim for them .

		The most important of these poems is the ode to Bums , from which we take the closing stanzas . '

		But never , since bright earth was bom In rapture of the enkindling mom .

		Might godlike wrath and sunlike scorn That was and is And shall be while false weeds are worn Find word like his . '

		Above the rude and radiant earth That heaves and glows from firth to firth In vale and mountain , bright in dearth And warm in wealth .

		Which gave his fiery glory birth By chance and stealth , ' Above the storms of praise and blame That blow with mist his lustrous name .

		His thimderous laughter went and came .

		And lives and flies ; The roar that follows on the flame When lightning dies .

		A word of praise should also be given to the Eabelais roundel , the Carnot sonnet , and the verses in memory of Mrs ,
Linton	PERSON	, in the simple form of the verses written tx -RRB- the glory of Lan - dor forty years ago .

		Among the miscellaneous features of this vol - ume may be noted an ode to ' Music , ' some ex - • quisite new songs of childhood , a translation of ■ the Delphic Hymn to Apollo , some lines ' At a Dog 's Grave , ' and a group of * Prologues ' for certain of the more famous Elizabethan plays .

		These poems supplement the earlier series of sonnets on the old English dramatists , of which the author says : ' I can hardly remember any task that I ever took more delight in discharg - ing than I felt in the inadequate and partial payment of a lifelong debt to the marvellous and matchless succession of poets who made the glory of our country incomparable for ever by the work they did between the joyful date of the rout of the Armada and the woeful date of the outbreak of the civil war . '

		Tlie ' Prologues ' may be taken as a further instalment toward the payment of the debt thus acknowledged .

		They and the volume are closed by ' The After - glow of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' -- ' Alone of all whose doom is death and birth ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is lord of souls alive on earth . '

		We have left for the close of this review our consideration of the poem which is the crown - ing glory of the present volume , * The Altar of Righteousness ' is so great a poem that any words of praise would do it but scant justice .

		It may be briefly described as a companion to the ' Hymn of Man , ' and as the final summing - up of the poet 's philosophy , the last word in his confession of religious faith .

		The contrast be - tween the shifting forms of superstition and the veiled central object of all true religious emo - tion is embodied in the following passage : ' Of cloud and of change is the form of the fashion that man may behold of it wrought : Of iron and truth is the mystic mid altar , where wor - ship is none but of thought .

		No prayers may go up to it , climbing as incense of glad - ness or sorrow may climb : No rapture of music may ruffle the silence that guards it , and hears not of time .

		As the winds of the wild bUnd ages alternate in passion of light and of cloud .

		So changes the shape of the veil that enshrouds it with darkness and light for a shroud .

		And the winds and the clouds and the stars fall silent , and fade out of hearing or sight .

		And the shrine stands fast and is changed not , whose likeness was changed as a cloud in the
night	TIME	. '

		The body of this poem offers a sort of historical survey of the religious instinct groping its way upward to the light .

		To the advent of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity this lovely tribute is paid : ' Then , soft as the dews of night , As the stars of the sundown bright .

		As the heart of the sea 's hymn deep .

		And sweet as the balm of sleep , Arose on the world a light Too pure for the skies to keep . '

		A beautiful tribute to
St. Theresa	ORGANIZATION	occupies a conspicuous place in the poem , and fairly matches the glorification of
St. Catherine	ORGANIZATION	in the '
Siena	LOCATION	' of ' Songs before Sunrise , ' Then comes the tale of the gradual undoing of the ecclesiastical perversions of Christianity , with mention of Bruno and Ral -RRB- elais , and much praise of Shakespeare . '

		In him all truth and the glory thereof and the power and the pride .

		The .

		song of the soul and her story , bore witness that fear had lied .

		All hope , all wonder , all trust , all doubt that knows not of fear ^ The love of the body , the lust of the spirit to see and to hear .

		All womanhood , fairer than love could conceive or desire or adore .

		All manhood , radiant above all heights that it held of yore .

		Lived by the life of his breath , with the speech , of his soul 's will spake .

		And the light lit darkness to death whence never the dead shall wake . '

		The final section of the poem ends as follows : ' All the names wherein the incarnate Lord lived his day and died Tads from suns to stars , from stars into darkness undes - cried .

		Christ the man lives yet , remembered of man as dreams that leave Light on eyes that wake and know not if memory bid them grieve .

		Fire sublime as lightning shines , and exalts in thunder yet .

		Where the battle wields the name and the sword of Mahomet .

		Far above all wars and gospels , all ebb and flow of time .

		Lives the soul that speaks in silence , and makes mute earth sublime , still for her , though years and ages be blinded and bedinned .

		Mazed with lightnings , crazed with thunders , life rides and guides the wind .

		Death may live or death may die , and the truth be light or night .

		Not for gain of heaven may man put away the rule of right . '

		With this strain of majestic music in our ears , we close the volume , our gratitude to the poet for his many past gifts strengthened and re - newed , our thankfulness deepened for his con - tinued presence in the world of living men .

		J THE DIAL , 15S STRUGGLES Uf THE WORLD OF SlTFFERIXG .

		* In the volume sent forth from the busy oflBce of the secretan - of the
Xew York Charity Organization Society	ORGANIZATION	, those who are interested in benevolent work ■ will find a most instructive and stimulating discussion of ' The Principles of Eelief . '

		The standpoint is that of one who is most familiar with the heroic efforts of private charity to mitigate the sufferings of dependent families .

		Ite author , Mr.
Edward T. Devine	PERSON	, is optimistic , and indicates the con - ditions under which relief may help without j > auperizing .

		But he comes , to the practical conclusion that all direct mea ^ - ures will fail unless larger social policies are fostered .

		The lxx > k will help us to give a quantitative value to our vague notions about the standard of living and the minimum wage ; and no writer has applied this definite standard to the methods of poor relief more thoroughly .

		Espe - cially valuable to a student is the analysis of t -RCB- - pical relief problems , which enables one to arrive at principles of relief much as a study of court decisions takes one to the heart of legal principles .

		A brief historieal survey of English and American poor laws and methods furnishes a background for the generalizations , and the deductions from the experiments made in connection with such disasters as the Chi - c-ago Fire , and industrial distress in periods of crisis , are of permanent value .

		The field of vision is chiefly that of a charity organiza - tionist , and some important topics , -- as state and town relief , child-saving work , care of defectives , and some others , -- are lightly touched .

		The work will be recognized as one of the chief contributions on this vital subject .

Washington Gladden	PERSON	has written a grace - ful sketch of the historical development of industrial organisations of society and the ten - dency to improvement in the lot of wage - earners , in the volume entitled ' Organized Labor and Capital . '

		And if the terrible facts cited from reliable sources stood alone ; if they rep - resented the main tendency of capitalistic man-dgement ; if it should prove true that the traders can not be honest and can not even con - struct a moral code ; if their domination makes falsehood and oppression necessary , -- then the people would greet almost any change , save revolution .

		Our President has a mind to tame the traders , and make an experiment with con - stitutional and legal regulation .

		If his method fail , ^ Ir .

		His materials might be found in the documents and treatises which are cited in his bibliography .

		Yet it is fair to say that he has coined the crude metal into current form and stamped it with his own personal quality .

		He has , as agent of charity organizations and settlements , b ^ n driven by what he witnessed and expe - rienced to the discovery that individual effort and philanthropic agencies are utterly inade - quate to prevent the increase of misery in the absence of a national policy .

		His descriptions of extreme distress have the vivid color and sharp outline which comes only wiili direct observation .

		His statistics of pauperism are confessedly incomplete , and his estimates may be exaggerated ; but he has clearly demonstrated the necessity for more thorough investigations by the government than we have yet had .

		It seems incredible that any human being can read this volume without fixing his purpose to work for a more rational method of dealing with the immigration of defectives , the insur - ance of unskilled workingmen , the municipal provision for playgrounds , and the other sane and practical measures which promise at least some degree of relief .

		The argument for legal prohibition of child-labor in urban industries is sound and vibrant with patriotic and humane 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, eympathy .

		Those who simply neglect to read such discussions become participants in the national injustice which threatens our civiliza - tion with a new invasion , a veritable deluge of barbarism .

		It will little avail to promote science , art , and literature , unless adequate measures are taken to select the breeding stock for the nation .

		At present the tendency is to select the unfit ; and the author shows that * race suicide ' is an inevitable consequence of unregulated immigration .

		His argument on this point deserves special attention .

		The director of the
People 's Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, which conducts educational work chiefly in the
Cooper Union	ORGANIZATION	, describes his experiments and sets down certain generalizations in his book entitled ' Working with the People . '

		Workingmen are deeply interested in those social problems that are concerned with the distribution of wealth ; but the ' Classes ' up - town will not spend time listening to lectures on such subjects , for they are the happy pos - sessors .

		Workingmen like discussions rather than sermons , and their interests are wide enough to include music , history , literature , drama , and some religion .

		Sectarianism in a mixed audience is not tolerated , but a man who can show how the immanent forces of the uni - verse are related to right and happiness on this earth may gain a hearing .

		Socialism is wel - come in such gatherings , because it gives the * Masses ' some chance to control the social machinery which masters their lives .

		Municipal ownership of public utilities is favored by these audiences .

		Miss
Frances A. Kellor	PERSON	, in her book entitled ' Out of Work , ' has brought together a body of first-hand information about the devices and mysterious ways of employment-agencies and intelligence-offices , which throws much light on the perplexities of housekeepers .

		Ultimately this investigation will doubtless aid in the amelioration of conditions .

		The method of securing the facts was one which a detective will admire and which the man of science will commend , for it was marked by shrewdness and exactness .

		The campaign in which this plucky student is a pioneer will carry terror to the unscrupulous and will help the honest and use - ful men and women whose function it is to market the commodity of surplus and misplaced labor .

		In the volume entitled ' Seven Years ' Hard / a young clergyman of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	tells in fragments of anecdote , with a hint of social philosophy and a little of clerical bias , some of his experiences in a poverty-cursed region of
East London	LOCATION	.

		It is not a story and it is not a system of sociology , but a series of snap ^ hots of the life of people ground to earth by employers , debased by drink and ignorance , and indifferent to art , science , history , morals , and religion .

		The author is not without his theories of reform , -- he would have all land owned by government ; all churches united and free from dissension and soup-house bribery ; while culti - vated people from the West End should reside in the East End and leaven the obdurate lump .

		In his view , ordinary philanthropy is mockery , , a homeopathic pill diluted in a sea of misery ; for the ' gift without the giver is bare . '


Charles Richmond Henderson	PERSON	.

		Briefs ox Ne ^ v Books .

		From ` The Academy ' and ` Litera - A bachelor j. , gathered together the and his books .

		, , , , ^ • , , i , fin rt rk r book-chats written by ` E. -LRB- x. O. , the collection bearing the title ` Egomet ' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A more thorough-going , one might almost say incorrigible , bookman than * E. G. 0 . '

		it would be hard to imagine .

		Literature , how - ever , is not his calling , as he tells us that he earns his bread somewhere in commercial Lon - don , working from ten in the morning until late in the afternoon , with two weeks of vacation in the
summer	DATE	; but reading is his one passion , and it is reading for pleasure solely .

		In a declara - tion neither voicing the loftiest ideals nor clothed in immaculate English , he frankly says , ` Life is given us for enjoyment , so I read what I believe I will enjoy . '

		But his manifest sin - cerity in all his literary judgments , and his abounding enthusiasm for a wide range of good books make his chapters delightful reading .

		Qualities and preferences , it is true , he very hon - estly reveals , that one might wish to be other - wise .

		For instance , ` that roaring despot , Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, ' he likes not at all .

		But as he repeat - edly sings the praises of ` The Pilgrim 's Prog - ress ' and `
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, ' and as the way to his heart is through his favorite books , perhaps he will let us call his attention to two familiar anecdotes that ought to soften him toward the worthy Doctor .

		One day , as
Croker	ORGANIZATION	tells us ,
Johnson	PERSON	took Bishop
Percy	PERSON	's little girl on his knee and asked her what she thought of ` The Pilgrim 's Progress . '

		The child replied that she had not read it .

		` No ! '

		returned the Doctor ; ` then I would not give one farthing for you . '

		Thereupon he set her down and took no further notice of her .

		Mrs.
Piozzi	PERSON	records in her ` Anecdotes ' a saying of
Johnson	PERSON	's that should delight our book-lover .

		` Was there ever yet anything written by mere man , ' he asks , ` that was wished longer by its readers , excepting ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' ``
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' and `` The Pilgrim 's Progress '' ? '

		` E. G. 0 . '

		is an old bachelor , dried and seasoned , a lover of his pipe and his fire-side , and perhaps in some danger of forgetting that life is more than literature , and that man does not live by books alone .

		Yet as we are judging him from data furnished by
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 himself for oux entertainment , we must be lenient .

		We believe him to have a warm human heart , and to be at bottom a right good fellow , whose real name we should like to learn , and whose acquaintance we should like to make .

		The city of
Ferrara	LOCATION	, at one time of
Savonarola	LOCATION	.

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the great Centres of Italian eultui-e , at present holds a p -RRB- osition of relative unimportance , and so little is heard of it that but few have a definite idea even of its location .

		But the city that was the birthplace of
Savonarola	LOCATION	, the home of
Ariosto	PERSON	, and the refuge of Tasso , will never be wholly forgotten .

		Interest in this old Lombard town will doubtless be stimulated by the recently pub - lished * Storj - of FeiTara , ' written by Miss
Ella Noyes	PERSON	and included in the ` Mediaeval Towns ' series -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- .

		The author devotes about two-thirds of her book to the history of the city , and recounts its troubles and triumphs from its earliest emergence in the seventh cen - tury to its great eclipse at the close of the six - teenth .

		The whole account centres about the ruling family of
Este	ORGANIZATION	, which came into imdis - puted control of the city in
1208	DATE	.

		To this remarkable line of rulers , typical despots of the wonderful age of the Renaissance ,
Ferrara	PERSON	owes her greatness and her fame .

		The story of the A-arious reigns is , as a rule , told in a sjTnpathetic manner ; still , the author is not blind to the strange weakness and grossness that seem to have fonned a pai ' t of the character and culture of the period and tries to present a true picture of Estensi despotism .

		Her work seems to have this defect , however , -- that too much is said of the court and too little of the masses that strove to supply the splendor that is described so well .

		In the last third of the book we are given a descriptive view of the city , its palaces , pictures , streets , churches , and abbeys .

		In forming an idea of what remains of
FeiTara	ORGANIZATION	's greatness , the reader is aided by a niunber of interesting illus - trations drawn by Miss
Dora Xoyes	PERSON	.

		The work is written in easy , dignified English , the narra - tive is interesting , and the historian displays good taste and judgment both in her choice and her rejection of materials .

		The book is well supplied with poetical quotations from the great Italian masters ; but as these are frequently not translated , their presence often detracts from the general interest of the work .

		nthy essays To say that the substance of Mr. on literary
H. W. Bo	PERSON	\ niton 's volume entitled subjects .

		i. Journalism and Literature ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- has appeared , for the most part , in * The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly ' is enough to indicate that it is made up of serious and suggestive work , though the nan-ow limits within whidi the separate essays are confined suggest rather the ` by-product ' of literary effort than its main purpose .

		There is a touch here and there in Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	's work that reminds one of Miss Repplier , and one might veiy successfully pick up his book for ` dozy hour ' reading , fol - lowing the by-paths of thought which his sen - tences open up or letting them drop to suit the fancy .

		It is by no means eveiy writer who will yield results worth while either to desultorj ' or to careful reading , but we think Mr.
Boj-nton	PERSON	has attained to that good fortune .

		The essay on ` Journalism and Literature , ' from which the volume takes its title , attempts no rigid dis - tinction between the two , but admits a great deal of inter-penetration along the lower mar - grin of the latter and the upper margin of the former .

		The ruthless demands of daily jour - nalism could not keep a
Godkin	LOCATION	confined whoUy within its narrow limits , and on the other hand the many who reach the higher walks of litera - ture through the avenue of journalism are not always successful in leaving the dust of the road wholly behind them .

		The two functions in their normal development , however , are quite distinct .

		Literatui'e .

		properly so called , requires the cre - ative faculty and presents a personal interpreta - tion of life ; the business of journalism is to record events and to comment upon them from a more or less rigidly pre-determined point of view .

		The originality that is the prime condi - tion of success in pure literature is not needed in jouiTiaJism , and may even be a stumbling block .

		On the whole , we like the paper on ` American Humor ' better than anything else in Mr.
BoATitonls	PERSON	volume .

		The author 's power of packing a great deal of truth in a few words shows to good effect in his adjudication of cer - tain claims to a seat on the bench of humor .

		For instance : ` The true hmnorist can not help conceraing himself with some sort of interpreta - tion of life : Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	can . '

		Ui
Ohio	LOCATION	retfiment in the Civil War .

		The supplying of materials for the future great history of the Civil War goes on unceasingly ; and one of the most jwpular forms taken is that of regi - mental records .

		These , like the family genealo - gies and town annals of
New England	LOCATION	, whUe not exactly history , are indispensable to the histo - rian ; and the story of a regiment 's war achieve - ments has at least symmetrical form , -- a true be - ginning , middle , and end .

		Those who i -RRB- eruse it with breathless interest are the survivors and their families ; the ` general reader ' will go through it as he does through the flag-rooms and relic-rooms in the State-house , -- with his hat off and his attention only occasionally roused by the mention of a famous name .

		.

		One of the best recent books in this kind is entitled ` Trials and Triumphs ; or , the Record of the Fifty-fifth
Ohio Volunteer Infantry	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- McClui ^ -RRB- ; and its prin - cipal author is Captain
Hartwell Osbom	PERSON	, who served honorably with the regiment throughout the war .

		The Fifty-fifth
Ohio	LOCATION	was recruited in
Huron County	LOCATION	-LRB- of which
Norwalk	LOCATION	is the countj ^ - seat -RRB- , after the reverses at Bull Run had stirred the Noi-th to greater efforts ; it had its full share of the campaigns in
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and
Georgia	LOCATION	, and of the terrible work at CTianeellors - ville and
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		This is related with clear - ness and graphic power by Captain Osbom ; and , besides the narrative , the book is xmusually com - plete in regimental statistics , sketches of officers and citizens , and personal notes and recollections of soldiers .

		Photographs , both ` wartime ' and 158 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, modern , have been reproduced in profusion , to recall the features of many a comrade ; and the
Avork	LOCATION	is in eveiy way a real contribution to the literature of the gi-eat struggle .

		A scientific Professor
Holtzmann	PERSON	's ` Life of biography Jesus / published in
Germany	LOCATION	in of Jesus .


1901	DATE	, now appears in an English translation -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book represents an effort to present the trustworthy picture of the life of Jesus that it is felt historical science is under obligation to provide , and the point of view is therefore strictly that of scientific crit - icism .

		The work exhibits thorough acquaintance with the sources , Jewish as Avell as Christian , and Avith the literature of the subject .

		More - over , the writer possesses to a good degree the sATupathy and insight necessary for such a task .

		As sources for the life of Jesus , he recognizes the Synoptic Gospels , or rather their sources , the Gospel of Mark and MatthcAv 's collection of sayings which was used by all three
Synop	PERSON	- tics .

		` The fii ` st and best source is ahvays the Collection of Discourses ; the next best is the Gospel of Mark ' -LRB- p. 32 -RRB- .

		The ` Gospel accord - ing to the Hebrews ' is reckoned ` one of the primary soureesi we possess for the life a # Jesus ' -LRB- p. 52 -RRB- .

		While Professor
Briggs	PERSON	is found - ing his chronology of Jesus 's ministry upon
John	PERSON	's references to various feasts .

		Professor
Holtzmann	PERSON	is dismissing the fourth Gospel as a mere Avork of art , and describing the sorry tat - ters that we possess of the lost ` Gospel accord - ing to the Hebrews ' as ` certainly equal as a source to the
Johannine Gospel	ORGANIZATION	in value ' -LRB- p. 46 -RRB- .

		Surely the truth lies between these posi - tions .


Holtzmann	PERSON	's Greek feeling is clearly at fault when he appeals to the saying of Salome in the lost ` Gospel according to the Egyptians , ' ` Then have I done well in that I have not borne children , ' for the words may as Avell be read ` Then had I done well not to bear children '' ? '

		The contradiction betAveen this fragment and the Synoptic tradition as to Salome -LRB- Mt. 27:56 , Mk .

		15:40 -RRB- is factitious .

		Memoirs of To those interested in that some - a French what pei-plexing conflict knoAvn as dragoon officer .

		^ ^ ^ - ^ ^ ^ ^ f ^ ^ ^ Spanish Succes - sion , Mr.
Walter C. Horsley	PERSON	's translation of a now little-known French Avork , Avhich he styles in English ` The Chronicles of an Old Cam - paigner , 1692-1717 ' -LRB- Button -RRB- , will be welcome .

		The author of these ` Memoires , ' he tells us , is
M. de la Colonic	ORGANIZATION	, and nowhere in the book have we come upon his full name , Avhich from other sources Ave learn to be Jean-Martin de la Colonic .

		He Avas a native of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, and early entered the service of
Maximilian Edward	PERSON	, Elector of BaA-aria , and ally of
France	LOCATION	in the war that resulted in seating Philip of
Anjou	LOCATION	on the Span - ish throne .

		La
Colonie	LOCATION	afterward became field - marshal and distinguished himself under Prince
Eugene	PERSON	at the siege of
Belgrade	LOCATION	.

		Returning to
Bordeaux	LOCATION	and to private life after the stiiTing events of this chronicle , he devoted himself to historical studies and published , besides the book under discussion , & ` Cui'ious History of the Town and ProAunc `` of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	. '

		His liter - aiy output seems to have met Avith consider - able favor , as several editions of the ` Memoires * appeared in his lifetime .

		Mr.
Horsley	PERSON	names
Brussels	LOCATION	,
1737	DATE	, as the place and date of the first publication of this Avork ; but Ave find record of an earlier edition , apparently the first one ^ issued at Fi'ankfort in
1730	DATE	.

		The book is pre - eminently for military men , being devoted to the details of battles and sieges , of marches and counter-marches .

		Other readers Avill find it tiresomely prolix .

		Both translator and printer appear to have done their Avork well .

		Portraits , plans of battles , and a copious index are duly provided .

		The problems lu the preface to Mr.
Frank L.	PERSON	of Modern McYev 's ` Modern Industrialism * Industrialism .

		-LRB- Appfeton -RRB- , the author confesses that it were indeed a bold task to consider such an inclusive subject Avithin a single volume .

		He confines himself , therefore , to shoAving , first , the essential elements of the industrial histoiy in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and Gennany ; sec - ond , to pointing out some of their complications ; and , third , to discussing certain consequent prob - lems of administration .

		The reader is initiated into the discussion thi-ough a surA ^ ey of the sub - ject , a general comparison of the methods of pro- duction at various times and in different places .

		He is then shoAvn pai ` ticularly the industrial changes which have taken place within the three countries Avhich the author purposes to consider .

		Thence he is led through a more detailed and extremely interestuig account of present indus - trial conditions , and the institutions
Avhieh	PERSON	are the outcome of them .

		Logically , questions arise as to the correction of certain evils , and solutions are clearly and concisely offered from the point of view of State interference , regulation , and government OAvnership .

		Mr.
McVey	PERSON	's conclusion as to present conditions , especialh '' in the
United States	LOCATION	, are somewhat ominous ; and yet his out - look for the future can be considered in no way pessimistic .

		His book , on account of its fairness and balance , deserves to be Avidelj ' ^ read ; and it can hardly fail to create in its readers a livelier interest in industrial conditions .

		Mr.
Charles A. Eastman	PERSON	's ` Red TaT/Sr Hunters and the Animal People ' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is likely at ni-st to be a little disappointing , it is so plain , so lacking in art or artifice .

		After Mr.
Long	PERSON	and Mr.
Thomp	PERSON	- son-Seton , it is like bread-and-butter after des - sert .

		But it nearly , if not quite , justifies the simile , for if the reader sustains his interest long enough his taste will approve the rather homely fare .

		Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	, as is well knoAvn , is an educated
Sioux Lidian	PERSON	, but he does not pose , even upon that vantage-ground .

		That it is a A'antage - gTound , lioweA-er , is sufficiently clear .

		Familiarity Avith the wild tribes has doubtless bred in him some coolness with regard to crack - ing bones and floAving blood ; but it has not bred cruelty .

		The Indian -- at least the good Indian -- belieA ^ es that he should not kill unless he needs food .

		He thinks that ` all the tribes of eartli

PTAT	ORGANIZATION	.

		159 have some common feeling , ' and he is not ashamed to go to the beaver and the wild-cat , the bear and the deer , to consider their waj 's and be wise .

		He shares his catch with the wolf that has pointed out the prey , and spares the mountain ewe and her lamb .

		He remains friends with the eagle that has saved his life , and for the sake of that friendship he never kills one of the eagle-folk .

		He smokes the pip > e of peace over his fallen enemy the grizzly , and leaves handfuls of cut tobacco beside the two elk who have fought to the finish , ` returning to camp empty-handed out of respect for the brave dead . '

		` And who is the grandfather of these sUent people ? '

		he asks .

		` Is it not the Great Mystery ?

		For they know the laws of their life so well !

		They must have for their Maker our Maker .

		Then they are our brothers ! '

		This spirit of imderstanding and of awe lifts Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	's stories , plain as they are , far above the ordinary in interest and significance .

		An English ' The Adventures of King James IT .

		monarch 's of
England	LOCATION	' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is the adventures .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ q ^ j , ^ y an unnamed author , but with an introduction by the Right Rev.
F. A. Gasquet	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	.

		The work is slightly tinged with a Catholic bias , but is on the whole very fair in its statement of events and impartial , if sometimes original , in its judgment of men .

		The life of
James II.	PERSON	, heretofore little known save for the three years he was
King	PERSON	, furnishes many striking situations , and of these the author has made the most , placing special emphasis on
James	PERSON	's adventures in the armies of Turenne and
Conde	LOCATION	, his ser \ - ices as head of the English navy , and his genuine religious conviction , centred at first in alliance to the established church , later to Catholicism .

		The customary judgment of his - tory that James 11 .

		had much less real ability than his brother as a ruler , is here denied , and in fact Charles 11 .

		is throughout regarded as a trifler , swept unresistingly along by the current .

		The book is in no sense a history , but is rather a characterization , the reader 's knowledge of lead - ing political events being taken for granted .

		This is in some slight degree confusing at times , but the fault is more than compensated for by a wealth of intimate anecdote not permissible in a more formal history .

		The value of the book is much increased by the inclusion of several beau - tiful portraits .

Frederick Litchfield	PERSON	has sup - plemented his more exhaustive and theoretical history of antique furniture with a practical appendix treating only the comparatively mod - em kinds of old furniture , such as the collector of ordinary means might wish to identify or to purchase .

		This limitation excludes everything earlier than the sixteenth century , as well as the magnificent pieces of later i -RRB- eriods in which only the millionaire collector or the museum would have an acquisitive interest , and centres attention on the domestic furniture of the last three hundred years , -- Renaissance , French , Ital - ian , Dutch , and particularly English .

		Mr.
Litch	PERSON	- field offers numerous hints , cautions , and su ^ es - ticms , calculated to put the reader on his guard and assist him in making intelligent choice in purchasing ; and a glossary of technical terms used in connection with furniture will enable him to consult catalogues and written descriptions of old furniture intelligently .

James Bryce	PERSON	, is republished by the
MacmiUan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a new edition , enlarged and revised throughout , with a chronological table of events , and three maps .

		It is now forty years since the first appearance of this work , and its qualities of sterling historical judgment and masterly philosophical condensation seem likely to keep it a standard work for at least another forty years .

		` The
Napoleon Myth	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
Henry Bidgely Evans	PERSON	, is described as ` an occult study , ' and is a curious contribution to the history of the
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic legend .

		It is accompanied by a translation of the ` Grand Erratum , ' in which Jean-Baptiste Peres , writing in

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 214 A GENTLE MAN 'S LIBRARY .

		Charles Lamb 's reckoning of the books * no gentleman 's library should be without ' would require some modifications to fit with our mod - ern notions .

		Giblx -RRB- n would still occupy a place in that supposititious collection , and possibly
Hume	PERSON	.

		But we have our doubts about
Robert	PERSON	- son ,
Beattie	PERSON	, and
Soame Jenyns	PERSON	.

		The last - named person may have l -RRB- een , as
Burke	PERSON	said of him , ' one of those who wrote , the purest English , that is , the most simple and alwrigi - nal language , the least qualified with foreign impregnations , ' but the present age knows him not .

		Paley 's ` Moral Philosophy ' and the ' Histories of Flavins Josephus -LRB- that learned Jew -RRB- ' may possibly still fill nooks in the libraries of ` modern gentlemen , ' but they are there as corporeal hereditaments , not as pur - chases made of purpose prepense . '

		Scientific Treatises ' are to 1 -RRB- e found in great numbers , to be sure , but how different a matter is their science from that comprised in the term as
Elia	LOCATION	understood it !

		As for the miscellaneous items in Lamb 's catalogue -- ' Court Calendars ,
Directories	ORGANIZATION	, Pocket-Books ,
Draught Boards	ORGANIZATION	, bound and lettered on the back , Almanacs , Statutes at Large ' -- they have their modern analogues , no doubt , for the type they represent is persistent .

		A revised version of the essay - ist 's list , adapted to our own American day and generation , might run somewhat as follows : Blue Books ,
City Ordinances	LOCATION	, Automobile Cata - logues , and
Club Registers	ORGANIZATION	, the ' works ' of Bal - zac ,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	, and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in uni - form library sets -RRB- , the Messages of the Presi - dents ,
Ben Hur	PERSON	, the Best Literature of the Uni - verse -LRB- sold by subscription -RRB- , and the writings of Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	.

		And of such a list the l > ook-lover might ; < ay as
Lamb	PERSON	said of his own : ' With these exceptions , I can read almost anything .

		I bless my stars for a taste so catholic , so unexcluding . '

		Tlie ` things in books ' clothing ' that perch upon our modem shelves offer a variety of vac - uity and a hollowness of pretension of which Lamb could hardly have dreamed .

		We were speaking not long ago of the ingenuity of sub - scription publishers in inventing new sorts of ' Libraries ' -- oratory , sermons , poetr -RCB- ' , wit and humor , elegant extracts , and what not -- and of the skill of their agents in foisting these choice products of the printer 's trade upon unwary or easily gullible victims .

		The nefari - ous business goes merrily on , and the commer - cial energ -RCB- ' which prosecutes it shows no signs of al > atement .

		What a legacy is being prepared for the inheritors of these showy stores of literary hmilDcr !

		What a time ` the child in the house ' is going to have as he grows up : and the roots of his young life strike blindly through this mould in their search for nutri - ment I We have often reflected upon the melancholy fortune of that luckless child .

		His predecessor of a generation or two ago -LRB- con - 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, cerning whom the literature of biography has revealed so many interesting particulars -RRB- had access to no great store of books , but , however restricted the pasture afforded for his brows - ings , there was a fair chance that it would yield a ' Gulliver , ' or a '
Tom Jones	PERSON	, ' or a ' Eob - inson Crusoe , ' and very likely all three of them .

		A ` Pilgrim 's Progress , ' an ` Arabian Nights , ' and a Fox 's ' Martyrs ' were pretty sure to be found in cupboard or garret , clothed in respect - able ancient garb , redolent of mystery and romance .

		The battered
Shakespeare	PERSON	and the few old ` Waverleys ' that rarely failed to be discovered somewhere offered a passport to the whole realm of the imagination , and were fed upon as manna from heaven .

		With such incitements , the instinct of youth was wont to grope its way toward the light of literature , and to build up wholesome tastes upon the most solid of foundations .

		How different is the fate of the modern youth !

		To begin with , he is sent to the school of our new mechanical fashion , and scientific pedagogy wreaks its will upon him .

		He is taught ` literature ' -- Heaven save the mark !

		-- by means of manuals and ingeniously-chosen texts , and his soul revolts .

		That this particu - larly obnoxious form of worriment should have any real relation to life , let alone to pleasur - able experience , is the last idea that ever enters his mind .

		Left to his own devices he might have found his way into many a treasure-house or pleasance of letters , but once having learned to look upon authors and their work as ticketed and classified objects of study , he relegates lit - erature to the list of disagreeable things that the tyranny of his elders forces him to endure for a season , but that no rational boy or girl would think of counting among the pleasures of life .

		With much toilsome constraint of his tender childish faculties he has been taught to read , and then he is given literary apples of Sodom for the reward of his labors and the disenchantment of his sense .

		Later in life , when the pressure of his environment forces him to find something to read , he wastes him - self upon inanities ; the vulgarity of the news - paper becomes his intellectual pabulum , the triviality of the popular magazine his means of mental recreation .

		Meanwhile , books -LRB- of a sort -RRB- have been all around him .

		If his lot has been cast among the well-to-do , he has had within his reach the ' gentleman 's library ' of our theme .

		If not , he has had its humbler analogue , the bookcase filled with spoil of the department store and the bargain sale .

		Xow the trouble with this ' gentleman 's library ' -LRB- and its cheap substi - tute -RRB- is that it is woefully undiscriminating .

		The proportion of wheat to chaff , of bread to sack , is so small that the ' child in the house / even if his healthy natural instincts have es - caped perversion at the hands of his pedagogues , has small chance of finding the wholesome nourishment that the family bookshelves would still probably afford if put to the right uses .

		Moreover , the very idea of literature is cheap - ened and vulgarized by the quantity of printed matter thus easily to be got at .

		How can books be precious things if multiplied in this reck - less fashion , and thrust upon a child 's atten - tion from all sides ?

		And how can any mere book in covers hope to compete with the glories of the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper with its colored comic supplements ?

		The ' gentleman 's library ' of Lamb 's detes - tation was not , we shrewdly suspect , a source of great literary satisfaction to its possessor .

		It was the mark of respectability , of station in life , and perhaps of affluence .

		Its modern prototype is the mark of all these things , dis - played with an exaggeration of pretension that comports with the other aspects of modern extravagance .

		It is apt to be viewed by its owner as so much furniture bought by the yard , as so much binding made to match the other upholstery .

		It may be safely averred that the books it contains are not read .

		In some cases , the notion of their being read is flouted by their very appearance .

		We recall certain edi - tions of
Dickens	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	and Shake - speare designed for the very purpose of making it impossible to read them .

		Such books are architecture , not literature ; the amateurs of editions de liLxe may describe them as ' noble tomes , ' and take pride in their possession , but the lover of books -LRB- in the Avarm human sense -RRB- would not have them as a gift .

		But whether physically readable or not , these collections of ' authors ' stand on the shelf unhandled , and grow from year to year with the incapacity of their owners to enjoy the bounty which literature so liberally offers to its elect .

		Like the schoolboy of whom it was said that much classical study had given him no a.cquaintance with Greek and Latin , but only the firm conviction that those languages existed , so the ' gentleman ' whose ' library ' we are now discussing may be said to have a firm conviction that the ' authors ' exist , but no notion whatever of the reason for their exist - ence .

		Thus is education justified of her chil - dren ; thus , in other words , does the mechani - cal teaching of facts about literature bear fruit in the mechanical acquisition of ` standard sets , ' for the encouragement of the sharp - sighted manufacturer of books and the faithful editorial hacks whom he employs .

		That our modern multiplication of editions is the index to a corresponding increase in literary culture
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 and appreciation is about the last hypothesis that would be framed by a philosopher seeking to account for the ` gentleman 's library ' as it exists in our dav and generation .

		SHAKESPEARE 'S ^ SECONT -RRB- BEST BED . '

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		A writer in the issue of The Dial for
March 1	DATE	refers to the clause in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's will by which he left to his wife his ` second best bed ' ; a clause that has been often mentioned as indicat - ing that the poet had but little affection for his partner in life and the mother of his children .

		I have never seen in print any explanation of a testamentary disposition that was not uncom - mon , I believe , in wills of that period ; but there is an explanation which , I think , is perfectly satisfactory , and which relieves the poet of the imputation of having put a slight on his wife .

		The question has often been asked .

		If Shakes - peare really entertained affection for his wife , why did he not leave her his best bed ?

		The answer is that under an existing custom which had the force of law he had no power to do so , the best bed of a land-owner being an heirloom , a species of personal property which upon the death of the proprietor goes along with the land to the heir , and of which the heir can not be de - prived by a last will and testament .

		` The term heirloom , ' according to
Bouvier	PERSON	's Law Dictionary , ` is applied to those chattels which are considered as annexed and necessary to the enjoyment of the inheritance . '

		It in - cludes title papers to lands , together with the chest in which they are contained , the keys of a house , fish in a pond , deer in a park , family tomb - stones and moniunents , family portraits , pews in churches , etc. .

		In
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time the best bed of a land - owner was an heirloom by custom recognized as law in many parts of
England	LOCATION	.

		Thus Sir
Edward Coke	ORGANIZATION	, who was a contemporary of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, says : ` And note that in some places chattels as heirlooms -LRB- as the best bed .

		table , pot , pan , cart and other dead chattels movable -RRB- may go to the heire and the heire in that case may have an action for them at the common law ' -LRB-
Coke	ORGANIZATION	on
Littleton	LOCATION	, IS a , 18 b ,
L. I. C. Sec	ORGANIZATION	.

		12 -RRB- .


Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	gives in quaint language the reason why heirlooms can not be bequeathed by will .

		He says : ` Yet they -LSB- heirlooms -RSB- being at his -LSB- the testator 's -RSB- death instantly vested in the heir , the devise -LRB- which is subsequent and not to take effect till after his death -RRB- shall be postponed to the custom whereby they have already descended ' -LRB- 4
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	's Commentaries , p. 429 -RRB- .

		That this custom was regarded in drawing the will of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and that the wUl does not in the least tend to show that he was wanting in natural affection for his wife , would seem to be obvious .

		Thackeray d *
America	LOCATION	.

		* Those of us who are like Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	in being able to say of
Thackeray	PERSON	, ' G'est mon homme / have been particularly fortunate of late .

		The recently-published ' Letters of Thack - eray to an American Family ' and
Grcneral James Grant Wilson	PERSON	's '
Thackeray	PERSON	in the
United States	LOCATION	' are books of quite exceptional interest .

		As to the first , it may be with a somewhat uneasy gratitude that we accept what is offered us .

		The old question of our right to such a gift arises with peculiar insistence in the case of
Thackeray	PERSON	, whom we know to have shrunk from all that biography and its accompaniments im - plied to him .

		It would decidedly simplify this and similar problems for us , and help besides to dispose of one of the most troublesome points of literary ethics , if we could be given some oppor - tunity of proving our fitness for the privilege we enjoy .

		There would doubtless be some diffi - culties in the way of devising a suitable plan for the establishment of our qualifications , as well as in the selection of those entrusted with , the duty of applying the test .

		Even an authorized biographer -- as in the case of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, for ex - ample , -- might not give universal satisfaction if appointed as a judge of candidates ; nor would all the advantages of intimacy and collaboration have rendered
Henley	ORGANIZATION	entirely acceptable to sill Stevensonians .

		The suggestion , it must be ad - mitted , is not very practicable .

		Our reading of letters will probably continue unlicensed , and those of us who have importunate consciences can , as Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	puts it in his discus - sion of the
Browning Letters	ORGANIZATION	, atone for our en - joyment of contraband goods by vigorously abus - ing the smuggler .

		Yet in some cases that atonement fails to be complete .

		In reading Thackerars letters we should be the better sat - isfied for some definite warrant for considering ourselves other than mere curious impertinents ; and lacking such warrant , it is with a half - guilty pleasure that we welcome the new vol - ume .

		It is not far from a score of years since the publication of the
Brookfield	LOCATION	Letters left little room for further revelation of
Thackeray	PERSON	's per - sonality .

March 16	DATE	, charge of cj ` nicism has bt ` cn silenced , or men - tioned , only to be indignantly disproved .

		In - deed , some of us have l > een so anxious to free the creator of Colonel
Newcome	PERSON	and of
Helen Pendennis	PERSON	from tihe unpleasant connotations of the word ' cynic ' that we have been quite ready to forget what text it was he loved to treat on , and will have it that
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	's '' ^ lion that came out of

		And yet the recollection of Mr.
Den	PERSON	- ceaee and Lady GriflBn , of
Catherine	PERSON	and her Galgenstein , no less than of Colonel iSTewcome and the Lamberts , belongs to a real apprecia - tion of the letters .

		The possibilities of the scBva indigimtio of the satirist bring into higher relief the tenderness that was always part of the man .

		The recently-published ` Letters to an Amer - ican Family ' cover the period from
1852	DATE	, the date of
Thackeray	PERSON	's first visit to
America	LOCATION	, to within a year of his death .

		Writing to -RSB-
\ Irs	ORGANIZATION	.


Brookfield	LOCATION	.

		early in
1853	DATE	, he says : ` Have you heard that I have found Beatrix at
New York	LOCATION	?

		I have basked in her bright eyes ; but ah me !

		I do n't care for her , and shall hear of hex - marrying a
New York	LOCATION	buck with the gi'eatest pleas - ure .

		She is really as like Beatrix as that fellow William and I met was like
Costigan	PERSON	.

		She has a dear woman of a mother , upwards of fifty-five , whom I like the best and think the handsomest , -- a sweet lady . '

		Tlie bright eyes belonged to Miss
Sally Bax	PERSON	- ter , and the
Baxter	PERSON	home at Second Avenue and Eighteenth Street soon became to him ' the
Brown House	ORGANIZATION	, ' the place he had ' learned to love best in
Xew York	LOCATION	. '

		A few weeks after his re - turn he writes from Kensington : ' I hope , please God , that the love and friendship I have had in your family may even go so far as to do some public benefit , -- the remembrance of you all sanctifies your country in my eyes .

		When people speak here sneeringly , as Londoners will talk , I break out indignantly and tell them how much good and worth and love and good-breeding there is in the country of which they talk so flip - pantly .

		And I pray Heaven it may be my chance , as it will be my endeavor , to be a peacemaker between us and you , and to speak good-will toward you . '

		In a letter written after his second visit , he says : ' I felt glad , somehow , to contribute to a thread that shall tie our two countries together ; for though I do n't love
America	LOCATION	, I love Americans with all my heart , -- and I dare say you know what family taught me to love them . '

		It was the press which provoked the qualifica - tion from him ; the newspapers had ' man - aged to offend and insult the most friendly stranger that ever entered our country or quit - ted it . '

		But the journalistic offences , happily forgotten now , were not publicly resented , ex - cept perhaps in the tone of a few sentences in the Eoundabout paper , ` Half a Loaf . '

		The at - titude of the writer , as well as of the man , re - mained ' inciirably friendly to
America	LOCATION	, ' and we have
Ethel Newcome	PERSON	, the heroine into wiiom he translated his American Beatrix , and much of ' The Virginians , ' to remind us of Thack - eray 's visit to the country that hardly more than a decade earlier had served to suggest
Eden	ORGANIZATION	and
Elijah Pogram	PERSON	,
Hannibal Chollop	PERSON	and Jef - ferson Brick to
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		The letters , as was to be expected from the nature of
Thackeray	PERSON	's relations to his corre - s | X -RRB- ndents , chronicle for the most part little but the moods of the writer .

		There are character - istic comments upon ' The Newcomes ' and ' The Virginians ' during the time of their publication .

		` I 'm in low spirits about the Newcomes .

		It 's not good .

		It 's stupid .

		It haunts me like a great stupid ghost .

		It says , why do you go on writing this rubbish ?

		You are old , you have no more inven - tion , etc. .

		Write sober books , books of history ; leave novels to younger folks . '

		And of ' The Virginians , ' he says : ` The book 's clever but stupid ; that 's the fact .

		I hate story-making , -- incidents , surprises , love - making , etc. , -- more and more every day ; and here is a third of a great story done , .

		.

		and noth - ing actually has happened except that a young gen - tleman has come from
America	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	.

		I wish an elderly one could do t ` other thing ... The public does not care about the story , nor about the Virginians ; nor I about either . '

		More plainly in these letters than in any other records , we can see how strangely soon Thack - eray Ijecame old .

		Always , as a writer , removed from youth by a far greater distance than his years would warrant , he seems to find himself an old man at a time when his contemporaries are scarcely yielding to middle-age . '

		I used to have some reminiscences and feelings of youth left Avhen I was 42 ; now I am near 43 , and no grandfather can be more glum .

		I sleep like a monk , with a death 's - head in my room . ' '

		Come , ' ' says the cheerful monitor , `` rouse yourself .

		Finish Newcomes .

		Get a few thousand pounds more , my man , for those daughters of yours .

		For your time is short , and the sexton wants you .

		You have been in this world long enough .

		You have had enough champagne and feasting -- travelling , novel-reading , novel-writing , yawning , grumbling , falling in love , and the like .

		You are too old for these amuse - ments , and what other occupation are jou fit for ?

		Get 200 # a year apiece for your girls and their poor mother , and then come to me . '' '

		What may have been something of an assmnp - tion in earlier days had grown into a realitv ' long before his death .

		In all but brain , he had become prematurely old .

		Dickens , looking at him as he lay in his coffin , noted that his hands were like tliose of a man of eighty .

		As to that ■ w ` hich gives the letters their great - est value to Thackerayans , -- the intimately per - sonal tone of many of the passages , -- comment , as in the case of the
Brookfield Letters	ORGANIZATION	, seems almost an impertinence .

Charlotte	LOCATION	, so hopelessly tiresome at other times , really endurable when she writes it , are all perfect of their kind , and might suc - eessfiilly be used to illustrate the dictimi that
Thackeray	PERSON	was at his best as a letter-writer .

		But the discussion of the charm of these letters , written in grateful affection to his friends , is another matter .

		And to th ^ t it seems most fitting to bring the remembrance of a phrase of Thackera -RCB- - 's own , uttered by the not unduly sentimental critic
Michael Angelo Tirmarsh	PERSON	, -- ' A great clapping of hands is but a coarse sort of s -RCB- `` mpathy . ''

		General
Wilson	PERSON	's long-expectetl volmues are the outcome of his articles on * Thackeray in the
United States	LOCATION	, ' publislied some years ago in ' The Century Magazine . '

		In them he has brought together much interesting material which has heretofore been scattered througliout scores of memoirs and recollections , besides a considerable number of unpublished letters and drawings .

		For the very beautiful form of these volumes , the publishers deserve the gratitude of every lover of artistically-made books ; and the contents will be appreciated by every
Thack	PERSON	- erayan , in spite of the fact that the pleas - ant discursiveness of reminiscence reminds us of
Lowell	LOCATION	's suggestion for an imaginary biography of
Thackeray	PERSON	, modelled on Professor
Masson	PERSON	's
Milton	LOCATION	, and to be entitled ' A
Life of Thackeray	ORGANIZATION	, or Who was Who in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	during the
Second Quarter	DATE	of the
Xineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. '

		A noteworthy feature of the many excellent illustrations is the number of portraits , from the bust of
Thackeray	PERSON	as a boy in
1822	DATE	-LRB- the singular resemblance of which to the later like - nesses in contour and expression must strike every one who has seen the replica in the Xational Portrait Gallery -RRB- , to the posthumotis
Gilbert	PERSON	portrait l ^ elonging to the
Eefomi Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the drawings reproduced , perhaps none is more distinctly Thackerayan than the page - ful of caps drawn for Mrs.
Lowell	PERSON	on board tlie ■

Byles	PERSON	, his hat ; '' the familiar spectacled Titmarsh in his high round cap ; and under the pointed liell - topi > ed headgear in the comer the characteristic legend ' Everybody 's cap . '

		There is a very full liibliography and a list of
Tliackerayana	LOCATION	, the latter c-ontaining the curious error of a substitu - tion of •
Lothair	PERSON	' for '
Coningsby	PERSON	' in a refer - ence to
Thackeray	PERSON	's burlesque of Disraeli .

		Both of
Thackeray	PERSON	's visits to Ameriea were quite uneventful , so that their chief histor -RCB- - , apart from the lectures -LRB- which were successful , though not sensationally so -RRB- , is the record of the pleasant relations established between the novelist and our countrATnen .

		He was fortunate in his associations .

		He saw only the best of us , -- the best side even of slavery .

		A letter to Miss
Perry	PERSON	and her sisters , published for the first time , gives us an attractive glimpse of him at
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and a bit of Emersonian criticism as well . '

		I have done pretty well at
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and am much aflfected by the kindness of a provincial Warrington there , who has done all his might to make me happy and is pleased to regard me with a kindness -- I was going to say admiration , which some folks will not be angry with him for feeling ... The spectacles were moistened somehow by his goodness and attachment -- a fel - low of remarkable reading , too ... He thought so well of us that I was quite frightened , and felt a Domlne non sum dignus .

		Bon Dieu -- how I should like to be as good as that fellow thinks me to be I He gave me
Emerson	LOCATION	's Essays , which I had never read -- have you ?

		They are very wise and benevolent , -- they come to very like conclusions to those which the Worldling who writes these pres - .

		ents to you teaches sometimes -- and as I read honest Emerson I fancy I have known it aU before . '

		Ttiough the
` Brown House	ORGANIZATION	in the Second Avenue ' found no rival , the greatest number of friendships seems to have been formed with the Philadelphians .

		There was talk of a con - sulship in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; and in a letter to Mr.
W. B. Reed	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	comments upon the sug - gestion .

		` There are half a dozen houses I already know in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	where I could find very pleasant friends and company , and that good old library would give me plenty of acquaintances more .

		But , home among my parents there , and some few friends I have made in the last twenty-five years , and a tolerably fair prospect of an honest livelihood , on the familiar
London	LOCATION	flagstones , and the library at the Athenafum , and the ride in the Park , and the pleasant society afterwards , and a trip to
Paris	LOCATION	now and again , and to
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	in the
summer	DATE	.

		-- these are little temptations which make me not discontented with my lot , about which I grumble only for pastime , and because it is an Englishman 's privilege .

		Own , now , that all these recreations here enumerated have a pleasant sound . '

		The consulship , like the wished-for position as the artist of * Pickwick ' after Se ^ Tuour s death in
1837	DATE	.

		and like the seat for
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	that ^ Ir .

		Cardwell filled , twenty years later , is one of the possibilities of
Thackeray	PERSON	's career that set us to wondering liow much we should liave lost or gained by their realization .

		When the ghost of the E-everend
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	, appearing to the writer of the

Dessein	ORGANIZATION	's Hotel in
1862	DATE	, put the question ` How man -RCB- - authors of your present time will last till the next century ? '

		we have no way of being sure how
Thackeray	PERSON	answered the query as far as his own writings were concerned .

		In his estimate of his work there was always a curious mixture of self-distrust and recognition of his powers which makes it difficult to guess how long a lease of fame he would have given himself .

		The question , as most questions will do , has answered itself .

		There are mentioned in the list referred to not far from fifteen hun - dred articles in American periodicals dealing with
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		The interest of readers , if the number of such articles is anything of a guide , appears to show no signs of lessening , but to increase almost yearly ; and
Thackeray	PERSON	- anjs may be well content with the place assigned to their author .

		A
Cooperative History of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Anyone who reads , with due attention , the ` Editor 's Introduction to the Series ' prefixed to the first volume of ' The
American Nation	ORGANIZATION	, ' will agree that therein these truths are held to be self-evident : that a new history of the
United States	LOCATION	, extending from the discovery down to the present time , is needed ; that no such comprehensive work by a competent writer is now in existence ; that , for an intelligent summarizing of the present knowledge of American history by trained specialists , and for a complete work written in untechnical style which shall serve for the instruction and enter - tainment of the general reader , there is but one method , the cooperative ; that previous efforts of this sort have not been altogether happy ; that this series is to avoid such unfortunate difficulties as were evident in previous ven - tures ; that every volume in tihis series must stand the double test of accuracy and readable - ness ; and that it is the editors function to see that the links of the chain are adjusted to each other , end to end , and that no considerable subjects are omitted .

		All these bold statements of fact and inten - tion we find in the editor 's introduction .

New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		where we learn that assistance has been received from various historical societies , notably those of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and
Texas	LOCATION	.

		The selection of the authors of the individual volumes -LRB- of which there are to be twenty-six in all , with one volume of index and one of maps -RRB- seems to have been entirely the editor 's function , and most of the choices made are happy .

		The whole series is divided into five groups , each of which deals with an important epoch in American history .

		The division into groups , volumes , and chapters makes in itself a topical analysis of no small value .

		As would be expected , each volume contains an author 's preface ; besides this , however , to each volume lie editor contributes another intro - duction .

		Here in a pleasant manner Professor
Hart	PERSON	tells the reader what he will find in the volume , how important this is , how the author has emphasized this or that point , and how the matters discussed in this volume are to be ' linked ' to those treated elsewhere .

		This part of the work may be serviceable to many readers who share the prevailing hunger for predi - gested food ; the same idea is followed out in another cooperative history of
America	LOCATION	now in course of publication .

		It does not seem , how - ever , to be a characteristic of the best of those European collaborations which in other respects have been models to the editor of ' The Ameri - can Nation . '

		From the general plan outlined by the editor we turn to the individual volumes .

		Somewhat in the nature of a prelude is Professor Chey - ney 's ' European Background of American His - tory , 1300-1600 . '

		The author of this volume has had a difficult task , and has done it admir - ably .

		It is his part to tell , without too much detail , .

		a story already familiar and covering a number of widely different subjects .

		This he must do without impairing the accuracy of his work or losing the reader 's interest .

		Beginning with the later mediaeval period , he traces the growth of commerce , exploration , and discov - ery , the work of
Portugal	LOCATION	and of
Spain	LOCATION	, and the political institutions of the great states of
Europe	LOCATION	that later were the chief colonizers .

		Then follows a fresh and succinct discussion of the rise and influenc-e of commercial and col - onizing companies .

		After this , the narrative returns to the European centre , and sketches briefly the course of the Eeformation on the Continent and in
England	LOCATION	.

		The last part of the volume deals Avith the constitution , and especially with the local government , civil and ecclesiastical , of
England	LOCATION	, the necessary pro- legomena to the constitutional history of the English colonies in
America	LOCATION	.

		From the very nature of Professor Chey -
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		191 nej ^ 's work , it is not to be expected that all parts of it shall be equally the results of per - sonal investigation , or based upon other tiian secondary materials .

		The story is told dehght - fully and with care ; but the necessity for com - pression causes occasionally a lack of clearness .

		For example , with reference to the constitu - tion of the
London	LOCATION	Company under the charter of
1609	DATE	, the author states : ` The form of government of the Company in
England	LOCATION	received much attention in the charter , as well it might after the failure of the arrange - ments of the former charter .

		The membership , quarterly assemblies of the general body of the members , more frequent meetings of a governing council of fifty-three officers , and their duties , were all minutely formulated ' -LRB- pp. 151-2 -RRB- , As a matter of fact , the provision for the quarterly courts was included in the third charter , that of
1612	DATE	, which is not mentioned by Professor
Cheyney	LOCATION	at all .

		We are now ready for the play to begin ; but must wait , for here follows Professor Far - rand 's volume upon ' The Basis of
American History	ORGANIZATION	. '

		This inevitably breaks the conti - nuity of the narrative .

		We pass from English history and institutions to the physical features , flora and fauna , prehistoric inhab - itants , and Indian tribes of
America	LOCATION	.

		The author himself informs us that his ta ^ sk has been one of condensation , and the results are especially evident in the fijst third of the vol - ume , which is somewhat below the general aver - age of interest .

		For example , the statistics upon pp. 48-53 do not gain by being printed out instead of being tabulated in figures .

		The chief service of this portion of the book will be its suggestiveness and the references in Pro- fessor
Farrand	LOCATION	's excellent bibliography .

		As to the much-vexed questions of American anthropolog -RCB- ' and ethnology , -- the genuineness of human remains in tertiary deposits , the evi - dences of pre-glacial man , the identity of the mound-builders , and the origin of the Ameri - can Indian , -- Professor
Farrand	PERSON	takes a con - servative position , and approves the prevailing skepticism .

		Likewise , in his chapters upon the Indians , he controverts many popular generali - zations , such as the exaggerated estimate of the power of the chief , the idea of the complete subjection of the squaw , the misunderstanding of the Indian 's ' stoicism ' with respect to pain .

		These are examples of a widespread misinfor - mation ; and in the relations of the whites to the Indians , and especially in the policy of the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	, the mistakes of history are seen to have been due to ignorance and folly rather than to deliberate ill-intent .

		Having listened to the prelude and scrutin - ized the play-bill , - we welcome the story of action , which begins with Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's volume on *
Spain	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	. '

		A few pages of prolegomena lead us at once to the life of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		The author holds the recent attack of
Vignaud	PERSON	upon the genuineness of
Tosca	LOCATION	- nelli 's letters to
Columbus	LOCATION	to have been unsuc - cessful , but believes that , if genuine ^ the letters did not give
Columbus	LOCATION	much information , -- at most , they only turned his mind to the problem .

		The story of his long endeavor to gain the support of the Spanish monaichs is abbreviated , and we are soon brought to the eve of the great voyage .

		` The son of the humble woollen-weaver of
Genoa	LOCATION	has gone far in twenty years .

		He is now a noble , and a high official in an ancient monarchy , and intrusted with a unique mission .

		Yet all depends upon the chances of the voyage whether these honors shall fade away in the mists of the
Sea of Darkness	ORGANIZATION	, leaving the mere shadow of a name , like
Ugolino de Vivaldi	ORGANIZATION	, in some such record as this : ``
Christopher Colonus	PERSON	, a Ligurian , proposed to pas3 over to the Indies by way of the west .

		After he left the
Canary Islands	LOCATION	, no news was heard of him / ' or whether his name shall have eternal celebrity as the discoverer of the New World .

		No man ever faced chances of fortune so extreme .

		On the other hand , no sovereign ever secured imperial domain at so slight a sacrifice as Isabella of
Castile	LOCATION	.

		Her venture was small -- a few thousand dollars and presumably empty honors to an impor - tunate visionary whose utterances seemed mere `` fables '' ' -LRB- pp. 18-19 -RRB- .

		This is a fair sample of the many striking summaries of events and characterizations of individuals which one finds throughout the book .

		Of similar impressiveness is the author 's final estimate of
Columbus	LOCATION	-LRB- pp. 82-83 -RRB- , the comparison of
Columbus	LOCATION	with
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- pp .

		127-128 -RRB- , the outline of the new conditions that confronted the explorer in Yucatan -LRB- p. 151 -RRB- , the conclusions as to Amerigo Ves - pucci -LRB- p. 103 -RRB- , and the resume of the results attained after three generations of conquest -LRB- ch .

		xiii -RRB- .

		The narrative of exploration takes up , roughly , two-thirds of the volume ; the remainder is devoted to an account of Spanish colonial policy ^ and of its results as worked out in
Spanish America	LOCATION	, which is even more an original contribution to Ajnerican history than the first part of the work .

		Professor
Bourne	PERSON	's discussion of the
Pace Elements and Social Conditions	ORGANIZATION	in
Spanish America	LOCATION	, and his chap - ter on Spanish Experience with
Xegro Slaves	PERSON	, possess , in addition to their value as history , a peculiar usefulness for those citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	today who wish to gain insight into the psychology of the Spanish-speaking peoples recently added to our territorial popu - lation , or into the character of those states with which commercial relations will henceforth bring us more and more into contact .

		192 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Professor
Bourne	PERSON	shows that the badly administered justice and the financial corrup - tion found throughout
Spanish America	LOCATION	were in direct violation of the efforts and intentions of the government .

		He gives us a keen criti - cism of the traditional view of
Las Casas	LOCATION	and the Spanish enslaving of Indians .

		Las Casas he calls ` the
Lloyd G-arrison	PERSON	of Indian rights . '

		` It is as one-sided to depict the Spanish Indian policy primarily from his pages as it would be to write a history of the American negro question exclusively from the files of the `` Liberator , '' or after a century of American rule in the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines to judge it solely from the anti-imperialistic tracts of the last few years ' -LRB- p. 257 -RRB- .

		Xot only did
Spain	LOCATION	begin negro slavery in the New World ; she also furnished the first abolitionist .

		Before either the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Quakers or Judge
Sewall	PERSON	had made their pro- tests , the
Jesuit Alphonso Sandoval	PERSON	in the beginning of the seventeenth century attacked both the institution and the trade in his work ' De Instauranda Aethiopum Salute . '

		The last chapter gives a sketch of the trans - mission of Spanish culture to the
New World	LOCATION	, and leads to this conclusion : ` If we compare Spanish America with the
United States	ORGANIZATION	a hundred years ago , we must recognize that while in the North there was a sounder party politic , a purer social life , and a more general dissemination of elementary education , yet in
Spanish America	LOCATION	there were both vastly greater wealth and greater poverty , more imposing monu - ments of civilization , such as public buildings , institutions of learning , and hospitals , more popu - lous and richer cities , a higher attainment in certain branches of science .

		No one can read
Humboldt	PERSON	's account of the
City of Mexico	LOCATION	and its establish - ments for the promotion of science and the fine arts without realizing that , whatever may be the superiority of the
United States	LOCATION	in these respects , they have been mostly the gains of the age of steam ' -LRB- pp. 315-316 -RRB- .

		` The Spanish American peoples have lacked the inspiration of united action , and their resources and powers have been frittered away in intestine quarrels .

		If the formidable apparition of the ever extending
United States	LOCATION	draws them together for mutual defense ; if the construction of railroads sufficiently overcomes the great geographical impedi - ments to unity ; if the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	shall servo the temporary purpose of protecting them from foreign attack during this period of mutual approach -- there may yet arise a great Spanish -
American federal State	ORGANIZATION	, the counterpart of the
United States	LOCATION	, to become a wholesome check on the indefinite absorption of alien lands and peoples to the south , and the home of a great people which with the infusion of new blood will free itself from the evils of its earlier life while preserving the best of the heritage from
Spain	LOCATION	' -LRB- pp. 317-318 -RRB- .

		In the volume on ' England in
America	LOCATION	, ' President
Lyon G. Tyler	PERSON	has given us a scrupu - lously fair and a very interesting work .

		The field is one in which there have been many workers , and this volume does not exhibit the freshness of scholarship that characterizes Pro- fessor
Bourne	PERSON	's work .

		The author gives us no detailed study of institutional growth , but a general narrative .

		Here one inevitably com - pares President
Tyler	PERSON	's work with that of the late Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	, with results not at all to the disadvantage of President
Tyler	PERSON	.

		Captain
John Smith	PERSON	's deeds are told at some length , and President T \ ` Ter finds time to make a plea for the Pocahontas story .

		The progress of
Virginia	LOCATION	after 1G24 is made more clear than is usually the case .

		The chapter upon
Mary	PERSON	- land and the thorny questions of religion exhibits admirable calmness of judgment .

		The account of
New England	LOCATION	shows no lack of appreciation of the sterling qualities of the Puritan society , though the tone is by no means that of the ' hagiology ' of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	his - torians .

		There is little room for detailed dis - cussions , so we find still ' Tlie introduction of negro slavery ' in
1619	DATE	, with no reference here or in the bibliography to Dr.
Ballagh	PERSON	's strong argument that this was not ' slavery ' in the later sense of the term .

		Again , to the struggle of Lord
Baltimore	LOCATION	with the Jesuits is devoted a single sentence , and Professor
Dennis	PERSON	's val - uable article on this subject is unnoticed .

		The account of the
Fundamental Orders of Con	ORGANIZATION	- necticut is the traditional one , with which it is helpful to compare that of Professor
Osgood	PERSON	in his book on '' The American Colonies . '

		Into a single chapter entitled ' Colonial Neighbors ' is compressed all that is said by President
Tyler	PERSON	about the lieginning of
New France	LOCATION	and of
New Netherland	LOCATION	.

		In the case of
New France	LOCATION	, we are promised a separate vol - ume , '
France	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	, ' by Professor
Thwaites	PERSON	; but that just five pages should be devoted to the narrative of Dutch colonization seems to show a lack of proportion .

		Unfor - tunately , even this condensation is not very successful , for several omissions and inaccuracies are found .

		Hudson receives very meagre treat - ment ;
William LTsselincx	PERSON	's name is not men - tioned except in connection with
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	; the story of the English protest to the States General , in
1621	DATE	, and of the answer of the
Dutch Government	ORGANIZATION	to this protest , is not wholly correct ; the charter to the
West India	LOCATION	Company did not give ' only an exclusive right to trade , ' for , as Professor
Cheyney	LOCATION	points out , it distinctly permitted colonization .


Peter Minuit	PERSON	did not in
1626	DATE	succeed ^ Fay .

		but Yerhulst , who held the directorship after
May	DATE	.

		The charter of privileges and exemptions was granted by the company to the patrooiis , with the approval of the government : hence it is hardly correct to speak of the company ' obtain - ing a new charter ' -LRB- pp. 291-29 .5 -RRB- .

		Finally ,
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		193 tliere is very decided need of ' linking ' '' between the account of
New Xetherland	LOCATION	where Presi - dent Tyler leaves it , and the story where Pro- fessor Andrews takes it up .

		The fifth volume and the last of this group is an account of ' Colonial Self -
Government	ORGANIZATION	' by Prof. C. McL .

		Andrews , which continues through 1G89 the story begun by President
Tyler	PERSON	.

		This is very certainly the best general account of this period that has yet apjjeared .

		One feels that the author not only has intimate acquaintance with the old sources , but also has been fortunate enough to reach considerable new material .

		This appears especially in the clear account of the commercial code of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and of the organs of administration that were developed ; in the description of the successive councils that led up to the perma - nent
Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	and Plantations estab - lished in
1696	DATE	, and of the plans for the control of the colonies and for their union for defensive purposes .

		Professor
Andrews	PERSON	is especially to \ -RRB- G congratulated upon the catholic view of colonial histor \ - that he presents to us .

		As successful as his descriptions of institu - tions is the author 's delineation of personality .

		In the story of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, for example ,
Wil	PERSON	- liam
Penn	LOCATION	's own intentions and acts are kept to the front , yet without any suggestion of hero-worship .


Penn	LOCATION	, we learn , was morally justified in his Iwundary controversy with the Baltimores , but Professor
Andrews	PERSON	's conciession tliat ' the technical right lay with
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and we can not admire
Penn	LOCATION	's inclination to ignore it ' -LRB- p. 247 -RRB- evidences his desire to be absolutely impartial .

		Again , the traditional -RSB- ucture of
Andros	LOCATION	, drawn largely from Xew ICngland sources , is subjected to sharp criti - cism , and we are told that ' as compared with many other colonial governors , he was upright , sympathetic and faithful ' -LRB- p. 93 -RRB- .

		Professor
Andrews	PERSON	finishes his narrative with the stor -RCB- ' of the Eevolution of
1689	DATE	as it devel - oped in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		^
Maryland	LOCATION	, and
Xew York	LOCATION	.

		Of Maseachusetts he states , in conclu - sion : * ^ When in
1691	DATE	a revised charter was granted , it created a government of the type of
Xew York	LOCATION	or
Xew Jerse	PERSON	-RCB- ' , instead of the old | K -RRB- pular government ' -LRB- p. 379 -RRB- .

		A discussion of this charter does not belong to this volume , and still less to the present review , but cer - tainly there were very marked differences between the government of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	under it , and that of
Xew York	LOCATION	.

		The description of the social , economic , and religious conditions within the colonies is here and there hardly so carefully worked out as the study of governmental institutions .

		Though lie refers to President
Tyler	PERSON	's chapter on the subject .

		Professor
Andrews	PERSON	seems to ignore the former 's conclusions as to education in the southern colonies , and to stick fast to Gov - ernor
Berkeley	LOCATION	's well-worn thanksgivings over the non-existence of free schools in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Again the account given of the commercial legislation , which is so helpful in its outline of the purpose of these laws and of their history , is less satisfactorj ' ^ when it comes to telling just how they worked in the different groups of colonies .

		We have tried thus to sum up briefly the general plan of the work and what we may call the individuality of each volume .

		For the out - ward dress of the books we have only praise .

		The volumes are excellently printed , and ser - viceably bound .

		A very few typographical errors have escaped the editor 's watchful eye .

		We find in Volume I. the word ' Geschicte , ' p. 37 , note , has lost an ` h ' ; while `
Wilhelmi	PERSON	' p. 291 , note 1 , has added a spurious * i. ' In Volume IV .

		p. 83 , line 2 , ` or ' should be ` to ' ; and on p. 332 , ` Vestusta ' should be ` Vetusta . '

		In Volume \ .

		, p. 3.53 , '
F. E. Sharp	PERSON	' might effectively hide the identity of '
F. E. Sparks	PERSON	/ which is the correct name .

		We must not omit commendation of the bibliographical matter appended to each volume .

		If we may be permitted a word of criticism of the series as a whole , we feel sure that , by serious students of history , ' The American Xation ' will be rated not as a whole , but vol - ume by volume according to the worth of each .

		Some will hardly be relied upon for reference ; but volumes like that of Professor
Bourne	PERSON	will take their place as standard works .

		For the general reader , if he is not deterred by the enormous amount of matter , by the separate authorship , and by the ga | > 3 that to some extent defy ' linking , ' the work will prove a mine of information interestingly told , well arranged , and attractively published .

		Yet even the gen - eral reader may be very willing to adopt as his final opinion these words of Professor
Jameson	PERSON	, uttered several years ago : ` Stretched upon the Procrustean bed of uniform requirements in respect to extensiveness and general method of treatment , the authors can present only those things which they have in common -- abun - dant and correct information and acute historical criticism .

		Many of the finer qualities of the indi - vidual mind are apt to evaporate in the process , much of what is most valuable in individual views and conceptions of history will find no place for itself .

		No one who appreciates these will readily assent to the assertion in the prospectus to the `` Narrative and Critical History '' that , `` when the superiority of the cooperative method is fully under - stood , the individual historian , if he ventures forth at all , will be read for entertainment rather than for profit .

		* The late

Prin	PERSON	- cess
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, and on the history of the Black - friars Theatre and its boy actors .

		The book is a mine of curious and valuable information .

		Much of it , to be sure , has al - ready found its way into annotated editions of the plays , but Mr.
Elton	PERSON	gives not only his con - clusions on doubtful points , but the arguments that led to them , enriched with illustration drawn from the most out-of-the-way sources .

		Indeed , so much material is furnished , and the learned antiquary ranges so very far afield , that the drift of his argument is not seldom ob - scured .

		Occasionally , also , the process is out of all proportion to the result ; for example , the author devotes a chapter of thirty-four pages to the history of the Blackfriars Theatre and the boy actors because ' The Tempest pos - sibly may have been produced at Blackfriars during the boys ' tenancy of the theatre ' -LRB- p. 479 -RRB- .

		One is far from complaining of the wealth of facts , however meagre the inference ; only , the volimie is hardly one to be read con - secutively .

		The former criticism , however , that the argument is not always clear , seems im - portant , especially when we consider the legal training of the author .

		An example may be found in the discussion of the date of Shakes - peare 's birth -LRB- pp. 22-25 -RRB- , which is neither clear nor cogent , partly , we venture to think , because of incorrect reasoning , and partly be - •

		cause of the awkward handling of material .

		A similar criticism applies , though in a less degree , to the argument for the regularity of the poet 's marriage .

		Compared with Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's discussion of the same subject -LRB- Life of Shakes - peare , pp. 18-24 -RRB- , it is far from convincing . ''

		Time was very pressing , ' Mr.
Elton	PERSON	says -LRB- p. 35 -RRB- , in explanation of an unusual clause in the marriage-license ; and again , though the absence of the bridegroom 's father is a plain suggestion that the marriage was irregular , he asserts -LRB- p. 35 -RRB- that ` one of the two friends would doubtless produce a letter or document bearing
John Shakespeare	PERSON	's signature or at - tested mark . '

		These two statements obviously beg the question .

		Whatever the truth may be , could ironical Fate have played an unkinder trick on literary historians , or have offered a greater temptation to romantic biographers , than to send two
William Shakespeares	PERSON	to the Registry of the Bishop of
Worcester	LOCATION	, on two successive days , to arrange a technically irregu - lar marriage with a lady named
Anne ?	PERSON

		Mr.
Elton	PERSON	appears to hold a brief , more or less , for the respectability of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		The poaching story he scouts : about a hundred years after
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	left
Stratford	LOCATION	for Lon - don , ' someone invented the story of his robbing a park ... The park , in process of time , was identified with
Oharlecot	PERSON	, and the owner with Sir
Thomas Lucy	PERSON	' -LRB- p. 38 -RRB- .

		Nor does he seem convinced that Sir
Thomas	PERSON	is referred to in the Merry Wives and in 2
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the contrary he devotes himself to proving -LRB- pp. 43-45 -RRB- that ' Shakespeare showed a certain respect for the Lucys and such persons bearing their names as he met with in the English chronicles , ' -- for example , the Lady Lucy men - tioned in
Richard III.	LOCATION	, 3.7.5 , and the Sir
Wil	PERSON	- liam
Lucy	PERSON	of 1 Henry VI. , Act .

		4 , Scenes 3 , 4 .

		Like all careful students of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's biog - raphy , as distinguished from the
Brandes	PERSON	school of romancers , he is in general not ' wise above that which is written . '

		We have become so familiarized with the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	legend that we are hardly awaxe , ujitil the facts are stated succinctly and without hypothetical em - bellishment , how very little we know of Shake - speare 's life .

		It is somewhat startling , even to a professed student of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, to read -LRB- p. 26 -RRB- : * The Christian name of his wife and her age ... are knovva only by the inscription on her tomb . '

		Yet , so insidious is the temptation to romance on this ever-fasci - nating topic , that Mr.
Elton	PERSON	, somewhat to our amusement , writes -LRB- p. 38 -RRB- : ` It may be as - sumed that the young couple lived with Mt.
John Shakespeare	PERSON	, and that
Anne Shakespeare	PERSON	helped in the housework , while her husband found something to do , either in teaching school
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 195 or copying papers in a lawyer 's oflBce . '

		Again , he appears to be somewhat incautious in as - suming -LRB- p. 218 -RRB- that the
William Shakespeare	PERSON	who appealed against paying his share of the
St. Helen	ORGANIZATION	's assessment in
1598	DATE	wps the poet .

		Mt. Lee , more careful , says -LRB- p. 38 -RRB- , ` it is not certain that this taxpayer was the dramatist . '

		The facts given by Mr.
Elton	PERSON	himself would seem to render such a doubt reasonable , though probably the wealthy man 's device of ' swearing - off taxes ' was not discovered yesterday .

		In
1598	DATE	, the poet had recently bought New Place , he was a large owner of grain , he was in a posi - tion to be asked by
Eichard Quiney	PERSON	for a loan of thirty pounds , and he was the author of at least eighteen successful plays .

		* If the diflB - culty can be explained at all , ' says Mr.
Elton	PERSON	-LRB- p. 219 -RRB- , ` it will probably be found that the poet had quite recently fallen into debt , lawful debt , which in truth and conscience he intended to pay ' !

		In one interesting particular , the author corrects Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's implication -LRB- p. 4 -RRB- that
John Shakespeare	PERSON	combined farming with the trades of butcher and glover .

		He savs -LRB- p. 319 -RRB- : ` People have talked of
John Shakespeare	PERSON	's mul - tifarious pursuits , suggesting that he farmed in the common-field at
Asbies	LOCATION	, and made up the wool and butchered the stock at
Stratford	LOCATION	; but , in fact , the farm was under lease to a tenant , and he would never have been allowed in any case to join such incongruous trades as those of a butcher and a glover .

		He could not keep a regular meat - shop while trading in skins , and no one haa seriously suggested that he worked about as a slaughterman , though such people were classed among butchers ... The killing of calves was the subject of constant restrictions , and it is certain that the inspectors would put a stop to anything that might injure the veal ; it is almost inconceivable , indeed , that a boy would be allowed to play such pranks in the shambles as the gossips described . '

		The last sentence is an amusing reference to Aubre -RCB- - 's statement that ' when he kill 'd a calf e he would doe it in a high style , and make a speech . '

		Halliwell-Phillipps is probably the source of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's error , if error it is -LRB- Out - lines , I. , p. 30 , II. , p. 339 -RRB- .

		.

		Now and then , on the other hand , the author is perhaps unduly cautious .

		It is generally known that on the identity of the names
Agnes	PERSON	,
Annes	LOCATION	, and
Anne	PERSON	in the sixteenth century , depends the validity of the inference that the
Agnes of Eichard Hathaway	ORGANIZATION	's will was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's wife ,
Anne	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Elton	PERSON	's scepticism as to the identity of the names seems to us unwarranted .

		The will of
Eobert Arden	PERSON	, which refers to his wife ,
Annes	PERSON	, and that of his widow , who calls herself
Agnes	PERSON	, would almost be sufficient .

		The very fact , cited by Mr.
Elton	PERSON	-LRB- p. 29 -RRB- , that early law had decreed the distinction of the names
Anne	PERSON	and
Agnes	PERSON	would seem to prove that they were popu - larly confused , and the examples given in
Halli	LOCATION	- weU-Phillipps ' Outlines -LRB- II. , p. 184 -RRB- show conclusively that they actually were .

		The book , however , abounds in the best kind of biographi - cal material ; for instance , the carefully docu - mented descriptions of the farmer 's condition in the sixteenth century , the appalling duties of the women of his family , and the inventory of the household goods of Eobert Arden -LRB- pp. 114 , 117 , 121 -RRB- , all of which enable us , without baseless assumptions , to reproduce imaginatively the life of the day .

		Not only will the student of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's biography find his account in these papers , but the student of the text as well .

		From the most remote quarters , light is shed on obscure or debated passages .

		Mr.
Elton	PERSON	's researches into agricultural antiquities , for example -LRB- pp. 140 - 147 -RRB- , enable him to explain such technical words as ' land ' -LRB- Ven .

		and Adon. , Ded . -RRB-

		In the interesting discussion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's accurate use of hunting terms -LRB- pp. 166-176 -RRB- , we are incidentally reminded , by a reference to All 's Well , 3.6.111 , that the verb of the maxim , ' First catch your hare , ' should probably be ` case ' -LRB- i. e. , flay -RRB- .

		In this connection it seems doubtful that ` fore - stalled ' -LRB- Haml. , 3.3.49 -RRB- , and ' dislodged ' -LRB- Cor. , 5.4.44 -RRB- , are used with any sense of their signifi - cance as hunting terms -LRB- p. 167 -RRB- .

		The Railway Problem .

		*
Xo	ORGANIZATION	other suhject more fully occupies the attention of the public today than the railway .

		Tliis great network , including in its meshes every community , and carrying to every dck -RRB- r its services , has not needed the criticism of the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	, or even the statements in a recent presidential message , to fix upon it an absorbing i > ublic interest .

		The aSTorthern Securities episode , begun on Wall Street and now continuing in the Federal courts , the spectacular performances in
Rock Island	LOCATION	of the
Moore	PERSON	brothers , the recent absorp - tion one after another of great roads , until now some twenty great combinations control 200,000 miles of line ; the manipulation of the coal roads by the coal barons , the present con - troversy over private cars , the latest rate war between the trunk lines to the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast and the grangers that serve the Gulf , -- all these events are but a few of the phenomena of the railway world of today .

		A great change in public opinion as regards the railways has come about since the enact - ment of the contradictory
Interstate Commerce Act	ORGANIZATION	in
1886	DATE	, and especially since the imex - pected application of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to the railroads by
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in
1897	DATE	.

		The thinking public has come to see that , while the railroad business , like all other businesses , is ojien to the conduct of its affairs in antagonism to the best interests of the whole community , the race of railroad managers has grown with the growth of the country .

		It is no longer possible to find great wreckers in control of these semi-public services , and the railroad presidents of today are , in the main , the very cream of the business ability of the nation .

		Presidents
Cassatt	PERSON	,
Hughitt	PERSON	, Hill , and Fish are of the best , but they are representa - tive .

		These men handle their properties not merely for dividends .

		They recognize the solidarity of the business interests of `` tlie whole country , and Mr.
Hill	PERSON	, distinctively , has been the builder , not oiily of a road , but of a whole industrial empire in the ' new northwest . '

		If there is to be more state regulation , and that seems likely , in deference to a more * The Strategy of Grkat RAtLBOADa By

		enlightened public opinion it will probably attempt not to shackle , but to direct .

		The older methods that threatened to ' kill the goose that laid the golden egg ' will not be repeated .

		Writers such as Professor Xewcomb have so clearly shown how the ton-mile rate has stead - ily declined to a mere fraction , that the charge of wholesale robbery can not longer be gravely maintained .

		Discrimination , under the pressure of great sliippers , to whom the Standard Oil managers notably showed the way , is the evil of today .

		But it can not be handled for abate - ment from the side solely of the railway , and Mr.
Garfield	PERSON	's suggestion of federal incorpora - tion points the way to a possil -RRB- le solution .

		A happy sign of an improving pul -RRB- lic opinion in regard to control of these great public utilities is the appearance in the
last two or three years	DATE	of a literature devoted to the railway problem .

		The Dial had occasion a year ago to review several of the best of these volUmes .

		One of the latest contributions is from the hand of -RSB- \ Ir .


Frank H. Spearman	PERSON	, who like his distinguished pro- totype
Frank Xorris	PERSON	knows how to bring fiction to aid the cause of truth in this field of research .

		The author of ' The Daughter of a Magnate , ' in his latest work , presents a series of industrial pictures of the
Vanderbilt	LOCATION	, the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, the
Harriman	LOCATION	, the Hill , the
Gould	PERSON	, and the old ' granger ' lines , and also glances at
Eock Island	LOCATION	,
Santa Fe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Alton	PERSON	.

		He closes with an account of the building of the line from
Omaha	LOCATION	to
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		He writes with a familiarity with his ` subject that enlightens , and with a style that entertains and fascinates .

		One can hardly say that he holds a brief for the railways , but he frequently puts the telescope to his blind eye -- as when he says , speaking of Mr. C * assatt : ` He determined that rate discrimination in the
United States	LOCATION	, the impoverishment of the investor , the ruin of the honest shipper , and the cause of so many railroad receiverships , should cease , and to the task of putting it down he and his associates addressed themselves ; and after public prints and public speakers had shouted themselves hoarse ; after congress had failed in solving the problem , as it has always failed ; after the courts of the TTnited States had failed , as they have always failed , this railroad man and his associates took the abuse m hand and stamped it out of American railroading . '

		One can only deny the conclusion .

		But the magnificent business ability that has covered this land Avith roads of steel , has outfitted then !

		■ with the most perfect railroad appliances in the world , and has not only squeezed out most of the water of earlier days , but has given , year by year , a cheaper service hand in hand with a better service , is given ample credit in the pages of this advocate .

		One can not dwell

		One can only sigh and wish that the method of - railroading ' might not be applied to one of the most important subjects before the people in the last days of an indolent
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		He must wish rather that the more rational meth - ods of an English parliament might apply , and these important measures l -RRB- e prepared by a commission of wisdom and expert knowledge combined for a legislature humlile enough to be guided by something more than its own esoteric self-conceit .

		Kecext American Poetry .

		* Many a time and oft has the poet essayed to -RSB- nit into words the inexpressible soul of music .

		For the poet who is also a lover of music the temptation is wellnigh irresistible , for he can not fail to recognize that the musi - cian 's art is closely related to his own , and com - plements it in many subtle ways .

		If it be true , as Pater claims , that all art tends to approach the condition of music , and achieves a succ-ess measured by the degree in which it nears this ideal end , then it must seem to the poet more than to other artistic workers a mat - ter of urgency that he possess himself of the musician 's secret and penetrate to the sources of the musician 's inspiration .

		There are vari - ous ways of making music the theme of poetry ; the way most generally accessible is that of recording the emotions awakened by a musical jierformance .

		and pressing into the service such imagery and parallelisms as it suggests .

		which opens his latest volume of verse .

		The following quotation illustrates the method of this writer : ' Light to the eye and Music to the ear .

		-- These are the builders of the bridge that springs From earths dim shore of half-remembered things To reach the spirits '' home , the heavenly sphere Where nothing silent is and nothing dark .

		So when I see the rainbow 's arc Spanning the showery sky , far-off I hear Music , and every colour sings : And while the symphony builds up its round Full sweep of architectural harmony Above the tide of
Time	ORGANIZATION	, far , far away I see A bow of colour in the bow of sound . '

		nius far , the poetic imagination is put to strictlv legitimate uses , but we have some doubt concerning the legitimacy of the analysis that follows . '

		Red as the dawn the trumpet rings .

		Imperial purple from the trombone flows .

		The mellow horn melts into evening rose Blue as the sky , the choir of strings Darkens in double-bass to ocean 's hue .

		Rises in violins to noon - tide 's blue .

		With threads of quivering light shot through and through .

		This is a little too suggestive of the French - man 's fantastical ascription of a definite color to each of the vowels .

		Analogies of this sort are too individually subjective to find any response in the common consciousness : and their valid - ity is consequently questionable .

		The remain - ing iK -RRB- ems in ^ It .

		Van Dyke 's volume take many forms and handle many themes .

		There are odes , sonnets , legends , lyrics , and bits of personal vei ^ e .

		They are delicate and graceful in workmanship , the expression of a refined and sensitive poetic instinct rather than the out - pourings of a creative mood .

		Several poems included in ' The Twin Immortalities , ' by Mr.
Charles E. Russell	PERSON	, attempt the interpretation of music in a far more intimate way than does the ode above mentioned .

		Three of these poems , devoted respectively to certain compositions by Yolk - mann .

		Eubinstein .

		and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, simply seek to find words for the train of feelings and fan - cies evoked by the music .

		The following , for example , from
Volkmann	PERSON	's Serenade in D Minor , is very charming : ' ` White silent depths of moonlight on whose breast The silvered trees Float like dim argosies at dreamy rest On stirless seas ; So still that when the moon sails high The song she sings in that vast sky Seems breathc?d afar on fairy flutes : So still that when her faint strains die Across the depths dim echoes fly Star-touched on throbbing lutes . '

		But it is not in verse of this sort , which manv others have done equally well , that Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's deepest appreciation of music may be found .

		It is rather in the two compositions , '
Graubiinden	PERSON	' and '
Pegli	PERSON	, ' actually written in the classical form of the sonata , that we find 198 THE DIAIi -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, music and poetry brought into the closest pos - sible relations .

		One naturally thinks , reading these poems , of ' Master Hughes of
Saxe	PERSON	-
Gotha	LOCATION	/ land ' A Toccata of
Galuppi	ORGANIZATION	's / but it is chiefly to realize that Mr.
Russell	PERSON	has attempted a more difficult task than
Browning	PERSON	's , and with surprising success .

		Where
Browning	PERSON	gives us a masterly technical description , our present author does not describe at all , but simply writes in conformity with the severe rule of the composer .

		Taking '
Graubiinden	PERSON	' for examina - tion , we find , first of all , that it is a poem in the orthodox four movements .

		Taking the second of these movements , the adagio , Mr.
Eussell	PERSON	's own words may be quoted by way of exposition . '

		The first stanza announces the first theme .

		Then follows a development group of four stanzas leading to the episode in stanza four .

		The first theme is repeated in stanza five , and the next development group leads to the second theme in stanza ten .

		The material of the second theme -- Force and Time -- is then worked out to the eighteenth stanza , when there is a recapitulation of the first theme and a stanza as a coda . '

		So much for the form of this poem ; its subject is provided by the heroic and successful struggle for freedom of the
Grau	PERSON	- bundners in the fifteenth century .

		We can quote but briefly , not at a length sufficient to show how admirably the musical form is imi - tated , but sufficient to make it clear that the poetry does not suffer from having been writ - ten under these exacting conditions .

		Here is the first theme : ' Winds that waft the dead sprays in and out , Winds before whose breath the faint stars shiver , Coldly glimpsed through wild clouds blown about , Now when leaves float brown upon the river .

		Shorn and shot by bolts from out thy quiver .

		Tell me in what dust thy wrath has blown Up and down the weary earth forever Any name or fame of theirs is known . '

		Here is a stanza taken from the working-out of the second theme : ' Even she , our lady , in whose name Faith takes heart again , and , starward turning , Hope in sweetest eyes casts back the flame Ever in her torch uplifted burning .

		She to whom men , turn with that old yearning , Sun and star and goddess .

		Liberty , Beautiful beyond all lore or learning , Sweet as sunrise on the heaving sea . '

		And here we have the recapitulation of the first theme with the coda : ' Wind that blows the cloud-flags far about , Wind that makes the huge storm-trumpets shiver , Wind before whose stern triumphant shout Men are bowed in awe and mountains quiver .

		Give us one great strain of sea or river .

		Fit to sing their praise whose deeds are known .

		Round and round the radiant world forever .

		Grandest strain of all thy lips have blown . '

		Mother Earth , that seest all sons of thine .

		Wind thy tender arms about them sleeping ; Cover them with roses and wild vine Where the river in slow circles sweeping Sings a quiet song for their safe-keeping .

		Bend , O mother , with thy smile above them , Peace in thy mild eyes and with no weeping ; Thou and we have one great cause to love them . '

		But we must not give the impression that Mr ,
Russell	PERSON	stands for experimental expression merely , or that aesthetic considerations alone are raised by his verse .

		He has a very definite social creed , which all his art is bent to enforce .

		It is the creed of democracy , not in the sense of a political shibboleth , but in that of the brotherhood of man , which his book maintains from first to last .

		His work is dedicated to President
Loubet	PERSON	, the ` foremost democrat of these times , ' and the passion of that faith finds exalted expression in such poems as ` Adam 's Sons ' and the ' Coronation Ode . '

		We must quote from both of these poems , choosing in each case the final stanza .

		This is the ending of ` Adam 's Sons ' : ' We have one goal together , you and I : We hear one echo of a wailing cry Incessant raised by sundered soul from soul Left lonely here as we ; And if a land beyond the clouds that roll Or only sleep and dreamless rest there be We know not , O my brother !

		but the dark Lightens a little with this only spark That with clasped hands and hearts we go as one When through the dusk we hear the dim bell toll The day is done . '

		And this is the close of the ' Coronation Ode ' : ' No more of Kings : this is the age of man !

		For you the night is dark , the day means naught ; Wasted for you your heroes ' blood that ran And lost the labor of their hands that wrought .

		The world goes on and leaves you on your knees Mumbling and mouthing to such gauds as these .

		The marchers ' chorus swells ; You hear no hint of all it tells .

		Voice after voice the burden sings sturdy and strong : We tread the wrecks of sceptre and of throne .

		Our feet crush out old faiths of fraud and wrong , We have no crown but liberty alone -- Labor and love are Kings ! '

		It is difficult to end the pleasant task of illus - trating this rich and varied volume of verse .

		One more extract , at least , shall be given , a stanza from the poet 's beautiful tribute to the artist of ' La Bella Simonetta . ' '

		Shall not men 's mightiest as their lightest deeds Be sown beyond us in
Time	ORGANIZATION	's field for seeds , And every word or work be rooted there To make earth red with roses , waste with weeds ?

		What man has died then ?

		Ah , all earth and air Are roseate as with shadow of a flame For him ; the fields are bright with leaf and bloom Sprung from his time of sorrow and grey gloom .

		And men that see the flowerage of his fame Twine chaplets wet with tears tKat keep them fair
Round Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's name . '

		This conception of immortality recurs again and again in Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's work , and is the keynote of the titular poem .

		We hardly need the actual tribute paid to the greatest poet now living in the world to remind us that the influence of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is manifest upon many pages .

		The titular poem in this volume will give a very fair idea of Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	's graceful workmanship .

		`
Helen	PERSON	's lips are drifting dust ;
Ilion	LOCATION	is consumed with rust ; All the galleons of
Greece	LOCATION	Drink the ocean 's dreamless peace ; Lost was
Solomon	PERSON	's purple show Restless centuries ago ; stately empires wax and wane -- Babylon ,
Barbary	ORGANIZATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	; -- Only one thing , undefaced .

		Lasts , though all the worlds lie waste And the heavens are overturned .

		-- Dear , how long ago we learned ! '

		There 's a sight that blinds the sun , Sound that lives when sounds are done .

		Music that rebukes the birds .

		Language lovelier than words .

		Hue and scent that shame the rose .

		Wine no earthly vineyard knows .

		Silence stiller than the shore Swept by
Charon	PERSON	's stealthy oar .

		Ocean more divinely free Than
Pacific	LOCATION	's boundless sea , -- Ye who love have learn 'd It true .

		-- Dear , how long ago we knew ! '

		During his brief life ,
Guy Wetmore Carry !	ORGANIZATION

		was chiefly known to readers at large as a writer of trifles in verse and prose , and it is only since his lamented death that his more serious qualities have been fully revealed .

		The posthumous collection of his verse , entitled • ' The Garden of Years and Other Poems , ' is in spirit far indeed removed from his * Grimm Tales Miade Gay , ' and his ' Fables for the Fxivolous . '

		It is a volume of manly sentiment embodied in facile and vigorous measures .

		The long poem which supplies the title is a con - fession of love in many stanzas , combined with reminiscenc-es of his Wanderjahre .

		We quote a specimen stanza .

		• 'T was in the garden , phantom-trod , of those My younger years , when life before me lay .

		That first I saw the flower of Love unclose From fancy 's folded bud .

		Youth only knows How tenderly I longed to pluck it !

		Xay , I would not waken those dead hours to-day : For
Time	ORGANIZATION	's consuming fire , with lambent lip .

		Has kissed my fair frail flower , and so I may Xot touch with the most careful finger-tip Its ashes , perfect as the unbumt rose .

		Xext in importance to this long poem is the group of five patriotic ballads which follow it , ballads written in a long and swinging rh -RCB- - thm .

		which may be illustrated by the following lines : ' The faithful unto death , their sleeping-places over The torn and trampled clover to braver beauty blows ; Of all their grim campaigning no sight nor sound remain - ing .

		The memory of them mutely to greater glory grews . '

		This volume is peculiarly fortunate in having an introduction by Mr.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	, who in a few felicitous words pays both personal and critical tribute to the author 's memory .

		` Lyrics and Legends of Christmas-Tide ' is the latest of the little books of verse that Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	puts forth from time to time in limited editions .

		There are something like thirty songs in this collection , unpretentiously charming , and filled with the spirit of the sea - son they celebrate .

		Our quotation shall be one of the four stanzas on * Xazareth Town . ' '

		Xazareth town in
Galilee	LOCATION	!

		Strumming a desert melody .

		The Bedouin minstrel trolls in the street ; At the Well of the Virgins the maidens meet ; The cactus-hedges crimson to flower .

		And the olives silver hour by hour As through the branches the south wind steals , A clear bell peals , and a vulture wheels Over the crest where the wild crags be ; -- Xazareth town in
Galilee	LOCATION	! '

		The small volume which contains Mr.
Frank Dempster Sherman	PERSON	's ' Lyrics of Joy ' may be fairly represented by the exquisite poem called *
Winter Dreams	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		Deep lies the snow on wood and field ; Gray stretches overhead the sky ; The streams , their lips of laughter sealed .

		In silence wander slowly by . '

		Earth slumbers , and her dreams , -- who knows But they may sometimes be like ours ?

		Lyrics of
spring	DATE	in winter 's prose Tliat sing of buds and leaves and flowers ; ' Dreams of that day when from the South Comes
April	DATE	, as at flrst she came .

		To hold the bare twig to her mouth And blow it into fragrant flame . '

		Long practice has given Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	a highly - finished technique , and the pieces in this col - lection have the art of true simplicity , or the simplicity of true art -- ^ the phrase fits which - ever way it is taken .

		Somewhat weightier in matter than the poems in the two collections just mentioned ^ -- or at least more elaborate in plan -- are the ' Interludes ' of Mr.
Philip Becker Goetz	PERSON	.

		These poems are written in blank verse which is some - what lacking in lyrical quality , but has vigor and a tang that gives zest to the taste . '

		Astray ' is possibly not so characteristic a specimen as might have been chosen , but it is the appealing embodiment of a thought that must often arise in serious minds . '

		I marvel not that sadder grows the world .

		For men have lost the love of simple things .

		With eloquence of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's music mute .

		With speed of waterways made bond to trade .

		With stately trees brought low for needless heaps .

		200 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, With flowers forced untimely into bloom , -- What is there honest , free , and fair remaining ?

		We stifle in our towns of prisoned air And happy with a rare glance from the earth We see a square of blue or curdled cloud , Or niggard stretch of moonlight through a street .

		At manners of the hill-bound kind we scoff .

		Although we know not what those hills have taught Of dumb and deep contempt for city 's towers .

		And in these keeps of pain , disease , and sin .

		These wards of grief whose keys are our own eyes , With blanched regard we tell ourselves we live .

		O mother of us all , from whom we went As early as our tender steps were free .

		Whose near outstretch of arm we put aside To hurry from thy verdant aisles of peace , Take us again , us sick with thought or craft .

		And lull us with thy choirs of careless birds ; And if there be more tragedy beneath The swell of thy serene , sweet mother breasts .

		Preserve thy silence and thy smile of old , Make merry with thy children as we glance .

		Let perfume charm and wonder awe once more As , leaning to thy heart our tired desires .

		We feel the oblivious beat of speechless love . '

		This may be called belated Wordsworthianism , but the message is even more insistent now than it was a century ago .

		Besides the ' Inter - ludes / of which one has been quoted , Mr.
Goetz	PERSON	's little volume contains ballads , songs , and sonnets , many of them striking in phrase and musical in measure .

		We can not refrain from quoting the sonnet on Virgil . '

		A mere pale boy , who , watching docile sheep On mead and easy upland o'er and o'er , Wove many songs with young Sicilian lore The while his spirit with increasing sweep Longed to be where seven hills in starry sleep Saw done the dauntless deeds , saw spent the gore .

		Saw drop the vanward bird and sink who bore .

		Until one master stemmed the battle 's heap And reigned a prince of peace , -- the high renown That mother-city of all cities born To celebrate and rumor through all time With the grand pathos of her bright , dead prime Was that pale boy 's , whose very glories mourn As if they knew immortal rides no crown . '

		There can be no doubt that this is poetry , and of unusual distinction .

		The author sometimes strains a little for effect , but the average qual - ity of his work is singularly high .

		Mr.
Eobert Loveman	PERSON	's new volumis is his fourth , and , like the other three , is made up of brief and simple lyrics .

		These rhymes upon ` Abelard and
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	' have particularly taken our fancy : '
Abelard	PERSON	and
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	, Ne'er were lovers like to these ; Flying in the face of fate .

		Ground beneath the heel of hate Constant to the latest breath .

		With a faith defying death .

		Deeper than unsounded seas , --
Abelard	PERSON	and
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Abelard and
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	, Drained Love 's chalice to the lees ; Joyed and sorrowed , laughed and wept .

		Tempest-torn and passion-swept ; Now they dream away the days In the peaceful Pere-la-Chaise , Sleeping there beneath the trees , --
Abelard	ORGANIZATION	and
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Few poets can say as much as Mr.
Loveman	PERSON	can within the compass of a pair of stanzas .

		A book of sincere and unaffected expression , having childhood , religion , and nature for its themes , is put forth by Mrs.
Mary Thacher Higginson	PERSON	, and entitled '' ' The Playmate Hours . '

		We select ' The Strength of the Hills ' for one of our illustrations . '

		A midnight hush pervades the air .

		No birdling chirps , no leaflet stirs ; Midsummer heat is everywhere , Even among the firs .

		` What far-off sound grows on the ear ?

		Through wild ravines it sweeps along .

		As if some swift-winged bird drew near To wake the night with song . '

		A rustle fills the birches tall ; A sudden coolness fans the cheek :
Monadnock	ORGANIZATION	's breath bears life to all Beneath its rugged peak . '

		For here each day is born anew A chaste
Diana	PERSON	, fresh and fair .

		Whose arrows , dipped in forest dew , Transfix each worldly care . '

		Our other illustration shall be this fine sonnet called ' Ghost-Flowers , ' by which is meant the
Monotropa	LOCATION	, or Indian pipe : ' In shining groups , each stem a pearly ray .

		Weird flecks of light within the shadowed wood .

		They dwell aloof , a spotless sisterhood .

		No Angelus , except the wild bird 's lay , Awakes these forest nuns ; yet night and day Their heads are bent , as if in prayerful mood .

		A touch will mar their snow , and tempests rude Deflle ; but in the mist fresh blossoms stray From spirit-gardens just beyond our ken .

		Each year we seek their virgin hauuts to look Upon new loveliness , and watch again Their shy devotions near the singing brook ; Then , mingling in the dizzy stir of man .

		Forget the vows made in that cloistered nook . '

		Tliere are not many of these poems , and the writing of what few there are has been scat - tered over many years .

		At their best , as has been shown , they are exquisite in feeling and finish , and none of them falls far short of this best . ' -RSB-

		\ Iine and Thine , ' by Mrs.
Florence Earle Coates	PERSON	, is a volume made up chiefly of occa - sional verse , if we extend that term to include personal tributes and pieces called forth by some incidental impression .

		Thus , the author pays her resi > ects to Mr.

Yeats	PERSON	,
Madame Bernhardt	PERSON	, and
Helen Keller	PERSON	, among the living , and to
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Picquart	PERSON	, Whist - ler , E. N '' .

Joan	PERSON	of Arc , among the dead .

		She also inscril > es verses to
England	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
Buffalo	LOCATION	, and to the ' War for the Liberation of
Cuba	LOCATION	. '

		Her sonnet ' To
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	' seems to us to represent her work uix -RRB- n its highest level . '

		Tell us of beauty !

		Touch thy silver lyre And bid thy Muse unfold her shining wings !

		Tell us of joy -- of those unaging things Which wither not , nor are consumed by fire .

		Things unto which the souls of all aspire !

		Sing us the mystic song thine
Erin	PERSON	sings , Her poignant dreams , her weird imaginings .

		With magic of thy `` Land of Heart 's Desire ! ''

		J THE DIAL .

		201 ' Let others hate I -- from lips not thine be hurled Reproaches ; since all hate at last miist prove Abortive , though it triumph for a while .

		The gospels that indeed have won the world Laid their foundation on the strength of love .

		Sing thou , a lover , of thy wave-washed Isle ! '

		Of the excellence of Mrs.
Coates	PERSON	's senti - ments there can be no doubt ; her nature is warmly responsive to whatever is worthy in life or beautiful in art .

		But her expression does not often exhibit spontaneity or achieve distinction .

		Spontaneity has never been a marked char - acteristic of the verse of Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	, who is too reflective a singer for the higher sort of lyrical utterance , but there are touches of distinction upon nearly even-thing she writes .

		Plainness of speech and subtlety of thought mark her work , and make it very precious to lovers of the graver kind of verse .

		This writer has been silent for so long that her new volume , ' Cassia , and Other Yerse / is doubly welc-ome .

		Here is a typical selection , called ' A Peu Pres ' : ' Thy palace walls were founded well .

		And well its courses thou didst lay ; One tower defied the genie 's spell And stands a ruin to this day . '

		The land of flowers thou didst attain .

		And see the
spring	DATE	's immortal jet ; Thy staff-worn hand was reached in vain -- Thy lips that crystal never wet ! '

		With pains the altar thou didst dress .

		And the burnt sacrifice prepare , And call upon the God to bless -- All but the fire from Heaven was there I * Thou shak ` st thy lance on hard-fought field , Thou sleep ` st , the tingling stars above ; -- Pity and praise sweet eyes can yield .

		But ne'er vouchsafe the Light of Love ! '

		`` What dost thou lack ?

		'T is almost naught That parts thee from thy Heart 's Desire , -- A step -- a span -- an airy thought : A pulse-beat more , thou didst require ! '

		Miss
Thomas	PERSON	's gift for moralizing impressively but not obstrusively upon a single theme is well illustrated by this poem .

		That she has the right feeling about poetic opportunity is shown by such lines as these : ' Thine the fault .

		If nothing near thee moves thy breast to song : Thy mornings are new-lit , thine evenings starred .

		Thy wind-blown forests are with joy exalt , Thy threshold birds are singing all day long -- Not thou dost lack a Theme , but these a Bard . '

		This volume includes upwards of two score sonnets , most of which are of richly imagina - tive beauty .

		It is with much hesitation that we have chosen ' From Lips of Stone ' to stand for the entire group . '

		Amid a waste and solitary field .

		Upon the twilight boundary of the day , Upspake the timeless flintstone huge and gray : '' WTiy should my counsel be forever sealed 7 To thee an ancient truth shall be revealed -- To thee , a wavering mortal , brief of stay : -- Something of kin , -- thou piece of passioned clay .

		Art thou and I , whom passion ne'er did wield ; For , lo !

		did not Deucalion at the flood Behind him fling us stones -- and men we grew ?

		With limbs we moved abroad , with lips we spake !

		And hast not thou , with grief , seen flesh-and-blood Become to thee as stones , that Pity 's dew Could never melt , nor yet thine anger break ? '' '

		From Miss
Hildegarde Hawthorne	PERSON	's little volume of delicate * Poems ' we select ' A Song * for our example . '

		Sing me a sweet , low song of night Before the moon is risen , A song that tells of the stars ' delight Escaped from day 's bright prison ; A song that croons with the cricket 's voice - That sleeps with the shadowed trees , A song that shall bid my heart rejoice At its tender mysteries ! '

		And then when the song is ended , love .

		Bend down your head unto me ; Whisper the word that was bom above Ere the moon bad swayed the sea ; Ere the brightest stars began to shine Or the farthest sun to bum .

		The oldest of words , O heart of mine .

		Yet newest , and sweet to learn ! '

		We could hardly wish for a prettier close fo ' the series of extracts which have been strung together in this review .

India	LOCATION	in
Geographically	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	is a conti - its physical nent , a little less than half as '' * '' * ' ■ '' • large as
Europe	LOCATION	, but characterized by the same symmetry and proportions , the same rich variety of phj-sical features and climate , as
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is more populous than
Europe	LOCATION	, having more than one hundred and forty inhab - itants to the square mile , while
Europe	LOCATION	has less than one hundred .

		And though usually spoken of as a political entity , it is a conglomeration of distinct kingdoms and peoples , and the concrete term ` Indian * may be applied to what is in the abstract a heterogeneous , polyglot combination of individuals , who belong to a dozen different nationalities , speak a Babel of tongues , and live in a variety of countries the physical features of which differ as much as their climatic conditions .

		Its ethnography must take note of peoples of Aryan , Scythian , Arab , Tartar , Dravidian , and Mongolian stocks , speaking more than seventy different langua ^ ges .

		Its geographical history be - gan with the invasion by Alexander the Great about the year 327 B. C. , -- the first scientifically - conducted military expedition in the world 's his - tory .

		Though for more than a century Eng - land has held the dominant position in this vast territory - , and official rep > orts to the British gov - ernment abound in information respecting its political and economic geography , j-et a compre - hensive geography of the country was much to be desired .

		Wise choice was made of Col. Sir
Thomas Hungerford Holdich	PERSON	, K.C.I.E. ,
C.P.	LOCATION	,
P.E.	LOCATION	, late Superintendent of the Frontier Sur - veys , to supply this desideratum for ` Appletons ' World Series , ' and with few exceptions his work 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	^ , will rank high with the other volumes of the series .

		Five chapters are devoted to the physical features of the various regions that compose the vast continent .

		A chapter on the people of
India	LOCATION	takes due account of the religions upon which the main divisions of the inhabitants are based .

		It is not sui ` prising that the author , who has been engaged in the British public service in
India	LOCATION	for more than twenty years , should give his chief attention to economic geography in chapters on Agriculture and Revenue , on Min - erals , and on Climate .

		And inasmuch as twenty - five thousand miles of railway have been built in
India	LOCATION	since
1870	DATE	, and as these railways are the most crowded with passenger traffic of any in the world , it is well that we should have a chap - ter on Railways .

		So great is the position that
India	LOCATION	now occupies in the world 's affairs that the appearance of such a book as this is especially opportune .

William Mtevary Sharp	PERSON	, published at intervals dur - ^ topography .

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's : Sons -RRB- .

		Of the topographical literature now so tmuch in vogue , this book is one of the best exam - iples .

		It is full of interesting matter , is well writ - \ ten , and the authors selected for description -LRB- mostly novelists -RRB- ai'e those about whom every - one likes to know ; the illustrations , often made from special photographs , are numerous and un - commonly beautiful .

		The ' country ' of an author may mean either where he has spent his time and which he has commemorated in his writings , or it may mean the lands or regions brought under the sway of his imagination , as
Provence	LOCATION	and Palestine by
Scott	PERSON	in `
Quentin Durward	PERSON	' and '' ^ The
Talisman	ORGANIZATION	, ' as
Samoa	LOCATION	or Silverado or
Fon	ORGANIZATION	- tainebleau in the instance of
Stevenson	LOCATION	; or it may mean the actual country of birth and up - ` bringing and residence .

		Sometimes these coincide , as in the instance of
George Eliot	PERSON	, whose own < !

		0untry and whose most enduring country of the imagination are practically identical .

		In gen - eral , what our author means by the ` country ' of a great writer , like
Scott	PERSON	or
Carlyle	PERSON	or the
Bron	PERSON	- tes , is that region where life fii `` st unfolded and where its roots are , -- the countrj ^ that the heart enshrines .

		These are the things of which one is always eager to hear , hoping , although well know - ing how vain the hope , to find some clue to that mysterious and incommunicable secret which we cjdl genius .

		The story of To tell ` The Story of Art Art through throughout the Ages ' in three theages .

		hundred pages , at the same time yielding space for an average of two illustrations on each page , would seem to imply treatment of the most superficial kind .

		Beginning with the crude attempts at art in the quaternary period , continuing through
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Chaldea	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	, < jreece ,
Rome	LOCATION	, and the modern European and American states , the space would seem to be barely adequate for mere statistics .

		But the scholarship and brilliancy of
M. S. Reinach	PERSON	, member of the
Institute of France	ORGANIZATION	, have achieved the apparently impossible and produced a book both critical and fascinating .

		This is partly be - cause
Monsieur Reinach	PERSON	is such a master of the phrase ; he condenses into a sentence an analysis or a criticism which others would spread through pages .

		How admirably , for example , is the char - acterization of Andrea del Sarto the technician , -- ` commonplace as a thinker , great as a paint - er ' ; and this , in speaking of Millet and our nineteenth-centuiy spirit , -- ` The tender and fra - ternal sentiment that breathes from
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's can - vases reveals that sympathy with the poor and humble which has been the honor and the tor - ment of the nineteenth century . '

		Impressionism is defined as a ` pictorial stenography , disdainful of details which rapid and sympathetic vision can not seize . '

		Whoever wishes to pursue the subjects into their details will find at the end of each chapter an exhaustive bibliography , mak - ing the work especially desirable as a reference book covering the whole field of artistic expres - sion .

		The translation , by
Miss Florence Sim	PERSON	- monds , is admirably done ; and the volume is imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		A study in It is from somewhat of a novel the principles view-point that Mr.
William De	PERSON	- of personality .

		^ ^ ^ g certain phases of Greek philosophy and Cliristianity in his latest work , ` From Epicurus to Christ ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		He takes , as a point of departure , such elements of personality as rise above the threshold of consciousness and are reducible to philosophical principles .

		It is with a view to discovering and pointing out these elements that he consults the doctrines of Epienrus , of the Stoics , of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
oE Aristotle	PERSON	, and lastly of Christ .

		His method is to quote , or to state simply in his own words , the gist of each master 's teaching , then to comment upon it and show whei'ein lies its truth or its error .

		The study may be said to be in the form of an evolution -- the best of the earlier systems being faithfully retained to aggrandize , as it were , the highest expression of personality ,
Christ	LOCATION	.

		The Christian view of life , combined with the elements of truth in the earlier systems , Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	regards as a really Catholic Christianity for which the present time is ripe .

		Although the author does not explicitly state the fact , the i-eader is left Avith the impression that such a religion is ultimate .

		An extremely interesting presentation of old principles in a new setting , together Avith keen suggestions of their modern exponents , tend to convmce the reader that Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	himself is far from lacking in certain prin - ciples of personality .

Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	f ur - ofour nishes another volume for the Indian wars .

McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , this covering the field from
1866	DATE	to

Sioux	LOCATION	. '

		The book , like its three predecessors ^
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , fm is fairly authentic history , and every endeavor Jias been made to set down the facts without fear or favor .

		, The four greater episodes in the book are the massacre at
Fort Phil Kearney	LOCATION	,
Colonel Forsyth	ORGANIZATION	's fight on the Arikaree -LRB-
Beecher	PERSON	's Island -RRB- , General Miles 's winter campaign against the
Sioux	LOCATION	, and the Custer massacre -LRB- the battle of the Little Big Horn -RRB- .

		Such events as these , when coupled with knowledge of the provocation given the Indians by Americans in no way re - sponsible to the military - , who nes ` ertheless have had to bear the burden of the misdeeds of others , can not fail to interest all who admire splendid courage , marked resourcefulness , and everything that goes to make up the accomplished soldier .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	has not -RCB- > een satisfied with the official and other reports of the time , but as far as pos - sible has supplemented them with such additional knowledge as he has been able to extract from those having direct relation with the events set forth .

		His anxiety , for example , to set straight the question as to whether or not General Cus - ter disobeyed orders in advancing upon the
Sioux	LOCATION	, and so bringing himself and his command to dreadful death , has resulted in a voluminous correspondence which requires an apj -RRB- endix and yet leaves the question not fully settled .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	himself , however , seems to hold that there was no technical disobedience .

		The book is illus - trated by many pencils , some of them in the hands of artists of distinction ; the effect as a whole is somewhat heterogenous , effective as each picture is , taken by itself .

		The marvels Probably no single volume yet of modern published ^ ves so clear an idea of mdusti-y .

		^ ^ ^ advances made in recent years in all the various fields of practical himian en - deavor as Mr.
Charles H. Cochrane	PERSON	's ` Modem Industrial Progress ' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- .

		Abundantly and pertinently illustrated , it takes up in suc - cession no fewer than forty-two major and a number of minor topics .

		The chief interest obvi - ously lies in the directions of electricity and steel , but there are various other advances made possible by reason of these , such as the excava - tion of great canals through enormous and com - plicated mechanisms built of steel , and rapid vehicles made possible through electricity .

		The towering buildings which lend a Babel-like effect to our cities , the great ordnance carried by our leviathans upon the seas , flying machines already past the stage of experiment , the mechanisms that lend themselves to stage use and deceptions , machine-making , and the differences between the American method with uniform and interchange - able parts and the Europ > $ an idea of building to suit special occasions and needs , all the appar - atus that takes standing grain from the field and ends with it in barrels of flour , glass-mak - ing , paper and its new uses , boot and shoe man - ufactures , weaving and spinning in power looms , clay and its newer uses , -- these and scores of other topics here find exemplification and com - prehensive no less than succinct treatment .

Angelo Heil	PERSON	- , prin , F.R.G.S. , in his latest work , ` The Tower of
Pelee	LOCATION	: New Studies of the Great Volcano of
Martinique	LOCATION	' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- .

		It is the result of a series of visits to the island , during which a number of photographs were taken , and these photographs , with comment upon them , constitute the present thin quarto .

		While more than oup phase of the activities of Pielee is taken into ac - count , the book deals chiefly with the wonderful tower , believed to be the solidified core remaining in the vent of a prehistoric crater , which came first into view during the great eruption of
1902	DATE	, and was destroyed in the cataclysm of
August	DATE	in that year .

		It began to emerge anew soon after , growing in height for days together at the rate of seventy feet a day , but crumbling at its top as it arose owing to fissures which served for the transmission of explosive vapors .

		It attained a maximum height of 800 feet or more , and was supported by a general rise of a supporting base of even greater elevation , the point of the tower reaching an altitude of 5,200 feet above sea level .

		The tower disapp -RRB- eared more rapidly than it came , and now remains only in the photographs , of extraordinary fidelity and impressiveness , that were taken of it .

		The book is written with more care than preceding volumes from the same hand , and will be read with intense interest .

Chris	PERSON	- forthetthoie tian Church ' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
H. c/insf	PERSON	tan
Church	ORGANIZATION	pomgroy
Brewster	PERSON	, is an unusually terse and at the same time comprehensive church year-book , in which is told the origin , history , and present status of each of the chief festivals of the entire church , as well as of many local feasts and festivals which obtain in certain parts of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The greatest merits of the work are its entire freedom from denominational bias , and the wide knowledge which it shows of profane a.nd ecclesiastical history and canon law .

		The record begins with Advent
Sunday	DATE	, and proceeds through the year , giving the date , fixed or approx - imate , for each festival , and finding some fes - tival for every day .

		It is of course impossible , even within the limits of five hundred closely - printed pages , to tell the stoiy of all the canon - ized saints of the church , so a few of the most noted have been chosen for each day , and their lives briefly sketched .

		An alphabetical index grives a much more compreliensive list of saints , with the proper ` saint-day ' for each , and there is also a chronological list of all the Bishops and Popes since the death of St.
Peter	PERSON	, and a copious general index .

		The book is copiously illustrated with a number of small cuts showing pictures of the saiiits or of the quaint symbols that the old church calendars employed to represent them .

		An aid to the Prof essor
Jiilicher	PERSON	's ' Introduction study of the to the New Testament , ' in the New Testament , original German , has for ten years been familiar to New Testament students , and has gained a high place among such works .

		In the English translation issued by Messrs. 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	,
Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's Sons , made from the second -LRB- the so-eaJIed ` third and fourth ' -RRB- German edition of
1901	DATE	, it will reach and benefit a much wider cir - cle , and New Testament study will be the gainer thereby .

		The translation exhibits , in the main , the ease and fidelity and clearness that are indispensable in such work .

		More attention to finish would have relieved the pages of some German survivals , such as
Muratorianum	LOCATION	, Sozo - menos , Theodoretus ,
Elzevier	PERSON	, and Leit-motiv .

Nizan	PERSON	-LRB- for Nisan , passim -RRB- , are not improvements ; and we should not have called a water-plant like papyrus a ` shrub ' -LRB- p. 568 -RRB- .

		It is amusing to see ` Tendenz ' soberly exhibited in parentheses after every clause in which the Ger - man has it ; clearly it is with some still an object of worship .

		A paa-enthesis misplaced -LRB- p. 613 -RRB- has thrown a series of valuable notes into confusion ; and Mr.
Gwilliam	PERSON	of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is hardly recognizable in
G. William	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- ibid -RRB- .

		Cer - tain Greek spellings and certain English capi - talizations offend the reviewer 's eye ; but with all its fallibility this English form of Jiilicher 's work will be useful and welcome .

		The history of A half Century ago there ap - a Southern peared ' A History of
Maryland	LOCATION	' commo7iweaith .

		Y > y
James McSherry	PERSON	.

		It presented a fairly adequate description of the founding of the colony , of the Puritan conquest , and of the Revolutionary War , from the Roman Catholic point of view -- although not radically so .

		This work has now been revised and supplemiented by Prof.
Bartlett Burleigh James	PERSON	, of the West - em
Maryland College	ORGANIZATION	, and is published by the
Baltimore Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reviser has restrained the fulsomeness of
McSherry	ORGANIZATION	, and has completed the story of
Maryland	LOCATION	from the close of the Rev - olution to the
end of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		The Civil War is presented from an unbiased view , as is the Reconstruction period following .

		A few incorrect spellings , -- such as
Charles ` Thompson	PERSON	, ' Secretary of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Con - gress , and the ease of `
Sprigg	PERSON	' instead of Prigg vs.
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, -- are to be noted .

		The polit - ical history has not been allowed to crowd out the industrial and economic development of the state , and the work as now presented is a val - uable addition to the rather scanty material available for
Maryland	LOCATION	's history .

		The quest of Mr.
Dwight M. Huntington	PERSON	's man - ' big game ' ner in ` Our Big Game , a Book for inAmertca .

		Sportsmen and Nature-Lovers , ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- can best be described as intimate , leaving a feeling of good-fellowship and cam - araderie as a characteristic among those who go a-shooting .

		The animals discussed are those specified as ` big game ' by the
Boone	PERSON	and Crock -
ett Club	ORGANIZATION	, and include wapiti , moose , mule-deer , black - tail-deer ,
Virginia	LOCATION	deer , the two sorts of caribou , bison , musk-oxen , big-horns , mountain goats , antelope , grizzly , polar , black , and big brown bears , pumas , and lynxes .

		Each of these beasts forms the subject of a chapter , in which its habits are described , its haunts given , and some experiences in shooting it , generally those of Mr ,
Huntington	LOCATION	himself , set forth in a man - ner intended to be of assistance to others in sim - ilar quests .

		There is also a preliminary dis - cussion of arms and ammunition .

		The book is illustrated by reproduced photographs from life , showing the animals as they have appeared in their native wilds .

		A book Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has put to - of famous gether in a volume called ` His - mystenes .

		torical Mysteries ' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , fourteen short sketches , previously printed in various periodicals , all of which have the interest of uncertainty , and some of which have a genu - ine historical bearing .

		Among the latter are ` The Cardinal 's Necklace , ' ` The Gowrie Con - spiracy , ' ` The Case of
Allan Breck	PERSON	, ' and others , while mysteries not really historical , in the sense of having any relation to important incidents in history , but rather famous for the contemporane - ous interest excited in them , are ` The Case of
Elizabeth Canning	ORGANIZATION	, ' and ` The
Strange Case of Daniel Dunglas Home	ORGANIZATION	. '

		In the last-mentioned essay , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's own interest in spiritualistic manifestations is made evident .

		But each of these is much more a study than a sketch , for the evidence is given , and being carefully weighed with a true historical sense , some conclusion is reached , the whole being presented in a form at once suggestive and convincing .

		Thus the vol - ume is both valuable as a bit of careful research and entertaining as a collection of stoi-ies .

		Memoirs of Major General
William Heath	PERSON	, a a
Continental	ORGANIZATION	native of
Roxbury	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, officer .

		served in the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	forces of the Revolutionary War during the entire eight years of that memorable contest between the colonists and
England	LOCATION	.

		In
1798	DATE	he published his Memoirs , consisting of a daily journal Avhich he had kept during the war , supplemented by recol - lections of other participants .

		The book has been out of print for many years , but is now restored in an attractive form as one of a series of ` Source-Books of
American History	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- A. Wes - sels Company -RRB- .

		Heath was unfortunate in de - laying an attack upon Port Independence , with which he was entnisted in
January , 1777	DATE	, -- a de - linquency that brought upon him the wrath of the Commander-in-Chief and probably prevented him from being entrusted with another important command during the war .

		He makes a mild de - fense of his conduct in his Memoirs .

		The book is of value also for its accounts of the disposi - tion of
Burgoyne	PERSON	after his surrender , of
Arnold	LOCATION	's treason , and of the surrender of
Cornwallis	LOCATION	.

		A ` true ' One of the most readable of recent biography of biographies is that by Mr.
Joseph Henry Clay	PERSON	.

		- ^ ^
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	, entitled ` The True Henry Clay ' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- .

		Following the plan of the series of which it is a part , Clay 's life and work are taken up topically , each of the twenty-seven ehaptei * s giving one of their many interesting aspects .

		This method involves , of course , more or less repetition , but it adds to
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 205 the completeness and interest of the work .

		As Clay was a leader in public affairs for nearly fifty years after taking his seat as senator dur - ing
Jefferson	PERSON	's administration , there is necessa - rily much about politics in the book ; but the emphasis is on the personal side .

		The author is an admirer of Clay , yet he tells the truth about him , not glossing over his defects and frailties or attempting to cover his blunders .

		The book contains twenty-four excellent illustrations , and is put forth in the attractive dress of the series to which it belongs .

		An outline of the French Revolution .

		The second volume of a brief work on the French Revolution , by Miss
Sophia H. MacLehose	PERSON	, is entitled ` From the Monarchy to the Repub - lic in
France	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As in the preceding volume , the author presents very briefly an out - line of the events of the period , citing numerous references , and giving a long list of authorities , for neither of which is there any necessity in a work of this elementary character .

		Yet the out - line in itself is good , and it is possible that read - ers may , as the author hopes , be attracted to a study of longer histories , by the interest cre - ated in incidents here only summarized .

		The numerous reproductions of old cuts and engrav - ings furnish one distinctly valuable feature of the book .

		XOTES .

		` Xapoleon and his Times ' is the title of the next volume to appear in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern His - tory .

		It follows in the series the volume on ` The French Bevolution ' published last
spring	DATE	.

		The series of ` Twelve English Statesmen ' is to be brought to a conclusion shortly by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's biography of
Chatham	LOCATION	, which the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce for publication this month .

		The
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	will shortly issue ` The Progress of Hellenism in
Alexander	LOCATION	's Empire , ' by Prof.
John P. Mahaffy	PERSON	.

		a compendium of the long and brilliant development of human culture under Greek influence .

		The series of six lectures delivered last fall at the
Art Institute of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Bussell Sturgis	PERSON	win be published next month by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a profusely-illustrated volume entitled ` The Interdependence of the Arts . '

		One of the most interesting biographical works of the present season will undoubtedly be found in the Hon.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	's Autobiography and Reminiscences , to be published this month by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some portions of the book have already appeared in recent issues of ` The
Century Magazine	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Two books of timely interest in connection with the approaching
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark Exposition	ORGANIZATION	are announced by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for publication within a few weeks .

		` From the West to the West , ' by
Abigail Scott Duniway	PERSON	, is an account in fiction form of a joiu `` ney across the plains to
Oregon	LOCATION	, giving a picture of the perils and hardships , as well as the romantic incidents , of travel fifty years ago .

		The other book , ` Letters from an
Oregon Ranch	ORGANIZATION	, ' tells of an attempt to create a home in the Western wilderness .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will follow up their attractive edition of the Barsetshire and
Parlia	LOCATION	- mentary novels of Anthony TroUope with a new series to be called the
Manor House	ORGANIZATION	novels .

		`
Orley Farm	ORGANIZATION	' is announced as the first volume .

		Messrs.
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	send us their library edition of `
Webster	PERSON	's
Xew Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	of the
Englsh Language	ORGANIZATION	, ' as compiled by Mr.
E. T. Roe	PERSON	.

		It makes a volume of nearly eight hundred pages , illustrated and indexed , is leather-bound , and enclosed in a box .

		` Der
Herzog	PERSON	von
Mailand	LOCATION	, ' being a free transla - tion of
Massinger	ORGANIZATION	's ` The Duke of
Milan	LOCATION	, ' made by
Herr Hermann Conrad	PERSON	, is published in the
Greiner	PERSON	and
Pfeiffer	PERSON	-LRB-
Stuttgart	LOCATION	-RRB- series of `
Bucher	PERSON	der
Weisheit	PERSON	und Schonheit , ' obtainable in this country from Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Besides the regular single-volume edition of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's brilliant novel , ` The Marriage of
William Ashe	PERSON	, ' just published by the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	, there will be a special edition in two vol - umes , limited to one thousand sets , each copy of which will bear the autograph of the author .

		A cheerful little book on ` The Funeral : Its Con - duet and Proprieties , ' by Mr.
Joseph X. Greene	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Jennings & Graham	ORGANIZATION	.

		Under the four heads of the undertaker , the minister , the bereaved , and the friends , the etiquette of the subject is discussed , and many useful suggestions are made .

		The Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	have just begun the publi - cation of a new and uniform edition of the late
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's essays .

		The edition is to comprise eleven volumes , of which four , containing the ` Hours in a Library , ' are now at hand .

		We need hardly say at this late day that these are all but the most delightful literary essays in the EngUsh language , and that their present convenient repub - lication deserves the warmest sort of a welcome . '

		A List of Arabic Manuscripts in
Princeton Uni	LOCATION	- versity Library , ' compiled by Dr.
Enno Littmann	PERSON	and published by the
University	ORGANIZATION	, makes public the contents of an important collection which has recently been deposited in the
Princeton	LOCATION	library by Mr.
Robert Garrett	PERSON	.

		This is a supplement to the Houtsma catalogue , the two together making up what is probably the richest collection of Oriental manuscripts to be found in any American library .

		A new series devoted to matters of present-day religion and morals is to be begun shortly by
Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will present books by men of such distinction as Rev. Dr.
Charles Cuthbert Hall	PERSON	, President of the

Washington Gladden	PERSON	, Rev. Dr.
William C. Bitting	PERSON	, and Rev. Dr.
Wm. Douglas Mackenzie	PERSON	, President of the

		The editor of the series .

		Dr.
Henry A. Stimson	PERSON	, has written the first volume , which is entitled ` The Right Life . '

		`
The Forms of Public Address	ORGANIZATION	, ' edited by Prof.
George P. Baker	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is an adjunct to rhetorical instruction which college teachers of the subject will find extremely useful .

		It is essentially an annotated volume of examples , with an introduction .

		Among the species of composition illustrated are letters , editorials , eulogies , dedications , after - dinner speeches , and addresses of various sorts .

		Thus the editorial section gives us sixteen examples of this form of writing , reprinted from such journals as The Dial , ' The Nation , ' ' The Spectator , ' ' The Inde - pendent , ' and several newspapers .

		NOTES 242 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 243 LIST OF NT : W books 243 OUR PIONEER AMERICAN FOET .

		There are estates which are held by the payment of a rose or a piece of fruit in an - nual rent .

		The intellectual domains which we take from great writers deserve at least an equal acknowledgment .

		Some legacies indeed of this kind demand knight-service : we must go to war to defend our king and almoner , dead though he be .

		Our first true American poet , however , does not need the help of sword or torch .

		He is serene and secure in hi ^ modest greatness , and there is nothing for us to do but to bring to his grave-throne our small tributes of criticism and appreciation .

		It is related of Lao Tsze that he was car - ried in his mother 's womb for seventA * or eighty 3 ` ears , so that when he was bom his hair was white and his form hoar with antiquity .

		The youth of nineteen , who , in a new country , amid a race of pioneers , wrote ' Thanaix -RRB- psis ' certainly recalls the Chinese philosopher .

		The dominant note in
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	's poetry is age .

		Age , engulfment , resignation , death , -- these motives return again and again in his poems .

		` Hiey are good themes , and there is no reason whv - a poet should not be especially bom to express them ; but the sin - gular thing is that they should be sung as the herald notes of our poetic dawn .

		One would think that then , if at all , would sound the music of
Spring	DATE	and Kesurrection ; then would glow pictures of buoyant action -- the red col * ' ors of love and war .

		Without meaning anything but praise , it may be said of
Bryant	PERSON	's poems in general that
Wordsworth	PERSON	forgot to write them .

		A few of them rise to the height of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's best , and they never sink to the level of his worst .

		But of course in mass , in range , in fire , the English poet is immeasurably beyond his American double or pupil .

		There is a differ - ence , too , in their view of Nature and outlook on man 's destiny .


Wordsworth	PERSON	is the poet of immortality -- of resurrection ; the Xature he loved was ablaxe with Spirit .


Bryant	PERSON	's Xature is the Xature of the chemists and geologists and geographers .

		He lacked metaphysics .

		How often has he repeated the idea of man returning to his original elements , -- of engulf - ment in the grave I By iteration he makes it impressive .

		Yet it is probably best to touch such thoughts , and leave them .

		Omar 's speak - ing jar gives us a more vivid sense of the mat - ter .

		And after all , the idea , poetically speak - ing , is nothing much .

		If man is spirit , his 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, sinking into the grave is of little consequence ; and if earth is spirit , too , it is of still less .

		It is remarkable that
Bryant	PERSON	keeps his Stoic conception of virtue and morality so high while yielding to an almost Lucretian sense of the constitution of the world .

		Bryant has in poetry the felicity which the Psalmist prayed for , -- neither poverty nor riches .

		Yet his severe taste saved him from that inevitable instinct for the second-best which has ruined so much American verse .

		He always recalls the masters ; and when it is not
Wordsworth	PERSON	's star which is in the ascendant , it is that of
Milton	LOCATION	, or Gray , or
Collins	PERSON	.

		He was perhaps the most careful student of verse we have had .

		But his music is too often a recollected air .

		His pictures , -- achieving , as they frequently do , the virgin phrase , cool , dewy , and unravished of man , -- lack yet the ecstacy of more daring souls .

		The sacred spark in him was a lambent phosphorescence , incapable of communicating heat or fire .

		Lyrical poetry does not lend itself easily to criticism .

		The spontaneous gush of thought , the record of fleeting emotion , it is too evanes - cent in its nature to admit of dissection .

		One does not analyze thistle-down , or break a butterfly on the wheel .

		When the creating and combining powers come in , we can try to trace their progression and culmination in a work of genius , and compare the results with other productions of a like order .

		But a good lyric ought to be unitary and unique .

		Per - haps the best way to discuss a writer whose work consists of a multitude of short pieces is to state first the general impression they pro- duce , and then go on and say what one can of the single poems .

		The largest division of
Bryant	PERSON	's work is the group of blank-verse pieces , including ' Than - atopsis , ' ` The Forest Hymn , ' ` The Prairies , ' ` Earth , ' ` Hymn to Death , ' ` The Flood of Years , ' and a few others .

		As far as theme and matter are concerned , they are practically all one , -- the same thoughts in varied settings .

		The earliest written of them sums up their whole message , and the world has accepted it as the greatest .

		In manner , however , they are equally good ; and it is a manner which makes a small thing seem almost colossal .

		The blank - verse is studied from
Wordsworth	PERSON	, who got his by inheritance through
Cowper	PERSON	from
Milton	LOCATION	.

		Neither in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	nor in
Bryant	LOCATION	, how - ever , is there anything which much resembles
Milton	PERSON	's sidereal style .

		And the two later poets differ from each other .

		In
Wordsworth	PERSON	's best blank-verse there is a sense of growth , a pulsating vitality , a pushing upward as of forest trees , each trying to be tallest .

		In Bry - ant 's lines there is the faltering , soundless fall of
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	leaves detaching themselves with - out wind .

		His verse , however , is a most fit instrument for the meditative mood .

		Infe - rior in passages to
Wordsworth	PERSON	's similar work , it is superior in single lines , and has far fewer lapses into prose .

		Bryant 's poems which bear upon wild-life in
America	LOCATION	, aboriginal or that of the early set - tlers , such as ' The Disinterred Warrior , ' ' The
Hunter	PERSON	of the Prairies , ' ' Catterskill Falls , ' have all a stamp of deep and grave sincerity .

		They are miniatures , and require a magnify - ing-glass to bring out their merits .

		But even after
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's great canvasses , painted with a broad brush , these little vignettes repay study .

		There are a good many of
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	's minor pieces which have a sort of faded elegance , as if they were originally written for the old Books of Beauty -- the Annuals of our early literature .

		They are not in the least vital , -- they are purely manufactured ; but their arti - fice is well done .

		A list of these would be too long to give , but in it would be ' The Song of the Greek Amazon , ' ' Song of
Pitcairn	ORGANIZATION	's
Isl	ORGANIZATION	- and , ' ` The Damsel of
Peru	LOCATION	. '

		A poem like ' The Lapse of
Time	ORGANIZATION	' is of a higher mood ; yet it too is irritating : it is so near the common - place , yet manages to evade actual prosaism .

		It reminds one of some of the slighter , prelu - sive strains of
Collins	ORGANIZATION	, which have nothing in them but an ineffable grace -- the classic air .

		But I must come to the handful of lyrics which are
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	's real title-deeds to fame signed and sealed by the Muse .

		Two little odes I would first mention , not for any spe - cial mark of thought or phrase which they possess , but because of their originality in metre .

		They are ` The Greek Partisan ' and an ' Ode for a Celebration . '

		Most poets , when they try to bring a variety of rhythm into a short compass , merely change the length of their lines ; but
Bryant	PERSON	here changes the key of the music , as Gray did .

		These brief poems have in consequence a dancing movement which is most effective .

		` The Siesta ' is probably the nearest ap - proach to a real song that
Bryant	PERSON	ever wrote .

		Some other of his things which are labelled songs are as wooden as clothes-pegs , as cold as icicles .

		The ' Song of
Marion	PERSON	's Men ' is a martial lyric , and a fine one , though it comes far short of equalling the war-poems of Burns and
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, or even two more recent Amer - ican patriotic strains , ' The Blue and the Gray , ' and ` The Bivouac of the Dead . '

		Bry - ant 's ' Greek Boy ' is also a Tyrtarean poem , and has real rather than painted fire .

		It is of course reminiscent of
Byron	PERSON	's ' Isles of
Greece	LOCATION	. '

		In
' June	DATE	' for almost the first time we find
Bryant	PERSON	standing impropped by any other poet .

		All the art he had learned from Gray and
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTATi 225
Collins	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	was in his mind when he wrote it , but for the nonce he forgot them and spoke straight from his soul .

		The diction of the piece is full of floating gold which con - centrates into one or two ingot-like phrases .

		* Oh , Fairest of the Rural Maids ' is almost equally good , but here Br -RCB- ant leans again on
Wordsworth	PERSON	's shoulder , as he does in ` The Fringed Gentian . ' '

		Autunm Woods ' is entire - ly original and absolutely flawless .

		Singularly enough ,
Bryant	PERSON	, usually so grave , not to say drab , in his coloring , here gives the gayest pic - ture of
American Autumn	ORGANIZATION	which exists in our literature .

		Mark the art or the unconscious truth with which he assembles all the bright aspects of the season , -- the woods which have put their glory on , the colored landscape , the gay company of trees , the painted leaves , the sun 's quiet smile , the absence of gloom where many branches meet , the stream that shines with the image of its golden screen , the rose - ate canopy where a maiden 's blush would be unmarked !

		The word ` colored ' is repeated three times , probably with intention .

		Alto - gether it is the most perfect piece of objec - tive work which
Bryant	PERSON	ever achieved , and needs only a touch of magical imagination to place it fairly by the side of
Keats	PERSON	's best .

		Hardly less admirable is * The Death of the Flowers , ' a little elegy whose sweet and gentle perfection make of it a sister-song to
Collins	PERSON	's ' Fidele , ' and even render it worthy to stand , at some remove , in the presence of the Death Song in ' Cymbeline . '

		The simple fitness of the epithets throughout the piece is Greek ; and the exquisitely modulated metre is perhaps the most lyrical movement in all Bryanf s verse .

		There remain
Bryant	PERSON	's three crowning poems -- ' To the Past . ' '

		Lines to a Water - fowl , ' and ' The Battlefield . '

		The first has an air of antique greatness .

		Its bareness is im - pressive as of a Spanish Hidalgo presiding at his empty board with an inestimable jewel or two , heirlooms spared by Fate , glittering on his fingers .

		The piece contains what is proba - bly
Bryant	PERSON	's finest line , -- ' And features , the great soul 's apparent seat , ' although ' Old ocean 's gray and melancholy waste , ' from ' Thanatopsis , ' and ' `` The desert and illimitable air , ' of the ' Lines to a Waterfowl , ' are near rivals .

		The last-named poem is the quintessence of
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	's genius .

		Neither in motive nor man - ner does it recall any other poet , and there is none throughout time who would not be proud to own it .

		Yet I think ` The Battle - field ' is his final and supreme triumph .

		Beauty and splendor of picture are here , and a grandeur of utterance which might have been thundered from
Sinai	LOCATION	.

		What is Bryanfs rank among our American singers ?

		Poe is greatest in prose , his verse being merely the gold fringe on his prose suit of sables ; yet even in poetr -RCB- ' he keeps his precedence .

		He keeps it by reason of his strange originality , his almost unequalled gift of proportion and effect , his charm of haunt - ing melody and unforgetable picturing .

		In weight and felicity of single phrase , however , he is certainly not equal to either
Bryant	PERSON	or
Emerson	LOCATION	; and by virtue of this felicity , allied to a considerable gift of design ,
Bryant	PERSON	, I should say , must rank second .

		Emerson 's shower of verbal sparks , which hardly ever coalesced into a star-like poem , can only place him third .


Walt Whitman	PERSON	is a purely l3rrical poet , but even yet it is hard to assay and value his dithyrhambic verse .

		In the great battle of the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	,
Laksmana	PERSON	is mortally wounded , and Hanuman , the monkey magician of the epic , is sent to a distant moimtain for an herb of healing to revive the hero .

		What with the length of the journey and his adven - tures by the way , Hanuman forgets the de - scription of the plant . '

		Something there was , * he says , ` of red , something of white , something of gold . '

		But he can not make up his mind which of the flowering things he sees around him is the right one ; so he plucks up the whole mountaiu by the roots , and conveys it back to the field of battle .

		This is perhaps an exaggerated comparison for Whitman 's poetry ; there is a sense of mass and greatness in him , yet it is most diflBcult to discover in all his pages that plant of charm and healing which we call poetry .

		Lowell is reported to have said , late in life , ` We were none of us as great poets as we thought we were . '

		None indeed of our classic writers had , in poetry at least , any great crea - tive gifts .

		There were lyrists , occasional poets ; and it is useless to try to push lyrical and occasional poetry into competition with the large , continued creations of Literature .

		The question is easily decided .

		Let anyone ask himself which the world could better afford to lose , all the poetry -- the best of its kind in the language -- contained in
Palgrave	LOCATION	's '
Golden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, ' or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ' Hamlet . '

		The verdict could hardly be long in doubt .

		Much would we miss , much would drop from us , if the passion and pathos and imagination of
England	LOCATION	's lyrists were obliterated ; but ' Hamlet ' is woven into the very texture of the souls , not only of our race , but of man - kind .

		Yet it is only one of a number of nearly equal pla -RCB- ^ by a single author .

		And the same judgment would almost certainly have to be rendered if the case were ' Paradise Lost ' against the whole body of lyrical verse in English .

		However , we can not do without 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, lyrical poetry , and we may be glad that we have in
Bryant	PERSON	a singer who lias added appre - ciably to the world 's stock of the best in this sort of writing .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		COOPERATION IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The establishment of a fully equipped American bibliographical institute is a desidei'atum that has been suggested more than once , though there is some difference of opinion , even among those who have carefully considered the matter , as to the endowment required .

		One proposition pub - lished calls for a fund of two hundred thousand dollars , or an implied income of from eight thou - sand to ten thousand dollars per annum .

		A much smaller sum could , however , be used advantageous - ly in the pursuit of certain restricted lines of investigation .

		The importance of encouraging bibliographical research in
America	LOCATION	, is well un - derstood and ought , ere long , to result in the creation of an institution especially fitted for the task .

		The cataloguing or bibliography of books , as books , is receiving so much attention from the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	and other institutions that , irrespective of the great value of such work , there is perhaps no urgent and immediate need of additional undertakings of ex - actly the same sort .

		The purpose of this note , therefore , is to suggest another field of investiga - tion whose fruitfulness is unlimited .

		Students and general readers frequently come across facts which , being curious or little known , or for other special reasons , are likely to be of general interest , and should be so recorded as to make them more accessible .

		Let the Carnegie Institution of
Washington	LOCATION	or one of the principal colleges commence the publication of a ` Miscella - nea Curiosa , ' comprising bibliographical notices collected by special investigators , general readers , and others , with notes and queries .

		Occasionally , an item found could be made the basis of a quest for additional information .

		American col - leges , through their faculties and students , could well cooperate with the editor , by contributing notices from time to time , and special branches of knowledge might be pursued when desired .

		One of the most important desiderata , as observed by the writer in ` Public Libraries , '
March	DATE	-LRB- 10:123 , 124 -RRB- , would be the formation of a good working bibliogi-aphy of bibliographies , which could be included , as the scope of the `
Miscellanea Curi	PERSON	- osa ' need not be limited .

		All the notices published should be duly ar - ranged and classified in very much the same man - ner as in that model volume , the ` A. L. A. Cat - alog , '
1904	DATE	edition , issued by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The order of the notices would thus eonfoi-m to the common practice of the majority of American libraries , which would conduce to the accessibility of the work .

		A special edition of the `
Miscellanea Curiosa	ORGANIZATION	' could be printed upon only one side of the paper , permitting the separ - ation of individual notices for gumming upon index-cards .

		As to the work itself , an extended illustration of its proposed contents could be compiled with little expense of time and labor ; but the few notices given below wall perhaps suffice for the present .

		The customary classifica - tion is here omitted to economize space .

		THE DIAL 227 tht Htfo 3Books .

		The liLFE-TToRK of THEoi > oitE Thomas .

		* The
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	book , now given to the public just three months after the death of the great conductor , has been prepared by his almost life-long friend , Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	, dean of musical critics in this country , and a man thoroughly fitted for his task , both by his musicianly equipment of experience and instinct , and by his skill in the art of effective literary presentation .

		The book was projected long before the lamented death of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	, and was thus well in hand at the time when he so unexpectedly laid down his baton forever , which fact accounts for its appearance with such fortunate promptness .

		The interest of this book naturally centres in the hundred pages or so of the
Autobiog	LOCATION	- raphy .

		These chapters constitute a ver -RCB- - matter - of-fact statement , bare of all ornament , and devoid of the slightest literary pretence , yet highly important by virtue of their subject - matter .

		His life-histor -RCB- - begins as follows : ' According to the records of the church in
Esens	LOCATION	,
East Friesland	LOCATION	, by the
Xorth Sea	LOCATION	, I was born on the
11th of October , 1835	DATE	.

		At this place my father was Stadtpfeifer / Here we have corrected the statement made in many of the recent obituary notices that
Essen	LOCATION	-LRB- of
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	celebrity -RRB- was the birthplace of Theo - dore
Thomas	PERSON	.

		It appears , indeed , that he was bom in
Holland	LOCATION	, and was saved from being a Dutchman only by his German parentage .

		Of his boyish musical ventures , he says : ' I have been told that I played the violin in pub - lic at the age of five .

		I have not , however , the slightest remembrance of when I began to play .

		My earliest recollection is that my father played the violin , so I played , and that I soon played the music he did .

		The members of his band , or orches - tra , amused themselves by bringing music to me and trying to find something that I could not read off at sight . '

		It was in the
summer of 1845	DATE	that the
Thomas	PERSON	family emigrated to
Xew York	LOCATION	, hav - ing a six weeks ' passage on an American mer - chant vessel .

		The father had a large family to support , and
Theodore	PERSON	contributed assistance by plapng at theatres and dancing-schools .

		In his thirteenth year he , together with liis father , enlisted in a navy band stationed at Ports - mouth ,
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		A year lat `` r , Theodore ob - tained his discharge , and started South on a concert tour of his own . '

		I do not remember taking anything with me but my fiddle , ray little box of clothing , and some posters which I had had printed , announcing a con - •

		cert by `` Master T. T. '' I kept a supply of these posters in my trunk , and when I had no money I first obtained permission to use the dining hall of a hotel for a concert , and then I went around on the day before the concert took place and put up my posters with tacks .

		When the time for the con - cert arrived , I would stand at the door of the hall and take the money until I concluded that my audi - ence was about gathered , after which I woxild go to the front of the hall , unpack my violin , and begin the concert .

		Sometimes I played with piano accom - paniment , but oftener without .

		I have yet in my possession a set of variations on ' ' Home , Sweet Home , '' which I wrote down some years later as a souvenir of those days .

		I did not have printed programmes . '

		Returning to
Xew York	LOCATION	the next year , Theo - dore found a new German theatre established , and was engaged as leading violinist . '

		Here I received my first intellectual impetus , by becom - ing acquainted with the plays of the great Ger - man poets . '

		He also remarks , incidentally , that ^ better music wa ^ played in the theatres then than at `` the present time . '

		The modem play-goer , if he have not the facts necessary for comparison , is at any rate prepared to admit that no music could be worse than what he now hears in such places of amusement .

		The great singers who came to
America	LOCATION	in the early fifties did much to form the musician 's taste during those impressionable years .

		But the problem of actual living remained a difficult one , as the following anecdote attests : ` Once , when I was a boy , I remember , seeing no way of earning the money for my board , I took my fiddle under my coat , went to the bar-room of a hotel , and played , and soon had the money I needed , after which I left .

		Other well-known musicians had to beat the big drum all day in street parades .

		I was , fortunately , not driven to that . '

		In
1853	DATE	,
Thomas	PERSON	played first violin in the orchestra of
L. A. Jullien	PERSON	, described as ^ the musical charlatan of all ages , ' who then came to
Xew York	LOCATION	, bringing with him some excel - lent performers .


Karl Eckert	PERSON	, the leader of Mme.
Sontag	PERSON	's orchestra , was his next master , and made him ' principal ' of the second violins ; besides exerting over him an influence which ' probably laid the foundation of my future career . '

		A year later , he became ' concert - meister ' under
Arditi	PERSON	, whose troupe included such singers as
Lagrange	LOCATION	and
Mirate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the latter he says : * I have always considered Mirate the greatest tenor I have heard , without exception , in voice , compass , method , and musi - cianship . '

		And yet , such is the evanescenc-e of the singers fame , his name is not now to be found in any of the modern dictionaries of music I It was under
Eckert	PERSON	that
Thomas	PERSON	first be - came concerned with the work of orchestral management .

		He was entrusted with the func - tion of making engagements with the men , and says that ' from that time on there was prob - 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, ably no good instrumentalist who did not spend his first years in
America	LOCATION	with the orchestra I formed / From the performance of this func - tion to the organization of his own orchestra was a stage in the conductor 's evolution that covered the next ten years .

		The chief episodes of those years , as far as
Thomas	PERSON	was concerned , were his connection with the Philharmonic Society of
New York	LOCATION	, his chamber concerts given with
William Mason	PERSON	, and his work as ' concertmeister ' with
Ullmann	PERSON	's opera com - pany .

		Meanwhile , he was making a thorough study of harmony and counterpoint .

		In commenTUig upon
Thomas	PERSON	's long period of orchestral leadership , which began in
New York	LOCATION	in
1864	DATE	, and ended with the end of last year in
Chicago	LOCATION	, just after the fourteenth sea - son of the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	was well under way , and the permanent home of the organi - zation had received its inspiring dedication , we shall attempt little more than the singling out of a few suggestive bits of the Autobiography , and of Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's following chapters of ' Eeminiscence and Appreciation . '

		We are not apt to think of Thomas as a joker , but the following story from his early years pleasantly illustrates the more genial side of his nature : ` We also had many little extravaganzas , which provoked much amusement .

		On one occasion , for instance , while playing the `` Linnet Polka , '' I re - quested the piccolo players to climb up into the trees before the piece began .

		When they com - menced playing from their exalted position in the branches , it made a sensation .

		I remember another funny incident which happened about this time .

		In the `` Carnival of
Venice	LOCATION	'' the tuba player had been sent , not up the trees , but back of the audience into the shrubbery .

		When he began to play the police mistook him for a practical joker who was dis - turbing the music , and tried to arrest him !

		I shall never forget the comical scene , as the poor man fled toward the stage , pursued by the irate police - man , and trying to get in a note here and there , as he ran . '

		Possibly we may consider in the light of a joke having
Thomas	PERSON	for its victim his account of a visit from
Barnum	PERSON	sometime during the seventies , when he was invited to tour the country , ` beside the fat woman and the ele - phant , ' as an adjunct to the ' greatest show on earth . ' '

		This was a high tribute , ' he adds , ' but what had I done to deserve it ? '

		The Great Fire in
Chicago	LOCATION	played an impor - tant part in
Thomas	LOCATION	's fortunes , for he had been booked to open the season of the
Crosby Opera House	ORGANIZATION	on the
evening of the very day	TIME	when the city -- opera house and all -- was laid in ashes .

		He reached the city while it was burning , and at once went through to
St. Louis	LOCATION	, the scene of his next engagement .

		He says : `
Providence	LOCATION	evidently wished to discipline me a little more .

		I was still too young , too presuming , and had too much vitality .

		But let that pass .

		It is sufficient that I became so involved financially by this disaster , and the consequent interruption of our tour , that it was many years before I recovered from my losses , and the wearisome travelling had to go on indefinitely . '

		Another unfortunate experience for Thomas personally -LRB- although the public benefitted vast - ly by it during two seasons -RRB- was his connection with the
American Opera Company	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1886-8 -RRB- .

		` The conductorship was offered to me , and I ac - cepted it , for I believed in the idea , and I knew it would also give my orchestra a permanent engage - ment , and relieve me from the responsibility of paying salaries .

		My hopes , however , were doomed to disappointment , for it soon became evident that there were peculiarities of management which neither art nor business could long endure .


Finan	PERSON	- cially the case was soon hopeless , and the only question left for me was how to get out of the toils in which I had been cunningly ensnared .

		The management refused to allow the much-abused and at last fatally stricken organization to die a natural death or have decent burial , and so it came about that toward the close it was either a disgrace or a calamity to every one connected with it .

		Even after it finally was dead and buried , its apparition haunted different cities all over the country for a time .

		My official connection with it had been lim - ited to that of musical director .

		I had no business interest in it whatever , but I was for years after - wards involved in lawsuits brought against me by its victims . '

		These were dark days indeed , and
Thomas	PERSON	in
1888	DATE	found himself seemingly no nearer to the permanent organization of which he so long had dreamed than he had been many years earlier .

		He even had to disband his orchestra , and become an itinerant conductor of impro - vised bands .

		This was the time when
New York	LOCATION	made ' the great refusal , ' and missed the greatest musical opportunity in its history .

		But the clouds were even then ready to break , and
Chicago	LOCATION	was preparing to offer what
New York	LOCATION	had withheld .

		In
1890	DATE	the project of the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	took shape , and the year following witnessed the beginning of
Thomas	PERSON	's thirteen years of continuous leadership in this city .

		How a body of public-spirited citizens met the deficits of these concerts for thirteen years , and gave their unquestioning support to the highest ideal of musical art as represented by him , undisturbed by the popular clamor for cheapened music and lowered standards , is a matter of history so recent that it does not call for setting-forth in detail .

		The most recent history of all is that of the campaign for a per - manent home for the orchestra , a campaign successfully prosecuted , whereof the visible signs are the beautiful hall which since last
December	DATE	has opened its .

		doors weekly to thou - sands of delighted music-lovers , and in which the concerts now continue , and will continue indefinitely , uninterrupted even by the death of their organizer , save for the one occasion when respect for his memory and grief for

		THE DIAI .

		229 his loss closed the doors for a few days .

		The last words of the Autobiography are these : ` We are now in the fourteenth season of the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its permanency is secure , its home is built , and the object for which I have worked all my life is accomplished .

		The old saying , `` Better late than never , '' comes to mind as I see in my seventieth year the realization of the dreams of my youth .

		But I trust I may stiU live long enough to show my gratitude to the men and women who have made this possible , and to leave behind me a young and vigorous institution to crown the achievement with a long future . '

Upton	PERSON	's work begins where that of Thomas ends , and gives us , first of all , a few pages on ' The Last Days of
Theodore Tliomas	PERSON	/ then a section of ' Reminiscence and Apprecia - tion ' extending to nearly one hundred and fifty pages .

		There is some supplementary material furnished for the early period , but in the main Mr.
Upton	PERSON	has confined himself to the years since
1869	DATE	, when
Thomas	PERSON	first brought his orchestra to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the critic first made his acquaintance .

		His first words to the writer -LRB- then and for many years thereafter musical critic of the
Chicago	LOCATION	' Tribune ' -RRB- were charcteristic .

		* I am glad to meet any friend of Mr.
Dohn	PERSON	's , and will be pleased to have you come and see me while I am here .

		You must not expect me to call upon you , for I am too busy , and besides , I never go into newspaper offices .

		I have no need to culti - vate the critics , for I know my work .

		I do not care to read what they write , and would not have time if I did care .

		* Such was the beginning of a warm friendship that was to last for thirty-five years .

		Speak - ing of the work now published , which it took much persuasion to induce
Thomas	PERSON	to sanction , he said : ' 1 will write my autobiography as part of our work .

		It will be only a general sketch of my life , and you must fiU in the de - tails , for which I have not time . '

		In thus completing the record , Mr.
Upton	PERSON	has given us matter both light and serious , skilfully pre - serving the balance in a well-proportioned nar - rative .

		By way of diversion , we are given a number of amusing anecdotes .

		A
Xew York	LOCATION	town was being canvassed for a prospective con - cert , and the information vouchsafed by a lead - ing citizen that the ` show would n't pay much unless
Thomas	PERSON	had a good end man . '

		Somewhere in
Utah	LOCATION	' it was gravely suggested that the more wedding marches he had on his pro- gramme the better . '

		An
Iowa	LOCATION	critic thought that the Boccherini Minuet was unfairly dealt with by its performance pianissimo con sordini , on the ground that ' such a pretty tune deserves to be played louder . '

		In
Keokuk	LOCATION	, the amuse - ment purveyor was surprised to be informed that
Thomas	PERSON	would not consent to play dance music after the concert was over and the flour cleaned .

		* Why not ?

		Ca n't they play dances well enough ? '

		In a
Michigan	LOCATION	town , there was a municipal hold-up in the shape of an official intimation that the licence of the orchestra troupe would be revoked unless free tickets were sent to all the members of the common coun - cil .

		This concert was to be given in the court house , and when the city fathers arrived , armed with their free tickets , they were escorted to the jury box and the prisoner 's pen , to the huge delight of the audience .

		By way of more serious matter , Mr.
Upton	PERSON	reports such characteristic words of Thomas as the following : ` Throughout my life my aim has been to make good music popular , and it now appears that I have only done the public justice in believing and acting constantly on the belief that the people would enjoy and support the best in art when continually set before them in a clear , intelligent manner . '

		The indomitable will which led him to eventual .

		success is finely illustrated in the following words : * I was hungry
last night	TIME	, but no fox gnawing at my side , as in the Spartan story , can make me aban - don the course of life I have laid out for myself .

		I have gone without food longer than I should , I have walked when I could not afford to ride , I have even played when my hands were cold , but I shall succeed , for I shall never give up my belief that at last the people will come to me , and my concerts will be crowded .

		I have undying faith in the latent musical appreciation of the American public ' This tribute to
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	expresses in some slight degree the feeling with which the great - est of all composers is regarded by those who have lived for long years in communion with his work : ` Take
Beethoven	PERSON	's music , it is something more than mere pleasure ; it is education , thought , emo - tion , love , and hope .

		I do not doubt that when my orchestra plays one of his symphonies , every soul in the audience is stirred in a different way and by a different suggestion .

		I care not from what sta - tion in life come the thousands who sit back of me .

		Beethoven will touch each according to his needs , and the very same cadence that may waft the thoughts of one to drowsy delight or oblivion may stir the heart of another to higher aspirations -- may give another hope in his despair , may bring to yet another a message of love . '

		Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's eloquent final characterization of
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	must now be quoted .

		` Thus passed from our midst the great musician who had wrought so long , so devotedly , so courage - ously for the things that make for the refinement of life and for the ennobling of the spirit , never once degrading the great gift which had been given him , never yielding to a sordid consideration , nor compromising his art with commercialism .

		His life is an example for American youth of a great purpose nobly striven for , nobly won , of work for civic and individual righteousness , of patience in well-doing , of honors modestly received , of success richly earned .

		He has affected the lives of thousands of men and women for good , by diverting their tastes from the trivial and meretricious to nobler and purer things , for great music is a moral influence 230 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Life and music may be more intimately related than we know .

		Music helps to keep body and soul in health , and no man 's education can be called complete without it . '

		In the appendix to the first volume of this
Avork	LOCATION	,
Thomas	PERSON	speaks to ns once more with his own mouth in the reprint of his weighty pages on ' Musical Possibilities in
America	LOCATION	/ first published in ' Scribner 's Magazine ' for
March , 1881	DATE	.

		The chief value of this paper is in its condemnation of the ' movable do system ' in elementary instruction , and its plea for absolute pitch as the only possible basis of sound musi - cal teaching .

		The voice is of one crying in the wilderness , but the logic is beyond the jwssi - bility of dispute .

		A reprinted newspaper arti - ele on ' Music in
Chicago	LOCATION	' is also of much inter - est. .

		The volume closes with some thirty pages of addresses , resolutions , and memorial tributes from various sources .

		The second volume of Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's work is made up chiefly of the programmes of fifty years , beginning with the
Mason	PERSON	-
Thomas	PERSON	cham - ber concerts , and ending with the concerts of the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the selection had to be made from nearly ten thousand pro- grammes , many omissions were necessary , but fourteen important groups are given complete , and the others are t3 ^ pically represented .

		For this volume ,
Tliomas	PERSON	wrote last
summer	DATE	a spe - cial introduction , extending to thirty-three pages , and dealing with the topics of pro- gramme-making , encores , late-comers , the prac - tical efi'ects of music , and the technique of the modern orchestra .

		The value of these notes is altogether out of proportion to their length , and we should like nothing better than to quote extensively from them .

		We will content our - selves with a single extract from the words addressed to the habitual late-comer . '

		Can a greater injustice be perpetrated on others who perhaps have made considerable sacrifice to be punctual , and have prepared themselves to enter into the spirit of the music to be performed , than suddenly and rudely to be aroused from a musical exaltation , in which they are oblivious of their surroundings , by persons who oblige them to rise and let them squeeze by to their seats , and who perhaps even talk , after they are seated , about something not at all in harmony with the music or the occasion ?

		Why , everybody understands that it is not only rude to be late to a dinner party , but that the seating of the late-comer creates such a disturbance of the atmosphere that it is difficult to establish unity of feeling again for that evening .

		How much more fatal is it to the unity of a con - cert . '

		As for the box-holders who indulge in noisy conversation , words are incapable of doing jus - tice to such offenders . '

		I must be excused for giving an opinion on this species of disturb - ance , for ray gift of emphatic language is not adequate to the subject . '

		And yet
Thomas	PERSON	had a very pretty talent for expressing himself em - phatically when emphasis seemed called for .

		His occasional habit of rebuking vulgar offend - ers against the rights of the music-lover is surely one of the blessings -- even if a minor one -- that we attach to his memory .

		And we liless him also for his insistence upon punctual - ity and the methods by which he enforced it , and for his determination not to mar the unity and balance of his programmes by concessions to the greedy inconsiderate persons who ask for encores , and above all for the determination which forced upon us , 5 ` ear after year , whether we liked it or not , the music that it was good for us to hear .

		It was a long and discouraging task , this education of the public taste in music , but it was accomplished at last , by a persistency of effort of which few men would have been capable , and
Thomas	PERSON	lived long enough to know by experience that his efforts toward this end had been really worth while .

		This must have been even a greater satisfaction to him than the permanent estab - lishment of his orchestra , which he also lived to ^ ^ ^ -

		* In the midst of a remarkable output of American historical works , it still remains true that the appearance of a new volume of

		Readers who have had their expectations raised to a high pitch by a perusal of his previous volumes will find no disappointment in the fifth , which deals with the period of 1864-60 .

		Tac - itus may also be quoted on that species of war which ' makes a desert and calls it peace . '

		It must have been reflections upon his famous march which gave to
Sherman	PERSON	his no less famous description of war .

		An entire chapter is devoted to that most delicate of all subjects , prisoners of war .

		The authors treatment is not colorless , yet only the most radical on either side can take excep - tions to it .

		The records are incomplete , but from the best sources obtainable the author figures out that the mortality in
Southern	LOCATION	prisons was 15.5 per cent. , while that in
Northern	LOCATION	prisons was a little more than 12 per cent .

		When the different conditions of the two sections are considered , a greater differ - ence might have been expected .

		Perhaps the policy of reducing rations in retaliation was adopted by the authorities at
Washington	LOCATION	on insufficient grounds .

		The authors conclusion i. * i that , * All things considered , the statistics show no reason why the North should reproach the South .

		If we add to one side of the account the refusal to exchange the prisoners and the greater resources , and to the other the distress of the Confederacy , the balance struck will not be far from even .

		Certain it is that no deliberate intention existed either in
Richmond	LOCATION	or in
Washington	LOCATION	to inflict suffer - ings on captives more than inevitably ac - companied their confinement . '

		The inhu - manity is explained rather by the fact that ' Prom wars imnambered evils flow , -- The unexhausted source of every human woe . '

		Two chapters give interesting accounts of social conditions in the North and South dur - ing the war .

		This ac-count has often been given for the South , but we still get glimpses of things heretofore more or less in the dark .

		In both , sections there were gayety and gloom , hard times and extravagance , retrenchment and speculation , generosity and meanness , re - ligious devotion and shameless immorality , loyalty and disloyalty , honesty and dishonesty .

		In both sections the people suffered from the rigors of martial law ; but in the South the suspension of the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus lasted for only one year , five months , and two days , and all this time by act of the
Confederate Congress	ORGANIZATION	, while in the North the suspension lasted one year , ten months , and twenty-one days by Executive assumption , and the rest of the time by act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a work of this scope one might reasonably have expected a fuller treat - ment of the very important subject of military arrests and the suppression of newspapers .

		The execution of Wm.
B. Mumford	PERSON	at
New Orleans	LOCATION	is merely mentioned as the cause of
Davis	PERSON	's proclamation of outlawry against But - ler , but the author fails to state that the exe - cution was on a charge of treason .

		If Mum - ford was a citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	, the Constitution prescribed the method for his trial , which was not followed ; if he was an alien enemy , he could not have been guilty of treason against the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the discussion of illicit trading with the enemy and frauds on the government , General
Butler	PERSON	comes in for his due meed of blame for the questionable business transactions which brought him considerable wealth .

		Perhaps the
General	ORGANIZATION	's reputation is black enough , but it might have been made still blacker had the author seen fit to go still more deeply into historical sources .

		If the suppressed report of the committee appointed by the War De - partment to investigate his conduct has not Wn destroyed , it certainly seems time for it to 1 > e exploited .

		The surprising thing is , that 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, stem old Puritan
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, after
Butler	PERSON	's career at N ^ ew Orleans and
Norfolk	LOCATION	, should have so highly honored this man whose ' repu - tion at the bar before the war broke out was that of an unscrupulous practitioner . '

		The shameless pillage and plunder engaged in by subordinates and common soldiers at
New Orleans	LOCATION	, largely under the guise of sequestra - tion and confiscation , are hardly mentioned in this narrative , though the newspapers of the day were full of specific references to them .

		As so much energy is now being expended on the history of Eeconstruction , the contribu - tion of Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	to that subject will be read with much interest .

		Under Lincoln 's well - known ' ten-per-cent . '

		plan , the people of
Louis	LOCATION	- iana inaugurated a State government early in
1864	DATE	.

		Lincoln wished to have Congrees recognize this government ; but it was never done , though two Congressmen from
Louisiana	LOCATION	had been admitted to seats a little more than a year before .

		The author does not bring out the internal condition of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, the wretched divisions and bickerings of the Unionists , and the fact that the government was the creature of the military power , which would have justified
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in refusing rec - ognition .

		However , the puny child might have developed a strong body by careful nurs - ing .

		But this was not the reason why Con - gress held back .

		It was due rather , as the author points out , to the obstinacy of Senator
Sumner	PERSON	, who , though a majority favored the resolution , would not allow it to pass because the new constitution of
Louisiana	LOCATION	had not conferred the suffrage on the negro .

		And herein was foreshadowed that long series of evils subsequently poured upon the wretched South by Sumner and by
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	.

		In strong contrast with this was the mag - nanimous spirit of Lincoln , who , ' with malice toward none , with charity for all , ' wished to ' bind up the nation 's wounds . '

		He wished the suffrage conferred upon the ' very intelli - gent ' colored people , but did not consider this an indispensable condition for readmission .

		Tbe debate as to whether the States were in or out of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	he regarded as a senseless quibble .

		Nobody doubted that they were out of their proper relation to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		He summed up the situation in
Louisiana	LOCATION	by a homely illustration .

		Granting that the new government is only an egg , ' we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it . '

		At his last cabinet meeting , he said : ^ I think it providential that this great rebellion is crushed just as
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has ad - journed and there are none of the disturbing elements of that body to embarrass us .

		If we are wise and discreet we shall reanimate the States and get their governments - in successful operation , with order prevailing and the
Union	ORGANIZATION	re-established , before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	comes together in
December	DATE	. ''

		The failure of this plan in the hands of his successor , the author attrib - utes mainly to
Johnson	PERSON	's lack of political sense .

		Lincoln himself probably would have had a fight with
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but his command - ing personality would have won on the main points .

		The so-called ' harsh legislation ' of the
Southern States	LOCATION	toward the negro , of which
Blaine	PERSON	, ignorant of the fact that some of it was copied from the laws of
Maine	LOCATION	, made so much , is set forth in its proper light .

		The further story of Reconstruction , to appear in the next volume , will be awaited with much interest .

		This volume makes a distinct contribution to the history of its period , in the subjects of society at the North , prisoners of war , and perhaps on
Sherman	PERSON	's march .

		Tlie copious citations in the foot-notes indicate a good use of source material .

		To the specialist , the work will appeal as authoritative until more evidence is forthcoming .

		The author has per - formed a distinct service in showing that a non-partisan account of our great Civil War need not be colorless .

		J THE DIAL t38 according to Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	.

		It is postu - lated that throughout the whole universe , * in every atom and every molecule / ' are found three fundamental attributes : matter , force , and sen - sation .

		This is what Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	him - self calls ' a monistic trinity , ' a trimonism not less mysterious than that of the theologians .

		The scientific philosophers of the nineteenth century .

		Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	and his contem - poraries , did a great service in unifying and therefore simplifying human thought .

		At the beginning of the century , facts were being re - corded rapidly , and it might have been expected that science would at length become a vast storehouse of miscellaneous information , quite beyond the power of man to utilize or compre - hend .

		In biology , there was the unceasing dis - covery of new species , some thousands of them described by Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	himself ; and of course this outpouring of new material has continued to the present day , yearly increasing in volume .

		Yet , notwithstanding all this , sci - ence becomes continually more intelligible and rational ; the pattern of things is gradually made clear as hitherto missing parts are sup - plied ; and , in short , we are daily more assured of the fundamental unity and harmony of the universe .

		Thus , in a sense , all scientific men are monists ; all believe that their smallest con - tributions possess value for the very reason that they help toward an understanding of the totality of things , so far as this max be grasped by the human mind .

		In another sense , however , it may fairly be maintained that all sane men are dualists .

		The fundamental dualism is that of the I and the not-I ; our lives are made up of the actions and reactions between these two .

		Regarding tilings objectively , and as a mere matter of logic , it is possible to argue that our very con - sciousness is but a part of the nature of things , free will being no more inherent in human beings than in gases or crystals .

		This is really Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	's position , and yet it is im - possible to read his very human work without a keen sense of his personality as a consciously free agent .

		There used to be at Maskelyne and
Cook 's	ORGANIZATION	, in
London	LOCATION	, an automaton which played chess , and was able , it was said , to beat nearly all comers .

		The proprietors of the de - vice declared that it was a mere mechanism , and indeed inspection seemed to preclude the possi - bility of someone being concealed within .

		N ^ evertheless , it was the general opinion that there was a free agent somewhere , and a clergy - man of my acquaintance , baffled in the attempt to furnish a more ordinary explanation , really believed that the conjurors were in league with the devil .

		In much the same way .

		we must be permitted to discount Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	's assur - ance that even he himself is an automaton , -- a mere result of blind preexisting causes , -- leav - ing it , however , to our clerical friends to offer the diabolical hypothesis !

		It is not fair to say that Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	is unaware of this difficulty .

		He overcomes it , to his own satisfaction , by adding sensation to force and matter as a third universal attribute of being .

		There is the ' sensation ' of atoms , that is , the affinity of the elements in chemical combinations .

		The ' sensation ' of protoplasm is what is often spoken of as its ' irritability . '

		So passing upward through twelve defined stages , we reach the sensation of civilized man , producing the arts and sciences .

		This ' sensa - tion ' is one in the sense that force is one , and matter is one , and is indestructible in the same sense .

		Thus it is not necessary to postulate that the human consciousness is the outcome of any metamorphosis of matter or force ; on the contrar -RCB- ' , this is denied , and it is said to lie merely the highest type of another universal attribute , ' sensation . '

		We reach a sort of pan - theism rather than atheism .

		It is likely to be claimed by materialistic monists , that this is giving away the whole monistic position ; that the ' monistic trinity ' is a contradiction in terms , notwithstanding
Haeckel	PERSON	's arguments in its defense .

		It may be so , but that is merely a question of words , and it is much more interesting to investigate the merits of the Haeckelian doctrine than to dis - pute about its label .

		It is not very easy to understand what is meant by an unconscious sensation , though we are reminded of the pho - tographer 's use of the word ' sensitive ' in con - nection with his plates , and of the chemist 's ` sensitive reaction . '

		At all events , letting the term pass , it is not shown that consciousness and sensation -LRB- in the Haeckelian sense -RRB- are the same thing , even in the sense that light and heat are the same .

		It is rather assumed be - cause philosophy requires it ; and if one can - not so believe as a matter of faith , there is no resort to actual demonstration .

		Accepting the ` monistic trinity , ' it does not seem to me that it is necessary to reject the immortality of the soul , or even a personal God .

		Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	rejects these , but for other reasons ; practically , because they seem to him totally unproved and unlikely .

		If ' sensation ' is a universal attribute , and human consciousness is a phase of it , does it not seem reasonable to suppose that it reaches similarly high development in many places and wa3 's in this vast universe ?

		That it should be otherwise , would seem as ` hnprobable as that elaborate chemical compounds or combinations of forces should be restricted to one or a very few places .

		This on the Haeckelian hypothesis , merely .

		* That the late
Canon Liddon	ORGANIZATION	, highest of High Churchmen , strictest of ritualists , and so devoted a Puseyite as in some matters to out-Pusey his chief , will be to very many readers no congenial subject for contemplation and study , is of course at once to be taken for granted by the reviewer of his ' Life and Let - ters ' as prepared for publication by his inti - mate friend , the Rev.
John Octavius Johnston	PERSON	.

		Yet the steadiness of purpose , the firmness of conviction , and the faithfulness to the truth as he saw it , which Liddon displayed in a life of singular consistency and unfaltering obedi - ence to the high call of duty , are such as to awaken the interests of even a listless reader and to challenge the admiration of however violent a dissenter from the eminent theolo - gian 's doctrinal teachings .

		to left , steadily advances , through easy grada - tions , to a position of eminence and distinc - tion and the fruition of appropriate and de - served honors and emoluments .


Henry Parr	PERSON	-RCB- '
Liddon	PERSON	's was exactly such a life of wisely economized energy and honestly earned suc - cess .

		He chose his calling in mere childhood , and thenceforward thought and action were guided and applied with sole reference to the contemplated end .

		As an infant , it was his favorite diversion to play at preaching , envel - oped in the ample folds of the ' Times ' news - paper .

		Except swimming , he took little part in boyhood 's usual sports and games , but was accepted by his schoolmates as their spiritual mentor , and was recognized by them as one that dwelt apart in a world of purity and high ideals which even their unredeemed natures knew how to respect .

		Sermon-writing was one of his cherised amusements , and five of these discourses , composed at the age of four - teen , are still extant in a copy-book which he sent to his Aunt
Louisa	PERSON	with the inscription , ' My first attempts at sermons . '

		But we are relieved to learn that these early indications of unmitigated priggishness were offset by sundry qualities of healthy boy-nature .

		He is remem - bered for his courage in more than one youth - ful combat . '

		I have seen him fight many a good fight and come out smiling , ' writes one of his school-fellows .

		And a story is told of his frank request in open school , ' Please , sir , may I leave off learning Greek ?

		I am sure I shall never understand it . '

		Plays , too , as well as sermons he was fond of writing , though he had never been inside a theatre ; and one of these juvenile pieces , '
Napoleon	PERSON	, ' * an his - torical drama rather than a tragedy , ' exhibit - ing ' vices to be avoided rather than virtues to be imitated , ' he and some of his schoolmates acted with success .

		The science of warfare , strangely enough , was also exceedingly inter - esting to the little preacher , who eagerly dis - cussed the details of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's Gallic campaigns and
Napoleon	PERSON	's battles .

		To Mr.
Frederic Har	PERSON	- rison , as quoted by Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	, we are in - debted for a pleasing portrait of the boy Lid - don ; and as his boyhood and youth present more of general interest than the ecclesiastical and doctrinal discussions and disputes of later life , an extended extract from Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's reminiscences is here offered . '

		I sat beside Liddon more than fortj ' years ago in the Sixth Form at
King 's College School	ORGANIZATION	, for a year or two .

		He was three years my senior , and the gulf that exists from fourteen to seventeen among school - fellows is not easily passed .

		But I sat in form next to him , and as in the Sixth we did not change places , I was his daily companion , I was fond of all sorts of games ; he of none .

		I read all sorts of books ; he had even then his own fixed line of thought and of
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIALi 235 study .

		He was much my senior , and very old for his years , so there was no kind of school intimacy between us .

		He always seemed to me an elder brother who wished the young ones were more seri - ous .

		But , different though our interests and habits were , I always found him friendly , gentle , and con - siderate .

		What was
Canon Liddon	ORGANIZATION	like as a boy of seventeen ?

		Well , so far as I can remember , he was at seventeen just what he was at twenty-seven , or thirty-seven , or forty-seven -- sweet , grave , thought - ful , complete .

		... To me , when I heard him preaching in
St. Paul	LOCATION	's , or heard him speak at Oxford of more recent years , he was just the same earnest , zealous , affectionate , and entirely other - world nature that I remember him at seventeen .

		The lines of his face may have deepened ; the look may have become more anxious of late years ; but as a schoolboy I always thought he looked just what he did as a priest .

		There was the same expression of sweet , somewhat fatherly , somewhat melancholy interest .

		He would reprove , exhort , advise boys just as a young priest does in his own congregation .

		We expected it of him .

		... I do not think that he ever joined in any game or even looked on at any game ; I am sure that he never took part in the rough-and-tumble horseplay common among boys ; and I am certain he never returned a blow or a prac - tical joke at his expense .

		Nor had he any occasion to do so , for neither blows nor horseplay was evei practised upon Liddon .

		There was , I fancy , a kind of silent understanding that to treat Liddon rudely , even without intending it , would be unmanly , like striking a priest with his robes on . '

		A pleasing incident recorded in connection with
Liddon	PERSON	's life at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is his saving the life of his tutor at a
summer	DATE	reading party ,
William Stubbs	PERSON	, the future professor of mod - ern histwv and
Bishop of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		This good fortune he owed to his prowess as a swim - mer .

		To present in something like due propor - tion the varied qualities , admirable and not so admirable , of the man Liddon , -- and not to dwell exclusively on his more amiable traits , -- we must next touch on a few of those dis - tinctive characteristics that made him so well known as one of the leading and most un - compromising High Churchmen of his time .

		Appointed , soon after his graduation from
Oxford	LOCATION	, vice-principal of
Bishop Wilberforce	ORGANIZATION	's newh ' - established Cuddesdon Theological Col - lege , he there displayed ritualizing tendencies that soon got the school into hot water and ultimately necessitated his resignation .

		Here is a characteristic extract from his diary : ` The Bishops of
Glasgow	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	have rep - resented to him -LSB-
Wilberforce	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- in the strongest terms the necessity of making the chapel less `` gaudy . ''

		Accordingly -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Cross has been removed ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the white and green Altar cloths are forbidden ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the painted figures on the wall are to be covered over ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- the celebrant is to stand at the end , not in front , of the Altar .

		This last change I feel to be the most important ; it is doctrinal .

		The Bishops wish to abolish the early Communions ou
Sundays	DATE	, but these happily have been saved . '

		Seven years later we find him most ungra - cioush ^ refusing to preach in
Westminster Ab	ORGANIZATION	- bey because the invitation was extended to him by
Dean Stanley	PERSON	, whose Broad-Church principles he disapproved ; or , to put it more accurately , his refusal appears to have been due to the latitudinarianism both of Dean
Stanley	PERSON	and also of the men --
Maurice	PERSON	,
Jowett	PERSON	, and others -- who were asked , at the same time with him , to occupy the Abbey pulpit .

		This is the strain in which he justifies his declination : ` You say , my dear Mr , Dean , that we refuse to preach in the same church with yourself .

		You will , I trust , forgive me for saying that Churchmen have hoped -- hoped and prayed , hoped against hope -- that one from whom so much might be expected , as j' ourself , would one day be with them .

		Even now we do not acquiesce in the miserable conviction that you have cast in your lot with men , like
Colenso	PERSON	and others , who are labouring to destroy and blot out the Faith of Jesus Christ from the hearts of the English people .

		We still believe that your gener - osity , rather than your judgment , links you even to Mr.
Maurice	PERSON	and Mr.
Jowett	PERSON	.

		We are quite sure your love of truth , your sense of moral beauty , and in eminent degree your historical tastes and wide sympathies , link you to us , who cherish the move - ment of 1833-50 , as to no other men in the English Church .

		You will , I trust , forgive the extreme freedom with which I have answered a letter , to which silence might have been the most respectful answer , if it had not been open to misunder - standing . '

		This from a young man of thirty-four to the
Very Eev	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dean of Westminster !

		How little he understood the other 's ' wide sympathies ' !

		Many matters , such as the '
Lux Mundi	ORGANIZATION	' controversy , the '
Bampton Lectures	ORGANIZATION	, ' the re - grettable agitation over
Jowett	PERSON	's alleged heresy ,
Liddon	PERSON	's reply to lilartineau 's ' Seat of Authority in
Eeligion	LOCATION	, ' his friendly relations with
Gladstone	PERSON	on the one hand and
Salisbury	PERSON	on the other , his refusal to consider the offer of a bishopric at the request of either , his dis - tinction as a pulpit orator , and his famous sermons at
Oxford	LOCATION	, at
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	, and else - where , might profitably be dwelt on by the reviewer , but must be dismissed with a bare mention and left to be enjoj ` ed -LRB- or not -RRB- in their entirety by readers of the book .

		Turn - ing to the Bishop of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	's closing chap - ter , personal and eulogistic in character , we will extract a final passage which , picturing to us the mature man , will serve as companion piece to Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's pen portrait of the youth .

		After speaking of the far richer and nobler nature than betrayed itself in the numerous controversies that engaged his zeal , the writer , referring to
Liddon	ORGANIZATION	's more inti - mate friends , continues : ` They remember him as one who , possessing in extraordinary measure the gifts most perilous to 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, simplicity and modesty , and so wielding those gifts that men of all sorts gathered round him in thou - sands and listened to him as to no other preacher , yet remained un marred by admiration and kept quite out of his heart all the degrading thoughts of what is called success ; -- remained apparently one of the least self-conscious of men , ready to enter with undivided interest into anything that was of real interest to others ; as simply grateful as a child for the simplest kindness shown to him ; never talk - ing about himself , nor talking as men do who , when they are silent , think much about themselves ; and making others somehow feel that it would not do to talk to him as though they thought him remark - able or great .

		Something of that restraining influ - ence seems still to belong to the very thought and memory of him ; it makes one hesitate -LRB- not in doubt , but in reverence -RRB- about venturing to give him the deep praise of humility and simplicity ; but one can say that the constant tokens of a very hum - ble , simple heart were there , through all his exercise of splendid powers and all the tribute rendered him by men .

		... It is hard to imagine any one talking much better than he did .

		The voice , the look , the manner , the perfect flexibility of tone ; the phrases that summed up everything , the reti - cence that suggested more than any phrase ; the ges - ture , or something less obtrusive than a gesture , which came in when any word would have been clumsy ; the delicate enunciation that was always precise and never prim , that lent itself alike to earnestness and fun ; -- these were but the accessory graces of a mind rich with knowledge of all sorts , and swift to bring out the aptest thought , and of an imagination so vivid that every detail stood at once before it , so discerning that it saw at once the detail that meant most .

		Indeed , most minds , as they move in talking , appear to be rather lumbering things in comparison with what one can recall of him . '

		As an example of brilliant qualities of intel - lect and character , of sound scholarship and , his convictions being what they were , of clear thinking , of high endeavor and exalted ideals , of lofty moral courage and untiring energy , of quickening spiritual power and winning per - sonality , Liddon commands our cordial admi - ration ; and to his faithful historian our thanks are due for a worthy addition to the literature of biography .

		By a curious coincidence , there appears , simultaneously with
Liddon	PERSON	's life , the life , as told in his letters , of the man whom
Liddon	PERSON	had the good fortune to rescue from an un - timely death , as already related .

		The two books serve in some degree to supplement each other .

		The picture we paint of a writer from reading his published works is more often than not widely at variance with the reality .

		It will cause some surprise to learn from Bishop
Stubbs	PERSON	's letters , as edited and supplemented with explanatory matter by Mr.
William Holden Hutton	PERSON	, that the learned historian of the English Constitution had a rare gift of humor , a keen wit , a geniality , sweetness , and charm , that not even the formalities of correct letter-writing could wholly disguise .

		Toil and learning , vast though they were in his case , need not , one is glad to see , quench the inborn spirit of merriment .

		The brightness and lightness of his fun , always under the most perfect control -LRB- for no man possessed a more admirable reserve -RRB- , were delightfully in contrast with the notion of his pereonality as entertained by those who knew him only through his books .

		A few reminiscences of him contributed by Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	help to give a true conception of his winning pres - ence .

		That he was without vanity and that he found learning its own sufficient reward , is also made clear .

		His editor has gathered this volume of letters primarily because ' it was felt that later times might well have cause to complain if they should be able to learn as little about the life of the great English his - torian of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	as we are able to know of Bishop
Butler	PERSON	. '

		It is to be hoped that , faithfully as Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	has exe - cuted his task , -- and his interspersed matter is illuminative and indispensable to the best en - joyment of the letters , -- that a fuller , more formal biography of Bishop
Stubbs	PERSON	may some day be written .

		Among the best letters must bo named the frequent missives , by no means always so dry and tough as our historian 's Charters , to
E. A. Freeman	PERSON	and
J. E. Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the desipere in loco
Stubbs	PERSON	was a master , at least in his correspondence .

		The following , from a letter to
Freeman	PERSON	, contains a delicious hit at that historian 's pedantic insistence on the use of Anglo-Saxon forms : ' A horrid thought has just penetrated to what my friends are pleased to call my brain -- that I have had two missives from you , and have answered neither .

		I am , in fact , rather languid after the production of my book .

		However , neither I nor
Boase	PERSON	either , know or believe anything about
Thierry	PERSON	's speech of
Henry I.	PERSON	, and about the veto I know nothing , and
Boase	PERSON	only knows that it was the result of some diplomatic juggling in the time of Hlodowigh XIV . '

		Eeferring on his first page to the * great school ' that ' arose in the middle of the nine - teenth century , which embodied and expressed the enthusiasm of the time for an ordered study of the past , ' the editor declares that ' of the workers in that school the greatest was
William Stubbs	PERSON	. '

		What rank then , some will ask , shall we assign to his great contemporary -LRB- and senior by two years -RRB- and successor in the chair of modern history at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	?

		But the quality of a biographers panegyric is not , and should not be , strained .

		Both reader and writer delight to dwell in fond remem - brance on the prowess of a deceased hero .

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTATi 237 Recext Books about Music * Some years ago , at the end of a long and ani - mated discussion with that profound and some - times illogical thinker ,
John Ruskin	PERSON	, when asked for a definition of art ,
W. J. Stillman	PERSON	replied : * The harmonic expression of human emotion . '

		Elaborating on this definition , he afterwards pointed out that science -- knowl - edge -- is common to all men , and invariable ; it is in the emotional nature that men differ ; the character of the emotion is that of the indi - vidual , and it is this which gives tone and char - acter to the art , which determines the artist , and imposes itself on all the judgments and criticisms of his art as the element that gives precedence .

		Art is therefore , in the last reduc - tion , the proclamation of individuality ; and the stamp of the art is that of the individuality , nature furnishing merely the pabulum .

		In her book entitled ' Makers of Song , * Miss
Amra	ORGANIZATION	.


Alice Chapin	PERSON	has endeavored to indicate the men who have in the most marked degree influ - enced the development of song .

		She points out that the development of music , and especially of lyric music , has been a matter of such subtle and slow gradation that the task of particular - izing and enumerating and selecting the domi - nant factors in the progress has presented many difficulties ; but if the sign-posts pointed out should lead some student into a more compre - hensive understanding of the history of song than it has been the author 's privilege to achieve , the aim of the book will have been fulfilled .

		Beginning with the twelfth century , the days of Bemart de Yentadom , of
Eegnault de Coucy	ORGANIZATION	, of John of Fornsete -- who gave the world the earliest piece of harmonic music , ' Sumer is icumen in , ' -- through the days of the Minnesinger of
Germany	LOCATION	, with the
Casta	PERSON	- nets , she passes on to the years of
Pierre Gued	PERSON	- ron , teacher of kings and master of the seven - teenth century chanson and romance in
France	LOCATION	, and of StradeUa and PurceU .

		In regard to such departures as the inclusion of such men as LuUy , StradeUa , and
John of Fornsete	ORGANIZATION	, the author feels that she will require no justifica - tion beyond a careful study of the works of these composers and of the lyrical productions imm ediately following their periods of activity .

		Miss
Chapin	PERSON	's work is both statistical and nar - rative , and her well - written story of the origin of song will be read with interest .

		It has been said of Dr.
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	that he often ' expresses what one has felt , but never quite formulated . '

		His first work , ' From Grieg to
Brahms	PERSON	, ' was commended for its succinctness , clearness , and gracefulness of expression .

		His latest work , '
Beethoven	PERSON	and his Forerunners , ' displays that firm grasp of the subject which makes it interesting as well as valuable reading for the student .

		It opens with a chapter on ' The Periods of Musical His - tory , ' touches upon ' Palestrina and the Music of Mysticism ' and ' The Principles of Pure Music , ' followed by biographical and critical studies of
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	,
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	, and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		In conclusion he says : ` As we glance over the life of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and over that larger
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	of the art of music in the classical period of which it was the final stage , we can not but be profoundly impressed hj the unity and continuity of the whole evolution .

		From ita first slight and tentative beginnings in the experi - ments of the Florentine reformers , secular music -- the art of expressing through the medium of tones the full , free , and harmonious emotional life of modern idealism -- gradually acquired , through the labors of the seventeenth century composers , defin - iteness of aim and technical resources .

		Then In the work of
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	and
Mozart	PERSON	it reached the stage of maturity , of self-consciousness ; it became flexible , various , many-sided , adequate to the demands made upon it ; it emerged from childhood and took its honored place in the circle of inde - pendent and recognized arts .

		Finally , it was brought by
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	to its ripe perfection , its full flowering .

		It was made to say all that , within its native limitations , it was capable of saying .

		It reached the fulness of life beyond which it could live only by breaking itself up into new types , as the old plant scatters forth seeds .

		And even then , these new types were dimly divined , and suggested to his successors by
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Was it not hia effort to express , in absolute music , the most various shades of personal , highly specialized feeling , vig - orous , sentimental , mystical , or elfishly wayward , that inspired the romantic composers ,
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Schumann	LOCATION	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, and their feUows , to pursue even further the same quest ?

		Was it not his feeling out toward novel dramatic effects in the combined chorus and orchestra , in the Ninth Sym - phony , that showed
Wagner	PERSON	the path he must taket ' There is a chord of sincerity in all that Dr.
Mason	PERSON	writes ; and while he is never pedantic , his work shows remarkable insight into the origin and development of musical works .

		Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	's work entitled ' Mod - em Musical Drift ' is divided into six parts , namely , '
Parsifalia	LOCATION	, ' ' Der Ring des
Xibelun	PERSON	- gen , ' ` Isolde 's Serving Woman , ' *
Richard Strauss	PERSON	, ' * Aux Italiens , ' and ' The Oratorio of Today . '

		A number of these chapters have been previously published in contemporary period - icals and papers .

		Keen in diagnosis and crit - ical in analysis , and free from personal preju - THE DIAIi -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, dice , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	never hesitates to call a spade a spade ; and while one can not always agree with him , he can not but admire the trenchant way in which the critic gives expres - sion to his views and opinions . '

		So weave your fancies ; I 'll weave mine ; And let them wander , dark or bright .

		The Lords of Art have graven fine ; Perchance we both discern aright . '

		Speaking of the oratorio of today , Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son points out that Sir
Edward Elgar	ORGANIZATION	's style belongs entirely to the present ; that his poly - phony is built on a harmonic basis which almost completely ignores the ecclesiastic tonalities of the earlier church writers , and utilizes the diatonic and chromatic scheme of the present , the method of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's ' Tristan und Isolde . '

		And while he is credited with oratorio quite as dramatic as
Tinel	ORGANIZATION	's , but saved from mere the - atricalism by the artistic discretion of the com - poser , the thing itself is considered anomalous , because the narrator becomes an imperative necessity and oratorio now demands scenic rep - resentation and that is forbidden .

		` The oratorio of today tends steadily toward the completion of a cycle .

		It started from the primi - tive religious play of
Cavaliere	LOCATION	, and through the development of the method of choral composition reached a point at which all conception of action disappeared .

		From that point it has been slowly and surely moving around to the restoration of the dramatic element , till now it stands once more at the very threshold of the theatre .

		In its present form it is an absurdity .

		Even the singers find it almost impossible to sing the oratorios of the new sort without putting at least facial expression into their work , and every one of them looks solemnly conscious of the foolishness of evening dress .

		Mr.
Elgar	PERSON	's interpretation makes Judas Iscariot altogether too realistic for a white waistcoat , and his
Mary Magdalen	PERSON	in a Princess gown with kid - gloved arms is a portrait which would make
Henner	PERSON	gasp and
Kuskin	PERSON	stare . '

		In ' Phases of Modern Music , ' Mr.
Lawrence Gilman	PERSON	has written in a trenchant way of cer - tain phases of present-day music .

		The author is endowed with grace of style , and he knows how to bring into relief the interesting features of unattractive subjects .

		Among the subjects treated are
Eichard Strauss	PERSON	, who is adjudged ' an artist of profound and just convictions , the most penetrant and sympathetic of humanists ' ;
Edward MacDowell	ORGANIZATION	, the composer , ' a romantic of the finer order ' ;
Edward Elgar	PERSON	, whose * Dream of Gerontius ' has been declared the finest musical work since
Wagner	PERSON	, but which the present author declares owes its extreme and affecting eloquence to
Wagner	PERSON	.


Wagner	PERSON	,
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	,
Mascagni	LOCATION	,
Loeflfler	LOCATION	, and
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	are also touched upon with discrimination , vividness , and spirit .

		In the essay on ' Woman and Mod - em Music , ' Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	answers in the nega - tive the question , ' Has Woman ever done greatly in creative music ? '

		In conclusion , he adds a few pertinent words to the fast accumu - lating bibliography on the ' Parsifal ' contro - versy .

		` It is undeniable that in `` Parsifal ''
Wagner	PERSON	has not written with the torrential energy , the superbly prodigal invention , which went to the creation of his earlier works ; he is not here , unquestionably , so compelling and forceful , so overwhelming in vitality and climacteric power , as in the exuberant masterpieces of his artistic prime .

		But never before , on the other hand , had this master of illusion shaped such haunting and subtle symbols of suffering and lamentation , of sadness and terror , of pity and aspiration . '

		A unique handbook to the music of
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	has been compiled by Mr.
G. C. Ashton Jon	PERSON	- son .

		It is a sort of a ' musical
Baedeker	PERSON	, ' made particularly useful through modern conditions . '

		Three years ago , ' says the author , ' this book could only have met with a very limited de - mand , owing to the fact that the numl > er of amateurs possessed of sufficient technique to play
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's music -LRB- for the most part extremely difficult -RRB- is very small .

		But today , owing to the invention of the pianola and the fact that all
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's works , including even the least im - portant of the posthumous compositions , are now available for that instrument , the whole domain of his music is for the first time open to all . '

		It has been the author 's aim to make his book equally useful and helpful to concert - goers , for whom it forms a permanent analytical programme , to pianists , and to those amateurs of music who can now , owang to the pianola , pursue for the first time a systematic and co - ordinated study of
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Comments from newspaper articles have been grouped un - der the opus numbers of the works to which they refer .

		In addition , a brief account is given of each composition , its relative place among
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's works , and notes of any special points of interest attaching to it .

		A chronological table is included , and the compilation of the approximate dates of the compositions enables one to study the development of the composer 's individuality .

		Tlie volume opens with a brief sketch of
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's life , which is followed by short preliminary chapters on various aspects of his work .

		A perusal of Mr.
Jonson	PERSON	's book will increase the artistic pleasure to be ob - tained from the intelligent study of this master of his class -- for in Chopin the romantic school found its highest expression .

		In similar vein to her ' Stories of the Wag - ner Operas ' and ' Stories of Famous Operas , '
Miss H. A. Guerber	PERSON	has now given us a volume of ' Stories of Popular Operas , ' in which are traced the stories of the librettos of `
William Tell	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' L'Africaine , ' ' Der Freischiitz , ' ` The Magic Fhite , ' ' Eigoletto , ' ` Othello , ' ' Fra Diavolo , ' ' L'Elisire D'Amore , ' ' Romeo and

		As explained by the author , the object of these stories is to enable the reader to follow the motions of the singers , and , even if unfamiliar with the langnage in which the opera is given , to have a fair idea of the mean - ing of what is said and done .

		The author has studied her subjects with enthusiasm and fidel - ity , and with singular thoroughness .


Ingram A. Pyle	PERSON	.

		Briefs ox New Books .

		A great Western Mr.
William M. Meigs	PERSON	's ` Life of statesman and
Thomas Hart Benton	PERSON	' -LRB-
Lippin	LOCATION	- expansionist .

		cott -RRB- is the first critical estimate of the great Westerner and his proper place in history .

		Benton 's life is traced with painstaking detail , through the early years in
North Carolina	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	to the fulness of his fame as Sen - ator from
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		There is an especially good chapter on life in the West , which furnishes a backgi'ound for a study of the leader who was above all an exponent of the Western spirit and therefore of nationalism ; for the West alone was not sectional but national .

		The political career of
Benton	LOCATION	is treated topically ; thus we have set forth his opinions and activities on the Salt Tax , the Land Laws , the Tariff , Expansion , Slavery , the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	,
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	and
Texas	LOCATION	, the Compromise of
1850	DATE	, and the Kansas-Nebraska agitation .

		Of the personal and intimate side of his character , little is told , and what is told is not of a nature to increase one 's admiration for the man .

		Possi - bly Mr.
Meigs	PERSON	, who is an admirer of
Benton	LOCATION	, did not see that the effect of his treatment of his hero 's character is to make the latter appear vain , egotistical , intolerant , prejudiced , and often vulgar .

		All these
Benton	PERSON	certainly was in some degree ; but the impression gained from the pages of Mr.
Meigs	PERSON	is probably somewhat unfair to the subject .

		The author does show us , however , that in broad-minded patriotism the Senator from
Missouri	LOCATION	was the superior of most of his con - temporaries .

		Ambition never led him to truckle to the popular feeling of the hour , nor did the unpopularity of a cause make him forsake it .

		His life covered the whole expansion of the republic , and no man better understood the meaning of that expansion or foresaw more clearly the dan - gers involved in the rapid g ^ rowth of the country .

		He opposed anti-slavery agitation and the result - ing pro-slavery agitation .

		His homestead land - policy would have settled the question of slavery in the territories ; his plan for tariff revision would have eased what he considered the worst injustice to the South .

		The author is wrong in describing
Benton	LOCATION	as Southern in his sympathies ; he was a true exponent of the Western spirit , and failed to understand the position of the South as completely as he did that of the
East	LOCATION	.

		He ` thought continentally , * and believed that all who thought differently were wrong , dishonorable , in - triguing , and traitorous .

		In few , if any , points does the biographer differ from the views of Ben - ton .

		Like him , he is suspicious of the
East	LOCATION	and of the South , has a low opinion of the opponents of
Benton	LOCATION	, believes still in the stoi-ies of the intrigues of politicians and statesmen for the purpose of shaping the course of national policy .

		His own appreciation of the Western spirit of expansion should at this late date make him understand that
Texas	LOCATION	and the far West were annexed , not because of , but in spite of , the desire of pro-slavery leaders , and that had it not been for slavery the annexation would probably have come earlier .

		The sketch here given of the evolution of the South - west , then known as the West , is very satisfac - tory .

		The character of the settlers , the methods of settlement , the land system , the pioneer life , the political and economic conditions of the set - tlements in the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley , -- all these are well described .

		The author rightly emphasizes the fact that the
Southwest	LOCATION	was settled without the aid of the central government , that it suffered from the jealousy of the
East	LOCATION	and profited Jby the friendship of the South from whence most of its settlers came .

		On the other hand , the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	was won for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	by the South and South - west , and was settled under the protection of the
United States	LOCATION	army , principally by people from the
East	LOCATION	, from the jealousy of which it suffered but little .

		The author has consulted most of the available authorities on
Benton	LOCATION	, and has gath - ered much material from hitherto unknown sources .

		The work is the best life of
Benton	LOCATION	yet produced .

		New studies The strongest sentiments of Pe - of Petrarch trarch 's heart , and the varied pas - and
Laura	LOCATION	.

		gj ^ ng and impulses of his mind and soul while under the spell of Laui-a 's influ - ence , have been revealed in the spirit of scien - tific research rather than that of poetic interpre - tation in ` The Secret of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
Edmund James Mills	PERSON	-LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The volume is the work of a literary scholar of analytic type who has turned his lenses upon certain disputed points in the lives of the lovers , and has brought forward varied proofs to attest his own theories regarding
Laura	PERSON	's birthplace , marriage , last ill - ness , and other details .

		Beneath the scholar 's zeal is submerged , at times , that romantic and elusive atmosphere which should ever surround this record of poetic love .

		The detailed diagnosis of
Laura	LOCATION	's disease , couched in terms of modern surgery , causes a shiver of revulsion .

		There are , however , compensating passages of charming ap - preciation and concise summary .

		The prose studies examine the vexed questions of
Laura	LOCATION	's personaJity , her home and burial-place .

		Mr.
Mills	PERSON	contends that her birthplace and home were at
Pieverde	LOCATION	, hard by
Caumont	PERSON	, and not at Avig - non ; this conclusion he attests by liberal , if not excessive , citations .

		With equal assurance he tes - tifies that
Laura	PERSON	was no high-born matron of the De Sade family , but a lowly country-maid , ' a white rose born in harsh briars . '

		The metrical portion which follows these studies is compiled from varied parts of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's vei-se , using , in the main , the texts of
Seartazzini	LOCATION	,
Carducci	PERSON	, and
Ferrari	ORGANIZATION	, with a few new renderings as in ` Love 's 240 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Obsession , ' ` Love 's Missioner , ' and ` Of
Laura	ORGANIZATION	's Eyes . '

		Nearly all the passages are chosen to support the claims advanced in the author 's prose studies .

		Some of the lines thus used seem strained in purpose ; and , in spite of the accu - mulation of references and quotations , the reader can hardly accept all the author 's conclusions .

		After all has been said pro and con , it is not
Laura	LOCATION	's birthplace or her daily tasks , not her fatal illness or the location of her tomb , that vitally interest us of to-day : it is her perennial charm and noble womanhood , so often portrayed by her poet-lover . '

		Good , too , she was , And never trivial ; showing in that sense Of heaven and holiness which sits so well On any woman .

		Yet she had sportive ways , And was most keen of mind ; her intellect Matched well her heart .

		White , slender hands she had .

		And dainty little figure , and fair feet .

		The volume is illustrated with a few photograv - ures of rare excellence , depicting shrines at Pie - verde ,

Higginson	PERSON	has well said , ` that
John Brown	PERSON	was the most eloquent of all our great Abolitionists , for his was the elo - quence of a life . '

		Something of this eloquence of action belongs also to those who took part with him in the stirring events attending the settle - ment of
Kansas	LOCATION	; and one of these participants was Dr.
J. W. Winkley	PERSON	, whose little book , `
John Brown	PERSON	the Hero ' -LRB-
James H. West Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives some highly interesting personal reminiscences of those days and of the man whose name they must always recall .

		In approaching a book of this character , a record of heroic deeds and of no less heroic sufferings , the reviewer feels himself disarmed of criticism except as to mere matters of historic accuracy ; and in this instance the writer deals with only a few and in themselves insignificant occurrences , hitherto un chronicled in any detail , and known now only to himself and a very few besides .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	has given in his life of
John Brown	PERSON	a succinct account of the chief event related , and he says of it , in an introduc - tion that he furnishes to Dr.
Winkley	PERSON	's narra - tive , -- ` But it required a fuller statement ; espe - cially since it seems largely to have escaped the notice of the chroniclers of that disturbed and confused period of
1856	DATE	.

		The partisan move - ment here described came in between two of
Brown	PERSON	's famous fights , -- that of Black
Jack	PERSON	, in early
June	DATE	, when he captured the Virginian cap - tain ,
Pate	PERSON	, and that in the end of
August	DATE	, when he repelled the formidable attack of the Mis - sourians upon the small settlement of Osawato - mie . '

		Not the least interesting part of the book is the account of the boy
Winkley	PERSON	's adventures in his repeated trips to
Kansas City	LOCATION	, usually alone , to get supplies for the small settlement where he and an elder brother lived .

		By his occult power of ` localization ' he drove his ox-team unerringly across the trackless prairie , meeting with sundiy exciting adventures on the way .

		Although the matter of the book is slender in amount , and spread thin by both author and printer , and although the glimpses we get of
John Brown	PERSON	are few and fleeting , the publishers are still within the truth in announcing that ` the book has the interest of a romance , ' and that ` the young will read it as if it were especially `` a story for boys , '' and the old will find in it matters to revive their enthusiasm . '

		Hawthorne ^ ^ ^ addresses and letters deliv - redivivus .

		^ ^ ^ d and read at the
Hawthorne	PERSON	commemoration of
July 4	DATE	to 7 at
Concord	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	have been published by
Messrs. Houghton , MiflBin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title , ` The
Hawthorne Centenary Celebration	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, who presided the first day , has edited the volume , and besides a frontispiece portrait of Hawthorne the book has six views in and about the
Wayside	LOCATION	, at
Concord	LOCATION	.

		Among these excellent presentations of various phases of the great romancer 's genius and personality , perhaps the freshest and most suggestive is Mr.
Charles Fran	PERSON	-
cis Adams	ORGANIZATION	's discussion of ` Hawthorne 's Place in Literature , ' -- fresh and suggestive because the speaker is a man of action even more than a man of letters .

		Yet he says dozens of things that excite protest and contradiction .

		He calls
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's style labored --
Thackeray	PERSON	who prided himself on writing the fluent , unstudied , some - times even careless English of a gentleman ; and of
Thackeray	PERSON	's characters these are the seven Mr.
Adams	PERSON	selects as typical and likely to survive , -- `
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, Major Pendennis , and
Morgan	PERSON	, masterpieces all , with
Colonel Newcome	ORGANIZATION	, Captain
Costigan	PERSON	,
Barry Lyndon	PERSON	, and
Esmond	PERSON	, in the sec - ond rank . '

		Will one reader out of a hundred read - ily recall Major Pendennis 's valet , and will one out of a thousand place him before Colonel New - come and
Barry Lyndon	PERSON	as masterpieces of char - acter-creation ?

		Of familiar types to be found in American imaginative literature , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	finds but three , --
Rip Van Winkle	PERSON	,
Topsy	LOCATION	, and Colonel Starbottle ; though on the last day of the celebra - tion he adds a fourth ,
Evangeline	PERSON	.

		While the army is receiving honors , has not Colonel Sellers a right to feel aggrieved at being neglected ?

		In his treatment of
Hawthorne	PERSON	's works , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	amazes us by naming ` Our Old Home ' as ` that one of his productions which the world would least willingly let die . '

		To the prevalent mania for complete editions , editions that suffer no ` pot - boiling rag ' to escape , he administers a merited rebuke .

		Of the more studied essays in the vol - i.ime , Mr.
Copeland	PERSON	's , Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's , and Mr.
Frank Preston Stearns	PERSON	's deserve especial notice .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's account of ` The Friendships of
Hawthorne	PERSON	' is excellent , but perhaps unduly long from the inclusion of some not indispensable details .

		The book is a worthy memorial of an important event in our literary annals .

		Old
Egypt	LOCATION	seen through expert eyes .

		The best results of modern
Orien	PERSON	- tal scholarship are being set directly before the eyes of the reading public , by men who can both read the lan - guages of the ancient Orient and put what they read in attractive language .

		Messrs.
Percy E.	PERSON
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241
Newberry	PERSON	and
John Garstang	PERSON	, who have done such commendable work on Egyptian soil and in the publication of their ` finds , ' have jointly written * A Short History of Ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a modest little work of 200 pages , but is full of the ripest fruit of the labors of its industrious authors in their explora - tion and decipherment of the Egyptian monu - ments .

		It gives a bird 's - eye view of the monarchy , from its founding down to its disintegration at least 3,000 years afterward .

		The style of the work is such as to carry the reader along at a rapid pace , and to give him merely sketch-lines of the great figures that loom up in each period or dynasty through that long stretch of time .

		The archaic or first period is naturally most full , for it is in just that period that some of the most startling discoveries have been made within the
last decade	DATE	.

		This formerly pre-historic and mythical period now steps up and takes its place in the regular and undisputed line of historical facts , and thus wipes out with one stroke the former incredulous statements regarding it .

		We are sorry to see that no new light of any conse - quence is found on the little known Hyksos period , and that its centuries of silence must still remain mute .

		In the appended ` Chronological Table ' a safe method is adopted in putting the ` Founding of the
Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	' ` before
3000	DATE	B. C In fact , no dates are stated specifically until the reign of Thotmes III. , 1515-1460 B. C .

		The long reign of Rameses II .

		is set at 1325-1258 .

		After this , the next specific date is made at 930 , when ` Shishank captures
Jerusalem	LOCATION	. '

		Such a book as this , carefully read , will lead the student to larger and more comprehensive works on this most fas - cinating of ancient lands and peoples .

		Memorials of The extremes of credulity , super - a once famous stition , and narrowness , on the tea-port .

		qj ^ q hand , and broad-minded intel - ligence and liberality , on the other , were curi - ously mingled in the historic old town of Salem ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		From the first set of qualities sprang the witchcraft delusion , with its harvest of innocent lives sacrificed to the popular frenzy ; to the second the cause of tolerance and enlight - enment in religion is indebted , Salem having early and in a most emphatic manner joined the
New England	LOCATION	movement for wider liberty in matters theological .

		That these opposite ten - dencies developed themselves in one and the same small community , seems strange at first , but is not inexplicable .

		The superstitious habit of mind of a sea-faring folk may serve largely to explain the witchcraft atrocities , while the ex - tended acquaintance with the world gained by the sea-captains and sailors of Salem in their voyages to
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	and other distant lands , must have opened their eyes to the nai * - rowness of
New England Puritanism	ORGANIZATION	.

		These thoughts are suggested by reading Mr.
Charles E. Trow	PERSON	's ` Old Shipmasters of Salem ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , a book containing much curious and interesting matter , collected from log-books , shipmasters ' journals , local newspapers , and other obscure sources , and served up with a generous pictorial accompaniment .

		Sea-yams and more weighty historical items mingle pleasantly in Mr.
Trow	PERSON	's pages , which are heartily commended to all who like to read about those that go down to the sea in ships .

		^ ___ The charm There was no Frenchman of let -
0	DATE	/ Renan ters in the last half of the nine - xn his letters .

		^ ^ ^ j ^ ^ ^ century who had a more interesting personality than
Ernest Renan	PERSON	.

		His tangential relation to Christianity , as it blossomed out in the French Catholic church ; his interest in religion in general , and in the life of Jesus in particular ; his strong utterances on the political and social issues of his day , -- aU these elements of his mind made him an unusually entertaining talker and writer .

		His most intimate friend in
Paris	LOCATION	was the famous chemist
Berthelot	PERSON	.

		These two men so thoroughly agreed and sympathized that they readily confided to each other their thoughts on many of the great issues of their day .

		Some of
Renan	ORGANIZATION	's best letters to
Berthelot	PERSON	have been gathered up and published in translation under the title , ` Letters from the Holy Land ' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		They were written from more than a score of places outside the Holy Land , --
Venice	LOCATION	,
Tripoli	LOCATION	,
Athens	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Alexan	PERSON	- dria , and many smaller places .

		The essential thing , however , is that they are Renan 's , and show what his attitude was toward the national , religious , and intellectual agitations of his times , stretching as they do over a period of forty-five years , from
1847	DATE	to
July 20 , 1892	DATE	, the last letter written by his own hand .

		They breathe the spirit of one who has enlisted in the cause of liberty of thought and action , with slight regard for tradi - tion , or for positions whose chief defense is that they are hoary with age .

		The tenderness of R'Cnan 's heart and the freedom of his mind are two features that appear prominently in these charmingly written confidential letters .

		A convict 's
Mankind	ORGANIZATION	is put upon sorrowful picture of inquiry regarding its inhumanity prison life .

		by guc ^ ^ book as ` Life in Sing Sing ' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , written by one who preserves a partial anonymity by his nom de plume of ` Number 1500 . '

		It is not a pleasant book , or is its manner much pleasanter than its matter , since it makes evident the fact that the criminal of to-day is rather the man in ` hard luck ' than one guilty of any extraordinary moral turpitude as distinguished from the hundreds that go upwhipped of justice .

		It sets forth , also , the complete uselessness to the community of the lives led by those in
New York	LOCATION	's most notorious penitentiary , and the complete failure there to induce the inmates to effect any reform in their indivdual points of view that would lead to the betterment of the race .

		On the other hand , it points out the extraordinary value of the services rendered by Mrs.
Maud Ballington Booth	PERSON	through the Volunteers ' Prisoners ' League , which has led more convicts into substantial accord with respectability since its institution in
1896	DATE	than all the i > enal institutions and so-called reformatories of the country put together .

		It appears that the 242 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
April 1	DATE	, keeper of the prison as a rule is not the sort of person one Avonld select as a reforming agent , and that little or nothing is done inside the prison walls that could have a deterrent effect upon any person fairly embarked on a criminal career .

		There is no probing to the depths to account for crime , for the writer is evidently a reporter rather than a philosopher .

		The book contains a vocabu - lary of prison slang , ` thieves ' patter , ' which has a certain value and interest .

		stories of the Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	's recent vol - lives of some ume , * Denizens of the Deep , ' sea-creatures .

		-LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , is not a continuous story , but ` a. series of lives of some Denizens of the Deep , based very lai-gely on personal ob - servation , buttressed by scientific facts , and decorated by imagination . '

		The author ` has wished to keep the work as unlike an orthodox natural history as it was possible to make it . '

		-- as unlike , that is , in point of dulness and didac - ticism ; and he has succeeded .

		His vigorous love of the sea is as patent here as in his previous books , and his healthful insistence on the hap - piness of the sea creatures is more convincing than ever .

		Although he is careful to remind us that we know very little of the depths of the sea , he often Avrites as if he had himself visited them .

		His stories of the various species of whale are most ample in knowledge , since whales are his specialty ; but in telling of other ` denizens ' also , -- and few land-lubbers would guess there were as many as he describes , -- his imagination works with a vividness that amounts to per - sonal identification .

		For justice , his chapter on the shark is most noteworthy .

		` The Shark eats man , ' he says , ` not because he loves man to eat , but because man when he falls overboai 'd is usu - ally easy to get .

		If the man be a good noisy swimmer , no Shark will venture near , for they are , though tormented with hunger , a most nerv - ous and timid race , and , indeed , always seem to me to lose a great many opportunities through diffidence . '

		For pity , the chapter on the seal is most memorable .

		` For my part , I shall never forget Bum-Murdoch 's ci * y of hon-or in his book , ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	to the
Antartic	LOCATION	, '' where he speaks of the newly flayed Seal lifting itself redly to - Avard heaven in the glowing sunshine , as if ask - ing its Maker why this thing should be . '

		For romance , the story of the
Stormy Petrel	ORGANIZATION	is most suggestive .

		The least satisfactory chapter is that on Sea-serpents ; but who that follows truth could write satisfactorily of them ?

		BRIEFER MENTION 276 NOTES 276 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 278 A SALUTARY MEASUBE .

		The recent action of the
New York City	LOCATION	board of education , cutting from the elemen - tary school work a considerable portion of the extraneous matter which has fastened itself upon the system during recent years , may seem somewhat drastic , and possibly may have gone too far , but it embodies a legitimate reaction from the excesses of the sentimental - ists , who , in their zeal for what they are pleased to call ' the enrichment of the curri - culum , ' and * the education of the whole child , * have quite lost their sense of educational perspective .

		The trouble with all these ad - vocates of manual training , and domestic arts , and the various devices for combining a vast deal of entertainment with a modicum of discipline in the teaching of children , is that their enthusiasm gets the better of their judg - ment , and that they make the most unwar - ranted demands upon the limited store of time and money available for public school support Each of these fancies or * fads ' -- to use just for once that objectionable word -- has its proper claims and its proper sphere in the educational plan , but its sponsors are never willing to accept what is fairly admissi - ble in its behalf ; their zeal carries them be - yond all bounds , and their misguided champ - ionship impels them to efforts which tend to impair the fundamental integrity of essential education .

		We have no quarrel whatever with any of these matters on its own account .

		All are good and helpful in their respective ways ; all are capable of contributing some useful ele - ment to the unfolding mind .

		But the moment they begin to be treated as other than adjuncts , the moment they attempt to encroach upon the area that belongs to the essentials , then the time comes when even , - sound edu - cational instinct must discredit them , when every rational educational activity must be exerted to keep them in their own place .

		If we can have all these pleasant things , or some of them , without giving one whit less atten - tion than before to the matters that are really necessar -RCB- - , well and good ; but if they are to be had only at the expense of the vital ele - ments of instruction , then the face of the educator can not be set too sternly against them .

		It is very pretty to talk about the development of the social consciousness , and about reproducing in the individual the exper - ience of the race , but if the child who has been made the victim of these experiments comes out of school unable to write a credita - bly spelled and composed letter , unable to per - form an arithmetical operation with certainty , unable to exhibit an accurate knowledge of elementary history and geography , the educa - tion of that child has been a failure , no mat - ter how many games he has played in school , or how much skill he has acquired in clay - modelling and basket-weaving , or how well he can sew on a button .

		How well we know the particular quality of scorn with which this old-fashioned doc - trine is greeted by the pedagogical senti - mentalist , and with what superiorly he recites 256 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, for its demolition the parrot-formulae of his pet species of psychology .

		Enveloping the subject in a mist of words , he so befogs the question at issue that Ms antagonist re - tires from the conflict baffled by the very intangibility of the weapons with which he is assailed , but assuredly none the less certain of the solid ground upon which his feet are planted .

		For all these vaporings of the theorist can not shake the conviction of plain sensible persons that the business of the school is teaching and not amusement , that the child who has the rough ways smoothed for him at every step is not the child who will acquire the power to overcome difficulties by his own efforts , that hard work is the only work worth doing , and that the development of concentrated thought and strengthened will is the final end toward which the educational process should be directed .

		How well also we know the more definite arguments adduced in behalf of that dilution of education which has been going on during the past generation , and how meaningless these arguments become when closely examined .

		With all the changes rung upon them by pedagogical rhetoricians , these pleas for ' the new education ' are reducible to the fol - lowing three : that the hand should be trained to act no less than the head , that things should be studied as well as words , and that the cultivation of thought is as important as the cultivation of memory .

		Admirable pre - cepts all three , but perverted to most unworthy uses .

		For these maxims , used as weapons in the arsenal of the half-educated propagandist , are only too apt to become the agencies of a reactionary process , speciously labeled reform , which is hostile to the inmost spirit of educa - tion .

		The ` hand and head ' argument sub - stitutes training in the practical arts for the intellectual discipline of the school ; the ` things and words ' argument subtly discour - ages the pursuit of all the nobler subjects of study ; while the * thought and memory ' ar - gument offers a veiled apology for the deplora - ble laxity of the present generation of young people , whose most conspicuous defect , when the school turns them loose upon society , is that they know few things or none with either exactness or certainty .

		If it is becoming all the time more apparent that these are the actual results of our over - weighted and over-ornamented school courses , it is surely time to call a halt , and endeavor to get back to something like first principles .

		A popular political maxim assures us that the cure for the evils of democracy is more democracy , and we shall doubtless be assured by the upholders of the present educational anarchy that what we need by way of a rem - edy for its unfortunate results is still more anarchy -- a still greater confusion of acci - dent with essence , a still further abandonment of discipline , a still closer levelling of educa - tional values , and a still wider scope for the pedagogical vagaries that are invading our schools from every quarter .

		This is a view which we can not share , and therefore , with - out knowing at all closely the nature of the situation in the
New York	LOCATION	schools , we are inclined to welcome as a salutary measure the reported recent action of the authorities .

		It may not have been a very intelligent action , and its motives may not have been of the highest , but it seems to have been taken in the right direction , and its instinctive basis seems to have been soimd .

		In many important mat - ters
New York	LOCATION	, so long in the rear , has recently been taking the lead in educational affairs .

		It has set the other large cities of the country a notable example in the matters of school architecture , of salary and pension measures for the security of the teaching profession , of the extension of educational activities beyond the range of what is usually attempted by public school systems .

		Its course in the matter now under consideration is likely to raise a storm of dissent , but we are constrained to believe that the outcome will be for good .

		In closing this discussion , we wish to say once more that we have no objection to the new school subjects on their own account .

		`` We are opposed to them only to the extent to which they encroach upon the time and re - sources available for the fundamentals , only to the extent to which they serve to dilute the strength of the old-time educational brew .

		Kindergartens and schools for manual training and courses in the domestic arts are nice things to have , but they must not be permit - ted to abridge the attention given to the more serious work of education , or to impair the energies devoted to its service .

		As long as their secondary importance is freely admitted , as long as they are treated as adjuncts to the system , to be employed when the means are available , and to be dropped when they are not , we give them cordial approval .

		But when they become parasitic upon the system , when instead of drawing from their own sources of energy , they tend to absorb the energies that should be apolied to more vital needs , then they become a danger of the most insidious sort .

		That this danger is a real one must be apparent to every close observer of our public schools .

		In most communities , the problem of ways and means , even for essential matters , is
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		85T a difficult one at best , and most of our systems are subject to periodical shrinkages .

		When such a shrinkage occurs , the obviously rational policy is to provide for it at the expense of the subjects and activities of secondary import - ance , leaving the essentials untouched ; but it is only too often the case in such an emer - gency that the pruning-knife is applied to all parts of the system alike , vital as well as ' accessory .

		The question is made one of ' jobs ' instead of being kept one of educational inter - ests .

		All the subjects once intrenched within a school system claim equal consideration with all the others , and so great is the present con - fusion of the public mind concerning the whole question of relative educational values that the impudent claim of cooking to be as important as arithmetic , of the kindergarten to be as important as the high school , is as likely as not to be allowed by those in author - ity .

		This is the danger which should enjoin a cautious conservatism upon all school boards and superintendents when the question arises of some new extension of their activity ; this it is which should make for them the motto festina lente the capstone of the arch of educational wisdom .

		SOMi : ASPERITIES AND AMENITIES OF C RITIC ISM .

		A hypercritical censor of art , so the story goes , one day approached a certain picture , de - termined to find no good thing in it , and at once exclaimed against the coloring , the draw - ing , the light and shade , the perspective , the grouping , in fact against every detail both of conception and of execution .

		` And that fly , too ! '

		was the final querulous criticism ; * no more like a real fly than I am ! '

		whereupon the preposterous insect , in superb disregard of all the canons of art , took wing and flew away .

		The fable illustrates the futility of much that passes under the name of criticism .

		But the critic 's -LRB- the literary critic 's -RRB- failing is now alleged to be not undue severity , but too facile praise .

		Complaisance , however , is no new dis - ease of criticism .

		It is curious to note that seventy-five years ago , in the palmy days of
Jeffrey	LOCATION	,
Brougham	LOCATION	,
Lockhart	PERSON	, and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, in the vigorous early prime of the *
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, ' the ' Quarterly , ' and '
Blackwood	PERSON	's , ' the same complaint of indiscriminate eulogy was made against critics of English literature .

		` At pres - ent , ' writes Macaulay in
1830	DATE	, ` however con - temptible a poem or a novel may be , there is not the least difficulty in procuring favorable notices of it from all sorts of publications , daily , weekly , and monthly .

		In the meantime .

		little or nothing is said on the other side .

		The author and the publisher are interested in cry - ing up the book .

		Nobody has any strong inter - est in crying it down .

		Those who are best fitted to guide the public opinion , think it be - neath them to expose mere nonsense , and com - fort themselves by reflecting that such popu - larity can not last .

		This contemptuous lenity has been carried too far . '

		Nevertheless , it i '' not ' contemptuous lenity ' but contemptuous ^ severity that most impresses the student ot early nineteenth-century literary criticism in .

		England .

		Eeviewers of the laxly lenient type there doubtless were , but their works have either perished with them or are at present not - readily accessible .

		A full century having now .

		passed since the rise of English literary criti - cism -LRB- in periodical form -RRB- of a serious andr worthy sort , it may not be uninteresting to - glance back and scan some of its more signifi - cant or more amusing features .

		Possibly , too ^ a moral or a lesson may deduce itself from such incidents and anecdotes as can find place in so brief a retrospect .

		All criticism must necessarily lag behind creation , and the closer it presses on the lat - ter 's heels , the more liable it is to ill-considered judgment and glaring error .

		Hence when & century ago , with the opening of a new era id English poetry , the critics attempted to pass judgment on tiie new school of poets as fast a & their works issued from the press -- works so startlingly revolutionary as judged by previous canons of poetic criticism -- there could not ' but be , as viewed by a later age , many wild utterances , many absurdly unjust apportion - ments of praise and blame , many amazingly false predictions as to the young singers ' final fate , whether of oblivion or of immortalityi . '

		This will never do ! '

		cries the bewildered and dismayed
Jeffrey	PERSON	in reviewing ' The Excur - sion ' ; and the flayers of
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	take up the refrain , with - only here and there a discerning and courage - ^ ous critic to put in a word of commendation ^ The sentence from
Publius Syrus	LOCATION	, Judex dam -- natur cum nocens absolvitur , which the ' Edin - burgh

		advance of proof .

		Not to point out excellences ^ but to detect and ridicule faults was the critic 's proper function .

		Truly it was no primrose - path of pleasantness that the poet sauntared down , no balmy atmosphere of unmixed adula - tion that he breathed , in those days of slashing reviews and cut-throat criticisms .

		The Quar - terly and
Blackwood	PERSON	reviews of
Keats	PERSON	's ` En -- dymion ' are perhaps too well known to call for ^ 258 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
April 16	DATE	'' any extracts from their scurrilities .

		But not so well known is
Gifford	ORGANIZATION	's cynical retort upon being ■ expostulated with for his severity , a severity that had moved some nameless sympathizer with its victim to send him a handsome testi - monial in the form of a banknote . '

		How can you ,
Gifford	ORGANIZATION	, ' pleaded the remonstrant , ` dish up in this dreadful manner a youth who has never offended you ? '

		* It has .

		done him good , ' replied the editor of the ' Quarterly , ' continu - ing his writing , with his green shade before his ■ eyes , totally insensible to all reproach or • entreaty ; ' he has had twenty-five pounds from
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Still more relentlessly cruel was • the treatment
Keats	PERSON	received from the Black - wood reviewer , the abominable ' Z ' ; for , not content with flaying him alive and spraying him with vitriol , the heartless wretch , three years after the poet 's death , executed a war - dance of triumph on his grave , exemplifying anew a too common propensity to add insult to injury .

		Here is a sample of the writer 's pleas - antry : ^ Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	, it seems , died with a volume of Mr.
Keats	PERSON	's poetry `` grasped with one hand in his bosom '' -- rather an awkward posture , as you will be convinced if you try it .

		But what a rash man
Shelley	PERSON	was , to put to sea in a frail boat with
Jack	PERSON	's poetry on board !

		Why , man , it would sink a trireme .

		In the preface to Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's poems , we are told that `` his vessel bore out of sight with a favorable wind '' ; but what is that to the purpose ?

		It had `` Endymion '' on board , and there was an end .

		Seventeen ton of pig-iron would not be more fatal ballast .

		Down went the boat with a `` swirl '' !

		I lay a wager that it righted soon after ejecting
Jack	PERSON	. '

		Not satisfied with this , the editors of the maga - zine preface their volume for
1826	DATE	with still further abuse .

		`
Keats	PERSON	was a Cockney , ' they declare , ` and Cockneys claimed him for their own .

		Never was there a young man so encrusted with conceit . '

		And more of like sort .

		Even twenty years after
Keats	PERSON	's death we find his - calumniators vainly striving to lay his ghost .

		• ' A good deal of
Waddle	LOCATION	, ' they write , ` was levelled against the conductors of this review when they had the misfortune to criticize a `` ickly poet , who died soon afterwards , appar - ■ ently for the express purpose of dishonouring .

		.

		The article was not written with us `` , ny intention of damaging Mr.
John Keats	PERSON	's lungs or stomach ... But how are we to anticipate such contingencies ?

		Must we , then , adopt the wise precautions of our ancestors in • cases of physical torture , and send the proofs to be read over in the presence of a physician who , thumb on pulse , might indicate the pas - sages which are too much for human nature to endure ? '

		The slashing style of criticism will enjoy a • certain popularity as long as hiunan nature is not angelic nature .

		The primitive instinct that takes delight in bull-baiting and cock-fighting , finds pleasure of the same sort , but more refined , more intellectual , in a skilfully waged war of words , if only the battle be fought with - out too repellent barbarity , too manifest disre - gard of accepted rules , on either side .

		And even where the contest is wholly one-sided and the defendant has no chance to be heard , the disinterested onlooker is none the less enter - tained if only the blows appear to be aimed all above the belt .

		But occasionally the victim of these assaults refuses to take his castigation in silence .

		An historic instance is
Tennyson	LOCATION	's neat retort upon
Christopher North	PERSON	, who had reviewed in '
Blackwood	PERSON	's Magazine , ' in a fashion not to the poet 's liking , his first volume of verse .

		Familiar though the lines must be to many , they will bear repetition here . '

		You did late review my lays .

		Crusty Christopher ; You did mingle blame and praise ,
Rusty Christopher	PERSON	.

		When I learnt from whom It came , I forgave you all the blame , Musty Christopher ; I could not forgive the praise ,
Fusty Christopher	PERSON	. '

		This must have been dictated by somewhat the same feeling that led the Greek orator , on hear - ing himself applauded by the rabble , to turn to a candid friend and ask whether he had said anything foolish .

		Thackeray , too , in one mem - orable instance , made a very fitting and amus - ing retort upon his critic .

		The ' Times ' had reviewed in highly offensive language his Christmas story , ' The Kickleburys on the
Rhine	LOCATION	, ' stigmatizing it as a pot-boiler of the meanest order ; and the critic had thus charac - terized the class of work to which it was assigned , -- ' For the most part bearing the stamp of their origin in the vacuity of the writer 's exchequer rather than in the fulness of his genius , they suggest by their feeble flavour the rinsings of a void brain after the more important concoctions of the expired year . '

		In reply to this ' hurticle , ' as
Thackeray	PERSON	might well have called it , he prefixed to the second edition of his tale ' An Essay on
Thun	PERSON	- der and Small Beer , ' in which he bantered '
Jupiter Jeames	PERSON	' on his style , his ' hoighth of foine language entoirely , ' his pompous Latin - ity , and so on , until poor '
Jupiter Jeames	PERSON	' must have felt like hiding his diminished head -- except that it was already snugly hidden under the safe cloak of anonymity .

		But the aggrieved author is not always so happy in his method of rejoinder .

		Less in con - sonance with the original offense is the resort to fire-arms , rather than to ink , as a mode of retaliation .

		Jeffrey 's scathing and , in truth , offensively personal review of
Moore	ORGANIZATION	's ` Epis - tles , Odes , and other Poems ' elicited a chal -

		26 '' lenge from the irascible little Irishman .


Jeff	PERSON	- rey , who chanced then to be in
London	LOCATION	, accepted it , and the combatants met at Chalk Farm in the
early morning of August 12 , 1806	DATE	.

		The issue of the affair furnished the town with food for merriment for weeks to come . '

		What a beautiful morning it is !

		` remarked the Scotch - man to the Irishman . '

		Yes , * was the reply , ' a morning made for better purposes ' ; to which the other breathed a sigh of assent .

		After fur - ther pleasant chat during the loading of the pistols , the duellists took their places and were about to fire , when the watchful providence that has been known to intervene on other sim - ilar occasions stayed the hands uplifted for mutual bloodshed .

		Policemen from Bow Street burst through the hedge and took the com - batants into custody .

		This well-timed inter - ruption , together with the finding of
Jeffrey	PERSON	's pistol to be bulletless -- an item that soon trans - formed and amplified itself into the report that neither pistol was loaded -- afterward prompted
Byron	PERSON	's sarcastic allusion , in his * English Bards and Scotch Eeviewers , ' to ' Lit - tle 's leadless pistol . '

		This in turn nearly caused a duel between
Moore	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	, but led in the end to their acquaintance and friendship .

		Meanwhile
Jeffrey	PERSON	and
Moore	PERSON	had met at a friend 's house , the Scotchman had pacified the Irishman by graciously admitting the excep - tionable nature of parts of the offending review , and the upshot of it all was a firm and fast friendship between the two from that day for - ward .

		All 's well that ends well .

		Similarly , the merciless judgment passed by
Jeffrey	PERSON	on
Byron	PERSON	's ' Juvenile Poems ' opened the way ulti - mately to a noble friendship between poet and critic .

		It is conjectured , and not without plausibility , that had it not been for the dis - sipated young lord 's early flagellation at
Jeff	PERSON	- rey 's hands he might never have aroused him - self to such worthy exertion as gave to the world his subsequent better poems .

		We certainly should never have seen the ' English Bards ' had it not been for the Scotch reviewer .

		Pleas - ing to note is the latter 's handsome tribute to the merits of
Byron	PERSON	's greater works -- so strik - ingly in contrast with the persistent persecution of Keats by the
Blackwood	LOCATION	critic . '

		None but a great soul dared hazard it , ' declared Byron in generous admiration ; ' a little scribbler would have gone on cavilling to the end of the chap - ter . '

		These ` and similar instances of retort , espe - cially where the disputants remember that they are gentlemen before they are writers , diversify and enliven the pages of literary history .

		But most often the critic has the first , last , and only word in the matter , however much one might like to hear the other side .

		Macaulay , for example , cuts to pieces poor
Robert Montgom	PERSON	- ery until the reader of his critique is fairly driven to side with the luckless poet . '

		We have no enmity to Mr.
Robert Montgomery	PERSON	, ' declares the critic , and the reader at once knows this to - be the prelude to a merciless onslaught on Mr.
Robert	PERSON	.

		Finding here and there in his poems reminders of earlier poets ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	accuses him unsparingly of plagiarism .

		The whole arraignment serves , and was perhaps -LRB- though half-unconsciously -RRB- meant to serve , as an opportunity to display the critic 's remarkable powers of memory and his breadth , of reading .

		The accusation of plagiarism , of * very coolly appropriating ' this and that and the other , is hardly made good .

		The reviewer 's parting stab is intended to give Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	his quietus .

		After noticing in no admiring terms the poem entitled ' Satan , ' Macaulay offers this bit of counsel , -- ' We would seriously advise Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	to omit , or alter , about a hundred lines in different parts of this large volume , and to republish it under the name of '' Gabriel . '' '

		And at the very end he says , ' If our remarks give pain to Mr.
Robert Mont	PERSON	- gomery , we are sorry for it , ' with a few more equally comforting words .

		Montgomery 's poem * can not now be said to be in everybody 's mouthy but it would be rash to attribute their obscurity to
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's wild and wanton rhetoric in the *
Edinburgh Review	ORGANIZATION	. '

		After a dose of early nineteenth-century book-reviews , one may well feel inclined to say with the elder
Disraeli	PERSON	, ' That undue severity of criticism which diminishes the number of good authors is a greater calamity than even that mawkish panegyric which may invite indif - ferent ones . '

		A worthless book soon dies , but any unjust censure that checks the production of good ones is regrettable .

		Jeffrey himself in later life admitted that he had erred on the side of severity . '

		A certain tone of exaggeration , * ^ he says in retracting some of his strictures on
Burns	PERSON	, * is incident , we fear , to the sort of writ - ing in which we are engaged .

		Reckoning a lit - tle too much on the dulness of our readers , we are often unconsciously led to overstate our sen - timents in order to make them understood ; and ; when a little controversial warmth is added to a little love of effect , an excess of colouring is apt to steal over the canvas , which ultimately offends no eye so much as our own . '

		In the pre - face to his collected essays
Jeffrey	PERSON	further acknowledges that he has said * petulant and ' provoking things ' of
Southey	LOCATION	, and that he has - of ten spoken * rather too bitterly and confi - dently of the faults ' of
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		StiU he adheres substantially to his early opinions , and claims credit for making prominent in all his discussions the moral worth or worthlessness of 860 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, the book reviewed .

		Good morals and good literature , he holds , go together .

		Turning from these now half-forgotten crit - ical writings of a century ago , the curious reader of them can not but retain a sense of the earnestness and zeal animating their better pages , and of the more than respectable learn - ing and ability they often display .

		Something of this seriousness of purpose might profitably be cultivated by present-day critics .

		A review that rivals or perhaps eclipses in interest and learning the work reviewed , or at least that sup - plements it with matter of real worth , is always a pleasant thing to read , but how rarely met with in the hasty book-notices of today !

		One fault of the early reviewers will of course be committed by their successors as long as these successors are fallible , -- the fault of uninten - tionally slighting genius and exalting its oppo - site .

		But that these past appraisers of litera - ture furnish , by their errors both of omission and of commission , no less than by their excel - lences , some measure of instruction for present guidance , and for present caution , is not to be disputed .

		A POINT IN PUBLISHING ETHICS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The great magazines of the country appeal to a wide circle of readers , many of them being reg - ular subscribers and many being regular buyers from the news-stands .

		These make up the clien - tele of the magazines and determine their suc - cess .

		Is it just , then , to this large body of regular readers for the publishers to issue in bookform an important serial before the last two or three in - stalments appear in the magazine ?

		The reason for the early publication is obvious : it means money in the pocket of the publishing company , and that is perhaps the main object the company has in view .

		But , again , is it just to the maga - zine 's regular supporters ?

		Doubtless there are those who become so absorbed in a story that they are willing to purchase it in bookform to get the final chapters a little earlier , yet they are probably only a small proportion of the whole number of readers .

		Most of those who buy the book , it is safe to say , have not read the monthly instalments .

		Is it just to cater in so marked a degree to this class while the regular subscribers are asked to wait ?

		Would there not be quite as many buyers of the book , if it were published after its completion in the magazine ?

		In this age of commercialism , it is perhaps too much to ex - pect that the publishing companies will worry thenaselves over such questions of ethics .

		And yet it is an injustice to their great body of sup - porters that they could and should avoid .

		The Reminiscences of a Dipl-omatist .

		* The life of Mr.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	has been remarkably full of incident and rich in oppor - tunity .

		As professor in the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, president of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, min - ister plenipotentiary to
Russia	LOCATION	, minister and ambassador to
Germany	LOCATION	, and president of the American delegation at the
Peace Conference of The Hague	ORGANIZATION	, he has rendered distinguished services to his country for which he will be held in grateful remembrance .

		For more than fifty years he has enjoyed the acquaintance and the friendship of many of the most prominent scholars and statesmen of the time .

		Not the least , therefore , of the services for which we are indebted to him is the record that he has now given us of the observations and experiences of half a century .

		Much of this matter has appeared , in an abridged form , in ' The Century Magazine ' in the
last two years	DATE	; but a great deal has never before seen the light .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	divides his work under the follow - ing convenient heads : Environment and Edu - cation ; Political life ; As University Pro- fessor ; As University President ; In the
Diplo	PERSON	- matic Service ; Sundry Journeys and Expe - riences ; Miscellaneous Recollections ;
Religious Development	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some slight overlapping was of course inevitable ; yet it is far better so , for each group of experiences and reflections thus stands out by itself , a distinct unit , yet linked by means of imobtrusive cross-references to other related groups .

		In arrangement the work is a model .

		By his skill in the selection of material , and by his admirably lucid and even style , the author has made every page intensely interesting .

		Bom in a prosperous little village of
Central New York	LOCATION	in
1832	DATE	, Mr.
White	PERSON	enjoyed the ad - vantages of a happy , wholesome life to which both poverty and riches were alike strangers .

		The glimpses he gives us of the futile educa - tional methods of those days remind us of the vast changes that have taken place in half a century . '

		Gerund-grinding ' -- against which he is very bitter -- has not , it is too true , entirely disappeared ; but the lecture system has been introduced -LRB- largely through Mr.
White	PERSON	's example -RRB- , and the study of the modem languages and literatures and of pure science is now generally on an equal footing with that of the Greek and Roman classics .

		Going abroad in the
summer of 1853	DATE	, Mr.
White	PERSON	lived first in
Paris	LOCATION	, hearing lectures at the Sorbonne and the College de
France	LOCATION	; later , as attache of the American legation , in
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	; and lastly • AUTOBIOGHAPHY OF AUDREW DiCKSON WHITE .

		THE DIAL 261 in
Berlin	LOCATION	, where he heard Lepsius , the S ^ yptol - ogist ,
Boeckh	PERSON	on Grecian history ,
Karl Eitter	PERSON	on physical geography , von Eaumer on Italian history , and
Hirsch	PERSON	on modem history .

		Ranke he pictures as having * A habit of becoming so absorbed in his subject , aa to slide down in his chair , hold his finger up toward the ceiling , and then , with his eye fastened on the tip of it , to go mumbling through a kind of rhapsody , which most of my German fellow-students confessed they could not understand .

		It was a comical sight : half a dozen students crowding around his desk , listening as priests might listen to the sibyl on her tripod , the other students being scattered through the room in various stages of discouragement . '

		Similar forgetfulness of the needs of one 's auditors , though perhaps not in so extreme a form , is not unknown in some of our universi - ties even to-day .

		In politics Mr.
White	PERSON	began life -- in
1840	DATE	, of course -- as a Whig .

		Most entertaining are his recollections of the building of log cabins with the latch-string hanging out , the barrels of hard cider , the raccoon skins , the balls kept ' a-rolling on , ' the screaming eagles and crowing cocks of a campaign fitly characterized as * an apotheosis of tom-foolery . '

		With the campaign of
1844	DATE	the slavery question loomed up in poli - tics .

		Concerning
Henry Clay	PERSON	and the slave problem , Mr.
White	PERSON	says : ` How blind we all were !

		Henry Clay , a Ken - tucky slave-holder , would have saved us .

		Infinitely better than the violent solutions proposed to us was his large statesmanlike plan of purchasing the slave children as they were born and setting them free .

		Without bloodshed , and at cost of the merest nothing as compared to the cost of the Civil War , he would thus have solved the problem ; but it was not so to be .

		The guilt of the nation was not to be so cheaply atoned for . '

		The defeat of
Fremont	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	, Mr.
White	PERSON	thinks , was providential .

		Had the great strug - gle been precipitated then , the outcome might have been far different .

		Moreover , Mr.
White	PERSON	fully believes in the sincerity of President
Bu	ORGANIZATION	- chanan and his associates , who ` honestly and patriotically shrank ' from the horrible prospect of civil war and disunion .

		The importance of the work done before and during the Civil War by Mr.
White	PERSON	and other teachers and public speakers is too often over - looked and too easily underestimated .

		He sought ever to spread intelligence of the demoralizing effects of slavery ; to aid in train - ing up ' a new race of young men who should understand our own time and its problems in the light of history . '

		His main work was done in his well-filled lecture room at
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, where his discussions of the growth and decay of feudalism and of the serf system could not fail to throw much light on the tendencies of slavery .

		In a visit to
Europe	LOCATION	in the
fall of 1863	DATE	, he helped in the work , which had then become extremely important , of increasing the numbers of those friendly to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause and opposed to European intervention , and of procuring takers for the new national bonds .

		In commenting upon the more recent events of our political life , Mr.
White	PERSON	more than once speaks of what is , in his opinion , * the worst evil in American public life , -- that facility for un - limited slander , of which the first result is to degrade our public men , and the second result is to rob the press of that confidence among thinking people , and that power for good and against evil which it really ought to exercise .

		* An interesting illustration of this is the popular fiction , long held , that the first battle of
Bull Eun	ORGANIZATION	was lost because General
McDowell	PERSON	was drunk .

		At a banquet in
1883	DATE	, Mr.
White	PERSON	learned from
General McDowell	ORGANIZATION	himself that he had been , throughout his military career , a total abstainer !

		Another valuable criticism concerns our polit - ical conventions , in which the principal part is now at times played by spectators , and which in consequence is subject , at such times , to mob rule .

		It is indeed ' a monstrous abuse . '

		Twenty years of Mr.
White	PERSON	's life , from
1865	DATE	to
1885	DATE	, were given to the work of helping to found , and of administering ,
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	.

		No chapter in the history of American educa - tion is more interesting , and perhaps none is more important , than this ; not so much because of the wonderful growth of Cornell as because of the instructive lessons to be learned by edu - cators and philanthropists from its early history .

		The difficulties with which Mr.
Cornell	PERSON	and Mr.
White	PERSON	had to contend were enormous : lack of available means , more students than could be handled , some of whom were grieved because they could not earn their own living in the uni - versity , above all , the most violent and persistent opposition from sectarian institutions and presses .

		So wisely , however , did they lay the foundations of the university , that no important deviation from their policy has ever been made .

		The career of usefulness that the university has already had is the best answer to the critics -- and the slanderers -- of its early days .

		About half of the book is devoted to the author 's diplomatic experiences and to the observations and reflections incident to his diplo - matic life .

		The public has already been able to form some idea of the immense importance of these memoirs in the light they throw upon the actions and characters of the great protag - onists of recent European history -- among them Lord
John Russell	PERSON	,
Lord Pauncefote	LOCATION	,

Henry Maine	PERSON	,
Lord Acton	LOCATION	,
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, and many others .

		Of the chapters that have to do with
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean statesmen , the most important , probably , are those dealing with
Bismarck	PERSON	and
William II.	PERSON	, which have already , in substance , appeared in ' The CentiTry . '

		Especially noteworthy is Mr.
White	PERSON	's high opinion of the character and ability of the German Einperor , The effect of this contribution to our knowledge of
William II.	PERSON	, his environment , his aims , and his ambi - tions , must be to increase greatly that respect which most Americans already have for him , and to strengthen the tie that binds
America	LOCATION	, already so largely Teutonic in her citizenship , to the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	mother-nation .

		The chapter on
Tolstoi	PERSON	does not increase our admiration for the great Eussian , but probably voices the opinion that will ultimately be widely if not generally held .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's explanation of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	's narrowness of view is illuminating .

		` Of all distinguished men that I have ever met ,
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	seems to me most in need of that enlarge - ment of view and healthful modification of opinion which come from meeting men and comparing views with them in different lands and under different conditions .

		This need is all the greater because in
Russia	LOCATION	there is no opportunity to discuss really important questions ... The result is that his opinions have been developed without modification by any rational interchange of thought with other men .

		Under such circumstances any man , no mat - ter how noble or gifted , having given birth to striking ideas , coddles and pets them until they become the full-grown , spoiled children of his brain .

		He can at last see neither spot nor blemish in them , and comes virtually to believe himself infallible . '

		At the same time Mr.
White	PERSON	believes
Tolstoi	LOCATION	to be ` One of the most sincere and devoted men alive , a man of great genius and , at the same time , of very deep sympathy with his fellow-creatures .

		Out of this character of his come his theories of art and literature ; and , despite their faults , they seem to me more profound and far-reaching than any put forth by any other man in our time ... His paradoxes will be forgotten ; but his devoted life , his noble thoughts , and his lofty ideals will , as centuries roll on , more and more give life and light to the new Eussia . '

		These extracts are typical of the breadth of view , the sympathy , the candor , the tact that characterize Mr.
White	PERSON	's utterances in this book as they have always done throughout his life .

		Fearless in his condemnation of stupidity , knavery , and quackery of every sort , he is care - ful , so far as possible , not to mention names where it would give pain to persons now living ; as for example , in his references to the famous
Fiske	PERSON	will case , the outcome of which shattered one of the dreams of his life , the establishment of a great library at
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Accustomed to dealing with great questions and to taking large views of things , he naturally overlooks the petty , the mean , the narrow , when these are overbalanced by better things ; and his new ver - sion of the great Apostle 's words is a creed of optimism most stimulating to the generation which is to carry on his work . '

		I have sought to fight the good fight ; I have sought to keep the faith , -- faith in a Power in the universe good enough to make truth-seeking wise , and strong enough to make truth-telling effective , -- faith in the rise of man rather than in the fall of man , -- faith in the gradual evolution and ultimate prevalence of right reason among men .

		The
liATEST History	ORGANIZATION	op
America	LOCATION	.

		* For several months , historical students have awaited with no small degree of curiosity the appearance of the initial volume of Avery 's ' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, ' to comprise in all twelve volumes , with colored illustrations and other novel features .

		The plan of the work is pretentious , the author 's aim being to pre - sent in popular form an accurate and scholarly narrative of the whole course of American his - tory , -- something that has never yet been suc - cessfully attempted .

		In the first volume , which deals mainly with the period of discovery and exploration , Dr.
Avery	PERSON	pretends to no original investigation .

		His use of primary authorities seems to be restricted to those easily accessible in transla - tions .

		Internal evidence , indeed , points to the conclusion that he is not personally familiar with the Spanish language -- the chief requisite for research work in this particular field .

		Even when the primary authorities are easily acces - sible , the author has not always used them , but has preferred to trust to secondary sources .

		A close comparison of his account of the third voyage of
Columbus	LOCATION	with that given by Wash - ington Irving shows how minutely he followed the earlier work .

		The two accounts are strictly parallel , the sequence of events and the way in which they are related being exactly the same .

		Variations occur in the expansion of words into phrases and phrases into clauses , with the occasional introduction of descriptive adjectives .

		For illustration , where Irving speaks simply of the ' Trinity , ' Dr.
Avery	PERSON	adds the word ' Holy , ' following , in this respect , the example set by * A History of the

		THE DIAL , 26S
Justin Winsor	PERSON	, who similarly depended far more upon secondary authorities than is usually supposed .

		Nevertheless , in a general way , as we con - clude from volume I. , Dr.
Avery	PERSON	is fully abreaiit of modem scholarship .

		By means of an exhaustive study of the best secondary authori - ties , he has made himself thoroughly conversant with the great problems in American history .

		On controverted points he has carefully weighed the evidence ; and , in the majority of cases , has come to incline to the sounder opinion .

		This is notable in the matter of
Amerigo Vespucius	LOCATION	, where he has , most surprisingly , managed to steer clear of
John Fiske	PERSON	's vagaries .

		Some - times , however , he hesitates , -- as in his account of
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	, -- scarcely knowing which side to take .

		To his notion , evidently , the con - flicting decisions seem pretty evenly balanced .

		As a result , the reader is left in doubt whether or not
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	was the leading spirit in the voyage of 1496-7 .

		Dr. Aver -RCB- ' seems to think he was ; but the concensus of historical opinion points decidedly the other way .

		This wavering attitude , so vexatious to a critical reader , is another indication that the author has not him - self investigated the sources .

		Of really serious errors in the book , there are none .

		Minor discrepancies occur once in a while , as in the statement that Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	was the second European after
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	to cross the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	.

		This is a repetition of
Fiske	PERSON	.

		As a matter of fact , several Span - iards , in the interval between
1521	DATE	and
1578	DATE	, had ventured there .

		Under certain circum - stances , omissions of important truths might well be counted as errors .

		Dr.
Avery	PERSON	fails to remark that
Sebastian Cabofs	PERSON	individual title to fame rests , not upon any share , self-attri - buted , in the voyages of his father , but upon his organization of the first English trading company , -- a greater feat because of its far - reaching consequences .

		Furthermore , the attention of the reader has not been called to the rather unsatisfactory character of the only evidence we possess for the De Gourgues expe - dition .

		On these two occasions , Dr.
Avery	PERSON	has not made the best possible use even of the secondary material ; for Professor
F. H. Hodder	PERSON	pointed out
Sebastian Cabofs	PERSON	real contribution to history several years ago , in an article in
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
John G. Shea	PERSON	, to whom Dr.
Avery	PERSON	is elsewhere much indebted , has , in his critical notes on
Charlevoix	LOCATION	, impeached the reliability of the purely French accounts of De Gourgues , -- that is , he has , from the silence of Spanish annals , seriously questioned whether the Frenchmen , massacred by
Menendez	PERSON	, were ever avenged in the manner cited by
Parkman	PERSON	and acquiesced in by Dr.
Avery	PERSON	.

		The first two chapters of the book , which are in their nature introductory , exhibit the same tantalizing dependence upon the opinions of particular individuals .

		Points in geology , not yet fully determined , are narrated with cer - tainty ; while the theories urged respecting the age of man are peculiar to Professor
G. F. Wright	PERSON	, who revised the second chapter .

		As the leading geologists and palaeontologists have persistently refused to accept them , it is unwise to embody them in a popular work .

		The twenty-second chapter is a first-rate general account of the Aborigines ; and here Dr.
Avery	PERSON	is very fortunate in having secured the co - operation of such an able Indian scholar as Mr.
James Mooney	PERSON	.

		The great weakness of the book lies in the absence of page references ; and this criticism is made with all due regard to the avowed purpose of the author .

		It is true that lengthy notes often impede progress , and break , as it were , the continuity of the narrative .

		Nevertheless , some intimation of the sources of the book ought to be given .

		It is not enough to have at the end a fairly complete bibliography ; the popular reader is not likely to make much use of it , and for the critical reader it is not suffi - cient .

		Exceptions might also be taken to the scanty use of quotation marks .

		The omission is intentional , yet hardly to be commended .

		Even to-day , the classical knowledge of the ordi - nary person is not of very wide range , espe - cially in the realm of poetry ; and , as Dr.
Avery	PERSON	has a personal weakness for well-turned phrases , poetical catch-words , and flowery expressions , it is not presumed that the popular mind will alwaj 's be able to make a distinction between quoted but uncredited poetry and original com - position .

		The illustrative material is a noticeable fea - ture of the entire book , and , with the possible exception of the imaginary cuts , which are likely to be misleading because they often rep - resent men of whom no portrait is known to exist , is worthy of unstinted praise .

		The pic - tures of objects , especially in the second chap - ter , are interesting and instructive .

		The maps throughout are well-selected and seem to us of unusual excellence , -- clear , well-defined , and accurate .

		Dr.
Avery	PERSON	's style of writing is smooth and flovdng ; but it lacks the literary finish of
Prescott	PERSON	, the elegant ease of Irving , and the wearing qualities of
Fiske	PERSON	.

		It abounds in hack - neyed phrases , indirect statements , and meta - phors that are txyo often distracting .

		In short , it is altogether too flowery either for a perma - nent classic or for a serious piece of historical work .

		Such traits may , however , commend themselves to the general reader for whom tho 264 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
April 16	DATE	, book was originally intended .

		Disregarding a faint touch of pedantry here and there , we may say in conclusion that the good points in the book far outnumber the bad , and augur well for the series .

		They show an extensive reading , and , withal , a most careful and judi - cious selection of secondary material .

		Admit - tedly , the book is a remarkable achievement for an untrained historian .

		It is something we have wanted for a long time ; and , if the suc - ceeding volumes carry out the design of the first or improve upon it , it is to be hoped that the erroneous ideas respecting many phases of American history , which have been so assidu - ously fostered and popularized by some of our best-known writers , will eventually be eradi - ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ '

Recent Books in Economics	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Our steady and increasing interest in eco - nomic problems has lately produced ^ several valuable results .

		There has been a growing dis - position on the part of our best writers to pro- duce clear and systematic monographs on spe - cial topics , designed not simply for the class - room but for the instruction of a more and more appreciative circle of serious and thought - ful readers .

		This has done much to improve the exposition and to make more practical the subject-matter of the academic studies of indus - ttial phenomena .

		Continuous discussion , by rendering obsolete portions of the more recent works on economic topics , has compelled the revision of theory and the re-classification of data in order to prevent work from being hope - lessly behind the tinies .

		Conversely , the greater interest of academic thinkers in practical prob - lems has led journalists and men of affairs to gather their scattered writings into permanent form , and thereby to render them more avail - able to those who had at once less opportunity for the first-hand study of events and more time for analysis .

		The three volumes before us represent both of these hopeful tendencies , two of them being the work of known theorists , ^ he other of a prolific publicist and , practical student of finance .

		ance of four or five weighty and serious produc - tions has marked the period as one of unusual importance in the history of this branch of eco - nomic writing .

		Professor
Kinley	PERSON	's ' Study of the Theory of the
Medium of Exchange	ORGANIZATION	' is a welcome addition to an honorable list , and the same cordial greeting will doubtless be extended to one or two other books , by authors of stand - ing , now known to be well toward completion .

		All told , the scientific theory of money has profited greatly from the attention focussed upon it during the two Bryan campaigns ; and has profited again from the cessation of the contest and the opportunity thereby gained for sober and more unbiased thought .

		Professor
Kinley	PERSON	's work is a volume of some 415 duodecimo pages , divided into seventeen chapters .

		These follow the conventional group - ing of topics , and hence need no enumeration .

		They fall , in general , into three classes .

		The first includes Chapters I. and II. , which deal with the origin and idea of money ; the second , Chapters III .

		to
XV	ORGANIZATION	.

		inclusive , on the various phases of metallic money and its problems ; and the third .

		Chapters XVI .

		and XVII. , on con - vertible and inconvertible paper money .

		The technical reader is inclined to wish that the first and third of these divisions had been omitted , -- the first because of the more or less conjectural and unessential character of the data on which such discussions must rest , the third because of the need for more extended dis - cussion than a chapter or two can afford .

		But what is thus a defect to the specialist will be a merit in the eyes of the general observer , who may even feel that for his purpose the book might well go further and treat the subject of
Credit and Banking	ORGANIZATION	, which the author reserves to another volume .

		Taking the central portion of the book , there will be found relatively little to quarrel with and much to commend .

		While the treatment necessarily follows beaten pathsy it adds its fair share of new thought and detailed analysis to problems already much hammered upon .

		Probably the most useful bit of originality in the book is the consistent application of the notion of marginal values to the general value of-money question , and indeed to all prob - lems throughout the treatment where special application of value-theory is requisite .

		In this respect the book is a marked advance over some recent work which seems to be based upon no consistent doctrine of value .

		The author 's conclusions , however , seldom depart from those recognized as orthodox , though he is distinctly fair to both sides of debated matters .

Kinley	PERSON	has doubtless done wisely in omitting most of the familiar outlines of American cur - rency history which usually appear in works on money .

		Probably the chapters to which the theorist will turn with most interest are those which deal with the ` quantity theory ' and the effect of credit on prices .

		This book nominally rejects both the stereot -RCB- ` ped doctrine of the quan - tity of money as fixing its value , and the recent analyses put forward in rivalry with that theory .

		The stand taken is that ` the value of money , as it emerges from any set of exchanges is ... the resultant of a complex group of forces , ' and after carefid enumeration of these forces the conclusion is reached that ' the attempt to establish a relation of simple pro- portion between the quantity of money and its value ' is futile . '

		The value of money / in short , ` has some relation to the quantity / but ` is not proportional to the quantity excepting in the case of inconvertible paper / and even then only subject to some limitation .

		This -LRB- except for the inconvertible paper -RRB- is certainly a sound and wise view of the matter ; and , we think , is substantially the view now taken by all those who consider the money question in an unbiased way , without seeking weapons with which to belabor others .

		Unfortunately , like most statements of theory which hold only to acknowledged truth , it does not take us very far ; and , indeed , the most serious criticism upon Professor
Elinley	PERSON	's whole treatment is that it leaves many important practical questions without definite conclusion .

		A similar eclectic outcome is reached in the chapter on credit and its influence upon the price level .

		The author adheres neither to the school which determines the price level without referents to money , nor to that which regards its increased demand due to credit identical in effect with the increased demand due to money . '

		Credit is properly one of the determinants of the price level , ' but only one .

		The effect of credit on prices depends on the completeness of the cancellation of indebt - edness .

		This theory rests upon the definition that exchanges effected by credit mechanism represent essentially ' a return to barter by representative transfers of goods rather than by physical transfers . '

		So far as such a return avoids the necessity for the use of money , it sets free a certain amount of coin for use in cash payments or as reserves , and this money , -- practically increasing the stock available for use in money-exchanges , -- exerts ^ whatever influence upon the price level can properly be attributed to a chan ^ in the quantity of money .

		In short , a rearrangement of marginal valua - tions is necessitated .

		Granting the authors assumptions , this view seems a distinctly rea - sonable explanation of the phenomena of credit , and is a welcome relief from recent talk about credit as identical with confidence , and from definitions of credit as a ' short sale of money / Without going further into the details of this book , it may be briefly appreciated as a com - pact and concise setting forth of monetary theory , ornamented with little in the way of allusion or history , and illustrated scantily , but based upon careful study of the recent as well as the older works on the subject .

		The origi - nality of the book does not lie in newness of material , but in method of treatment , and the conclusions are throughout eclectic It should prove a useful volume both for the class room and for popular circulation .

		l ^ Ir .

		Conanf s work on ' Wall Street and the Country ' is confessedly an apology for the * financial interests , * and an effort to demon - strate the latent harmony between the promoters and financiers of
New York	LOCATION	and the plain citi - zens throughout the land .

		With this object in view , the book aims to ' set forth in some degree .

		the dangers of proceeding too rashly in extending the area of Federal intervention , and in fettering that freedom of action and initative which has been one of the essential causes of our national progress . '

		Six essays are included in the volume , and of these the first three and the last serve the main end , the fourth and the fifth being more general in character .

		Probably the most interesting and informing essay of the set is the one on ' The Future of Undigested Securities ' ; and Mr.
Conant	PERSON	has done rightly in giving it first place .

		The author believes that the sufferings inflicted upon the public through the over-capitalization and inflation of recent corporate enterprises are to be attributed largely to public gullibility and only in part to the promoters .

		Kecalling the unfortunate experiences of the early days of joint-stock companies , he points out that present conditions are analogous to the older experi - ence , and suggests that what is needed is not new legislation , but ` to apply to industrial trusts ... the lesson so well learned in the school of experience in railroading and banking . '

		The stronger and better organized of the new corporations will stand the test to which they are now being subjected , while the others will share the fate of our wildcat banks of the ante-bellum davs .

		In his chapter on ' The Trusts and the Public , ' Mr.
Conant	PERSON	finds 266 THE DIAJL -LSB- AprU ; 16 , that the dangers of govemmeiit regulation far overtop those of oppression and abuse by the mammoth corporations .

		` Intelligent discus - sion ^ he welcomes , and suggests that ` within the states corporation laws can probably be improved in many cases in the interest of the investor . '

		But to the consumer he has little to say except that ` in the nation , perhaps , some simple laws might be enacted for the protection of the consumer without disturbing the rights of the shareholder . '

		A lengthy elaboration of the classical economic argument for speculation is given in the essay on ' The Function of the Stock and Produce Exchanges . '

		This , like the other essays , is chiefly a defense of existing methods of financial manipulation , and a gentle effort to obscure some of the more repulsive aspects of modern finance . '

		The Economic Progress of the Century ' is different in tone from the other essays .

		It is a review of some of the economic factors which have contributed to recent industrial advance , and seems to have less of the character of a special plea than its companion pieces .

		Perhaps no higher compli - ment could be paid this essay than to say that it is somewhat in the style of the late
David A. Wells	PERSON	's ` Recent Economic Changes . '

		Mr.
Conant	PERSON	's method , -- and , it is not unfair to add , somewhat of his special bias , -- may be seen to good advantage in the paper on ' A G-old Standard for
China	LOCATION	. '

		Admirably clear is this little monograph in its re-statement of the fa - miliar reasons why Western producers would be benefited by the adoption of a stable money by
China	LOCATION	, as well as in its explanation of the modes by which the costly and difficult undertaking must be carried through .

		What Mr.
Conant	PERSON	neglects to lay stress upon , however , is the special interests behind our apparent display of national altruism and good feeling in pushing the plan forward .

		The ' Gold Standard for
China	LOCATION	' turns out to be a gold standard with a silver circulation , yet there is nowhere a clear recognition of the fact that our silver product is now chiefly controlled by a single interest , very powerful at
Washington	LOCATION	, and that the adoption of the project would mean a great increase in the demand for this metal and con - sequently an increase in its price .

		Our experi - ence in getting silver for
the Philippines	LOCATION	fur - nishes an interesting illustration of the effects that would flow from such an operation , and of the profits that would swell certain favored pockets .

		On the whole , Mr.
Conant	PERSON	's little book is use - ful and interesting , if read with due care and discretion .

		Its best feature is the clear depic - tion of many current conditions on which the general reader has scant opportunity to inform himself ; its worst , the ex parte character already referred to , and the failure to bring into relief important facts which might materially change the opinion of the reader if known .

		Professor
Carver	PERSON	's book on ' The Distribution of Wealth ' is a discussion of the abstract prin - ciples upon which the product of industry is divided .

		It had been anticipated by some as a book that would break new ground , and by others as a sharp critical review of the distribu - tion controversy that began some fifteen years or more ago .

		Tlie author evidently regards his own work as a bit of hard reading , for he ' hopes that the reader who takes up the volume will do so with the understanding that economics is a science rather than a branch of polite litera - ture . '

		By way of fitting it for use as a text , collateral reading in the standard authors on economic theory is suggested at the end of each chapter .

		None of the expectations concerning ' The Distribution of Wealth ' seem to be justified .

		Quite sound and classical -LRB- in the modern sense of that term -RRB- , for the most part , there is little or none of the critical review of recent theory already referred to , and we are glad to say that we can not accept Professor
Carver	PERSON	's foreboding of difficulty in reading the volume .

		On the contrary , there are numerous places where con - densation might be resorted to without at all rendering the treatment too abstruse or difficult to follow .

		The book is in the main a clear and careful re-statement of the prevalent ideas on the theory of distribution as now accepted .

		The formal division of the treatment follows conventional lines with chapters on
Value	ORGANIZATION	, Diminishing Returns , Forms of Wealth , Wages , Rent , Interest , and Profits .

		In the chapter on Interest , the point of view accepted by the author is developed along typical lines .

		Inter - est , says Professor
Carver	PERSON	, is ' the income which capital returns to its owner , whether he lends it or employs it himself in his business . '

		It is the surplus earning over and above the amount needed to replace losses and repair wear-and - tear .

		Capital is enabled to earn such an income simply because its material forms are useful , and this essentially justifies the ' productivity ' theory precisely as a similar fact in the case of labor accounts for and measures the productive - ness of that economic agent .

		Producers ' goods make up the significant categories of capital , and these are subject to a law of marginal pro- ductivity which dictates the proportion in which they will be combined with land and labor in productive processes .

		But any accoamt of the productiveness of capital , -- or , in other words , any theory of interest , -- must take account of the supply of the agent as well as of the demand for it .

		Demand is fully explained by the doc - trine of marginal productivity , but not so of
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		267 supply .

		Such supply is controlled by two fac - tors -- the cost of producing the capital and the necessity of waiting for a more or less slow return .

		The dislike of such waiting gives rise to the payment called interest .

		This waiting or saving is , in final analysis , the placing of capital in productive forms , as machinery , etc. .

		Such saving does not , always and everywhere , involve sacrifice , but the saving of enough capi - tal to carry on industry does do so .

		Hence the amount of interest paid does not correspond to a general discounting of future consumption , but to a marginal sacrifice or discounting .

		An equilibrium between demand for and supply of capital is arrived at when the purchaser 's -LRB- bor - rower 's -RRB- demand for different forms of capital gives them a value just equal to their marginal cost of production .

		Land seems to yield inter - est on principles precisely similar , yet the inde - structible elements involved are such as to war - rant a separate theory of rent .

		Capital varies much in its durability , and different countries and ages vary widely in the strength of the sav - ing spirit , and hence in the marginal sacrifice of abstinence .

		It is conceivable that interest might disappear , owing to a decline in such marginal sacrifice to zero ; but no such result is likely to occur .

		The ' justice ' of interest is a question of political expediency , and on that basis may be upheld , since without it capital would be scarcer and what there was would be less ably managed .

		This specimen of the mode of reasoning employed in ` The Distribution of Wealth ' is representative .

		A similar plan is pursued in the other sections , and generally the application of the doctrine of marginal sacrifices figures throughout as the leading principle .

		Yet there is everywhere apparent an effort to keep the valuable elements in conflicting doctrines new and old , and to harmonize them where possible .

		The book is moderate in tone and in conclu - sions .

		Some critics of Professor
Carver	PERSON	have accused him of * circuity ' in treatment .

		It would not be worth while to recall the shadowy refinements upon which this charge must be based .

		The subject itself is one in which cer - tain assumptions must be made , and to these the reasoning naturally and unavoidably returns .

		Only by eliminating the whole theory of distribution , -- as suggested by one critic , -- will such a ' danger ' be avoided .

		Professor
Carver	PERSON	has furnished a sensible and readable summary of theory on an abstract phase of eco - nomies , -- a phase , too , that is lately falling into disrepute .

		It should do something to improve the status of this field of study .

		We note in conclusion that the proofs of the book have been carefully read , but that some of its mechanical features are not the publishers ' best .

		In the copy that has fallen under our eye , one * form ' -LRB- 16 pages -RRB- has been omitted ; and there are other serious imperfections .

		*
M. Arminius Yambery	ORGANIZATION	, already well known through former publications , some concerned with interesting public events in his career and some more intimately personal , has gathered into two volimies a number of the de - tails , both public and personal , not in - cluded in his previous works , and has given to the book the double title of ' The Story of My Struggles : The Memoirs of Arminius Vambery . '

		His purpose is stated quite frankly , and the book may be taken as supplementing all that he has written not avowedly scientific in its nature .

		Where his earlier books have exhausted his reminiscences , as in the case of those describing the wonderful journey that he made into
Central Asia	LOCATION	in the disguise of a dervish , the mention here is merely passing and for the purpose of setting the event in its due chronological place .

		In other re - spects , particularly in his recollections of his earlier years , and in specifying his services to the cause of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	, the treat - ment is remarkably fuU .

		It is in this latter respect that the interest of the narrative will be found to reside chiefly .

		M. Vambery is an extraordinary example of what one man may accomplish by writing to the newspapers , -- an art and practice gener - ally unknown in the
United States	LOCATION	, greatly to the country 's loss .

		It is no exaggeration what - ever to say that
M. Vambery	PERSON	's letters to the
London	LOCATION	* Times ' have played no small part in changing the map of the world .

		He returned from his expedition in
Central Asia	LOCATION	with an amount of knowledge concerning those parts exceeding that of any other European .

		He had acquired perfect command of the Turkish lan - guage and literature , and with this a surpris - ing fund of information about the government and politics of the Ottoman empire .


Persia	LOCATION	, too , was an open book to him , and his history of
Bokhara	LOCATION	is the standard work on that little understood people after many years .

Great Britain	LOCATION	as the one civilizing and enlightening agent of that por - tion of the world , his attitude as a freedom - loving Hungarian giving him a complementary hatred for
Russia	LOCATION	and her methods .

		Born a Jew , M ,
Vambery	ORGANIZATION	's account of his boyhood and youth sets forth the bitterness of the prejudice against that remarkable race in
Hungary	LOCATION	and throughout the Austrian empire , -- a prejudice hardly yet removed in his indi - vidual case , and then only from his countrymen having learned of the esteem in which he is held by the world outside .

		It also exemplifies the loyalty of the Jew to his brethren , whereby the widow 's son in the depths of poverty was freely accorded , through the years of his educa - tion , such aid as was possible from those only less poor than himself .

		After the customary training of the orthodox son of
Israel	LOCATION	in the Scriptures and their commentaries , including an amount of learning by rote that must have had some effect in developing his extraordinary memory , his schooling fell into the hands of the Roman Catholic priests .

		The result was to leave him a pronounced skeptic in all that per - tains to revealed religion , and the following passage indicates his subsequent attitude : ` As will appear from the following pages of this work , it was for the most part religion , the product of divine inspiration and the supposed means for ennobling and raising mankind , which made me feel the baseness of humanity most acutely ; and from my cradle to my old age , in
Europe	LOCATION	as well as in
Asia	LOCATION	, among those of the highest culture as well as amid the crudest barbarism , I have found fanati - cism and narrow-mindedness , malice and injustice , emanating mostly from the religious people , and always on behalf of religion ! '

		Considered in the light of his real attain - ments and solid contributions to the world 's knowledge of its people and their spoken tongues ,
M. Vambery	PERSON	's apologies for his lack of a thorough grounding in the humanities sound strange , and are likely to provoke the inquiry whether more learning of the ascer - tained sort would not have left him less able to make original contributions to the general store .

		It is made clear that he hit upon Turk - ish as the field in which to exhibit his talents for research because of its kinship to Hun - garian ; and when he had all that
Europe	LOCATION	could give him , in his state of almost complete desti - tution , he embarked upon the journey to Con - stantinople which colored the rest of his life .

		There he set about learning the cultivated speech and literature , until he found himself , within a comparatively short time , generally accorded the position of an ` Effendi , ' -- that is , a fully accredited Turk .

		His interest in the beginnings of the language led him into his expedition to the former home of the Othraans , where he had to pass for montlis in his artificial character as a true believer .

		His recital of his physical sufferings at this time must excite sym - pathy from every reader , while his mental tor - tures were still more acute .

		One anecdote illustrating oriental shrewd - ness is certainly worth giving , the occurrence taking place while
M. Vambery	PERSON	was at Erze - roum as the guest of
Hussein Daim Pasha	PERSON	. '

		One day the
Pasha	PERSON	lost a valuable diamond ring , and as he had not been out of the house one might justly suppose that the ring would be found , unless one of the numerous servants of the establishment had made away with it .

		As all investigations were fruitless ,
Hidayet Effendi	PERSON	sent for a celebrated wonder-working Sheikh , who squatted down in the middle of the great entrance hall , where all the servants were assembled .

		I impatiently waited the issue of events .

		At last the
Sheikh	LOCATION	, sitting cross - legged , produced from under his mantle a black cock , and holding it in his lap he invited all the servants , each in turn , to come up to him , stroke the cock softly , and straightway put his hand into his pocket ; then , said the
Sheikh	LOCATION	, the cock , without any more ado , will declare who is the thief by crowing .

		When all the servants had passed in turn before the
Sheikh	LOCATION	, and touched the cock , he told them all to hold out their hands .

		All hands were black , with the exception of one , which had re - mained white , and whose owner was at once desig - nated as the thief .

		The cock had been blackened all over with coal dust , and as the thief , fearing de - tection , had avoided touching him , his hand had remained white , and consequently his guilt was declared .

		The servant received his punishment , and the Sheikh his reward . '

		The autobiographer himself is occasionally lost in surprise at his own advancement , and the reader will share the feeling with him more than once .

		It is only a chapter or two from the scene just depicted , when he writes of his stay at
Lord Houghton	ORGANIZATION	's country seat , after he had been invited to
England	LOCATION	for the purpose of lec - turing and attending to the publication of his first book , the account running thus : ` During one visit there I made the acquaintance of such celebrities as
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	, afterwards Viceroy of
India	LOCATION	; the poet
Algernon Swinburne	PERSON	, who used to read to us passages of his yet unpub - lished poem , `` Atalanta in Calydon , '' over which the slender youth went into ecstasies ; and last , but not least , of
Burton	LOCATION	, just returned from a mission in the North-West of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Burton -- later Sir
Eichard Burton	PERSON	-- was to spend his honeymoon under the hospitable roof of the genial Lord
Houghton	LOCATION	.

		The company , amongst which
Madame Mohl	PERSON	, the wife of the celebrated Orientalist ,
Jules Mohl	PERSON	, spe - cially attracted my attention , had met here in honor of
Burton	LOCATION	, the great traveller , and as he was the last to arrive ,
Lord Houghton	LOCATION	planned the follow - ing joke : I was to leave the drawing-room before
Burton	PERSON	appeared with his young wife , hide behind one of the doors , and at a given sign recite the first `` Sura '' of the Koran with correct Moslem intona - tion .

		I did as arranged .


Burton	PERSON	went through every phase of surprise , and jumping up from his seat ex - claimed , `` That is VambSry ! ''

		M. Vamb6ry 's story possesses an engaging

		THE DIAL 269 frankness , with an occasional bit of self-depre - ciation which has always some purpose in view .

		For instance , he observes that his early training in
Hungary	LOCATION	was of the kind that prepared him for his experiences in the East , adding , ` The difference between the condition of a poor Jew-boy and a mendicant dervish in
central Asia	LOCATION	is , after all , not very great .

		The cravings of hun - ger are not one whit easier to bear or less irksome in cultured
Europe	LOCATION	than in the Steppes of
Asia	LOCATION	, and the mental agony of the little Jew , despised and mocked by the Christian world , is perhaps harder than the constant fear of being found out by fanat - ical Mohammedans . '

		The book is interesting in many ways , as the foregoing extracts show more plainly , perhaps , than any comment makes possible .

		It sets forth a long , industrious , and honorable career , filled with achievement of no mean order and not yet closed .

		Being interestingly told , and by one who learned to write in English late in life , there can be no good result from criticiz - ing its style .

		But it both needs and deserves an index , in addition to the summary of previous works from the same hand which is added as an appendix .

		The inclusion of paragraphs on city play-grounds , industrial schools , and other edu - cational efforts show that charity is conceived as something more than almsgiving .

		The value of this monographic work is vastly increased because it is inspired by a common purpose , unified by a common plan , and brought together in a single volume by an author-editor peculiarly well fitted for the task .

		Professor
Henderson	PERSON	has a much more practical knowledge of charitable matters than most college professors have of the subjects they teach ; in him , indeed , the theoretical and the practical are almost ideally united .

		One is tempted to wish that he had somewhat mag - nified his editorial fimction and supplied a summary making clear the trend of modem philanthropic effort .

		But perhaps this is tiie wish of the dilletante or of the book-reviewer only ; there is something to be said in favor of the old-fashioned plan of reading a book through instead of merely skimming through the introduction and conclusion , and those who read it should be able to draw their own gen - eralizations .

		Charity workers are apt to be busy people , but they will find this book well worth reading through .

		If this review is little more than a table of contents , it has at least supplied the most conspicuous lack of the volume ' reviewed , whose table of contents is only a list of coun - tries .

		A somewhat more analytical list of top - ics is needed to exhibit the richness and vari - ety of the subject-matter and to make the book useful for ready reference , although there is a fairly good index .

		His purpose , as he explains it in his preface , is * to supply the student a considerable mass of defi - nite fact ... rather than extended philosophical discussions of historical trend . '

		With the exception of the first fifty pages , the method of treatment is exclusively topical ; each state in the union is sketched briefly , sometimes in less than a page .

		A more accu - rate title would have been ' A Historical Ency - clopaedia of
American Education	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The centenary of the inauguration of the movement for free public schools in the city of
New York	LOCATION	has suggested the need of a general historical sketch of the system , and such a sketch has been written by Mr.
A. Emerson Palmer	PERSON	, secretary of the
New York	LOCATION	school board .

		The author describes his work as ' a fairly complete chronicle rather than a philo - sophic history . '

		He thus parries the most seri - ous criticism that can be made , -- namely , that the book treats only of surface events and that the significance of the events chronicled is not shown .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	is well informed on his own subject , but he appears to know little or nothing of the development of other city systems .

		The title-page informs the reader that this history is authorized by the
New York	LOCATION	board of education , which fact may account for the somewhat gingerly discussion of several recent movements in organization .

		Not with - standing these limitations , the book meets a dis - tinct need , and every student of American edu - cation would welcome similarly comprehensive sketches of the growth of public education in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and other centres of population .

		Books treating of school supervision from the formal or official side of systems and laws , have been sufficiently numerous ; a work , however , describing the management of schools as they actually are managed , is something of a novelty .

		This latter is the task that Superintendent
Wil	PERSON	-
liam E. Chancellor	PERSON	, of
Bloomfield	ORGANIZATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, has undertaken to perform in his recent volume , ' Our Schools , their Administration and Super - vision . '

		The immediate aim of the author ha ^ been to provide a manual of advice for teachers entering the profession of the school super - tendency .

		Such topics as boards of education , the superintendent , the principal , graded sys - tems of schools , state systems , the private school , the new education , and the educational policy of the community are dealt with from the point of view of the school administrator .

		An appen - dix of more than fifty pages contains reprints of the blank forms necessary in the administra - tion of city schools .

		As a guide to the novice ,
1905	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL , 271 the work will undoubtedly prove useful ; but its greatest value is iu an entirely different direc - tion ; as a study in social control , it is a master - piece .

		How boards of education are managed , how public sentiment can be created and brought to bear on them , when the superintendent should be bold and when not too bold , -- these are the topics dealt with by Mr.
Chancellor	PERSON	in a manner that might almost be described as fascinat - ing .

		Pari ; of the interest lq these discussions is due to the large number of specific cases which the author cites .

		Another source of strength , though of inferior importance , is found in his acquaintance with modem eco - nomics , sociology , and pedagog -RCB- ' .

		The book is equally free from the patriotic gloss of the pro- fessional politician and the hysterics of the pro- fessional reformer ; it recognises frankly the weak spots in our city systems and the difficul - ties that confront the superintendent .

		Any one interested in knowing the schools as part of the social machinery of tiie countrv - will find the work profitable .

		Inspector
William H. Winch	PERSON	of the English elementary schools endeavors to apply an exact standard of measurement to the intellectual results accomplished in the schools of different countries . '

		Xotes on German Schools ' is the title of his first work in this direction .

		The volume , in the main , contains accurate and detailed descriptions of lessons observed by the author in a four months ' tour of inspection in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In the case of each lesson described , all the obtaining conditions -LRB- such as age of pupil , grade , number in class , preparation , and time devoted to that particular branch -RRB- are stated .

		The subjects covered in separate chap - ters are arithmetic , the language arts , history , geography , modem languages , elementary science , drawing , physical exercises , and sing - ing .

		The resulting volume lacks the charm and picturesque features of some American books on the same subject , but is a more useful and solid contribution for serious students .

		Critics who complain that in
America	LOCATION	philos - ophy is simply an academic luxury remote from the real interests of life should read
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	's posthumous volume , ` The Education of the Wage-Earners , ' which con - tains the record of a unique experiment among the Russian Jews of
Xew York City	LOCATION	.

		As the result of a challenge at the close of a lecture , Professor
Davidson	PERSON	organized a class composed almost exclusively of wage-earners from the tenement houses .

		With them , he successively studied the history of civilization , modem lit - erature , and the history of philosophy .

		In spite of broken English , poor facilities for study , and the exhaustion from excessive physi - cal labor , these students threw themselves into the courses with surprising intellectual vigor and enthusiasm , which has been continued through a series of years , even after the death of the founder .

		This result is a striking con - firmation of one of the founder 's theories ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that the true students of the age are not found in universities , largely supported by the idle sons of the rich , but in the factories and work - shops .

		The volume , which is edited by Mr.
Charles M. Bakewell	PERSON	, contains a brief biography and characterization of Professor
Davidson	PERSON	by the editor ; two of the original lectures of the course ; the history of the movement , written by Professor
Davidson	PERSON	, together with his letters to the class showing the underlying spirit of tiie movement .

		A new volume of addresses or lay sermons by
Dean Briggs	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	follows the lines of his previous book , * School ,
College	ORGANIZATION	, and Char - acter , ' in its attitude toward fundamental col - lege problems .

		Its contents , however , are more miscellaneous in character , containing as it does the
Harvard Phi Beta Kappa	LOCATION	poem for
1903	DATE	and the address to the school children of
Concord	LOCATION	on the hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Emerson	LOCATION	, as well as the addresses on college topics .

		I -RRB- ean
Briggs	PERSON	does not retract his scepticism concerning modem methods in higher education , so well phrased in the title of one of his previous address ^ , * Old Fash - ioned Doubts concerning Xew Fashioned Edu - cation . '

		He preaches the gospel of routine , of complete mastery of the automatic side of living , as a prime requisite in education .

		His most inspiring chapters are those treating the moral and social side of modem college life , where his wide experience lend weight and insight to his words .

		He is also unusually for - tunate in his illustrative stories .

		Admiration of the author 's style should not blind the reader to his essentially one-sided presentation of an intricate subject .

		With a sure hand , the weak - nesses arising from the elasticity and individu - alism of the newer methods in higher education are laid bare , but nothing is said of the initia - tion into scientific method , the intellectual maturity and philosophic spirit which these same methods have secured to the abler and more serious-minded students .

		Twenty-three of the recent utterances of President
William E. Harper	PERSON	have been gath - ered into a volume called ' The Trend in Higher Education . '

		The majority of the chapters , including all those of importance , discuss either coUege and university questions or religious and theological education .

		The articles , with the exception of some brief occasional addresses , are vital and frank almost to the point of blimtness , -- there is no tendency to 272 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		call a spade an agricultural implement .

		At the same time , the treatment is fair , and no attempt is made to criticize a particular institution by insinuation .

		Dr.
Harper	PERSON	takes a vigorous and business-like attitude , modem but not radical , and his gen - eral conclusions are likely to be more widely accepted by the university men of the country than those of any other writer in recent years .

		The strongest chapters are ' Waste in Higher Education , ' which should be sent to every board of regents or trustees in the country , ` How Shall the Theological Curriculum be Modified , ' and * The Situation in the
Small College	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The first chapter , ' Democracy and Education , ' does not afford President
Harper	PERSON	's preeminently objective mind as good an opportunity to dis - play itself to advantage as many of the later themes .

		Some of the minor topics treated are teachers , salaries , endowment C -RRB- f college athletics , Latin versus science , coeducation , the three years ' course , and luxury among college students .

		Both President
King of Oberlin	ORGANIZATION	, in his volume entitled ' Personal and Ideal Elements in Education , ' and Dr.
George A. Hubbell	PERSON	, in his book called * Up through Childhood , ' endeavor to apply the results of modem psychology to moral and religious education .

		President
King	PERSON	writes for the scholar a con - servative interpretation of the results gained by men like
Coe	PERSON	,
Starbuck	ORGANIZATION	, and
Leuba	PERSON	in their researches concerning the psychology of con - version and allied themes .

		If the basis of his careful and well-wrought argument is some - times wider than the application to concrete problems , this apparent discrepancy is to be accounted for by the form of the chapters , which were first delivered as papers before religious conventions , where striking and concrete con - clusions are urgently demanded .

		The volume contains President
King	PERSON	's inaugural address , another plea for the retention of the old-time college course .

		Dr.
Hubbell	PERSON	writes in a popu - lar style for a much wider audience .

		His book reads like a number of bright Y. M. C. A. talks strung together with some appearance of system .

		It abounds in excellent stories and familiar verse , and contains much eloquence .

		N ' o better book on religious pedagogy for the average Sun - day school teacher has been written .

		It is readable , fearless in its discussion of present conditions , and embodies many of the typical ideas of the last decade .

		Child study is rapidly emerging from the monographic period to a stage characterized by general summaries and interpretations .

		The latest venture in the latter direction is a vol - ume written by Miss
Amy Eliza Tanner	PERSON	, for - merly of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and entitled ` The Child , his Thinking , Feeling , and Doing . '

		The book is designed for the teacher and the mother .

		The author avoids technical terms and speculative discussions ; , facts in great abundance have been supplied , together with bibliographies suificiently com - plete to confuse the average mother or teacher who is not also a trained student .

		Inasmuch as the majority of readers ignore bibliographies , however , no great amount of damage will result .

		The arrangement of chapters lacks any psycho - logical or logical basis .

		For normal or college students who should have some groundwork in general psychology before studying child psy - chology .

		Miss
Tanner	PERSON	's book is inferior to that of Dr.
Kirkpatrick	PERSON	; for general readers it will prove more serviceable .

		Mr.
Gosse'a	PERSON	estimate of
Patmore	ORGANIZATION	.

		Barely a decade has passed since the death of
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	, and already his work lies more in shadow than that of any other well-known poet of his generation .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, writing of
Patmore	PERSON	in the series of ` Literary Lives ' -LRB- Scrib - ner -RRB- , prophesies that the shadow will soon pas & and that
Patmore	PERSON	's reputation will grow steadily in the future until it reaches a position as secure , , if not as eminent , as that now held by
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	, .


Browning	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's biog - raphy is highly interesting ; explaining much that is mysterious in
Patmore	LOCATION	's poetry through the strange personality of the poet , the biographer adds something of distinct value to the critical estimate .

		But his conclusions are at least open to debate .

		As Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	himself says ,
Patmore	PERSON	- was the type of the moral and intellectual aristo - crat ; he arrogated to himself an independence of thought and action not in harmony with modern theories of social welfare .

		Moreover , his ideals ^ both personal and literary , were above his powers of realization .

		The result of all this seems , to - an outsider unbiassed by personal admiration for
Patmore	PERSON	, consistent with the facts as they are .

		Patmore is dead , and with him died the inspira - tion of his presence , the impulse of his strong and aggressive individuality , and the charm of his poetry .

		Patmore 's poetry was
Patmore	PERSON	trans - lated into verse , mystically simple , inconsistent , , incomplete .

		Even ` The Angel in the
House	ORGANIZATION	' is fragmentary , and great reputations are not built on fragments .

		If he is to be remembered it will be as the friend of great men , the early idol of the Preraphaelites .

		He started thoroughly abreast of his times , but he did not care to forge ahead with the rest , and Avas only angered when others insisted that the goal had not been reached .

		Still , it is something to have been considered an enemy Avorth fighting , and the records show a famous quarrel for almost every famous friendship .

		It is almost impossible to consider
Patmore	PERSON	's poetry

		` The Azalea ' is perfect , so are other little things and small parts of some of the bigger things ; then all is said .

		An efficient A. text-book has a possibility to text in make or mar the student 's interest Psychology .

		jjj ^ particular section of the intel - lectual domain second only to that of the teacher .

		And the requirements demanded of teacher and text alike are many , complex , and strenuous .

		Tact , insight , judgment , taste , and a nice feeling for compromise amid the emphasis of the essen - tials , are all to be exercised without dogmatism , without sacrifice of a helpful effort on the part of the learner or of enthusiasm on the part of the teacher .

		The new-bom change ia the interpreta - tion of subject-matter and of the spirit of the teacher has humanized and naturalized the text - book .

		No discipline has profited by , and in turn inspired , this consummation more than that of psychology ; and since
James	PERSON	any one who issues a dull or unreadable book on psychology does so at his peril .

		Besides readability , such a text should inspire effort and lead to effective absorp - tion of new ideas .

		In this aspect its success de - pends upon system , point of view , and the sus - tained capacity of the author .

		In all these re - spects , and everywhere with distinctive success , the volume recently issued by Professor
J. R. Angell	PERSON	passes a critical examination .

		The text is readable , the doctrine sound , the teaching effect - ive .

		It achieves these merits by judicious se - lections and omissions , by emphasis of the im - portant and a sufficient indication of the details to make a life-like picture .

		The points of great - est emphasis are the importance of the functional , active , effective processes in the world of mind , the instructive sidelights that are obtained when we study such functions as a growth and note how such processes came to be , and how differ - ently they are distributed in the varieties of mental experience .

		The strength of the book is in the descriptions of the higher and more com - plex forms of the mental product , those in which perception , memory , attention , and the formation of concepts play the major part .

		The introduc - tory accounts of the source of the material upon which the mind works , and of its relations with a nervous system , while adequate , are for many pur - poses too condensed , and too summary to balance well with the more adequate and congenial treat - ment of what comes later .

		Yet in all , and for the purposes of the general introductory course in our college psychology , the book has distinctly greater adaptiveness and promise of eflBciency , with fewer shortcomings , than almost any other book that has recently been put forth to meet the needs of those young minds about to be ac - quainted with the natural history of the mental life .

		The field of modem Irish history inTte ^ uii ^ ^ ^ s long been permitted to he fal - low ; only here and there , and par - ticularly where it directly touches the English field , has much genuine work been done .

		Recently , however , Mr.
C. Litton Falkiner	PERSON	, an enthusiastic student of the Irish past , has begun a systematic study of the history of the whcJe island , and , especially on the social and topograph - ical side .

		In his earlier ' Studies ' he gives us a pic - ture of
Ireland	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century ; in his later work , ` Illustrations of Irish History ' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , he takes us back to the seventeenth .

		The book is in two parts : the first is a collection of papers -- ` by-products of historical research ' -- dealing with various subjects , most of which , however , concern the early history of
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		To the historical student these papers have distinct value ; but the general reader will find them any - thing but inspiring .

		Of far greater importance and interest is the second part , which is a collec - tion of source materials , descriptions of
Ireland	LOCATION	by officials and travellers who visited or lived jn the country during the Stuart period .

		As the greater part of these were written by royal offi - cials , matters are naturally seen from the Eng - lish point of view ; and the narrators find much 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
April	DATE	t6 ^ to censure , especially in popular customs and religious observances .

		Nevertheless , taken together they form a picture of Irish society in the six - teenth century that is clear and vivid , though somewhat exaggerated and unsympathetic .

		The editor 's notes explanatory of Celtic terms and obsolete place-names are all the reader can desire .

		Some of the essays in Part I. , such as those in which the author discusses the woods and the counties of
Ireland	LOCATION	, also give considerable help toward a proper understanding of these contem - porary accounts .

		It should be added that a large part of this material , particularly certain chap - ters of
Tynes Moryson	ORGANIZATION	's Itinerary , ' had lain in manuscript form till within the last few years , a few sections being printed in this work for the first time .

		In publishing a book such as this , Mr.
Falkiner	PERSON	does the cause of history a service ; it is only to be regretted that he has found himself unable to include a few extracts from writers more in sympathy with the Irish people and their struggles to maintain their nationality and their faith .

		It is well for the title of a book to le ^ rZ ' ^ ce ! '' '

		* ^ ^ `` ^ f ^ i ^ ly accurate idea of its contents .

		When one reads the title , ` How to Know the Starry Heavens , ' he must not be blamed if he infers that the work is devoted to teaching a knowledge of the constella - tions .

		But this book of Professor
Edward Irving	PERSON	is of quite a different nature .

		Dedicated to ` All true citizens of the
Great Cosmos	LOCATION	and to all who wish to become such , ' it aims to interest the gen - eral reader in astronomical processes , and in those results of astronomical research that most compel the imagination and are associated with the widest -- and in some respects the wildest -- of theorizings .

		The author 's ` chariot of imagina - tion ' carries the reader through the starry realms , leads him to see in an humble rock-frag - ment something similar to the entire known uni - verse , and in turn to consider the latter as per - chance forming a fragment of some yet grander structure .

		The latest speculations about the Nebular Hypothesis are here exploited in con - siderable detail , the discussion of the structure of matter embracing an admirably clear and suc - cinct account of various forms of radio-activity .

		Line cuts and photo-engravings abound , but are scarcely more picturesque than the language of the author , which is usually interesting and genu - inely informing .

		There are occasional lapses which offend the serious reader , when the author attempts undue jocoseness , or oversteps the boundaries of good taste in references to the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		His philosophical standpoint may be judged by a quotation from page 205 : ` We have come to the conclusion that nothing exists apart from matter and its energies .

		Mind , in the form of desires and inclinations , exists not only through - out the animal and vegetable kingdoms , but like - wise in so-called dead matter .

		Even the mole - cules , atoms , and corpuscles have a kind of sensa - tion and will .

		From all that we can learn of the beds and couches of the Greeks ,
Etruscans	LOCATION	, and Romans , they were neither beautiful to look at nor comfortable to lie upon .

Ransom	ORGANIZATION	's book is not intended for popular reading .

		It is a slightly expanded col - lege thesis , and a scholarly contribution to the archaeologj - of furniture .

		No phase of the subject is overlooked , and the studies include valuable chapters upon materials , technique , ornament , furnishings , forms , and styles of the beds of the different periods , which seem to be exhaustive as to the literary and monumental sources of our information .

Texas	LOCATION	, with the settlement by Americans of that territorv ' , their conflicts with the Mexican authorities , their war of independence , with annexation , and with the war with
Mexico	LOCATION	and the subsequent
Gadsden Purchase	LOCATION	.

		It is written simply and effectively , and with less elaboration of detail than previous works from the same hand .

		The restraint shown in describing the victories of the Americans over the Mexicans , for example , adds greatly to the effectiveness of the volume : and Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's atti - tude toward the ethical questions involved in the conquest is well indicated by the use of the word ` spoliation ' in his sub-title .

		A word might have been said about the evil precedent then estab - lished for policies still at work in the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines ; but no doubt is left in the mind of the reader that the American nation was an ^ iiltv of a crime against Mexico , made worse rather than better by the fact that its chief perpetrators seemed to be unaware of their giiilt .

		A volume of ` Dramatic Episodes , ' by Miss
Marjorie Benton Cooke	PERSON	, is sent us by the
Dramatic Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The success of
Miss Cooke	ORGANIZATION	's previous volume , ` Modern Monologues , ' has been such as to justify the preparation of the present work , which contains ten pieces , each in a single scene , dealing mostly with the fashions or the humors of present-day life .

		The ` Official Report of the
Thirteenth Universal Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	, ' held in
Boston	LOCATION
last October	DATE	, has just been published by the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	intrusted with that function , and makes a volume of three hundred and fifty pages .

		Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	, as editor of the `

		` The Alchemist ' and ` Bartholomew Fair ' have already been given us in this form , and two more volumes are now at hand .

		The plan thus not - ably inaugurated by Professor Cook may well be recommended to other instructors in other universi - ties .

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which we described at the time of its incep - tion , is now making substantial progress .

		In this book , which brought forward Miss
Ottilie Liljencrantz	PERSON	as a romancer of unusual gifts , appeared the first colored pictures by the Kinneys , two young artists who have since demonstrated their unequaled ability in the handling of mediaeval subjects .

		`` Leif the Lucky , '' with its illustrations in full color -LRB- the first ever used in fiction -RRB- and its characteristic decorations and type , created a sensation .

		A year later came another Viking romance from the same author and illustrators , `` The Ward of King Canute , '' which proved equally successful , as it was distinguished by the same original features .

		After
Miss Liljencrantz	PERSON	's books came a ■ * ■ romance of early
Chicago	LOCATION	by another hitherto unknown writer -- `` When Wilderness Was King . ''

		With the benefit of the embellishments by the Kinneys it secured immediate attention , which augmented rapidly when the charm of the story itself became known .

		It was a popular success of the first rank , figuring in the '' six best sellers '' and other evidences of prosperity .

		Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	's second novel , `` My Lady of the North , '' has been even more popular , and at the present time over sixty thousand volumes of these two stories have been sold -- the work of a writer absolutely unknown about a year ago . ''

		FOR THE WHITE CHRIST '' TN this romance of
Charlemagne	PERSON	's day -LRB- just published -RRB- the publishers felt that a suitable story far exceeding all ■ ' ■ previous efforts in book making was at hand .

		The author ,
Robert Ames Bennet	PERSON	, had gone thoroughly into his subject and produced one of the `` big '' novels of early Christianity of the class represented by `` Ben Hur '' and '' Quo Vadis . ''

		It is a splendid tale of heroic scope and in external adornment surpasses any volume previously offered .

		The illustrations are in full color , several new ideas in decoration have been utilized , and within six weeks of publication day there is a universal verdict pronouncing `` For the White Christ '' `` the most beautiful book of fiction ever published . ''

		As in the case of

		Of these four ,
Thtvss	ORGANIZATION	's edition of
1532	DATE	is the only one of real value , as all the rest are derived from it .

		It is of special value as an original authority .

		There is no other known source of ETsk 's Teitameni of Love , or for tbe Ballads entitled The Flower Curtetye , To my Sovereign Lady , or A Goodly Ballad .

		Of the
Tetia	LOCATION	- meni 0 / Cretteid the only other authority is the later -LRB- but independent -RRB- edition of

Thynne	PERSON	's text is better than that of the BIS. , and supplies many missing lines , inclusive of lines 1-44 .

Assembly of Ladies	ORGANIZATION	, of which there are two other copies ; and for the Bnvoy to Seegan , and the Book of the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	, of which there are three
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		For lines 31-96 of the last mentioned , which are missing in two of the MSS. ,
Thynne	PERSON	is the best authority .

		In other cases , the text of Thynne is also , in general , well worth consulting ; notably , in the case of TroUus and
Cressida	PERSON	.

		And it is well to bear in mind that from
1532	DATE	to
1597	DATE	, the text of the
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	was most easily accesrible to readers in one of the four Folios .

		Every word of the text has been collated with the best editions , a very large mass of new matter has been discovered and incorporated , and Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	in his notes has endeavored not only to relate Lamb 's writings to his life , but to account for all his quotations and allusions -- an ideal of thoroughness far superior to any that previous editors have set before themselves . ''

		We congratulate Mr.

		Twenty-five years ago on
this first day of May	DATE	was begun the publication of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	.

		Turning back to its first issue , the date
1880	DATE	has a strangely distant look ; but little else is changed .

		The heading is the same ; the original size of the paper has been adhered to , with an increase in the number of pages demanded by its growth ; and its general physical appearance is substantially as it was in the beginning , modified by inevitable changes in methods and standards of typog - raphy .

		Its bound volumes , of uniform height and nearly uniform thickness , standing in a long row on the library shelves , express the consistency and stability which from the first the publication has sought to establish and maintain .

		Such details as these are not matters of accident , nor are tiiey without significance .

		Fluctuations in a journal 's character and standards , a lack of fixed ideals and clearly - defined aims , the indecision and instability that lead to trying first one tack and then another in the hope of catching the winds of popular favor , are usually typified in capri - cious changes of external form .

		The Dial has chosen a very different course ; and no survey of its career would be at all discern - ing that did not take this feature into the account .

		Its effort has been to achieve dis - tinction through consistency and persistency ; to be itself , with its own standards and char - acter ; to have its ideals , and live up to them .

		Its aims and scope , the sort of journal it would try to be , the work it would set itself to do and the manner in which it would try to do it , were problems that were thought out in advance ; and the course then decided on was followed with as little deviation as pos - sible .

		Whatever of success and influence the paper has gained , and the fact that it is now able to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary , must be attributed largely to this cause .

		Obviously , those who set for themselves such tasks , -- to work for ideal aims , to limit wittingly their opportimities for material gain , and sacrifice immediate for ultimate success , -- must be prepared to travel a long and somewhat lonely road .

		Xo others , indeed .

		806 THE DIAL -LSB-

		But , fortunately for the stimulus to higher forms of endeavor , there are compensations peculiar to the case .

		The task , though difficult , may not be impos - sible ; and those who succeed in it are likely to find their triumph coming at last through the very causes that made it seem at first improbable or incredible .

		It is clear now to many , as it was in the beginning to but few , that had The Dial been less tenacious of its ideals , had it been willing to decline to lower levels and to narrower aims , its rea - sons for existence would have been defeated and its career self-annulled .

		Definiteness and singleness of purpose , a clear view of what was intended to be done and unwavering per - sistency in doing it , are factors largely to be credited with such success as the enterprise has achieved .

		The occasion is doubtless one for self-con - gratulation and rejoicing .

		Yet somehow it finds us not wholly in an exultant mood .

		Boasting is forbidden before one has taken his armor off , and he may then be too weary to care much for boasting .

		Those who have large issues have generally paid the price ; and leaders of forlorn hopes , in life as on the battle-field , are little prone to merry - making over their success .

		They are glad and proud to be successful : it is for this that they have staked and won .

		But taking a retrospective look , they think of other things , -- of what it all has cost ; of the ex - penditure of time and strength , the tale of years that have been taken from their own liv ^ to give life to that for which they strove .

		A quarter-century is a big portion of a man 's working life , particularly when it spans the period between thirty-five and sixty years ; and what one gets in return for it should be something worth the while .

		That it is well worth the while , there is no ques - tion in this case .

		But in looking back over the way that has been traversed , and counting up the cost , one thinks vividly of the toils and struggles , the anxieties and disappoint - ments , the tragedies unwitnessed and trials unrecorded , the menaces and perils , * gorgons and chimeras dire , ' unseen by all but him , that have beset the way .

		He thinks , too , of the many who were with him on the journey and are now no more .

		But the occasion lends itself also to a more cheerful tone .

		The heading of our article itself shows that we have much to be thank - ful for .

		Those who know something of the problems and history of journalism know how rarely success is won by periodicals that are precluded by the very terms of their being from making anything like a popular appeal .

		Earely do such become established ; more rarely still do they achieve a quarter-century of continuous publication .

		But infinitely rarer is it , -- so rare , indeed , that instances are but exceptions to the contrary rule , -- • that they remain all that time under the same control and guidance with which they began their career .

		The founder and editor of The Dial at the beginning is still its chief editor and director , and has been such throughout the quarter-century .

		Fortunate in this long - continued service , he has been fortimate also in the loyal cooperation of his associates , and in his staff of capable and often devoted contributors .

		While in the earlier years something like half the paper was written by the editor , in recent years the work has been done by writers scattered from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , following the specialization of knowledge and interests that is so distinctive a feature of our time .

		In entire sympathy with the ideals and motives of the journal , all have labored zealously with him to uphold its standard and enhance its interest and value .

		Another cause for satisfaction is that the paper has never missed an issue , and , as has already been pointed out , has never changed its general character and aims .

		The chief change that has taken place was in the increased frequency of issue , from monthly to semi-monthly , about midway of its career ; but this was a needed improve - ment and advance , which may be followed by others as occasion may require .

		It may not be amiss to point ont in this place the fact that at the present time The Dial is the only journal in
America	LOCATION	given up to the criticism of current literature ; it is also the only literary periodical in the country not owned or controlled by a book publishing house or a newspaper .

		If further grounds for felicitation were needed than those already cited , they might be found in a consideration of the opportunities for doing good possessed by an enlightened and independent organ of literary criticism in
America	LOCATION	.

		On this point , however , and on the service that The Dial has been able to render to this cause , we are content to let others speak for us .

		It would be interesting
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 if there were space , to speak of the advances in the book-publishing and book-reading worlds in the period covered by our hasty survey .

		Here , too , there is cause for satis - faction , since we are doubtless safe in saying that the demand for books of the better class has increased faster than the increase in population , denoting an advance in culture and civilization .

		Especially is this true of the great Middle Regions of the country , the regions making such tremendous strides in growth and influence .

		CJonsiderations like these show that it was no mistake that The Dial was located in the metropolis of this great and growing region , in which its in - fluence is doubtless more direct and forceful than if emanating from the seaboard .

		The example and inspiration of such a journal in a city so lately supposed to be given hopelessly to sordid standards and material aims is something also to be taken into the account .

		Dealing with literature in the largest sense , it is but natural that the literature of its own country should be its chief concern ; but local of course it should not and could not be .

		It is but simple justice to the American publishers to add that by none are The Dial 's work and influence more clearly comprehended than by them ; and not least among the reasons for gratula - tion on this occasion should be noted their intelligent appreciation and encouragement .

		We began with a note from the past : we end with a note for the future .

		One quarter - century of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	is ended .

		It begins another with a surer confidence and a soberer wisdom ; and though the old is tinged with sadness , the new is lit with cheerfulness and hope .

		A MISSING INDIAN NARRATIVE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		May I venture to add a word or two to Mr.
McPike	PERSON	's interesting letter on the subject of cooperation in bibliographical research , in The Dial for
April	DATE	IT I merely wish to cite an instance , from my own personal experience , of at least one direc - tion in which the suggested ` Miscellanea Curi - osa ' might be made of very great service to students and investigators in every department of human knowledge .

		In looking up material bearing upon the Mandans , to utilize in editing that portion of the Journals of LaVerendrye and his sons which covers their
Mandan	LOCATION	tour , I came uix > n a let - ter , quoted by
Schoolcraft	PERSON	in his ` Indian Tribes of the
United States	LOCATION	, ' etc. , Part in. , p. 253 .

		The letter is dated
January 28 , 1852	DATE	, and is from
D. D. Mitchell	PERSON	, at that time
United States	ORGANIZATION	Superintendent of Indian Affairs ; and the pass - age to which I particularly wish to refer is as follows : ' The early portion of their -LSB- the
Mandan	LOCATION	-RSB- history I gather from the narration of Mr.
Mackintosh	PERSON	, who it seems belonged to or was in some way connected with the
French Trading Company	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- he probably means the
North West Company	LOCATION	, many of whose employees were French -RSB- as far back as
1772	DATE	.

		According to his narration he set out from '
Montreal	LOCATION	in the
summer of 1773	DATE	, crossed over the country to the
Missouri	LOCATION	river , and arrived at one of the
Mandan	LOCATION	villages on
Christmas Day	DATE	.

		He gives a long and somewhat romantic description of the manner in which he was received and dwells at some length upon the greatness of the
Mandan	LOCATION	population , ' etc. , etc. .

		It seems clear from the above that Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	is not merely giving the substance of a conversation with the Mr.
Mackintosh	PERSON	referred to , but that he refers to a written narrative , either in print or in manuscript .

		I have searched high and low for this
Mack	PERSON	- intosh document , in the Canadian Archives at
Ottawa	LOCATION	, the
Parliamentary Library	ORGANIZATION	at the same place , the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution , and every other depositary that would be likely to contain such a narrative , and have enquired of men like Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	of
Madison	LOCATION	, Dr.
Bryce	PERSON	of
Winnipeg	LOCATION	, and
Ben	PERSON	- jamin Suite of
Ottawa	LOCATION	, who are recognized as authorities on early western exploration and the western tribes , but so far as I can learn the
Mackintosh	PERSON	document is not in any public library , nor does it seem to be known to those who would be most likely to have seen it .

		Here , it seems to me , is a case in point for the proposed ` Miscellanea Curiosa . '

		Someone , somewhere , must surely know something about
Mackintosh	PERSON	and his elusive narrative .

		While I cite this merely as an example of the probable usefulness of the periodical suggested by Mr.
McPike	PERSON	, I may add that I shall be exceedingly grateful for any information that can be afforded me by readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	as to the
Mackintosh	PERSON	narrative .

		A
FAMOUS Cornish Character	ORGANIZATION	.

		*
Eobert Stephen Hawker	PERSON	, for forty years vicar of Morwenstow in
Cornwall	LOCATION	, was emphat - ically a ^ character . '

		Mr ,
Baring-Gould	ORGANIZATION	's account of him has made Hawker a familiar figure to many readers , all the more so that in this lively biography the romancer often gets the better of the historian .

		Even in his third and revised edition the author -LRB- or perhaps his publisher -RRB- could not find it in his heart to suppress some of the good stories that had been proved to be untrue ; they were too character - istic to be spared .

		Mr.
Byles	PERSON	says of this work , ` As a character-sketch and a jest-book , it is clever and amusing , but as a biography it is not altogether satisfactory . '

		Dr.
F. G. Lee	PERSON	's life of Hawker , which appeared simultaneously with Mr.
Baring-Gould	PERSON	's , has never been popu - lar , as it confines itself almost wholly to mat - ters of religious controversy , being partly a defense of
Hawker	ORGANIZATION	's position and partly an attack on liberalism in the Church of
England	LOCATION	.

		Hence the need of a new , full , and authorita - tive account of this singular and interesting man .

		Of great events , as commonly understood , our vicar 's life has none to show .

		He was bom at
Plymouth	LOCATION	in
1803	DATE	, being the eldest son of a physician , who afterward entered the church , and grandson of a well-known Calvinist preacher .

		The youthful pranks of
Robert Hawker	PERSON	, his fertility in harmless practical jokes , and the various forms in which his excess of animal spirits found vent , would fill a book -- if it were not too large .

		But not to let the rollicking lad 's love of fun scandalize these decorous pages , we hasten on to his amazing marriage , in
1823	DATE	, when he was not yet twenty , to
Charlotte Elizabeth	LOCATION	I ` ans , a well-to-do spin - ster of more than twice his age .

		Hawker was at that time an Oxford student , and we have been told , wrongly it now appears , that his mar - riage was precipitated by his father 's announce - ment that the family exchequer could no longer meet the expense of the young man 's education .

		However that may be , the strangely assorted pair enjoyed many years of wedded happiness , until in the order of nature the senior partner 's place was left vacant , whereupon -LRB- but with no indecorous haste -RRB- the sexagenarian survivor sought consolation in the arms of a second wife , this time young enough to be his grand - daughter , with wh om the last eleven years of • The Life and Letters of
R. S. Hawker	PERSON	, sometime Vicar of Morwenstow .

		By his Son-in-Law ,
C. E. Byles	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		New York :
John Lane	PERSON	.

		his life appear to have passed no less pleasantly than the preceding forty .

		He died in
1875	DATE	, having held the living of Morwenstow a little over forty years .

		His first charge , the curacy of
North Tamerton	LOCATION	, covered only four years , and need not claim our notice further than to introduce an incident illustrating his unfailing readiness of resource from his very youth , and also his delightful unconventionality even in the pulpit .

		` One day a labourer at Tamerton came to Hawker in great trouble , saying that a sack of potatoes had been stolen from his garden , and would his Reverence kindly help him to discover the thief .

		It was
Sunday	DATE	, and they were on their way to morning service .

		`` Well , well , '' said
Hawker	PERSON	, `` we will see about it after Church . ''

		He was taking the sermon that day , and he preached on the eighth commandment .

		`` And now , '' he said , `` I have a sad tale to tell .

		One of our neighbors has missed a sack of potatoes from his garden , and the thief is even now sitting among you .

		He has a feather on his head ! ''

		A man in the congregation was observed surreptitiously to put his hand to his head , and so the guilt was brought home . '

		A word in passing as to those foregleams of the coming man that we discern in the young
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	student .

		To ' star-eyed science ' it does not appear that he devoted himself with any enthusiasm .

		Neither for the niceties of clas - sical scholarship nor for the rigors of higher mathematics do we read that he developed any taste .

		The Newdigate prize , however , was awarded him for a poem entitled '
Pompeii	LOCATION	, ' which a harsh critic has declared to be an imi - tation of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's prize poem on the same subject written at
Cambridge	LOCATION	eight years before .

		But Mr.
Byles	PERSON	makes a good defense against this charge .

		Conviviality , a fondness for giving champagne breakfasts , and a readi - ness to take the lead in any daring escapade , seem to have been young
Hawker	PERSON	's distinguish - ing qualities .

		The historian of Pembroke col - lege links his name with that of
Thomas Lovell Beddoes	PERSON	under the heading , ' Two Eccentric Poets , ' and mentions that some of his ' extra - ordinary letters ' are still preserved in the col - lege library .

		With something of contempt for book-learning , and with some truth too ,
Hawker	PERSON	writes in later life , ' A patient and persevering man is always more likely to prosper at the universities than one whose genius would shine in ordinary life . '

		Somewhat astonishing -LRB- or perhaps not astonishing , for nothing need sur - prise us in Hawker -RRB- is his opinion of
Addison	PERSON	's style . '

		It is one of the lamentable blotches on
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, ' he writes to a nephew about to enter
Pembroke	LOCATION	, ` that they select such a miserable composer of sentences as
Addison	PERSON	was for trans - lation -LSB- into Latin -RSB- .

		His parenthetic pages , sometimes never ended at all , are about the worst elements ever selected to form a clear

		THE DIAI .

		309 and simple style . '

		-LRB- Peace to the shades of that earlier and more famous
Pembroke	LOCATION	scholar whose contrary opinion has gained general acceptance . -RRB-

		It will be easily believed that the vicar of Morwenstow was an excellent story-teUer .

		Humor , imagination , and the power to keep his gravity of countenance when uttering the most astounding assertions , made him a source both of delight and of bewilderment to all his acquaintance .

		Indeed , as the author tells us , * this habit of hoaxing became so ingrained in his nature that perhaps , as he grew older , he was hardly able himself to distinguish between jest and earnest , fact and fancy , belief and simulated belief . '

		But this inability to draw a sharp boundary line between the real and the imaginary made him no whit less acceptable to children , who quickly recognized in him a delightful pla ^ Tnate , one who never failed to respond to that magical watehword of the nur - sery , * let 's pretend . '

		^ One pervading princi - ple of Holy Writ , ' he notes in his thought-diary , ' is fondness for little children 's weal . '

		That such a man , living in a remote maritime dis - trict famous for its superstitions , should have himself fallen a victim to superstition , espe - cially religious superstition , is not surprising .

		In a letter to his brother
Claud	PERSON	he gravely describes a storm that had threatened to destroy his wheat , until he stilled the tempest by erect - ing two wooden crosses , one of them inscribed , Imperat ventis , and the other .

		Dixit mari ,
Tace	ORGANIZATION	. '

		They were fixed and consecrated , ' he says , ' by six o'clock in the
evening	TIME	, amidst so fierce a gale that the carpenter could hardly hear the service on the cliff .

		But the Prince of the
Air	ORGANIZATION	heard it and obeyed . '

		-LRB- In this and subsequent quotations the good vicars prodigal use of cap - itals is left to be imagined . -RRB-

		His diary con - tains the following , under the heading ' Ghosts ' : ` We know that demons are loose .

		`` We are told that the messengers of Satan are volatile , and fiU the air .

		We read that angels glide to and fro .

		Why may not the souls of our beloved traverse the air on the errands of their lovef StiU another passage , whether from diary or letter is not made clear , describes the hair-rais - ing experience the vicar had with a ghost in the course of a drive one bright
summer	DATE	day .

		Pale with fright , the holy man luckily be - thought him to make the sign of the cross , at which the spectre fled . '

		It was , ' he concludes , * a kind of nameless and indefinable sensation , rather than the sight , that assured me it was preternatural : at least , so I thought and think . '

		One little circumstance may serve to explain this pronounced propensity for horrors and marvels .

		Hawker was an opium-eater .

		He took the drug first as a medicine -- thev all do -- and afterward from habit .

		His biographer inclines to think that much of his beet poetry was written under the influence of opium .

		But the inevitable reaction followed in moods of irritability and deep depression .

		like De Quincey , he broke himself of the habit in later life , but resumed it some years before his death .

		Among the more admirable qualities of this richly endowed nature was a warm love for ani - mals .

		Over them he exerted something of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's influence .

		To the birds especially he was a friend and benefactor .

		A paragraph from his diary illustrates this in a way that is both touching and amusing . '

		Beans and peas / he writes , * are interdicted by the jackdaws .

		We have sown twice , and twice they have devoured them all .

		And a scarecrow , put up by my old man , was so made up in my hat and broken cassock that they took it for me , and came around it looking up to be fed . '

		Cats and dogs abounded in his house , and even followed him to church , where they behaved with great propriety .

		His horses obeyed his voice without help of whip or rein .

		All animals he believed to be immortal .

		Dwelling on the coast and seeing much of shipwreck , both accidental and * assisted , ' Hawker naturally reverts to the theme in many of his letters .

		A characteristic passage may be quoted .

		The date is
December , 1859	DATE	.

		` Since
1843	DATE	I have taken up from the rocks and buried 27 .

		But to me the great comfort is that the souls of all these men are grateful to me for the respectful interment of their bodies , and that all they are permitted to do for me they fulfil .

		That they have brought me tokens of good will I am persuaded .

		Do you know , I was surprised to hear you doubt that the dead know what we do .

		I thought the Scripture clear about this .

		Besides , how otherwise can we account for the appearance of spirits for especial purposes to the living !

		And that they do so appear everybody in every nation under heaven believes . '

		Let us not begrudge our poet-parson whatever happiness he found in his primitive beliefs .

		The best thing in Mr.
Byles	PERSON	's book is Hawk - ers account of a visit he received from
Tenny	PERSON	- son .

		The poet came unannounced and unrec - ognized in the month of
June , 1848	DATE	, roaming over
Cornwall	LOCATION	in quest of material for his ' Idylls of the King . '

		It was a lucky chance , or a wise design , that brought him to the vicar 's door ; for no one was more in love with or bet - ter versed in the Arthurian legends than Hawker .

		The meeting of the two poets has been already very briefly told by one of them ; the subjoined is a part of the other 's fuller account : * I found my guest at his entrance a tall , swarthy Spanish-looking man , with an eye like a sword .

		He sate down and we conversed .

		I at once found myself with no common mind .

		All poetry in par - ticular he seemed to use like household words , and m THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, as chance led to the mention of
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's picture of night -LSB-
Iliad	LOCATION	, viii. , 557-559 -RSB- he gave at once a ren - det-ing simple and fine : `` When the sky is broken u | > and the myriad stars roll down , and the shep - herd 's heart is glad . ''

		It struck me that the trite translation was about the reverse motion of this .

		`` We talked then about
Cornwall	LOCATION	and
King Arthur	PERSON	, ii ^ y themes , and I quoted
Tennyson	PERSON	's fine account of the restoration of Excalibur to the lake .

		Just then he said , `` How can you live here thus alone ?

		You do n't seem to have any fit companions around you . ''

		My answer was another verse , from ^ ^ JjQcksley Hall '' -- ■ '' ' I to herd with narrow foreheads vacant ot our ' • ' !!

		, glorious gains , f.l 1 Like a beast vrith lower pleasures , like a beast with lower pains ! '' ''

		Why , that man , '' said he , `` seems to be your favourite author . ''

		`` Not mine only , but Eng - land 's , '' answered I. ... I proposed to show my unknown friend the shore .

		But before we left the room he said , `` Do you know my name ? ''

		I said , `` No , I have not even a guess . ''

		`` Do you ^ sh to know it ? ''

		`` I don ' t much care -- * that Which we call a rose , ' '' etc. `` Well , then , '' said he , `` my name is Tennysonl ! ''

		... So we grasped hands , and `` the shepherd 's heart was glad . ''

		We went on our way to the rocks , and if the converse could all be written down it would make , I think , as nice a little book as
Charlotte Elizabeth	LOCATION	-LSB- Mrs.
Hawker	PERSON	-RSB- could herself have composed .

		All verses - -- all lands -- the secret history of many of his poems , which I may not reveal -- ^ but that which I can lawfully relate I will . '

		. '

		T ' And with this fillip to his appetite the reader of this review is referred to the book itself for the remainder of a memorable interview .

		From
Hawker	PERSON	's own pen much might be quoted to complete this brief sketch of the man .

		Among .

		minor peculiaritiess was his abhorrence of a bearded clergy . '

		Nothing / he maintains , * can mar a man 's character like that one thing , a beard .

		By one of the councils which are named in our Articles , and which all the clergy at least have vowed to obey , beards are forbidden to be worn by the clergy at all .

		So that every clergyman who wears one is a rebel against the authorities of the church -- lowers himself to the level of a lay-person and degrades his sacred office . '

		Thus even Hawker 's freedom from most forms and conventions was balanced by an almost superstitious observance of others .

		It can be truly said of him that he never took the impress of what he himself called ` the smoothing-iron of the nineteelith century / but , again to use his own words as applied to the
Cornish	PERSON	clergy of an earlier gen - eration , ' became developed about middle life into an original mind and man , sole and abso - lute within his parish boundaries , eccentric when compared with his brethren in civilized regions , and yet , in German phrase , `` a whole and seldom man '' in his dominion of souls . '

		Hawker the poet , the ballad-writer , is far less familiar ' to the world than Hawker the vicar of MotwenstdW .

		Longfellow held his verses in high esteem and included i a number of his bal - lads in his ' Poems of Places . '

		His biographer might well have reprinted the famous but now obsolescent
Trelawny	LOCATION	ballad , which can soon boast an antiquity of fourscore years , having first appeared , anonymously , in ` The
Royal Davenport Telegraph	ORGANIZATION	and
Plymouth	LOCATION	Chronicle ' of
Sept. 2 , 1826	DATE	.

		Among those who took the piece for a genuine antique were Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	and
Lord Macaulay	LOCATION	, and Hawker seems to have had some difficulty afterward in con - vincing the public that the refrain and only the refrain was ancient , and that he was respon - sible for the rest .

		And so , with the author , we take leave of a ' unique and winning personality , strong enough to disregard convention , and free to develop in solitude a peculiar charm .

		In the retrospect of those long years of Morwenstow , we remember chiefly his charity to the poor , his care for the shipwrecked , his hospitality to friend and stranger , his tenderness to all living creatures , his whole-hearted devotion to wife and child and home .

		Such is the abiding mem - ory of Eobert
Stephen Hawker	PERSON	. '

		* !

		N'one of the arts has been more copiously and , it may be added , detrimentally endowed with reference helps than music .

		Detri - mentally , because its dictionaries and lexicons , as well as its biographies , in many instances , abound in errors , and the despair of the situa - tion is that once these errors appear in a given lexicon nearly every subsequent lexicographer incorporates errors and all into his own work , without once stopping to investigate or verify .

		There has been little original source-work done in musical dictionaries for fifty years past , except by
Fetis	PERSON	,
Mendel	PERSON	, and Riemann .

		Nearly everything has been second hand , and plagiar - isms have been particularly audacious .

		The musical student , unless he is an expert , has been misled by inaccuracies and exasperated by omis - sions in his reference books .

		When Sir
George Grove	PERSON	's ' Dictionary of Music and
Musiciaiis	PERSON	' appeared in
1878	DATE	it met a hearty Welcome everywhere .

		Its need was recognized , for the dictionaries above mentioned were growing antiquated , and , besides this , it was the first dictionary in the English language that made any pretensions to breadth of scope , comprehensiveness of treatment , or accuracy of •

		THE DIAL , 311 statement .

		Nearly all the other works of the kind were either imperfect or in some manner untrustworthy .

		Sir
George Grove	PERSON	himself had accomplished so much in the way of original research , had made so many important musical discoveries , and was such a well-trained and thoroughly equipped musical scholar that it was hoped a dictionary had at last appeared which would answer the needs of those not ters6d in foreign languages .

		As far as the work went , this expectation was gratified .

		Some of its biographies , especially those of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, and
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	, are masterpieces .

		Its technical contributions are searching and quite exhaustive , and its histori - cal matter as a rule accurate and reliable .

		But although the two volumes originally announced grew into four , numerous omissions were dis - covered when consultation began .

		An appendix was added to supply these omissions , but even then they were numerous and -LRB- as a further illustration of the doctrine of the total deprav - ity of inanimate things -RRB- of course it was just the particular thing that was particularly wanted which was not in its pages .

		The American student was also greatly disappoint - ed , because scarcely an allusion was made to any American topic .

		These defects , however , were compensated for by the excellence of the dietionarj - ^ s general content , and for many years it has proved of such value that it has come to take the place of the German works .

		N `` or have the recent reference works of
Elson	ORGANIZATION	,
Champlin	LOCATION	, and
Baker	PERSON	-LRB- the latter a very import - ant and handy guide in all matters Ainerican -RRB- affected its popularity in this country , notwith - standing its failure to recognize American sub - jects , which have been growing steadily in dig - nity and importance .

		It is now more than a quarter of a century since the first instalment of Sir
Greorge Grove	PERSON	's work appeared .

		The time has come , therefore , for a new edition , for large numbers of new lights have appeared in the musical world , many subjects in the old dictionary require amplification , and science has pushed its researches so far that much new matter has been brought to the surface , requiring state - ment .

		Mr.
Grove	PERSON	was engaged upon tiie pre - liminaries of such an edition when death over - took him in his labors and the work had to be entrusted to another hand .

		The publishers made no mistake when they selected Mr.
J. A. Fuller Maitland	PERSON	for the editorial task .

		He has been musical critic for ' The Thunderer , ' assisted Sir
George Grove	PERSON	in the original preparation of the Dictionary , has written some important works in musical biog - raphy , edited several , and translated that mon - umental work ,
Spitta	ORGANIZATION	's ' Life of

		He has brought to his task musical scholarship , attain - ments in languages , journalistic experience , and love of research .

		The first instalment of his painstaking and scholarly labor has now appeared , and it deserves to be called not mere - ly a revision of the
Grove Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	but the beginning of a new dictionary ; for while it fol - lows the general plan of the old one , and con - tains much of the old matter , yet even the old matter has been most carefully edited and arranged mOre systematically .

		Unimportant items have been omitted , and some errors cor - rected .

		The longer biographies , especially those of
Bach	PERSON	and Beethoven , have been enriched and their compositions have been tab - ulated with all the care which
Kochel	PERSON	or Notte - bohm display in their theme catalogues .

		The general change may be inferred from the fact that the first volume of the old edition contains 768 pages , closing at the middle of the letter * I , ' while the first volume of the new edition has 800 pages and only reaches the close of ' E. ' The cause of this difference is sufficiently apparent .

		Intending to have but two volumes , half of the alphabet was put in the first , and this explains its scantiness of material and the disproportion between the first and the remain - ing three volumes .

		It was a serious error , but it has been rectified and the proper balance effected by the inclusion of 417 new topics , besides brief mention of authorship and first performances of all important operas , which Mr.
Grove	PERSON	almost entirely overlooked , although they are of great value as references .

		The new articles of leading importance are on ' Acoustics , ' with many diagrams , * Auto - matic Appliances , ' * Baireuth , ' ' Chester Music Festivals , ' ' Coronach , ' * Conducting , ' profusely illustrated , ' Concert Institutions in
Paris	LOCATION	, ' ' Concert Stiick , ' * Dance Music , ' '

		Of these thirty-six names , fully one-half should have been in the first edition , which of itself shows its serious omissions .

		Besides this , the inadequateness of treatment displayed in such biographical sketches as those of
Bach	LOCATION	,
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	,
Brahms	PERSON	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, and a few others has been remedied by fuller historical detail and critical analysis , which gives the reader a clearer idea of the style and character - istics of the composer .

		It is surprising , how - 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ever , that the editor should have retained the error in the life of
Sebastian Bach	PERSON	that attrib - utes the ' Lucas Passion ' to that composer .

		It should be within the recollection of all
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean music scholars that when the
Spitta	PERSON	' Life of
Bach	PERSON	' appeared , our own
Bernhard Ziehn	PERSON	, whose musical scholarship and critical faculty are even better known in
Germany	LOCATION	than here , proved beyond dispute that the '
Lucas	PERSON	Pas - sion ' was not written by
Sebastian Bach	PERSON	and thus prevented the inclusion of a spurious com - position in the
Bach	LOCATION	G ^ sellschaft 's famous edi - tion -- a feat in critical analysis that was per - sonally acknowledged by
Robert Franz	PERSON	, one of the most learned of the
Bach	LOCATION	students .

		It is to be hoped before the editor gets to the letter * Z ' he will have heard of this profound musical theorist , and in connection with his biography correct the error .

		It will be a grateful announcement that the new edition contains many and valuable refer - ences to American musicians , -- and this for the first time in any European musical dictionary .

		All of these American topics are treated in the main with the comprehensiveness and accu - racy due to the subjects .

		It is to be regretted that the name of Billings , the father of Amer - ican psalmody and the first in the line of American composers , should have been over - looked .

		The history of this sturdy American , whose anthems were as inspiring to the revolu - tionary camps as were the
Bach Chorales	LOCATION	at

New England	LOCATION	churches from that English compen - dium , the
Bay State Psalm Book	ORGANIZATION	, and other works sent over from
England	LOCATION	for the spiritual edification of the colonists , deserved a place in sucli a dictionary as this .

		As ; a rule these topics are characterized by praiseworthy accuracy , but we must disagree utterly with the writer of the brief sketch of
Carl Bergmann	PERSON	in his statement that '
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	's tastes and talents were largely devel - oped under
Bergmann	PERSON	's influence . '

		This is grossly incorrect , as shown in the memorials of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	just published .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	was first closely associated with Mr.
Bergmann	PERSON	as first violinist in the Mason-Bergmann cham - ber concerts , inaugurated in
New York City	LOCATION	in
1855	DATE	, -- an event by the way which the writer of the sketch entirely ignores .

		From the very beginning , Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	, as Mr.
Mason	PERSON	, Mr.
Mosenthal	PERSON	, and Mr.
Matzka	PERSON	, the other mem - bers , acknowledge , was the master spirit of that organization .

		He dictated its general policy , its programmes , its interpretation , and its man - ner of performance .

		Out of personal regard for
Bergmann	PERSON	, Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	is very careful in his statements , but those on the inside know that
Bergmann	PERSON	was jealous of him and had lit - tle sympathy with his musical radicalism , and that the friction at last was so strong he with - drew in a short time and the organization be - came the Mason-Thomas instead of the
Mason	PERSON	-
Bergmann	PERSON	, but not until Mr.
Bergmann	PERSON	once confessed to him , ' you have lifted the veil from our eyes . '

		Neither Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's tastes nor his talents were developed under
Bergmann	PERSON	's in - fluence .

		Both were manifest before the men came together .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	announced his tastes publicly when he formed his first orches - tra in

		The salient features of the first volume of the new dictionary have now been sufficiently set forth , and assuming that the remaining foui volumes will represent the same standard of musical scholarship and will contain similar results of careful and accurate labor , it will not be premature to announce -- and this , too , with - out any disrespect to the memory of Sir
George Grove	PERSON	as a scholar -- that at last we have an English musical dictionary not only worthy to be compared with the French and German dictionaries but surpassing them all in the lateness of its information and in its compre - hensive scope .

		To all intents and purposes , Mr.
Fuller Maitland	PERSON	and his associates have given us a new ' Dictionary of Music and Musicians . '

		Its scope has been greatly enlarged , as will be seen by the following statement in the preface : * TJpon the first edition a limit of time was imposed , the date
1450	DATE	being fixed as the begin - ning of the music that could be expected to interest modem readers .

		The study of ancient music , and in particular of that which belongs to ecclesiastical plainsong , has been so widely spread -LRB- partly as a result of the scientific arti - cles written by the late
W. S. Rockstro	PERSON	in the latter part of the Dictionary -RRB- that no book on music could now be considered complete which made its starting-point as late as the middle of the loth century . '

		It is not alone in the enlargement of its scope that this Dictionary has been improved .

		By amplification and more adequate treatment of leading topics , exact statement , supplying of omissions , critical analyses , correct arrangement of compositions under opus numbers , absolutely new articles which should have been included in the old edi - tion , and the recognition of the new material that has been supplied during the last twenty - five years , the editor has given the world for the first time a reliable and comprehensive Diction - ary of Music in English , and has constructed an enduring monument to his musical scholar - ship .

		In its typography and general arrangement the book is entirelv satisfactorv .

		but some of the portraits are unworthy of the general high standard .

		They look like half-tones reproduced from half-tones , which are never satisfactory .

		The frontispiece , a portrait of
Beethoven	LOCATION	, is open to this criticism , and besides is not as characteristic or as faithful a likeness as might have been selected .

		The chalk drawing by von Kioeber , or the pen sketch by Lyser , would have been more desirable than the meaningless and spiritless one that has been used .

		Few great men have suffered more at the hands of artists than
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

George r. Lptox	PERSON	.

		The Story of a Great Monopoly .

		* The importance of the Standard Oil Com - pany is due not so much to its own history as to the fact that the profits made through it , the methods created by it , and the men elevated on account of it have found their way into other industries in which the experience of the older organization has been used to create new concerns .

		Thus there has come into existence what might be called a net-work of Standard Oil influences which touch many industries , many interests , and many communities .

		The numerous statements and facts concerning this remarkable company , together with the exist - ence of documents illustrating its entire his - tory , have led
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	, under the stimulus of magazine direction , to undertake the present * History of the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ In the prospectus to the work issued by the publishers the public is informed that this his - tory is not controversial and therefore inspir - ing ; it is not written to prove a preconceived theorj - ; it is a legitimate study of a thirty years ' industrial warfare based on documents ; and the interpretations of the documents are in the light of an intimate knowledge of the oil industry and of the men engaged in it .

		As though to impress the reader still further with the scientific value of the book , another sentence is added to the effect that ` every statement , ever -RCB- - interpretation of fact , every important step , is backed by documentary evidence , ' This sets a high standard , which if attained would place the book in the position of an authority for all time upon its subject .

		In the gathering of material for a work of this kind four courses may be followed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the interviewing of persons contemporaneous with the times ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the study of public opinion as voiced in public prints , such as newspapers and pamphlets ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the perusal of contracts , • The History of thb

May 1	DATE	, price-lists ^ legal cases , and printed documents ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the study of reports of legislative bodies , testimony and exhibits of witnesses before investigating commissions .

		Miss TarbelFs book gives evidence of an examination of the mate - rial that would be brought to light by following these methods , although her failure to cite authorities in foot-note references makes it almost impossible at points to verify some of the most important statements made in the book .

		In the interpretation of this material the author has undoubtedly been influenced by her long association with the people of the * Oil
Eegions	PERSON	' and the sharing of the feeling there prevailing against the common enemy , the * Standard . '

		Despite the statement of the pub - lishers to the contrary , a thesis is to be found running through the book ; this , however , does not in the least vitiate its value .

		This thesis may be stated in the following way : The oil industry in its early stages * had workers in great numbers with plenty of capital , who were pieeting every difficulty and overcoming them , ' which promised ` the normal unfolding of a new and wonderful opportunity for individual endeavor . '

		This natural development was pre - vented by the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	, which was able by its methods to secure a monopoly and take away this grand opportunity from individual enterprise .

		In the chapter on ' The Birth of an Industry ' the thesis is almost unconsciously continued in these words : ' But what had been done was , in their judgment only the beginning ... They would meet their own needs .

		They would bring the oil refining to the region where it belonged .

		They would make their towns the most beautiful in the world .

		There was nothing too good for them , nothing they did not hope and dare .

		But sud - denly , at the very hey day of this confidence , a big hand reached out to trottle their future . '

		The rise of the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	took place simultaneously with the competition of three ' railroads for the oil traflBc and three cit - ies for the business of refining .

		In this com - petition , rebates and discriminations were the outcome , as they were bound to be in unre - stricted industrial conflict .

		It was what each railroad expected of the others , and what each city expected to fight .

		We are told that by
1871	DATE	every refiner suspected that his neighbor was getting better rates than he ; moreover , the refiniij ^ business seemed to be overdone .

		Out of sucn chaotic conditions the South Improve - jnent Company was bom , and though the strug - gle , against it was successful nevertheless an unseen hand drew the bonds tighter about the oil business by shutting off oil , cutting down the supply of cars , and taking over customers .

		The plan proposed by the South Improvement Company was in effect what has been done a hundred times in other ways since that day .

		No more recent example need be cited than the cattle trust .

		Secretly the promoters of the
South Improvement Company	ORGANIZATION	made contracts with the railroads ; by a mistake the plot was discovered , and thereupon began what Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	calls ' the Oil War of
1872	DATE	. '

		The alarm and indignation of the oil producers can only be imagined ; through this feeling an organiza - tion was created that fought successfully the South Improvement Company .

		The result was the abandonment of the frames , but not the annihilation of the framers , of this remarkable movement .

		The rebate system , however , had been tested ; it could be used at another time .

		The fight against the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	, thus begun in its effort to control transporta - tion , has continued at different intervals for the same reason .

		So far as economic grounds are concerned the contention as to whether the shipper of large tonnage shall be granted a lower rate than the prevailing one for concen - trated traffic remains unsettled .

		It took no great argument to persuade the railroads of the soundness of this position , and even to go fur - ther in the payment of rebates on shipments made by other concerns .

		Although the oil pro- ducers and independent refiners were able to break up the
South Improvement Company	ORGANIZATION	, nevertheless its successor , the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	, controlled the business of refining oil by
1875	DATE	.

		Even after the result just referred to , the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	had three great prob - lems to solve : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the regulation of crude production ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the control of pipe lines and transportation facilities ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a final form of organization that would escape the criticism of the law .

		The machinery of the company 's organiza - tion was thoroughly tested by the efforts of the producers to raise the low prices of crude oil a * compared with refined .

		To do this the pro- ducers looked to the creation of a pipe line to the sea-board and sale of export oil , and the regulation of interstate commerce by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both of these projects were for the time defeat - ed , and the discovery of new oil fields made the task of keeping the price of crude oil at a low point an easy matter .

		There was , however , an appeal to the law still open to the producers .

		In
1879	DATE	a suit was brought against the officers of the
Standard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though vigorously prose - cuted for a time , delay of the proceedings in
1880	DATE	brought out strongly the power of the Standard to manage recalcitrant officers and bitter opponents , and to win a result known a ^ the ' Compromise of
1880	DATE	. '

		This may be regarded as a victory for the company for the

		315 reason that the great hopes of the oil producers were in no respect realized .

		One opening still remained to the producers .

		To take advantage of it they must build a pipe line to the seaboard .

		Under the able manage - ment of Messrs.
Benson	PERSON	,
McKelvey	PERSON	, and Hop - kins , a pipe line was completed in
1881	DATE	.

		Thus the Standard was brought face to face with its second great problem .

		After a period of two years the
Standard	ORGANIZATION	, by successful maneuvering , secured an agreement with the
Tidewater Pipe Line	ORGANIZATION	, and was able to control the transportation of oil by this means as well as by rail .

		By
1887	DATE	the
Standard	ORGANIZATION	had reached tihe highest efficiency , and wished to be let alone ; but a rapid series of events brought greater attention to its meth - ods than ever before .

		The
Buffalo	LOCATION	case , the Rice contest and the Pa -RCB- Tie imbroglio , together with the defeat of the oil men 's bill in the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	legislature , stirred the country tremendously .

		Demands for investigation and requests for knowledge about the mysterious power came thick and fast from all parts of the land .

		As a result there followed the
New York	LOCATION	and Congressional investigations , the suit of the
State of Ohio	ORGANIZATION	against the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	and its dissolution on paper .

		Through the leniency of the courts the situation did not differ materially from what it was before the dissolving order of the courts .

		It remained for another Attorney General of
the State of Ohio	ORGANIZATION	, Hon.
Frank S. Mannett	PERSON	, to com - plete the dissolution , forcing the company to meet its third problem , that of law-proof organ - ization , and to create a great holding company , the
Standard Oil Company of Xew Jersey	ORGANIZATION	.

		During this legal contest the producers made another attempt to secure their freedom , but the Standard now entered the oil fields as an oil producer , carrying consternation into the ranks of the producers .

		The one escape open to the independents , as before , was an outlet to the sea .

		After many difficulties and great vicissi - tudes the
United States	LOCATION	Pipe Line was built ; and in time an organization of independent oil refiners , despite the most hostile opposition , was created in what was called the Pure Oil Com - pany .

		It is through the organization of these companies that competition exists in the field of oil production .

		It was , however , a result profoundly different from that hoped for by the pioneers in the oil business .

		In looking back over the history of the Stand - ard Oil Company one is impressed with the shrewdness of the men behind it , the real great - ness of the company , its economies and admir - able methods of handling business .

		But against this are to be contrasted the espionage of the business of competitors , the manipulation of Ifigiglatures , the determination of rates , the securing of rebates , and the harassing of com - petitors .

		The
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	would have been in any event a great company , but the methods used in forestalling competitioii have made it a monopoly . '' '

		It is of relatively little importance whethef every statement made in Miss TarbelFs book is absolutely true .

		The real question is as to whether or not she has pictured the history of the
Standard Oil Company	ORGANIZATION	in its true light , and has presented correctly the methods practiced by this organization and its agents .

		In tiie judgment of the reviewer , the author has accomplished both of these tasks in so just , clear , and attracti/e a manner as to entitle her to the thanks of every American citizen .

		Tlie book is a genuine contribution to that knowl - edge of the real inwardness of things industrial which Americans as a people so lack .

		The
Sotjtherxeb	ORGANIZATION	's Problem .

		* Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	has collected , in a book of some three hundred pages , certain articles recently contributed by him to '
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine , ' in answer to the uumi - swerable argument of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, together with several earlier essays of his on the race problem .

		The result is a book the central interest of which is psychological rather than scientific , -- that is , it presents the brief for the South , of a Southerner of distinction , who while not a friend of the Negro race is certainly not to be counted an enemy .

		A careful dissection of the book reveals some interesting evidences of growth and feeling .

		The first essay chronologically is Chapter VII. , written some fifteen years ago and published first in another volume .

		This essay is brought down to date by Chapter II. , with some repeti - tion .

		Similarly Chapters VI .

		and I. elaborate Mr.
Page	PERSON	's only real contribution to the race problem in the years of his writing and observa - tion , -- viz. , his account of the training and con - dition of the house servant on the best
Virginia	LOCATION	plantations .

		Two chapters are given to special pleas on the subjects of lynching and disfran - chisement , and a hastily constructed and inac - curate chapter deals with the present condition of the Negro .

		316 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, on the other for its singular agreement with all that the Negroes themselves and their friends have ever demanded .

		Mr. Page begins by asserting that * no man can entirely dissociate himself from the condi - tions amid which he grew up , or free himself from the influences which surrounded him in his youth .

		The most he can do is to strive earnestly for an open and enlarged mind and try to look at everything from the highest and soundest standpoint he can reach . '

		Throughout most of the book there is evidently a sincere effort to keep this judicial attitude , but this is seriously marred by careless statements of fact and particularly by Mr.
Page	PERSON	's large reliance on the authority of
William Hannibal Thomas	PERSON	, and his approval of the monstrous assertions of Thomas 's book .

		For instance , to assert that ` murder might easily have been done ' in the
Boston	LOCATION	' riot ' of some years since is an unfor - tunate exaggeration ; the story of
Sam Hose	PERSON	is not at all in accordance with the published facts , since many honest men do not believe he was guilty of any crime but that of murder .

		Then , too , the character of Thomas and the unreliability of his book have been too often exposed to permit of this being made the basis of reiterated slander upon the
American Negro	ORGANIZATION	.

		The brief for the South as held by Mr.
Page	PERSON	is made up of the following points : 1 , That Slavery gave the Negro excellent training ; 2 , That the mistakes of Reconstruction alienated master and freedman ; 3 , That the freedmen 's sons and the sons of the masters are growing further and further apart ; 4 , That the Negrc is capable of some but limited improvement ; 5 , That by education he should be given a chance to improve .

		To one like Mr.
Page	PERSON	, whose youthful dreams centered on a
Virginia	LOCATION	plantation of the better sort , amid trained family servants and the old lazy prosperity of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	gentleman of the kindlier regime , it seems a monstrous thing to condemn slavery as an inhuman and cruel system .

		It was not this , Mr.
Page	PERSON	again and again declares ; rather it was ` a. relation of warm friendship and tender sympathy ' -LRB- p. 166 -RRB- , ` the `` driver '' of slave-horror novels was as purely the creature of the imagination as
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	, or the Chimera ' -LRB- p. 167 -RRB- , often ` the affection of the slaves was stronger toward the whites than toward their own off-spring ' -LRB- p. 174 -RRB- , and the slaves had in many instances ' the education which comes from daily association with people of culture . '

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	was only eight years old when the war broke out , and so he knows slavery largely by tradition .

		Never - theless , believing the tradition true , Mr. Page resents slurs on slavery , and he has in his contention just enough of right to make it next to impossible for him to realize his error .

		It is as inaccurate to call
Southern	ORGANIZATION	slavery bar - barous as it is to call the modem wage system ideal ; but it is not inaccurate to say that
Southern	ORGANIZATION	slavery fostered barbarism , was itself barbaric in thousands of instances , and was on the whole a system of labor so blighting tc white and black that probably the only thing that saved Mr.
Page	PERSON	's genius to the world was the Emancipation Proclamation , -- the very deed that allows the present reviewer the pleasure of criticising Mr.
Page	PERSON	's book instead of hoeing his cotton .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	is dean of that school of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	writers which has in recent years pictured the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	planter as a sort of demigod .

		The world has accepted this por - traiture in good-humored silence , recognizing it as a generous tribute of the New to the Old South ; nevertheless , it is perfectly clear that the Southern gentleman of yesterday was an ordinary human being , kindly , indolent , chol - eric , and self-indulgent , neither better nor worse than the ordinary run of men .

		It is inconceivable that a laboring class placed under the complete dominion of such a man should prosper ; and with all the instances of kindness and affection -LRB- and there were hundreds of such instances -RRB- the net result of any such system was , and was bound to be , oppression , cruelty , concubinage , and moral retrogression .

		That this was the result in the South , one can read even in the dry reports of the
United States Census	ORGANIZATION	.

		How far it was possible in the days of recon - struction to have acted more wisely than the nation did will always be a mooted question .

		Men like Mr.
Page	PERSON	, however , forget that in
1864	DATE	practically every Southerner was convinced that free Negro labor was impossible , and was determined to keep the substance of slavery even if he had to surrender the name .

		Under such circumstances there were but two ways open : either to establish government guardian - ship over the Negroes ; or , by making them full citizens at once , to let them guard their own rights .

		The first would have been the wiser course , but the South frustrated it .

		The South attacked not simply the working of the Freed - men 's Bureau but its basic principle .

		When that
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	fell , what was left but enfran - chisement ?

		Only slavery , and war had just made slavery impossible .

		That estrangement should follow between ex - master and freedman was inevitable .

		Who should be blamed for it , -- the intelligent mas - ter or the ignorant man ?

		Surely to base the
Ku Klux Klan	PERSON	on the
Union League of Negroes	ORGANIZATION	, as Mr. Page virtually does , is as ungenerous as it is unhistorical .

		It was inevi - table that for one or two generations after

		And the fault of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	whites has been that they have sought to increase this feeling by exploiting it in political and social life , placing personal and public humiliations on black people , em - phasizing , publishing , and gloating over every mistake and foible of a struggling people , and hindering their progress in many directions by law and custom .

		that the crucial points of ^ Mr.
Page	PERSON	's attitude are evident .

		This chapter seeks to prove that no great amount of development can be expected of black people .

		The sincere belief in this has quite evidently preceded the massing of the facts , so that any fair student would simply say that the case was ' not proven . '

		The negative testimony of
Africa	LOCATION	and
Hayti	LOCATION	, with all its weight , is inconclusive .

		His earlier argument that no Negroes of ability had ap - peared in
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Page	PERSON	has had to modify even in the short space of fifteen years ' experience , and the present argument that ' exceptional N'egroes but prove the rule of infe - riority ' sounds like a retiring to inner lines of fortification .

		Then , too , there may well be considerable difference of opinion as to whether or not the accumulation of two hundred and
thirty millions of dollars	MONEY	in farms in one gen - eration is a sign of Negro thrift ; Mr.
Page	PERSON	thinks it is not , and hastens to the more con - genial subject of crime , where the testimony is more vague and mystifying .

		Tlie trouble with this whole argument is that an assumption of the unchangeable inferiority of a race of men inevitably leads to actions that hinder their development .

		If these Negroes can not become ordinary civilized human beings , why waste time offering them opportunities ?

		This is the inevitable conclusion of such phi - losophy , and although Mr.
Page	PERSON	stops half way and insists on education and opportunity for blacks , makes the excellent suggestion of black police , and defends an intelligent black vote , yet the mass of his compatriots in the South sweep on far beyond him and act on the phi - losophy that Professor
William Benjamin Smith	PERSON	has recentlv published in his volume entitled ` The Color Line . '

		^ Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's book is a naked , unashamed shriek for the survival of the white race by means of the annihilation of all other races .

		He says bluntly : ` Compared with the vital matter of pure Blood , all other matters , as of tariff , of currency , of sub - sidies , of civil service , of labour and capital , of education , of forestry , of science and art , and even of religion , sink into insignificance .

		For , to judge by the past , there is scarcely any conceivable edu - cational or scientific or governmental or social or religious polity under which the pure strain of Cau - casian blood might not live and thrive and achieve great things for History and Humanity ; on the other hand there is no reason to believe that any kind or degree of institutional excellence could per - manently stay the race decadence that would follow surely in the wake of any considerable contamina - tion of that blood by the blood of
Africa	LOCATION	' -LRB- p. IX . -RRB-

		.

		Moreover , the author does not stop there .

		If ` contamination ' is to be avoided , whites and Negroes must not live in the same land , nor eventually upon the same earth .

		Not even indi - vidual exceptions can save the lower race from this judgment .

		` Does some one reply that some Negroes are bet - ter than some Whites , physically , mentally , mor - ally !

		We do not deny it ; but this fact , again , is without pertinence .

		It may very well be that some dogs are superior to some men ' -LRB- p. 15 -RRB- .

		Nor is the Negro race alone condemned ; the Chinese must go , the Japanese are questionable , and of course the Malays ,
East Indians	LOCATION	, Turks , and such people are inadmissible .

		In fact , the majority of humanity is doomed by reason of ' disease , vice , and discouragement , ' and the prophecy of this consummation so devoutly to be wished ought , in Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's opinion , ` to be stamped in letters of gold on the walls of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	and over the pul - pit of
Plymouth Church	ORGANIZATION	in BrookljTi , on the lin - tels of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, and on the title-page of all future editions of `` The Independent '' and '' The Nation '' ' -LRB- p. 185 -RRB- .

		Such a book could easily be passed over in silence , did it not state flatly and with unneces - sary barbarism a thesis that is the active belief of millions of our fellow countrymen .

		In vain may we smile at the author 's hysterics , and criticise his slovenly composition ; in vain may we remind ourselves that this arrogant mani - festo of the Princes of the Blood is an out - break of world-old pharisaism and brute self - assertion ; in vain may we remind Mr.
Smith	PERSON	that nations live for Mercy ,
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, and Truth , and not simply for breeding ; and that since some do ^ kill their enemies quickly instead of tantalizing them to death by ' disease , vice , and discouragement , ' this may prove more dogs superior to men than he admits .

		All this argu - ing is beside the point ; some men think in this wise , and this is the heart and kernel of the Negro problem .

		This is the new barbarism of the twentieth centurj - , against which all the forces of civilization must contend .

		Can the world conquer it as it has already partially con - quered caste and religious persecution and feuds ?

		Mr.
E. A. Johnson	PERSON	, author of the vol - ume entitled ` Light Ahead for the Negro , ' recently published , believes that we can .

		His little book , written by a man of Negro blood , is curiously yet not unattractively pieced 318 THE DIAIi -LSB-
May	DATE	r , together in the form of semi-fiction , and con - tains the prophecy of a century hence .

		His hero has asked , in this millenium , of the fate of such books as Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's and -LRB- may we add ? -RRB-

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	's : ` She also had heard of those false prophets whom history had not forgotten , but who lived only in ridicule and as examples of error .

		She seemed to be ashamed of the ideas once advocated by these men , and charitably dismissed them with the remark that , `` It would have been better for the cause of true Christianity had they never been listened to by so large a number of our people , as they repre - sented brute force rather than the Golden
Eule	PERSON	. '' ' '

		I heard with rapt attention .

		Although I had already seen much to convince me of .

		the evolution of sentiment in the South , these words sank deeper than all else .

		Here was a woman of aristocyatie Southern blood , cradled under the hills of secession and yet vehement in denunciation of those whom I had learned to recognize as the beacon lights of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	thought and purpose !

		And when I re - flected that her views were then the views of the whole South , I indeed began to realize the wonder - ful transformation I was being permitted to see . '

		The Father of
American Caricature	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It has been pointed out that the Civil War made American caricature what it is at the present day -- one of the most dominating fac - tors utilized in formulating public opinion .

		It required very little imagination on the part of the artist to make the tall figure of President Lincoln appear grotesque , and his many strongly marked peculiarities supplied both friends and enemies with subjects for ridicule .

		The stirring times from
1861	DATE	to
1866	DATE	brought to view the greatest caricaturist this country has ever J ^ nown -- Thomas Nast .

		In his new biography of
Nast	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	says that one of the trophies most highly prized by the artist was a vase , in the shape of an army canteen , representing
America	LOCATION	decorating the cartoonist in the presence of the army , and bearing on the reverse side the inscription : ` Presented to
Thomas Nast	ORGANIZATION	by his friends in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of the

		and enlisted men in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		he was sent to
England	LOCATION	to make illustrations ^ for the ' New York Illustrated News , ' of the international prize-fight between
Heenan	PERSON	ajid
Sayers	PERSON	, at that time an unparalleled proof of newspaper enterprise .

		So unusually successful was he in this venture that he was ordered to
Italy	LOCATION	to join
General Medici	ORGANIZATION	in the famous campaign in which
Garibaldi	PERSON	freed
Sicily	LOCATION	and
Naples	LOCATION	and created the Kingdom of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		In
February , 1861	DATE	, just before the breaking out of the Civil War , he returned to
America	LOCATION	.

		His campaign in
Italy	LOCATION	had given him a war experience such as no other artist possessed .

		The strong patriotic interest which he took in the Rebellion raised his work to the level of the heroic .

		Lincoln acknowledged that his power - * ful emblematic picbures were the best recruit - ing sergeants for the North .

		Nast worked in a field peculiarly his own .

		His designs at this time were of a serious character , setting forth as they did -- sometimes emblematically in pic - torial allegory , sometimes in direct and strik - ing presentment -- the many and mutable phases of the great war .

		Pictorial humor and satire were his weapons of might , and beneath their allegorical exterior were concealed the most profound convictions , the most direct !

		insistence on reforms , the most pointed exposure of shams .

		Always earnest and never cynical , he had but one view and end ever in mind -- the moral and political advancement of the people and the nation . '

		The cartoonist who accom - plishes anything worth while , ' said N ast , short - ly before his death , ' must have his own deep convictions that the target at wldch he is aim - ing is the right one to attack .

		Looking over my experiences as a cartoonist I deem it one of my most satisfying reflections that I never allowed myself to attack anything I did not believe in my soul was wrong and deserving of the worst fate that could befall it . '

		Nast assisted in electing Lincoln the second time ; and after the
Ctmfederate Army	ORGANIZATION	had laid down its arms at
Appomattox Court House	ORGANIZATION	, he became an ardent advocate of tem - perance reform .

		In this noble cause he won a noble battle , putting a stop to one of the most intemperate social customs of the day .

		His art had become a ' mighty engine of warfare . '

		It was during the period of reconstruction and corruption which invariably follows the upheaval of a great country that his work achieved the highest point that satiric art has ever reached in
America	LOCATION	.

		Nast 's work at that time betokened at once the power of the artist and political satirist combined , -- a talent that but few in the history of art possessed .


Kaul	PERSON	- bach in
Germany	LOCATION	had it , as is splendidly shown in his ` Reynard the Fox ' ;
Hogarth	PERSON	,
Gilroy	LOCATION	,
Cruikshank	PERSON	, and

		THE DIAL .

		319 But none of these ever dictated a policy or caused a national refonn .

		To municipa -RSB- reform Xasf s pen became a battery of artallery , .

		shooting shrapnel at the common enemies of freedom and the purity of the ballot-box .

		The exposure of the Tammany Ring and the flighi of
Tweed	ORGANIZATION	's confreres are matters of world-wide knowledge .

		Tweed admitted that
Nast	ORGANIZATION	cari - catured him so often and so sharply that he began to look like his counterfeit presentment -- ^ hat coarse , obese figure , those insolent deep - set eyes , those thousand and one little char - acteristics that are still identified in the public mind with fraud incarnate .

		Nasfs cartoons in those days were not the paid work of a mere artist hired to carry out the directions of another , but the crystallization of his own personal antagonism to what he knew was one of the most brazen attempts to rob by whole - sale in the history of any municipality .

		Comparing the cartoons in the Tweed days with those of the present time , Mr.
Paine	PERSON	says : ` Today the merit of our cartoons lies mainly in their technique and the clever statement of an existing condition .

		They are likely to be the echo of a policy , a reflection of public sentiment , or the record of daily events .

		The cartoons of Thomas Nast were for the most part a manifest , a protest or a prophecy .

		They did not follow public events , but preceded them .

		They did not echo public senti - ment , but led it .

		They were not inspired by a mere appreciation of conditions , but by a powerful con - viction of right and principle whch would not be gainsaid .

		The altered attitude of our pictures to - day is not due to the individuals but to the condi - tions .

		Nast began when the nation was in a flame of conflict .

		When the fierce heat of the battle had subsided , it left the public in the ebullient forma - tive state where human passions run high and human morals and judgment are disturbed .

		At such times strong human personalities leap forth to seize the molten elements and shape the fabric of futurity .

		Such men have little place today .

		The
New York Herald	ORGANIZATION	said not long ago , editorially : `` The press of
America	LOCATION	merely mirrors public opin - ion instead of commanding it . ''

		And it is this that the cartoonist of the present day must be con - tent to do .

		He can but mirror the procession of events -- not direct them . '

		It was Xast who gave dignity to the ' anthro - pomorphic symbol of American ideas and opin - ions ' -- UncLe
Sam	PERSON	; depicting him no longer as the lean buffoon of former years .

		He also pos - sessed in a remarkable degree the faculty of throwing individuality into articles of apparel and personal belongings ; in fact , in many of his pictures he merely indicated the personality of his subjects in this way -- such as
Oakey Hall	PERSON	's eyeglasses ,
Horace Greeley	PERSON	's hat , the dollar-mark and money-bag for
Tweed	ORGANIZATION	's face .

		The first of animals to take its definite place in the history of American caricature was the donkey .

		Xast 's first application of the donkey to Democracy was on
January 15 , 1870	DATE	, when he represented it as the ' Copperhead -LRB- demo - cratic -RRB- Press ' kicking the dead lion ,
E. M. Stanton	PERSON	.

		Shortly afterwards the Eepublican elephant and Democratic donkey took definite shape in ` Harpers Weekly . '

		Speaking of Xasf s enduring influence on the art of cari - cature , the present biographer says : ' Being the first , it was necessary for him to estab - lish fundamentals , to construct the alphabet of an art .

		The work was not arbitrarily done , nor were the results due to accident .

		The symbols which to - day confront us on every hand were each the inevit - able expression ot some existing condition Which by strong , sure mental evolution found absolute embodiment and became a pictured fact .

		We can no more efface them than - ve can erase the char - acters of our spelling-book . '

		It was but a question of time when iiie jwib - lic would no longer demand pictorial crusades ; Nasf 3 business relations with '
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly ' became strained , and he finally found himself practically robbed of a means of liveli - hood .

		For a while he met with success on the lecture platform , but at last this also failed . '

		Somehow the gentle and pathetic figure of
Don Quixote	PERSON	can not fail to present itself to those who in his final days were familiar with the dreams and struggles and disappointments and with the lovable personality of Thomas Xast . '

		It was in
March , 1902	DATE	, after Mr.
Eoose	PERSON	- velt had become President , that Xast received a letter from his old friend , Hon.
John Hay	PERSON	,
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, offering him the consular post at '
Guayaquil	LOCATION	,
Ecuador	LOCATION	.

		Though Xast feared the climate , he needed the position , and accepted it .

		On
Sunday	DATE	,
December 7 , 1902	DATE	^ he succumbed to yeUow fever far away on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		Xast 's art was remarkable for its fertility of invention and that clear graphic style which insured it the popularity that waits on sim - plicity .

		In defining his position in the world of art , Mr.
Paine	PERSON	says : ` There is a divine heritage which rises above class drill and curriculum -- a God-given impulse which will seek instinctively and find surely the means to enter and the way to conquer and possess the foreordinated kingdom .

		Such a genius was that of
Thomas Nast	LOCATION	.

		Lacking a perfect mastery of line , he yet possessed a simplicity of treatment , an understanding of black and white color values , with a clearness of vision , a fertility of idea , and , above and beyond all , a supreme and unwavering purpose which made him a pictorial power such as this generation is not likely to know again .

		Per - haps aU this is not art .

		Perhaps art may not be admitted without the grace of careful training -- the touch that soothes and fills the critic 's eye .

		But if it is not art , then , at least , it is a genius of no lesser sort .

		There are men who will tell you that Grant was not a general .

		There are other * who will hold , that
Nast	ORGANIZATION	was not an artist .

		Yet these two were mighty warriors -- each in his own way -- and the world will honor their triumphs when 320 THE DIAl .

Ingram A. Pyle	PERSON	.

		Masters of the Early and
Late Rexaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is too much to expect anything but very unequal merit in the different volumes of series of monographs on artistic subjects .

		An editor must choose his writers as he may , with the inevitable result that certain books will fall below the standard set by the best of the series .

		The excellent beginning made by the ' Library of Art ' in its two early volumes on Bonatello and
Michael Angelo	PERSON	led the reader to hope for a set of monographs of almost uni - form excellence .

		But the inevitable inequality of such a series is illustrated by the mediocre character of the first of the three books forming the latest additions to the series , -- ' Mediaeval Art ' by Mr.
W. R Lethaby	PERSON	.

		The volume is devoted chiefly to the history of architecture from the year 300 a. d. to
1300	DATE	A. D .

		It opens with chapters on Byzantine art in the
East	LOCATION	and in
Italy	LOCATION	; then follow passages on Eomanesque art in various coun - tries ; finally there are chapters on Gothic art in different European states .

		The treatment is so cursory that the reader often finds little more than a list of monuments .

		The chapter on ' Gothic Characteristics ' might be expected to offer a definite field for criticism , but it proves to be only a compila - tion from other writers ; moreover , it does not marshal its facts in systematic order .

		There is the bias usual with British writers when deal - ing with this subject .

		Anyone who knows the work of
Viollet-le-Duc	ORGANIZATION	,
Louis Gonse	PERSON	, and
C. H. Moore	PERSON	is not inclined to accept the more superficial view of English writers , and our author does not even come up to the very mod - erate standard of the best British criticism .

		• His exposition , so far as it goes , is not clear , and it is evident that he has no proper grasp of the fundamental principles of his subject .

		After a rapid review of Gothic art in
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	the volume ends with a still slighter and less satisfactory discussion of Gothic archi - tecture in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mr ,
Lethaby	ORGANIZATION	's book as a whole shows no new grasp of the subject , no general principle or underlying philosophy whereby to coordinate many artistic movements .

		It is profusely illus - trated , as are all the numbers of the series , and is provided with a good index .

		Miss
Maud Cruttwell	PERSON	's volume on Verrocchio is a scholarly and appreciative monograph of great importance .

		Until the appearance of this book , the only serious work devoted to this
fifteenth century	DATE	master was that by
Mackowsky	ORGANIZATION	in the *
Kiinstler Monographien	PERSON	. '

		But this is published only in German , and is neither as accurate nor as stimulating as the present volume .

		A battle of criticism has been waged about the work of this master ever since Bode 's and
Morelli	PERSON	's vituperations and diatribes of nearly thirty years ago .

		`` Verrocchio has indeed presented many difficult problems , one of the most interesting of which relates to the early works of his great pupil ,
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	.

		Miss
Cruttwell	ORGANIZATION	brings to her task a long residence in
Italy	LOCATION	, years of training in the writing of three earlier volumes of impor - tance , especially the monograph on the della
Robbia	LOCATION	, and she applies the methods of modem connoisseurship to the various mooted questions .

		In her introduction she says : * Verrocchio is perhaps the least known and appre - ciated of the great masters of the fifteenth cen - tury .

		The supreme excellence of those works which are proved by documentary evidence to be authentic is disregarded as the standard of judgment as to quality and style , and a quantity of inferior sculp - ture and painting is attributed to him for which his feeble imitators are responsible . '

		Not only has this been true , but critics have judged our master by his earlier , more angular , and less beautiful paintings .

		He was pre - eminently a sculptor , and his mature works , such as the '
David	PERSON	' and the ' Boy with the Dol - phin ' in
Florence	LOCATION	and the ' Bartolommeo Col - leoni ' in
Venice	LOCATION	, prove that in his acquaintance with anatomy and the laws of movement , in his draughtsmanship and technical skill , he was inferior to none of his contemporaries , and that in breadth of vision and imaginative power he was excelled only by
Donatello	ORGANIZATION	and
Leonardo	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , ^ with an impeccable accuracy in representation and a vigoroi ^ and facile exe - cution , he combined the poetry , the depth of feeling , and the wide sympathies of the idealist . '

		How different , and how much truer , is this con - clusion from
M. Muntz	PERSON	's dictum that Ver - rocchio is ' narrow and bourgeois ' and his work '' commonplace , angular , and dry . '

		There is a popular interest in
Vasari	LOCATION	's tale that
Verrocchio	PERSON	left his painting of ' The
Bap	ORGANIZATION	- tism ' unfinished , and that
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	added one of the angels in the foreground ;
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 321 whereupon , the story goes , the older master was so discouraged that he never touched brush again .

		On the contrary , our author proves by detailed analysis that this angel shows the same hand as that which executed the rest of the picture , and she cites documentary evi - dence to the effect that Verrocchio continued to work for many years afterwards .

		The dis - cussion of this picture in connection with ' The Annunciation ' by Verrocchio in the
Uffizi	LOCATION	and the smaller painting of the same subject by
Leonardo da Vinci	ORGANIZATION	in the
Louvre	LOCATION	is the occasion of some excellent critical writing in regard to the latter .

		Take as an example the following passage in regard to
Leonardo	LOCATION	's style : ` The most remarkable quality of
Leonardo	LOCATION	's work is its vivacity , a vivacity noticeable in the slightest of his engineering sketches and even in his handwriting .

		The least touch of his pen , pencil or brush is rapid and vividly alive .

		It is sensitive , yet decisive .

		It darts and scintillates like flame , giving to the painting or drawing , even when the subject represented is tranquil in sentiment , an ex - cess of life almost fantastic .

		In his earliest work known to us , the predella panel of the `` Annuncia - tion ' ' in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, this vivacity is present to so great a degree that the solemnity of the theme is almost marred by the alertness and briskness of the figures .

		Each touch of the brush in hair and wings and grasses sparkles with life . '

		Another passage that deserves notice is the discriminating comparison of the artistic styles of Pollaiuolo and A ' ^ errocchio .

		Scientists and draughtsmen par excellence in a school of nat - uralists and linealists , these two masters are the very bone and marrow of quattrocento art ; and their relative characteristics have rarely been so well defined as in
Miss Cruttwell	LOCATION	's words .

		Some profile portraits of women , notably that in the
Poldi Pezzoli Museum	ORGANIZATION	in
Milan	LOCATION	and another in
Berlin	LOCATION	, which are ascribed to Piero della
Francesca	PERSON	, are attributed by
Berenson	PERSON	to Verrocchio .

		It seems to us that they are cer - tainly works of the Florentine rather than of the Umbrian school , which would exclude Fran - cesca 's authorship .

		Miss
Cruttwell	PERSON	, however , does not accept these beautiful likenesses of women as works of Verrocchio , and indeed attributes to our master none of the -RSB- \ Iadonna pictures bearing his name .

		In this we follow her with approval , for these Madonnas in Lon - don .


Berlin	LOCATION	, and elsewhere certainly show the work of several hands .

		It is by such conclu - sions that the authentic works of the master are to be distinguished from mediocre school pieces .

		In the list of his genuine works she gives him only three paintings : ' The Baptism ' in the
Florentine Academy	ORGANIZATION	, ` The Annuncia - tion ' '' in the
Uffizi	LOCATION	, and the portrait of a woman usually ascribed to Leonardo in Prince
Lichten	PERSON	- st ^ in 's collection at
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Cruttwell	ORGANIZATION	gives in an appendix the text of documents , some of them discovered by her - self , which bear on various questions , and thus enables the reader to verify her conclusions .

		In her account of the painter 's life she is judicial and cautious , while she adds ma - terially to our information on the subject .

		Although the present monograph has not decided all the difficult problems presented by this sphinx of fifteenth century art , it is a step towards that result , and is an important and stimulating c-ontribution to the history of art , a masterly exposition of Verrocchio 's com - manding position as painter and sculptor .

		The volume on Titian by Dr.
George Gronau	PERSON	is a translation of a work published in
Germany	LOCATION
four years ago	DATE	.

		New material has , however , been added , and the whole brought up to date .

		The work is avowedly based on
Crowe	PERSON	and
Cavalcaselle	ORGANIZATION	's ` Life and
Times of Titian	ORGANIZATION	, ' in two volumes ; but since this was published research has added much to our knowledge of the great Venetian master .

		Dr.
Gronau	PERSON	has himself been a diligent investigator of docu - ments and interpreter of paintings ; he is both historian and connoisseur , and it is partly due to this twofold equipment that we now have a volume of such unusual value .

		The book is popular in that it is avowedly written for the general reader , but the writers judicial insight and scholarly equipment have enabled him to pack an incredible number of details into small compass , to give us a masterpiece of condensation which possesses at the same time breadth of view .

		He deals with the different groups of paintings , -- as the early portraits , the Giorgionesque Madonnas , the great altar - pieces , -- in separate chapters without following a strictly chronological order .

		It might be an open question if this is the best method , but in case the deficiencies of such procedure are not thought to be more than made up for by its advantages -LRB- and we think they are -RRB- ,
Herr Gronau	PERSON	gives at the end of the book a descrip - tive list of the paintings of the master , with comments on the date or probable period of exe - cution .

		This forms an admirable key for the study of
Titan	ORGANIZATION	's artistic development in detail , and is of unique value , constituting the most important feature of the book alike to the ama - teur and the critic .

		Our author makes two additions to the mass of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's known paintings : he has discovered in the apartments of the
Pitti Palace	ORGANIZATION	a portrait that he believes may be that of
Giulia	LOCATION	, Duchess of TJrbino , and he moreover attributes to Titian the remarkable portrait of a lady in the
Crespi	LOCATION	collection at
Milan	LOCATION	, which
Berenson	PERSON	believes to be a copy of a lost
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	but which Cook B2 ^ THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, liolds to be an original
Giorgione	PERSON	and the por - trait of
Catherine Comaro	PERSON	.

		• Much new information is given in regard to many of the painter 's princely patrons and his relations to the courts of
Mantua	LOCATION	and
Urbino	LOCATION	, while the important facts about the painter 's life and ch ^ tracter are summed up in d masterly manner .

		One of the best chapters is that on ^ Titian 's Private Life , -- Family , Home , Friends / Additional points of interest are Dr.
Gronau	PERSON	's belief that the so-called ' Dnke of
Norfolk	LOCATION	' in the
Pitti	LOCATION	is really a portrait of the Duke of
Urbino	LOCATION	, his discussion of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's Giorgionesque period , the emphasis he places on
Palma Vecchio	ORGANIZATION	's influence on our master , and his chapter on
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's technique .

		Although he writes on the latter subject with the modesty of a layman , and gives his opinions with reservations , we are bound to say tiiat his discussion of the great master 's methods is the best contribution yet made to the subject .

		Of especial value also are his remarks on the art of portraiture on p. 131 , his discussion of land - scape in
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's work -LRB- pp. 166 et seq. -RRB- , and the passage in regard to the painter 's later style , the monochromatic effect of his most mature work -LRB- pp. 160 , 161 , and 162 -RRB- .

		This effect is seen in such of Titian 's later pictures as his ' Portrait of Himself ' in
Madrid	LOCATION	, painted at about the age of ninety , and his ' Christ Crowned with Thorns ' in
Munich	LOCATION	.

		In dra - matic insight and power of interpretation wedded to the highest technical skill , certain of these late works are unexcelled , and are not generally appreciated as they deserve .

		One of the refreshing features of the book is the reproduction , among its abundant illustra - tions , of some of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's less known yet impor - tant pictures .

		A few of these unfamiliar sub - jects are : '

		Those who recall Dr.
Gronau	PERSON	's sympathetic monograph on
Leonardo da Vinci	LOCATION	, published some two years ago , may at first feel disap - pointment at the comparatively oold treat - ment of Titian .

		It may seem that he is too tolerant of the great Venetian 's poorer pictures , and not sufficiently appreciative of his master - pieces .

		But this scholarly restraint is in fact one of the great merits of the book .

		On this account it is much to be preferred to the more enthusiastic treatment of the well-known mono - graph by Mr.
Claude Phillips	PERSON	; the German 's critical balance and scholarly reserve are in striking contrast to the Englishman 's bombast | and prose poetry .

		Indeed , Dr.
Gronau	PERSON	's volume , marked by cautious accuracy and disinterested love of truth , is a model for works of its class .

		It is a thing of high art in itself , and is cer - tainly the best life of Titian that has appeared .

		America 's With the publication of Volumes historic XI .

		to XVI. , Mr.
Archer Butler	PERSON	highways .

		Hulbert 's series of ` Historic High - ways of
America	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Arthur H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been completed .

		Volumes XI .

		and XII. , treating of ` Pioneer Roads , ' begin with an account of the evolution of roads from the trail to the first American turnpike , built from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to Lancaster in
1794	DATE	.

		Much of this discussion repeats the matter of earlier volumes , though more attention is given to the means of trans - portation , beginning with the pack horse and developing , as the trail becomes a road , into the freighter and stagecoach .

		Four highways are described : first , the road beginning with
Zane	PERSON	's trace from Wheeling to
Zanesville	LOCATION	, which was continued to the
Ohio	LOCATION	river at
Mayesville	ORGANIZATION	and thence to
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Ky.	LOCATION	; second , the road built in
1832	DATE	by
Virginia	LOCATION	between
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	and
Parkersburg	LOCATION	, which Mr.
Butler	PERSON	calls the ` old Northwestern turnpike ' ; third , the
Genesee	LOCATION	road , built between
1794	DATE	and
1800	DATE	from
Utica	LOCATION	to the
Genesee	LOCATION	river and thence to
Lake Erie	LOCATION	; and , fourth , the
Catskill	LOCATION	turnpike , built in
1802	DATE	from the
Hudson	LOCATION	to the
Susquehanna	LOCATION	.

		The first three roads were selected for treatment by Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	because they were in the line of the early west - ward movement , and the last one , apparently , because an account of it existed ready-made in Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	's ` Old
New York Frontier	ORGANIZATION	, ' which the author was permitted to borrow .

		The separate treatment of the
Braddock	PERSON	,
Forbes	LOCATION	, and
Boone	PERSON	roads in earlier volumes of the series prevents a logical development of the material , so that the relation of the various roads to each other is lost sight of .

		The greater part of the two volumes consists of accounts , drawn from various sources , of travel upon early roads .

		The narra ^ tive , taken from
Baily	PERSON	's ` Tour , ' of a ride over the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	road in
1796	DATE	is both interesting and instructive , and an heretofore unpublished let - ter describing a trip over
Braddock	PERSON	's road in the same year gives a faithful and pathetic picture of emigrant life .

		The remaining accounts are of slight value ; the chapter from
Hall	PERSON	's ` Legends of the West ' is wholly imaginative , and the extracts from
Dickens	PERSON	's ` American Notes ' are too easily accessible to warrant reproduction .

		Vol - umes XIII .

		and
XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		are entitled ` Great Ameri - can Canals . '

		They furnish accounts of three canals : the
Chesapeake	LOCATION	and
Ohio	LOCATION	and the
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania canals , in Volume XIIL , and the Erie canal in Volmne XIV .

		The former volume brings out in an interesting way the rivalry between the canal and the railway , which ended in the X905 .1 THE DIAL S23 easy triumph of the railway .

		The latter volume gives a convenient outline of the history of the Erie canal , which is particularly timely by reason of the great improvements that have recently been entered upon for the purpose of maintain - ing the commercial prestige of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Log - ically the order of the two volumes should have been reversed , since it was the success of the
Erie	ORGANIZATION	canal that inspired the construction of the other canals .

		It goes without saying that the account of these three canals is very far from giving that comprehensive view of the era of canal building in the
United States	LOCATION	which it is very desirable to have , and which we naturally expected from the title of the series .

		Particularly surprising is the omission of the
Ohio	LOCATION	canals , which form a part of the history of the author 's own state and which for so long a time performed a useful service in connecting the Great Lakes with the
Mississippi	LOCATION	system .

		Volume XV. , entitled ^ The Future of Koad-Making , ' is a popu - lar treatise on good roads and the way to make them .

		It consists of five chapters by different hands .

		The first is an introductory discussion of the sociological importance of good roads by Mr.
Butler	PERSON	himself .

		The second is an account of the
OflSce of Public Road Inquiry of the Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	, by the Hon.
Martin Dodge	PERSON	, Direct - or of the
Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		The third chapter is a reprint of a bulletin entitled ` Good Roads for Farmers , ' written by Mr.
M. 0	PERSON	.

		Eldredge , Assistant Director of the
Office of Public Road Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	, and issued by the
Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	in
1899	DATE	.

		This chapter , filling nearly half the volume , is devoted to practical directions for road making .

		Follow - ing it are two short chapters , one on ` Materials for
Macadam Roads	ORGANIZATION	' by Mr.
L. W. Page	PERSON	of the
Road Material Laboratory of the Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	, and the other on ` Stone Roads in
New Jersey	LOCATION	' by Mr.
E. G. Harrison	PERSON	, Secretary of the
New Jersey Road Improvement Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		Such a volume as this seems out of place in an historical series .

		It may , however , bring the work now being done by the Unit-ed States government in encouragement of the good roads movement to the attention of some who might not otherwise know of it .

		Volume
XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		is devoted to an index to the entire series .

		The later volumes of the series present both the merits and defects of the earlier ones .

		They are entertain - ing and often suggestive , but always incomplete .

		The material is ill arranged , and a surprising amount of it is reprinted from other books .

		Taken as a whole the work is more like a ` report of progress ' than a finished product .

		A Ihttch ` Charge it to

		An excellent biography of this good man and hardy pioneer has been pre - pared by Mrs.

		Huidekoper 's early life in HoUand , his coming to
America	LOCATION	in
1796	DATE	at the age of twenty , his long and profitable con - nection with the
Holland Land Company	ORGANIZATION	, chiefly as their agent at
Meadville	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, his promoting of that town 's interests , his exertions in behalf of religious `` ilight `` nnient and liberality , his founding of the first Unitarian .

		church in his part of the country , and later his and his son
Frederic	PERSON	's snceessful endeavors -LRB- o start a theo - logical school at MeadviUe , and finally his lamented death in
1854	DATE	, -- all these and many other matters are set forth in due order and with abundant pictorial accompaniment .

		Extracts from
Huidekoper	PERSON	's correspondence are given , and especially interesting are his letters to
James Freeman Clarke	PERSON	, who married one of his daugh - ters .

		Selections from his published writings prove him to have been a man of intellectual independ - ence and great moral force .

		Copious extracts from his manuscript autobiography also add to the value of the book .

		Modestly but unmistak - ably he shows himself to have been one of the makers of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		At once self-reliant , energetic , and earnestly thoughtful , he says , ' I have become thoroughly convinced that the most valuable part of a man 's education is that which he gives to himself . '

		In that utterance lies much of the secret of his success in a pioneer life that presented problems for whose solution he had no one to whom he could turn .

		Another familiar saying , which is probably still current at
Meadville	LOCATION	, commemorates his breaking loose from the fetters of old-fashioned orthodoxy . '

		^ What is Unitarianism f Nobody knows but
Huidekoper	PERSON	, and he wo n't tell . '

		Herein is sug - gested more truth than at first appears .

		To understand the aims and ideals of this creed - less sect , one must be of it ; and , more than that , no one member can speak for another .

Charles Whibley	PERSON	's ' Literary Por - traits ' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , Montaigne and
Jacques Casanova	PERSON	have made full confession of themselves ; Rabelais and
Burton	PERSON	reveal them - selves more or less unconsciously in their works ;
Philippe de Comines	ORGANIZATION	hides himself completely behind his hero ,
Louis	LOCATION	XI. ;
Drummond of Haw	ORGANIZATION	- thomden is known by the books he keep -RRB- S and by
Jonson	PERSON	's lucky visit ; and
Holland	LOCATION	by the confi - dences of a gossiping godson to
Anthony	PERSON	a Wood , who transmitted gossip into biography .

		There is considerable difference , therefore , in the fulness of the portraits ; some are not much more than sketches , others are full lengths .

		Rabelais and Montaigne are not only the best done but the best worth doing .

		Rabelais , whom we so identify with his work that we hardly think of the latter as possessing a name distinct from its author 's , Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	pictures as a learned and genial doctor , whose experience in the church made him satirize the monks with Aristophanic humor and the strong flavor of the esprit gatilois .

		He is more than the author of ` Gargantua ' and ` Pantagruel . '

		His work , too , is no mere ribaldry , though it is hardly so guileless as Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	would repre - sent it .

		It does stand for freedom and beauty , and its tone is virile .

		It is in the vanguard of 824 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the intellectual Renaissance , and its author dared much to be an apostle of human progress .

		Mon - taigne , on the other hand , is not distinct from his work .

		His Essays give us almost as complete an idea of him as the ` Diary ' does of
Pepys	PERSON	, though , as Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	remarks , in an entirely different way .

		Pepys records his daily doings with microscopic minuteness , and we draw the conclusion .

		Montaigne treats every experience as a means of testing his soul , of knowing himself , and he records his results . '

		I have no business save with myself , ' he says .

		* 1 consider myself unceasingly ; I control and taste myself . '

		Pepys never made such a confession , but he lived up to it just as completely .

		From his abundant material Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	has only to select to make his portrait .

		The details chosen range from Mon - taigne 's eating so greedily that he often bit his tongue to his views on nature , life , and death .

		He appears so many sided , so divers et ondoyant , as he says himself , that every man feels kinship with him .

		But to say , as Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	does , that ` there is no circumstance of life , whose tangle these Essays may not unravel ' is to mark just that extravagant enthusiasm which appears in nearly all these portraits .

		Rabelais was translated by
Urquhart	PERSON	and Motteux ,
Philippe	PERSON	de Comines by
Danett	ORGANIZATION	, and Montaigne by
Florio	PERSON	, admirable translators all in the noblest period of English translation .

		They are the minor figures in Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	's interesting gallery .

		The first Christian emperor .

		In the ' Heroes of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- the good work goes on apace ; and the enterprise may now fairly regard its conclusion as approxi - mate , -- unless , indeed , history shall continue to be made so rapidly as to necessitate several addi - tions to the niches in this Hall of Fame by such great captains as
Nogi	PERSON	and
Oyama	LOCATION	, and even for some yet undiscovered latter-day Russian .

		How - ever that may be , thirty-nine biographies have been published , and the number announced as still in preparation is eleven ; which makes a sus - piciously precise total of fifty .

		The round num - ber , however , may be the result of history 's * evening up ' in the long run , rather than of any arbitrary predetermination of the editors ' minds .

		The volume on Constantine the Great , the latest addition to the series , is the work of Mr.
John B. Firth	PERSON	, an
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	scholar already known to readers by his study of
Augustus Caesar	PERSON	and his translation of
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	's letters .

		The fii-st Christian emperor is an historic figure whose claim to the somewhat fortuitous title of * great ' was derived rather from his grasping the skirts of happy chance than from breasting the billows of circumstance .

		Mr.
Firth	PERSON	recognizes this ; and only insists that ' under his -LSB- Constantine 's -RSB- aus - pices one of the most momentous changes in the history of the world was accomplished . '

		Of this period and of its central figure the author has written sensibly and satisfyingly .

		He has made the best possible use of his original author - ities , who , as he says , were practically without exception bitter and malevolent partisans , by a masterly divination of the truth , or the probable truth , in such polemics as
Lactantius	LOCATION	,
Eusebius	LOCATION	, and other Christian or pagan writers .

		His treat - ment of the legends surrounding
Constantine	PERSON	's conversion is rational without being unsympa - thetic ; and in his deeply interesting account of the Arian controversy and the
Council of Nice	ORGANIZATION	he has recorded the facts as he sees them , and is content to be a guide instead of a judge .

		He regards Constantine as a sincere and convinced Christian ; although ' the Chrisbianity of the Emperor was grossly material , and worldly suc - cess remained in his eyes the crowning proof of the Christian verities . '

		The concluding chapter , ' The Empire and Christianity , ' is a scholarly survey of the real subject -- epochal rather than individual -- of the book .

		Constantine 's greatest political achievement was the founding of the splendid capital to which he gave his name ; and in the long and fascinating chapter devoted to this subject , Mr.
Firth	PERSON	malies free and grateful use of the sumptuous and standard work on Con - stantinople by an American scholar .

Italy	LOCATION	, jg described by Mr.
R. M. John	PERSON	- ston in his two volumes entitled ' The Napoleonic Empire in
Southern Italy	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It was a novel proceeding , to say the least , when
Napoleon	PERSON	, by a simple proclamation addressed to his army , deposed Ferdinand and
Caroline	PERSON	after the battle of Austerlitz .

		Although he did not take this step in the interest of the Neapolitans , but rather to establish French supremacy in that portion of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, his brother
Joseph	PERSON	, and afterwards his brother - in-law Murat , employed enlightened Neapolitans and competent Frenchmen in sweeping away the vestiges of feudalism and in reorganizing soci - ety on the basis of the French system .

		So suc - cessful was this work that at the Restoration in
1815	DATE	even the French code , with slight modifica - tions , was retained and was extended to
Sicily	LOCATION	.

		The present volumes do not treat social changes in much detail , merely describing the condition of the kingdom in
1805	DATE	and indicating how the work of reform was inaugurated .

		The principal emphasis is placed upon political and military incidents .

		The author is not inclined to think that
England	LOCATION	's control in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	was as undisputed after Trafalgar as commonly sup - posed .

		One of the most interesting chapters of the first volume describes the Maida campaign , and the insurrection in
Calabria	LOCATION	during which such diverting cut-throats as Fra Diavolo played the leading roles .

		The principal figure of the volume is
Joachim Murat	PERSON	, a spectacular if not an attractive pyersonality .

		Murat 's situation after the disastrous Russian campaign was too complex to be simplified by a hero of his cali - ber .

		The story of his fall and fate is told with vigor and judgment , and is the best part of the whole work .

		The second volume covers the period from
1815	DATE	to the end of the insurrection of
1820	DATE	.

		Its theme is the influence of the secret societies , chiefly the

		But he began early , at barely sixteen , when he obtained a commission and went out to the
Crimea	LOCATION	.

		Scarcely anything of the grimness of warfare appears in his rapid and readable narrative : the light-hearted lad almost seems to have been playing at war .

		Of the terrible suffer - ings of the arm -RCB- ' before
Sebastopol	LOCATION	he says barely a word .

		That he was plucky , popular with his fellows , and somewhat of a favorite with his superiors , may be read between the lines .

		Lack of funds to purchase a desired promotion led him to leave the military for the civil serrice after attaining the rank of major .

		More than once he hints at a leanness of purse that may well have familiarized him with the traditional sub - altern 's repast , ' a glass of water and a pull at the waistbelt . '

		His pages perhaps now and then owe some of their attractiveness to a pardonable unwillingness to spoil a good story in the telling , as when he describes the skatmg at
Halifax	LOCATION	as extending ` over longer stretches of ice than are to be found anywhere else in the world . '

		The histor > - of his services as prison official contains , beside weightier penological matters , accounts of noted criminals , remarkable escapes , and other interesting incidents .

		The author 's style has the unstudied fluency of one who is used to writing with the din of the printing-press in his ears and the boy at his side waiting for copy .

		The book is a worthy addition to the Major 's long list of works , grave and gay .

		native-gTown superstitions and customs .

		Dr.
Robert Hamill Nassau	PERSON	spent forty years in this land as a missionary .

		The service that he was required to render gave him excep - tional opportunities to study the thoughts , beliefs , and influential customs that form so large a part of the life of those ungrown races .

		Throughout the entire period of his service he carefully gathered facts on every phase of the native 's life .

		These first-hand facts he has clas - sified and embodied in a volume entitled * Fetich - ism in
West Africa	LOCATION	' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a work of first - class importance to students of ethnology , sociol - ogy , and primitive religion .

		The author devotes most of his ^ aee to the discussion of the fetich , as occupying chief place in the life of the native races of
West Africa	LOCATION	.

		Travellers who have made a hasty trip through that country and have ques ^ tioned the natives as to their beliefs , have often reported that they had found a race so low in the scale of being as to have no idea of
Grod	ORGANIZATION	or of a superior being .

		Dr.
Nassau	PERSON	completely refutes every such statement , by citing cases where the native said what was understood as a denial of belief in a higher Being , simply to acknowledge his ignorance and inferiority in the presence of such learned and mysterious white men .

		Years of close study of many of the most degraded tribes have convinced Dr.
Nassau	PERSON	that there is no race so benighted as not to have the knowledge of at least the name of God .

		He has carefully gleaned among several of these primi - tive peoples , and has become convinced that , with all their superstiti -LRB- m and mysterious white and black arts , they are jwssessed of a distinct and definite religious nature that can be reached and educated .

		Closely following Mr ,
William M.	PERSON	of * ''
Ento'iif Meigs	PERSON	's biography of Thomas
Hart Benton	PERSON	appears one by Mr.
Joseph M. Rogers	PERSON	.

		For
this later	DATE	book there seems to be slight excuse , except that it was called for in the ` American Crisis Series ' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , to which it belongs .

		The work is careless and super - ficial .

		The author gives us too few facts about
Benton	PERSON	, too much apology for
Benton	PERSON	, and too much of his own unauthenticated opinion .

		Mr ,
Rogers	PERSON	thinks that
Benton	PERSON	was an important national statesman who was responsible for much sound legislation and many sound pKjlicies .

		But instead of exhibiting
Benton	PERSON	's greatness , he pre - fers to belittle the contemporaries and opponents of
Benton	LOCATION	--
Webster	PERSON	.


Calhoun	PERSON	, Clay , and
Doug	PERSON	- las -- as men of selfish ambition , timeservers , trimmers , and intriguers .

		Evidently the author holds to the ` great man ' theory of history , for he shows no appreciation of the influence of strong natural forces in American history .

		Of the social , pK -RRB- litical , and economic conditions .

		North and South , restdting in the long contro - versy over slavery , he displays a profound ignor - ance .

		The non-slaveholders in the South really possessed and very actively exercised political rights , though Mr ,
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	says the contrary .

		It is not correct to say that
Benton	PERSON	lost his seat in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	because he opposed nullification , and that he was the ` first martyr to the slavery cause .

		.

		struck down by the slave power . '

		He failed of reelection because he was old , arro - gant , untactful , and out of touch with his con - stituents .

		He was not killed by defeat , but by an incurable disease of long standing , up > on which politics had no influence .

		It was not the memory of
Benton	LOCATION	that preserved
Missouri	LOCATION	to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but natural forces aided by the Germans and the
United States	LOCATION	army .

		The book does not make one understand
Benton	PERSON	the man , as does Mr.

Benton	LOCATION	the statesman , as does that of Mr.

Mabel W. Daniels	PERSON	's account of ` An American Girl in
Munich	LOCATION	' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is pleasantly written and full of delightful humor .

		In ` twelve long letters , written to an intimate friend , the author tells with charm - ing frankness her trials and pleasures during a year of musical study .

		She airs her German phrases with childish na'ivetS , translates them all carefully , and sometimes indulges in a bit of fine writing ; but for these faults she atones by her clever characterization of people , vivid descriptions of street scenes and foreign cus - toms , as well as by clear and apt comment on musical matters .

		She succeeds remarkably in putting into words the impressions made by vari - ous symphonies and operas , and gives many delightful and not too familiar glimpses of her masters ,
Stavenhagen	PERSON	and Thuille , and of
Ysaye	PERSON	and
Carl Zerrahn	PERSON	.

		Stavenhagen 's remark , when
Miss Daniels	PERSON	asked to join his class in composi - tion , is too good to be ignored .

		No woman had ever entered this class , but after solemn con - sultation with his secretary , the master said : ` Because a Fraiilein never has joined the class is no reason why a Fraiilein never can , ' -- a point of view so un-German as to be truly refreshing .

		The work first appeared in
Germany	LOCATION	in
1844	DATE	, and was intended as an offset to the extreme free trade views of some of the
Adam Smith	PERSON	school of economists .

		It is a fairly able presentation of the protectionist argument .

		Having never been revised , however , it of course fails to deal with some of the more recent phases of that subject .

		The author was a moderate protectionist , believ - ing neither in prohibitive duties nor protection to raw materials .

		According to his theory there are two stages through which every country should ultimately pass ; the third stage , that of free trade , supposedly being the final one in which it should remain .

		In
1844	DATE	, according to this theory ,
England	LOCATION	was the only country in
Europe	LOCATION	that was actually ready for this third stage .

		If
England	LOCATION	was ready for it sixty years ago , in the estimation of the author , it may be a ques - tion how much this book will aid the protectionist cause in that country after all .

Schwaben	LOCATION	- verein of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Numerous special committees have for some time been at work upon the several features of the celebration , and the result gives promise of being a noteworthy demonstration of loyalty to both the personal memory and the objec - tive achievements of the noble poet who inspired the idealism of
Young Germany	LOCATION	a hundred years ago , and whose example still offers inspiration to all generous spirits everywhere who have the cause of humanity at heart .

		BRIEFER MENTION 360 NOTES 361 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 362 THE ENDOWM ENT OF LEARNING .

		The educational world was agreeably sur - prised by the recent announcement that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	had found yet a further distinctive purpose for his versatile philanthropy , and pos - sibly the most urgent and pertinent of all .

		In establishing the
Carnegie Institute	ORGANIZATION	, the founder had set forth the wholesome doctrine that the endowment of men was to be considered as of greater intrinsic worth than the furtherance of projects or the building of institutions .

		The two latter forms of the endowment of learning may be said to be firmly sanctioned by our philanthropic traditions ; they seem to demand no defense as to principle , however obviously capable of expansion as to practice .

		There is , on the other hand , a curious wariness in regard to the spefcific endowment of individuals , a sort of suspicion in some quarters that it does not quite harmonize with democratic ideals , a still less pertinent misgiving in others that it bears a flavor of charity .

		With a growing apprecia - tion of the complexity of the conditions requi - site for our maintenance of a dignified , not to say a commanding , position in the intellectual rivalry of nations , such doubts wiU find their own solution .

		The hopeful message of the
Carnegie Institute	ORGANIZATION	was the more distinct recog - nition that the most profitable form of endeavor was to find the deserving and origi - nal type of investigator , and then to ^ secure for him the conditions most likely to mature for the public benefit the issues of his labors .

		A monotonously constant obstacle that stood in the way of even a reasonably favorable environ - ment was the awkward necessity in which the possessor of the favored gifts found himself , of earning his living , to say but little of the provision with fair prudence against the rainy days of incapacity or the gloomy outlook of an incomelees old age .

		To afford some relief to this unfortunate condition is the worthy purpose of the recent bequest .

		It is again to endow men rather than institutions , to aid * the cause of higher education and to remove a source of deep and constant anxiety to the poorest-paid and yet one of the highest of all professions . '

		The fund will , so far as the institutions that share in its benefits are concerned , make pro- vision for a pension system for * the least rewarded of all professions , ' thus enabling those who have reached the years when the harness ia growing a bit irksome and the pace a little tardy to enjoy days ' of merited tranquility , and -- what is equally important -- to permit men during their prime to devote themselves with greater singleness of purpose to the work in hand , with less uneasiness as to what the future may bring .

		It is rather remarkable that so small a share of the great gifts in behalf of education should have recognized this central need .

		The piti - ful inadequacy of the professor 's salary seems to demand as its indispensable compensation the provision for a comfortable retirement after long-time service .

		Having abandoned hope of even the most modest of competences , the pro- fessor should not be required to face senescent penury .

		The need has not been wholly over - 344 THE DIAIi -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, looked ; dt would be possible to enumerate a small group of institutions that have adopted a pension system , while others have it under earnest consideration .

		In the brief experience of the effects of the provision , ceri ^ in immedi - ate benefits are worthy of record : it has strengthened the feeling among the members of the faculty that they belong for life to the university with whose lot they have cast their own .

		This feeling of permanency of adjust - ment exercises a wholesome influence upon the attitude of the scholar to his work , a content - ment of spirit that finds not the least of its benefits in the ability to consider with greater composure than is now usual , the overtures of other institutions .

		It is because the extent of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's foundation Avill draw wide attention to this greatest defect in our educa - tional provisions -- a defect that our foreign critics have repeatedly pointed out -- that it is likely to exercise a permanent influence upon the administrative measures of all the higher institutions of learning .

		It thus assumes the importance of a national contribution to edu - cational policy , of a distinctive and comprehen - sive recognition of the most persistently over - looked ' desideratum in the educational situa - tion .

		As such it merits , as it will doubtless receive , the enthusiastic endorsement of those by whom the welfare of our intellectual con - cerns is properly cherished .

		The day has wholly gone by when it was really an impropriety to look a gift horse inl the face .

		Indeed the points of favor and defect of the offering are as likely to be as carefully consid - ered by the donor as by the recipient .

		At the moment , a rather vigorous discussion is going on anent a wholly different contribution , argu - ing how far it is incumbent upon the benefi - ciary to pronounce upon , the methods by which the proffered animal was originally acquired .

		The more usual inquiry relates to the special fitness of the benefaction to meet the actual needs , and without interference with other desirable ends .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has passed through the experience of having a most gen - erous offer to a most worthy cause most consid - erately declined because of the mature judg - ment of those who were to administer the ten - dered foundation , that the complications of the measure were likely to entail difficulties which they were not prepared to face .

		The wisdom of the details of the provisions , as well as the possible dangers ' which the bequest brings with it , are as legitimate points of discussion as were these same considerations in the planning of the foundation .

		Whenever a very large sum of money is given to a cause of this kind , there is the ready criticism that it will diminish the natural incentive for others to supply similar needs , and thus relieve rather than expand the sense of civid and philanthropic responsibility .

		Against Mr.
Came	PERSON	^ e 's libraries it is urged that it would have been better to have had them locally endowed or wljolly provided by the communi - ties ; in regard to the
Carnegie Institute	ORGANIZATION	, that it would lead universities to shift the burden of research to the fund thus provided and with - draw funds that might have been available for such purpose ; and in regard to the present grant , that it will postpone the day when uni - versities would have of their own accord estab - lished pensions for their s `` lf-sacrificing profes - sors ' .

		This is a complicated issue , for which any formula is an impertinence .

		It is , how - ever , interesting to observe that the environ - ment of modem civilization is so baffiingly complex , and the many-sidedness of human concerns so unexpectedly surprising , that there is quite as much room for the very opposite influence as for the one that at first sight seems imminent .

		One may at all events express the hope that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's endowment will sup - plement existing provisions rather than exon - erate universities from the duty of supplying pensdons , andj will lead to similar provisions in such institutions as do not benefit by the Car - negie foundation .

		The latter consideration will presently be shown to have special pertinence .

		And after all , each generation has a nearer concern and a profounder insight for the needs of the forseeable future than for the more dis - tant and dubious perils of a remote posterity .

		In this aspect of things , there are many who look forward to a larger amelioration of the conditions of learning in
America	LOCATION	as a conse - quence , direct and indirect , of this timely bequest , than from any other application of beneficent millions .

		The detail likely to arouse strenuous discus - sion is easily selected .

		It is that relating to the exclusion of state universities from the benefits of the bequest .

		, Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	explains that inasmuch as such universities ' may prefer that their relations shall remain exclusively with the state , ' he can not presume to include them .

		The construction of this position is not easy .

		If it is to be taken at its face value , then it may be said without hesitation that the conception of the function of the state university which it seemingly entertains belongs to a bygone and not to the present regime .

		Doubtless there are expressions and actions in the past of almost all of the state universities that would lend color to such an interpretation of their policy ; but the modem state university is pre-eminent - ly a contribution by a given state to the cause of higher education in the land ; and state uni - versities have been successful in proportion as they have acted upon this liberal interpretation of their scope and function . '

		How much of the
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		345 older sentiment is still current , it would take a special inquiry to determine ; but it would be a distinct surprise to leani that state universities do prefer that their relations shall remain exclusively with the state .

		Indeed what is most striking in regard to the activities of the lead - ing state universities is the completeness of their parallelism to the purposes , methods , and policy of comparable institutions supported by private endowment .

		The rapprochement of the two is a notable feature of educational ten - dencies .

		It appears in the confederation of American universities bound by the common support of graduate work ; it appears in every movement of a national character in higher edu - cational thought .

		The particular conditions that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's bequest were especially to relieve , obtain in most typical measure in the state uni - versities ; the under-pa -RCB- - ment , the sacrifice of personal comfort , the uneasiness , the deep interest in the advancement of learning , the service often in an uncongenial and unsym - pathetic milieu , are on the whole nowhere to be found in more typical combination than in the service of state institutions .

		If it be argued that the fund set aside would not have been adequate for all American universities , and that accordingly the principle of selection was that of excluding those upon which a duty could be rather forcibly urged of providing their own pension system , the matter becomes more intelligible though less consistent with the published statement .

		Undoubtedly the sentiment of responsibility should be rather more readily aroused in regard to oflScial than in regard to private service .

		But the present temper of legislatures does not seem favorable to this type of measure ; so that no practical relief seems in sight .

		It will at all events be interesting to see what attitude state universi - ties will take -RRB- towards their exclusion from this bequest .

		The attitude is certain to be a friendly one , because of the well proved fact that move - ments of this kind , once inaugurated , grow ; and that the provisions in one group of insti - tutions must in the end be met by equal pro- visions in others of the same class .

		It is more to the point at present to antagonize the con - ception that state universities have any inten - tion to be exclusive , or desire to remain in a separate class .

		Many of them have accepted extensive or modest private benefactions , and some are urging that such benefactions are in - deed necessary , - to the extension of interest in their mission , upon which the tmiversity spirit feeds and grows .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's gift once more calls deliberate attention to the perils of the academic life in
America	LOCATION	.

		The attractions of the highways to other careers advertise themselves , and leave the path that leads to the university chair rather bare and uninviting .

		It requires decided de - termination , devotion to purpose , and belief in ideals to follow it ; and defections and unrest are becoming ' increaaingly common .

		Still more generally is it observed that the class of young men who are willing in spite of conspicuous discouragement to enter the ranks , does not maintain its quality .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	adds his testimony to the fact that ' able men hesitate to adopt teaching as a career . '

		The only source of hesitation relevant to the present dis - cussion , not by any means the only one worth discussing , is that of inadequacy of income .

		A most timely contribution to the matter appears in a pleasantiy intimate article in the
May	DATE	is - sue of ' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, ' setting forth un - der the caption * What Should College Profes - sors Be Paid ? '

		an itemized account of actual expenses for nine years of a teacher in one of the larger American universities .

		The result is that this self-sacrificing individual has actually been required to spend nearly double his aver - age income from the university for living ex - penses , and so has paid some
$ 1400.00	MONEY	annually for the privilege of teaching .

		What this means , when interpreted for the institutions as a whole , and !

		for the universities throughout the land , is nothing less than the recognition of the fact that the actual supporters of our institutions of higher education hiave not been either the mil - lionaires or the legislatures but the professors themselves .

		The writer in the '
Atlantic	LOCATION	' concludes that an advance of about sixty per cent would be needed to supply the basis for the necessities of life to a man with an eco - nomic temperament , in the social status of the professor ; which fact , if accepted , may quite well be stated by saying that for many years professors have been contributing the missing sixty per cent of their salaries to the support of the institutions for whose benefit their services were rendered .

		And in the aggregate this would constitute a sum fairly comparable in some cases , if not in most , with the income from other sources .

		In this aspect of things the
Carnegie	LOCATION	founda - tion appears as a single but important step in the encouragement of the academic life through the removal of its present disadvantages .

		The question thus comes to the front whether a still more pointed remedy would not have been equally or even more effective , in other words some direct incentive for the provision of ade - quate incomes .

		The conditional gift is one that present-day philanthropists find convenient to their purposes of inspiring rather than of dead - ening endeavor .

		If the income from such a magnificent sum as Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has devoted to the endowment of learning were offered to deserving universities upon condition that the authorities provide a certain minimum but ade - 346 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
May 16	DATE	, quate income for their professors , it is not whollyi idle to hope that the higher education would be as decidedly benefited as by the pro- vision of pensions ; and the effect of the infusion of new life would have been more immediately and outwardly visible .

		Perhaps both plans are worth a trial ; and the untried method of stim - idation may serve as the suggestion for further experimentation .

		Important as are ways and means of alleviating distress , the relief of the unfortunate condition is far more important than the manner thereof .

		To Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	be - longs the honor of the first adequate recognition of the importance of the evil which he has at - tempted to relieve by a contribution that indi - cates that such a step is coordinate in value with the endowment of research or the equip - ment of instruction .

		THE BASIS OF LITERATURE .

		When an entomologist finds a new species of insect , he writes a description of it , which is iorthwith published in a technical journal .

		People do not read such descriptions , unless they themselves have an insect which they think may be the same .

		After a careful comparison between the printed words and the specimen in hand , it may appear that one has the species described , and immediately the words live again as they did in the mind of the original describer .

		More than this , however , the pub - lished account , viewed in the light of its mani - fest meaning , almost always contributes some - thing new to the stock of ideas of the person using it .

		With all literature , apparently , the same thing happens .

		There has to be a common factor , X , in the minds of writer and reader , which is the carrier of an uncommon factor , y. Let it be the test of literature that it con - tains both X and y .

		Some very successful writings , in a commer - cial sense , owe their vogue to the fact that they reflect the minds of the readers .

		They gratify the common taste for regarding one 's own image .

		Such , evidently , are not literature in our sense ; the reaction , x + x , is a perfectly sterile one .

		Other writings , rich in y , carry no x for most readers .

		It is notorious that the first readers of several notable works found no x therein at all , and were ready to reject them altogether .

		They were like descriptions of an insect no specimen of which was known to later students .

		It is possible that there now exist works of this character , useless to us , but veritable mines of wealth to those who have the key -- the common character which we call x .

		In science an interesting and suggestive case has lately come to light .

Gregor Mendel	PERSON	, an Aus - trian priest , published in
1865	DATE	a paper on heredity , as illustrated by experiments in breed - ing plants .

		This paper was ignored until
1900	DATE	, but to-day it is regarded as one of the most important of all scientific writings .

		A better - known and equally illustrative case is that of
Sprengel	PERSON	and his writings on insects and flow - ers , -- laughed at in his day , but regarded as the work of a genius since
Darwin	PERSON	showed us where to find the x. Could there be a perfectly sterile y , carrying no x for any one ?

		It is thinkable , but scarcely believable .

		Picture the man condemned as a lunatic or crank , carrying nevertheless the greatest message to manlcind , which no man , now or hereafter , could ever understand .

		For - tunate it is , that it is possible to address pos - terity , so that a voice falling to-day on deaf ears may echo hereafter with pregnant mean - ing .

		Although it is hard to believe that any y-bearing literature , if duly preserved , will always remain sterile , there is the question of its preservation .

		Before the days of printed books many a good idea must have gone down the wind unheeded .

		In these days of over many books , it is as likely to be lost in the very chaos of writing , voiceless like the man who cries against the crowd .

		And the worst of it is , we are by the nature of the case unable to prevent it .

		Can fruitful literature ever cease to be so ?

		As it is assimilated , the y is gradually converted into X , and in the simpler cases no residue at length remains .

		Whatever was there is now fully possessed by the reader , and he may not obtain fresh inspiration from that source .

		Thus some scientific papers , y-ivl \ in their day , have now no more than historic interest .

		It is the distinction - of really great literature that it never loses its ^ / - quality ; the more it is used up , the more seems to flow from it , as from a perennial
spring	DATE	.

		If the superiority of the ancient Greeks was as great as
Galton	PERSON	has maintained , it is think - able that their like may never again arise ; and thus there might be a belated literature , which would appeal only to those whom it could never reach .

		Its cr-ness would be extinct before it was born .

		One could , I think , select instances of writers who seemed to themselves to write for the past rather than for the present or future .

		The best literature , evidently , is that which carries a maximum of y , with enough x to make the former fruitful .

		Style is clearly an x character simply , hence it can not be the end of literature .

		Nevertheless , it is of the utmost
1905	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL , 347 value , being the means whereby x-ness is given to the most y-some thoughts , as is very well seen in the ease of
William James	LOCATION	, who can make even psychology fascinating to ordinary readers .

		On the other hand , y-less style is bar - ren , at best tickling the intellectual palate .

		It is useless to expect real literature to grow out of anything but mental travail .

		All litera - ture is propaganda ; it carries its message as from teacher to student , the teacher himself being also a student .

		It can not be impartial , whether it relates to a woman 's face or the theory of evolution .

		It must not be afraid of giving offense ; indeed , it is the knight-errantry of the mind .

		What literature may this coun - try and day produce ?

		Ask , rather , what advance is it making in thought or deed , what are its aims , what tomorrow would it have ?

		For literature is prophecy ; the first fruit of the coming change , the very birth of the y-child for whom the inheritance is waiting .

		Will you say , against this , that the highest literature has often dealt with the oldest themes , and with matters of small import ?

		What is it to the world that Romeo loved Juliet ?

		Truly , nothing at all , baldly postu - lated ; but it is the privilege of the highest genius , and that only , to really illuminate , y-wise , the events of every human life .

		One does not need to possess much talent to add something to the subject of beetles , but to enrich the thought of mankind on a subject of universal consideration , -- that is as difficult as it is admirable .

		Perhaps I am partial to science ; but I ven - ture to claim that most scientific writings , dry - as-dust if you please , are more genuinely liter - ature than much of what is ordinarily put out as such .

		They contain y-elements ; not , per - haps , of a very distinguished kind , but real in their way .

		There is no reason why science should not aspire to be the basis of a very high type of literature , but this must be the product of genius , here as elsewhere .

		History is as scientific as natural-history , or should be , and it has long been recognized as a field for liter - ary effort .

		Euskin did not lose his eloquence when he took to sociology , and it would be diffi - cult to find any modem American writings worthier to be called literature than those of
William James	LOCATION	.

		In the belief that science has a strong and special message for this and com - ing generations , I would urge that new attempts shoidd be made to give it the ^ - quality which may make it available literature to the people , without reducing it to the meaningless level of ordinary popular scientific writings .

		To this task , the best abilities may fittingly be dedi - cated ; but courage and perseverance are as necessary as literary skill .

		Southern Jutfe ts `` Wak Time .

		*
Mary BoyMn Chesnut	PERSON	was the wife of one of the most prominent of the ante-bellum south - em leaders .

		Her relatives were all of the wealthy slaveholding class -- the class that , according to the popular histories , precipitated the southern people into secession and war for the sake of slavery .

		The published extracts from Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	's diary ought to do much to cor - rect some false impressions that most people , southern as well as northern , now have of the old southern regime .

		The entries in the journal cover a period of four years , from
1861	DATE	to
1865	DATE	.

		In its entirety the diary filled forty-eight small manuscript volumes ; but for the present pur - pose the editors have condensed it by omitting matter of purely local interest , and they have added a sketch of the author and some explan - atory notes in the text .

		Written from day to day , these pages reflect the spirit of the times better , perhaps , than any other account that we have .

		AU was grist that came to this mill .

		There are jokes , war anecdotes , stories of love and death , notes of conversations heard on the cars , in the streets , in ballroom , hospital , and dressing room , from women , soldiers , statesmen , spies , and negroes , descriptions of economic , social , and military conditions ^ and of Confederate politics .

		Nearly every noted man or woman of the Confederacy contributes a conversation or an opinion , which Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	records and comments upon .

		It was not a private journal , but lay open upon the parlor table and was read by any friend who cared to see what had been written .

		The style is crisp and bright , and the tone frank and good tempered .

		* I praise whom I love and abuse whom I hate , ' says Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	, but there is little abuse in her pages .

		It is inter - esting to note the difference between
South Carolina	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	in regard to social posi - tion .

		* Until we came here -LSB-
Richmond	LOCATION	-RSB- we had never heard of our social position , ' Mrs.
Ches	PERSON	- nut wrote ; ' we do not know how to be rude ta people who call .

		To talk of social position seems vulgar .

		Down our way that sort of thing was settled one way or another beyond a per - adventure , like the earth and sky .

		We never gave it a thought .

		348 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, As the conunents of one in closest touch with political affairs and possessing the confi - dence of the leading Confederates , Mrs.
Ches	PERSON	- nut 's remarks upon secession are most inter - esting .

		Certainly nearly all of the people whom she knew were loath to secede , -- the men to leave high positions , the women to give up social prestige .

		If we may trust her judgment , the southern leaders were slow to secede and somewhat despondent as to the future .

		The people , however , were enthusiastic , though ^ complaining bitterly of slow and lukewarm public leaders .

		^ President
Davis	PERSON	was denounced in
1861	DATE	as ' no seceder , ' ^ and in
1863	DATE	some one accused him of ` not being out of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	yet . ' '

		Lord !

		how he must have hated to do it , ' is the comment of the diarist when Judge
Campbell	PERSON	resigned and came south .

		After the Confederacy was formed the general desire was for peace , and many hoped for re-union .

		When Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	heard the cannonade at Sumter , she says , ' I prayed as I never prayed before . '

		The future seemed gloomy .


Davis	PERSON	told her to be ready for a long war ;
Trescott	PERSON	and
Stephens	PERSON	had little hope of success ; the army officers dbclared that the North was overwhelmingly superior in resources ; and , in
1862	DATE	,
Yancey	PERSON	came home from
England	LOCATION	and reported ' not one jot of hope . '

		Decidedly the chieftains dampened enthusiasm , but the average people were sanguine .

		There was complaint that half-hearted men had secured the high places , and intrigue and jealousy were rife in
Montgomery	LOCATION	and
Eich	PERSON	- mond as in
Washington	LOCATION	.


Mason	PERSON	and
Yancey	PERSON	were criticised as not being the proper persons to send abroad .

		The enemies of
Davis	PERSON	seemed willing to ruin the cause in order to injure him .

		Spies were allowed to come and go almost with - out check , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the newspapers could keep no secrets .

		So run the comments .

		Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	has small respect for the enemies of
Davis	PERSON	and their ` virulent nonsense , ' and when the end draws near she declares that ' the soldiers have done their duty ' but ` the Con - federacy has been done to death by the politi - cians . '

		The stubbornness of
Davis	PERSON	and
John	PERSON	- eon , the slowness of Longstreet , the rashness of Hood , -- all come in for keen criticism .

		But for the Lees , father and sons , there is nothing but admiration .

		General Lee is to her ' the very first man in all the world , ' ' so cold , quiet , and grand , ' and she notes that at the height of his fame he wished only for a
Virginia	LOCATION	farm with fresh cream and ' unlimited fried chicken . '

		Of his son , when he spoke well of General But - ler , she remarks ` the Lees are men enough to speak the truth of friend or enemy , fearing not the consequences . '

		An observation worth men - tioning was that the political and military lead - ers of the Confederacy were Scotch and Scotch -
Irish	LOCATION	, and not of the planting class , -- ` our planters are nice fellows , but slow to move . '

		This daughter of
South Carolina	LOCATION	thinks that the southerners of the
East	LOCATION	bore privation and discipline better than those of the
West	LOCATION	.

		The negroes knew very well what the war was about , and some of the southern people were in fear of slave uprisings .

		All during the war Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	watched the blacks closely .

		She states that while some of them were ' furi - ously patriotic ' and wanted to enlist and fight for their masters , the great majority were pro- foundly indifferent , ` utterly apathetic ' as late as
1865	DATE	, showing the influence of the war spirit , only in ' increased diligence and absolute silence . '

		The only sign of feeling was dis - played by the better class of house servants , some of whom assumed stately airs , and ' con - trived to keep from speaking to us , ' though attentive to duties .

		The planters found great difficulty in supporting their negroes while no cotton was being sold and prices of supplies were high .

		Some planters were ruined by this expense .

		When the end came there was joy at freedom among the negroes , yet most of them went on plowing and hoeing as usual .

		The disorder came later .

		Slavery , it has been said , was the corner - stone of the Confederacy .

		So it was , as the non - slaveholders and the lesser slaveholders and the poorer classes saw it .

		But
Mirs	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chesnut 's diarj ' bears repeated evidence that to the hereditary slaveholders the institution had become an intolerable burden and responsibility , and to these emancipation came as a relief .

		It is on the subject of negroes and slavery that Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	's diary will prove most valu - able to historians , but the general reader will be chiefly interested in the accounts of the home life of the beleaguered people .

		There was feasting and dancing in the early days of the war , ' starvation parties ' and dancing during the latter part , and love - making and marriages all the time .

		There were brides dressed in coarse Confederate gray , bridesmaids in black , and guests in ' four year old finery . '

		A new book was ' a pleasing incident in this life of monotonous misery . '

		The home people were seeking distraction from sorrow . '

		Hope and f eai : are both gone and it is distraction or death ... If it would do any good we would be sad enough . ' '

		An open grave with piles of red earth thrown on one side ; that is the only future I see . '

		As the years wore on , and the death roll of fathers , sons , husbands , and sweethearts grew longer , women died silently of grief . '

		Our best and bravest are under the sod , ' writes Mrs.
Chesnut	PERSON	, ' we are hard as stones ; we sit unmoved and

		Reason ix
Humax Conduct	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Professor
Santayana	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	has the unusual gift of being able to make lit - erature out of philosophy , without apparently finding it necessary to dilute the latter in the process .

		He has already deserved well of both the philosophical and the general public , but his projected work on ' The
Life of Eeason	ORGANIZATION	' is by far the most elaborate and important enter - prise that he has yet attempted .

		Indeed it promises to constitute in some ways one of the distinctive contributions to philosophy of the last few decades .

		It is , to begin with , more encyclopaedic in its scope than anything of the kind recently issued .

		The five volumes that are proposed will deal respectively with
Reason in Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	, Reason in Society , Reason in Religion , Reason in Art , and Reason in Science ; of these the first two have already appeared .

		Furthermore , the work may be regarded as the first attempt to give any sys - tematic expression to that new group of ten - dencies which , under the name of Pragmatism , or Humanism , is causing a ferment in the philosophical world at the present time .

		The movement has been so confused and groping hitherto , that any effort to give greater pre - cision to its outlines is to be welcomed .

		But to Professor
Santayana	PERSON	's work is due not merely the commendation that belongs to a pioneer attempt ; its own positive quality is so good that it can afford to stand on its inherent merits .

		And while it is too early to predict whether or not it will be accepted generally by the Prag - matists as a satisfactory presentation of their apparently somewhat divergent views , it can - not fail to influence in a marked way the future course of discussion .

		It is not to be supposed that the fuU burden of Professor
Santayana	PERSON	's thought wiU yield itself easily to the casual reader .

		It is in parts , especially in the first volume , hard reading , as any fundamental inquiry must be ; and the difl & - culty is not greatly lessened -LRB- one suspects that it may perhaps even be increased a little in places -RRB- by the literary charm and poetic sug - gestion of the style .

		Nevertheless the qualities that lie on the surface will make these volumes attractive to almost any one who cares for vital and penetrating criticism applied to hum an life .

		•
The Ltfe of Reason *	ORGANIZATION	.

		Or ,
The Phases of Human Progress	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
George Santayana	PERSON	.

		Volume I. ,
Introduction and Reason in Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volume II. , Reason in So - ciety .

		New York :
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The statement that the work is encyclopaedic in the nature of its treatment should not suggest anything of the ponderousness that usually goes along with a philosophical survey of human reason .

		These attractive little volumes suggest the literary essayist rather than the systematic philosopher .

		And indeed they may be looked at as a series of connected essays , in which the salient aspects of experience stsuid out in relief , treated in a suggestive rather than an exhaust - ive way , and made the centre of a play of illujninating and sometimes brilliant comment , from a mind keen , original , and in possession of a single clearly-defined and fruitful point of view .

		Therefore whether one accepts , or even wholly understands , the large doctrine of the work , he will be likely to enjoy the many rela - tively independent discussions of detail scat - tered through its pages .

		The sustained fresh - ness of the treatment is rather remarkable .

		Of course there is much that is not new ; but almost invariably the treatment escapes any suspicion of the stale and commonplace .

		This is due in part to the closeness of the touch that is kept with concrete and first hand experience , and in part it is to be put to the credit of the writer 's literary gift , -- if indeed the two are not in a measure one .

		Even in the more abstruse dis - cussions , we are made constantly aware that we have to do with the interpretation of actual conscious experiences , and furthermore that these are not intellectual contents simply , but are also in every case the expression of subtle emotional reactions toward life .

		And Professor
Santayana	PERSON	is notably successful in the very diflScult task of making language suggest these most elusive and baffling implications of experi - ence .

		For one , therefore , who is willing also to think , the work is essentially readable through - out .

		It is full of keen insight wedded to apt expression .

		Take these sentences for example : ' Fanaticism coi ^ ists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim . ' '

		There is nothing sweeter than to be s -RCB- Tnpathized with , while nothing requires a rarer intellectual hero - ism than the willingness to see one 's equation written out . ' '

		Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ' '

		Activity does not consist in velocity of change , but in con - stancy of purpose . '

		* There is nothing cheaper than idealism .

		It can be had by merely not observing the ineptitude of our chance preju - dices , and by declaring that the first rhymes that have struck our ear are the eternal and necessar \ ' harmonies of the world . '

		And the description of metaph3 ` sics as the ' love affairs of the understanding . '

		Most of the especially felicitous passages , however , are too long to quote here .

		350 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Any brief summary of Professor
Santayana	PERSON	's philosophical doctrine must needs be bald and inadequate , giving but a slight idea of its sug - gestiven ^ s or of the importance of the ques - tions that it raises .

		Eeason is described as vital impulse modified by reflection and veer - ing in sympathy with judgments pronounced on the past .

		It involves two sides , therefore , either of which may exist in relative indepen - dence of the other .

		Underlying it as its ulti - mate presupposition are the dark , irrational depths of blind feeling and impulse .

		But to bring out of this anything that we can call experience or progress , anything whatever that has consicious meaning or value , it is necessary that brute sense existence should get an ideal dimension .

		Feelings must be attached to ideas ; instincts must become in some degree conscious of their ends .

		So , again , the life of ideas , of imagination , may exist parasitically in a man , hardly touching his action or environment .

		A dream is always simmering below the conven - tional surface of speech and reflection , and there may well be intense consciousness in the total absence of rationality .

		Such consciousness is suggested in dreams and in madness , and for all we know it may be found in tlie depths of universal nature .

		Eeason and humanity begin with the union of instinct and ideation , when instinct becomes enlightened , establishes values in its objects , and is turned from a pro- cess into an art , while at the same time con - sciousness becomes practical and cognitive , beginning to contain some symbol or record of the coordinate realities among which it arises .

		The
Life of Eeason	ORGANIZATION	is the happy marriage of two elements , impulse and ideation , which if wholly divorced would reduce man to a brute or to a maniac .

		The rational animal is gener - ated by the union of these two monsters .

		He is constituted by ideas that have ceased to be visionary and actions that have ceased to be vain .

		Ideals are thus the very stuff of rational life .

		The physical world itself is nothing but an instrument to explain sensations and their order , an ideal term used to mark , and as it were to justify , the adhesion in space and recurrence in time of recognizable groups of sensations .

		No doubt there is some ambiguity in calling this ideal , since we ordinarily set it off from ideals in the narrower sense as constituting the natural conditions from which ideals
spring	DATE	and on which they depend ; still the origin of both is the same in principle .

		Such conditions have already been formulated in the constructions of a mechanical science .

		These are therefore to be accepted by philosophy franldy , as the neces - sary presuppositions to be recognized in the effort to satisfy our preferences in that world of values which is the dwelling place of relig - ion and art and the other spiritual interests of man .

		While truth certainly exists , then , if existence be not too mean an attribute for that eternal realm that is tenanted by ideals , it is repugnant to physical or psychical bfcing .

		Truth means not sensible fact , but valid ideation , verified hypothesis , and inevitable and stable inference .

		Eeason is no active force , but merely a method by which objects of desire are compared in reflection .

		For the impelling and directive force we must needs fall back upon the magical involuntary nature of life ; it is subterranean , deep beneath the realm of ideas and conscious intent .

		Attention simply registers , and watches the images bubbling up in tihie living mind and the processes evolving there .

		Consciousness is a sort of ritual solemnizing , by prayer , jubila - tion , or mourning , the chief episodes in the body 's fortunes .

		Spirit is thus useless , being the end of things ; but it is not vain , since it alone rescues all else from vanity , by giving to it whatever of value it possesses .

		The aim of philosophy is of course not to manufacture ideals , but to interpret them .

		The problem is to imite a trustworthy conception of the conditions under which man lives with an adequate conception of his ideal interests .

		There are two kinds of mistakes that we may make , as has been implied already .

		The scientific radical is BO proud of having got rid of the obsolete machinery of past ideals that he remains entangled in the colossal error that the ideal itself is something adventitious and unmeaning , not having a soil in mortal life or a possible fulfillment there .

		The mistakes to which the idealist is inclined are of an opposite sort .

		He may forget that he is dealing with the product of the poetic imagination , and may try to materialize it , to turn it , as popular religion does , into a statement of existence , which he substitutes for the natural world out of which it springs .

		Or he may in another way lose sight of the connection between the ideal and the real , and deny or frown upon the natural conditions with reference to which alone the ideal has meaning .

		For what are ideals about , what do they idealize , except natural existence and natural passions ?

		The soul is but the voice of the body 's interests .

		Every phase of the ideal world emanates from the natural and loudly proclaims its origin by the interest it takes in natural existence , of which it gives a rational interpretation .

		To adjust all demands to one ideal and adjust that ideal to its natural conditions , -- this is the * steadfast art of liv - ing , ' the
Life of Eeason	ORGANIZATION	.

		With such a conception as this for his start - ing point .

		Professor
Santayana	PERSON	has of nece ^ ity the task set for him to render his general prin - ciples in terms of the concrete facts of human

		THE DTAT .

		351 life ; and to this the remaining four volumes -- of which ' Eeason in Society '' is the first -- are to be devoted .

		While * E ^ son in Society ' is much more easily digested by the reader without a technical philosophical training than the introductory volume , it is a question whether it quite fulfils the promise of its predecessor .

		Sev - eral of the chapters in the first book are really notable contributions to speculative thought . '

		Eeason in Society ' somehow strikes one as less forcible and well-rounded , less adequate to the theme .

		Nevertheless , it is a thoroughly inter - esting book .

		The first chapter -- on Love -- is possibly the most characteristic , and lends itself more readily to the author 's peculiar gifts .

		Then follow chapters on The Family , on Indus - try ,
Government	ORGANIZATION	and War , The Aristocratic Ideal , Democracy ,
Free Society	ORGANIZATION	, Patriotism , and
Ideal Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		On all these subjects something clear-cut and interesting is said ; and though the treatment is perhaps marked by a certain not wholly pleasant character of aloofness and a failure in full-blooded himian sympathy , its keen analysis and criticism of social ideals is bracing and salutary , in view of the dangerous power that a sentimental conventionalism has to obscure our recc ^ ition of social facts as they really are .

		Nevertheless one may read and admire , and still not be convinced that such a Positivism as these volumes represent is a final philo - sophical creed .

		It is acutely reasoned , with clear consciousness of the issues involved ; and if true it would vastly simplify the problems of philosophy .

		But will these admit of such a simplification ?

		There may be more to be said than the author will allow against reducing the objects of our spiritual experience without remainder to the ideal , as opposed to so-called real , existence .

		The question turns partly upon the conclusiveness of certain philosophical rea - sonings , partiy on our estimates of values ; and this is not the place to consider either .

		But one may be permitted to doubt whether the embodiment in terms of a real existence which -LRB- somewhat inconsequentially , it might appear -RRB- is allowed its right when the conception of otiier human selves is concerned , is after all to be ruled out so sharply in the case of God and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		And once admitted into the scheme of things at all , one may still more seriously question whether a right human attitude wiU allow the thoroughgoing subordination of per - sons to ideals which Professor
Santayana	PERSON	's * Eeason in Society ' throughout involves .

		At least this will seem to some readers a funda - mental weakness of the book , however difficult it might be found to establish a contrary creed .

		Comparatively few leave the beaten paths to explore the fascinating country villages , to fol - low up the course of some of the small streams , or to climb on foot or on donkey-back the steep hills to some little settlement perched forever beyond the approach of any wagon track , and there to stop long enough to see something of the life lived by its quaint people .

		Yet he who does not do this , who does not penetrate into the heaths and make the acquaintance of the Italians on their native heath , never really knows

		852 THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, ditions that to us seem full of hardship .

		The paternal system known as mezzeria or half - and-half land-tenure , prevails , based on an equal division between landowner and peasant of everything the soil produces .

		Dating back tQ the palmy days of the Roman Eepublic and having undergone many vicissitudes , it still exists in spite of occasional efforts to abolish it .

		That
Italy	LOCATION	has no wish to copy our own conditions is shown by the argument of
Signor Lambruschini	PERSON	, quoted by Mrs.
Eoss	PERSON	.

		` If you abolish mezzeria , all those families who , though poor , have a roof they can call their own , a field they can call theirs , and a master they love and bless ; who , toiling and watching under rain and sun , hope and pray to God for abundant crops for themselves and for their master , will for the first time feel the pangs of envy and hatred , the shame and despair of being forced to beg , an ^ to wait for work .

		At the same time we shall learn to dread meetings and strikes such as occur in
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, the destruction of agricultural machinery , the burning of ricks , barefaced robbery and -- as the last and miserable remedy -- the poor-tax . '

		Like all human institutions , however , mezzeria has two sides .

		Over against the community of interest it establishes between proprietor and peasant , may be set the fact that it is a bar to agricultural progress , but the old-established custom of helping the workers to tide over a bad year bears its fruits , and socialism has no followers among the contadini .

		Less practical , but more picturesque and poetic , than Mrs.
Boss	PERSON	's book is the work entitled ` The Medici Balls , ' written by two American women who also have known
Italy	LOCATION	as residents , and not as mere tour - ists .

		The title is a bit far-fetched ; hav - ing made seven little journeys in
Tuscany	LOCATION	and ' in all their travels , even in lanes and modest farm houses , having found themselves under the aegis of the powerful banker-princes of
Florence	LOCATION	, ' they call their account of these seven journeys ' The Medici Balls , ' from the seven balls on the shield as worn by Piero de '
Medici	PERSON	when the Medicean supremacy was at its height .

		The places visited are The
Mugello	LOCATION	,
Prato	LOCATION	,
Ohianti	PERSON	and the
Impruneta	LOCATION	,
Lucca	LOCATION	,
Pistoja	LOCATION	, the
Hills of Brancoli	ORGANIZATION	, and
Barga	LOCATION	.

		It is the illus - trations quite as much as the text that make the charm of this book .

		Nearly all of these pictures , numbering more than one hundred , are quite new , being taken by the travellers ' own kodak .

		Olive orchards and vineyards and trellised vines , the large , white , violet-eyed Tiis - can oxen driven by kindly-faced peasants ; walled towns , towers , and fortresses ; peasants and priests faring along winding lanes ; straw - plaiters , with busy fingers weaving in front of cottage doors , -- all those scenes that one sees continually in
Italy	LOCATION	and nowhere else in the world , -- ^ making a charming portfolio of studies to be enjoyed by all , but most by those Avho can fill in the pictures by memory of the golden touch of sun and color and fragrance with which the real
Italy	LOCATION	caresses all .

		Like the two pleasant volumes just noticed , Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	's ' Italian Backgrounds ' is a collection of impressions and essays about
Italy	LOCATION	.

		But while the others are books merely , this is literature .

		Through this travellei ^ s story runs a fine thread of scholarship , of savoir fairs , of cosmopolitanism , not easily to be matched in travel-literature .

		The reader 's pulse quickens with an artistic pleasure such as might be aroused by a novel by
Thackeray	PERSON	or
George Eliot	PERSON	, or an essay by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	or
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		The book has what we call distinc - tion of style , as impossible to resist as to define .

		Whither Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	goes , and what are the subjects of her chapters , it is not important to mention .

		Any particular geography is not the point in question when the guide is one so steeped in the spirit of the ` land in which any - thing may happen save the dull , the obvious , and the expected . '

		If in Mrs. ^ ^ ^ larton 's pages we do not see
Italy	LOCATION	steadily and see it whole , we do a better thing , -- we trust ourselves to a stream of impressions and memories that is much more inspiring than any mere observation .

		Indeed , had Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	been practical and well - advised , some of her most delightful experi - ences would have been lacking .

		For example , everyone would recommend for
August	DATE	an Alpine village rather than an Italian journey ; at Spliigen is not the air pure and fresh and cool ?

		But
Spliigen	PERSON	was guilty of the unforgiv - able offence of \ being too near
Italy	LOCATION	.

		` One can forgive a place three thousand miles from
Italy	LOCATION	for not being Italian ; but that a village on the very border should remain stolidly , immovably Swiss was a constant source of exasperation .

		Even the landscape had neglected its opportunities .

		.

		Was it better to be cool and look at a waterfall , or be hot and look at
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	's ?

		Was it better to walk on gentians or on mosaic , to smell fir-needles or incense ?

		Was it , in short , ever well to be else - where when one might be in
Italy	LOCATION	? '

		Everyone who has invented excuses for going to
Italy	LOCATION	, or for postponing departure from it , will foresee what happened .

		` We tried to quell the rising madness by interro - gating the travellers .

		Was it very hot on the lakes and in
Milan	LOCATION	?

		`` Terribly , '' they answered , and mopped their brows .

		`` Unimaginative idiots ! ''

		we grumbled , and forebore to question the next batch .

		Of course it was hot there -- but what of that !

		Gradually we began to picture our sensa - tions should we take seats in the diligence on its return journey .

		From that moment we were lost .

		The two diligences have the silent square to themselves .

		There they stand , side by side in dusty slumber , till the morning cow-bells wake them to departure .

		One goes back to Thusis ; to the

		353 region of good hotels , pure air and scenic platitudes .

		It may go empty for all we care .

		But the other .

		the other wakes from its Alpine sleep to climb the cold pass at sunrise and descend by hot windings into the land where the church steeples turn into campaniU , where the vine , breaking from perpendicular bondage , flings a liberated embrace about the mulberries , and far off , beyond the plain , the mirage of domes and spires , of painted walls and sculptured altars , beckons across the dustiest tracts of memory .

		In that diligence our seats are taken . '

		To make any new artistic discovery in
Italy	LOCATION	at
this late day	TIME	, would seem hardly likely .

		But such was Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's joyful experience .

		At
San Yivaldo	LOCATION	, a secluded mon - astery somewhat difficult of access , she found a series of pictures representing the
Via Crucis	LOCATION	, having only a local fame but usually ascribed to Gk -RRB- nnelli of the seventeenth century .

		This late origin , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's keen sense for the characteristics of the different periods of Ital - ian art rejected at once .

		The treatment was seen to be that of an artist trained in an earlier tradition .

		The careful modelling of the hands , the quiet grouping , free from effort and agita - tion , the simple draperies , the devotional expression of the faces , all pointed to the latter p ^ of the fifteenth century .

		Expert testi - mony has since confirmed the author 's opinion at every point , and a beautiful photogravure of a group from * The Crucifixion , ' placed as a frontispiece to this volume , enables the reader to judge for himself .

		How many such ' finds ' may yet await in Italian by-ways , who shall say ?

		Certain it is that our new faculty for the differentiation of styles in painting is rapidly doing away with our unquestioned allegiance to authority and pushing many of the old attribu - tions to the wall .

		The temptation to quote from a book of such fine flavor as this of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's is great but must be resisted .

		The delicate and sym - pathetic drawings made by Mr.
E. C. Peixotto	PERSON	are worthy illustrations of the text .

		Although it is true , as Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	says , that * there is no short cut to an intimacy with
Italy	LOCATION	, ' still a book like her own is something for which to be grateful as an alluring , though roundabout , ^ ay - Anxa Bexxesox Mc ^ Iahax .

		PlOXEERS OF WESTEKX EXPLORATIOX .

		* In her volume entitled * Pathfinders of the West * Miss
Agnes Laut	PERSON	, one of that brilliant little group of Canadians who are so creditably upholding the intellectual reputation of their country in
Xew York	LOCATION	, adds another and a very delightful volume to the growing literature of early western exploration .

		This is the story • Pathtindebs of the
West	LOCATION	.

		By
A. C. Laut	PERSON	, Illus - trated .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the romantic and adventurous lives of
Radis	PERSON	- son , LaVerendrye ,
Heame	ORGANIZATION	,
Mackenzie	PERSON	, and
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	.

		Above all it is the story of
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	, in whose behalf Miss Laut unhesi - tatingly challenges the giant form of estab - lished opinion .

		In her * Foreword ' she says : ` The question will at once occur why no mention is made of
Marquette	ORGANIZATION	and Jolliet and La Salle in a work on the pathfinders of the
West	LOCATION	.

		The simple answer is -- they were not pathfinders .

		Contrary to the notions imbibed at school , and repeated in all histories of the `` West ,
Marquette	LOCATION	,
Jolliet	PERSON	, and La Salle did not discover the vast region beyond the Great Lakes .

		Twelve years before these explorers had thought of visiting the land which the French hunter designated as the Pays d'en Haut , the West had already been discovered by the most intrepid voyageurs that
France	LOCATION	produced , -- men whose wide - ranging explorations exceeded the achievements of Gartier and Champlain and La Salle put together . '

		Thus Miss Laut throws down the gauntlet to the historians , and we learn from the '
Adden	PERSON	- dum '' to her * Foreword ' that her statements have already been challenged , and sharply chal - lenged , from all parts of the country .

		Tlie author 's explanation of the long oblivion obscuring the names of
Sieur Pierre Esprit Badisson	PERSON	and his fellow-explorer
Menard Chou	PERSON	- art Groseillers , is this : '
Badisson	PERSON	and GroseiUers defied , first
New France	LOCATION	, then Old
France	LOCATION	, and lastly
England	LOCATION	.

		While on friendly terms with the church , they did not make their explorations subservient to the propagation of ^ the faith .

		In consequence , they were ignored by both
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	. '

		After citing the original sources from which she has drawn the material for her narrative .

		Miss Laut proceeds : ` The historians of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, animated by the hostility of their respective governments , either slurred over the discoveries of Badisson and GroseiUers entirely , or blackened their memories without the slightest regard to truth .

		It would , in fact , take a large volume to contradict and disprove half the lies written of these two men .

		Instead of consulting contemporaneous documents , -- which would have entailed both cost and labor , -- modem writers have , unfortunately , been satisfied to serve up a rehash of the detractions written by the old historians .

		In
1885	DATE	came a discovery that punished such slovenly methods by practically wiping out the work of the pseudo-historians .

		There was found in the British Museum , the Bodleian Library , and
Hudson 's Bay House	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, an unmistakably authentic record of
Badisson	ORGANIZATION	's voyages , written by himself . '

		Having thus dug down to the solid rock of contemporaneous documents .

		Miss Laut pro- ceeds to build up her story with consummate skill .

		One can conceive that even the romantic story of
Pierre Esprit Eadisson	ORGANIZATION	might , in some hands , have been made dry and uninteresting .

		As here told it is fascinating to the last degree .

		Miss Laut brings to her work not only the historian 's tireless search for truth , but as weU the fire and imagination and creative power of 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, a novelist and poet .

		Her work is not merely authentic , and founded , as history must always be founded , on the original documents , but it is vivified by the touch of an artist .

		The dry bones of fragmentary narratives have been breathed upon , and the man Radisson , with all his faults and all his virtues , stands before us .

		Dr.
Dionne	PERSON	of
Quebec	LOCATION	, Dr.
Bryce	PERSON	of
Winni	PERSON	- peg , and above all the veteran historian of French
Canada	LOCATION	,
Benjamin Suite	PERSON	, whose ` destructive criticism of inaccuracies in old and modem records has done so much to stop people writing history out of their heads and to put research on an honest basis , ' have from time to time combated the long-established prejudice against
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	and the authenticity of his western and northern explorations , but it remained for Miss Laut to present his case 80 vividly and attractively that it becomes a positive pleasure to be convinced .

		It is not necessary to assume that every one , whether competent to form an authoritative opinion or otherwise , must accept unreservedly all Miss Laut 's conclusions .

		There will doubt - less still remain in many minds moot points in connection with
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	's third and fourth voyages .

		Nevertheless , it may be said without fear of serious contradiction that Miss Laut has established her main contentions -- that Radisson discovered the North - West , as well as the overland route to
Hudson	LOCATION	's Bay , -- and that she has done more than any other writer to rehabilitate the memory of the explorer in the minds of all unprejudiced people .

		` There is no need to point out
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	's faults .

		They are written on his life without extenuation or excuse , so that all may read .

		There is less need to 6ulogize his virtues .

		They declare themselves in every act of his life .

		This , only , should be remem - bered .

		Like all enthusiasts ,
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	could not have been a hero , if he had not been a bit of a fool .

		If he had not had his faults , if he had not been as impulsive , as daring , as reckless , as inconstant , as improvident of the morrow , as a savage or a child , he would not have accomplished the exploration of half a continent .

		Men who weigh consequences are not of the stuff to win empires .

		Had Radisson hag - gled as to the means , he would have missed or mud - dled the end .

		He went ahead ; and when the way did not open , he went round , or crawled over , or carved his way through . '

		Only those who have groped their way slowly and painfully through the extraordinary mazes of
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	's English , in the original narra - tives * , can properly appreciate the charm of Miss Laut 's version .

		While maintaining in every particular the spirit of the original , and even some of its quaint phraseology , she has * Here is a sample , taken from the narrative of the fourth voyage : '' They -LSB- the Octanacks -RSB- are the coursedest unablest , the unfamous and cowardiest people that I have seene amongst fower score nations that I have frequented . ''

		One gathers , at any rate , that
Radisson	PERSON	did not think much of - the Octanacks .

		condensed here , expanded there , interpreted elsewhere , and thrown over the whole the glamor of romance , until the narrative stands out as a clear , compact , and most graphic story .

		Of the remainder of Miss Laut 's book limita - tions of space forbid more than the briefest mention .

		While by no means so important as contributions to history , her accounts of LaVerendrye 's quest of the far-famed Western Sea , of
Samuel Hearne	PERSON	's search for the North - west Passage , of
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	's splendid exploits in pushing his way north to the Arctic , and then crossing the Rockies -LRB- the first White Man -RRB- to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and of the notable expedition of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, are marked by the same clear - ness of statement and charm of style that we have already noted in the Radisson story .

		It only remains to note the number and qual - ity of the illustrations with which the narra - tives are so plentifully supplied .

		They number some sixty in all , and many of them are from old and rare prints , hitherto inaccessible .


Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	.

		The PHiLosoT '' Hy of Good Fortttne .

		* There is something essentially modern in a moral philosophy that preaches salvation through good fortune .

		For centuries the Stoic has had an acknowledgment of merit entirely denied to the Epicurean .

		The
Church	ORGANIZATION	teaches the blessedness of renunciation , penance , and asceticism ;
Kant	PERSON	, apart from the Church , builds his philosophy on the doctrine of original sin , and finds redemption only in a conscious intellectual struggle against inherent human weakness and imperfection .

		Even Tolstoy and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	advocate the return to Nature that implies the inferiority of all man-made devices for enriching life .

		It remains for the twentieth century moralists to develop a system that advo - cates nothing unpleasant , that takes for granted no innate and unconquerable sinfulness in man , and that offers a scheme of life based upon a secure belief in the ultimate perfection of the race through its own effort .

		The growth of this idea has been synchronous with the supplementing of the economic doe - trine of individual rights by the broader one of social rights , and the development from in - voluntary social cooperation to voluntary and conscious cooperation .

		The new moral code is , in fact , an ; outgrowth of the new code of social economics .

		The same methods of reasoning that justified the conclusion that child-labor was economic waste prove that child-labor is • The Children of Good Fortune .

		An Essay In Morals .

		By
C. Hanford Henderson	ORGANIZATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 355 equally moral waste ; the same theory that de - nies to a nation a strength greater than the strength of its component parts denies to a com - munity a social welfare exceeding the good for - tune of the individual members of the com - munity .

		One of the leading American advocates of the new philcKophy is Mr.
C. Hanford Henderson	PERSON	, whose ' Education and the Larger Life ' marked an epoch in literature of its class .

		In that book , published almost three years ago , Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son developed the educational side of the ques - tion , using the term education not in its narrow technical sense but to signify the entire process of human development from the cradle to the grave .

		He advxx?ated such a training of the senses as woidd lead to the highest and most complete expression .

		His ideal of education was that which resulted in the greatest bodily strength , intellectual receptivity , and spiritual insight .

		To this he added the idea of efficiency , -- ^ the power to put into successful practice the newly acquired knowledge of what was worth while .

		This unity of worth and efficiency as a defi - nite moral standard is the theme of Mr.
Hen	PERSON	- derson 's latest book , * The Children of Good Fortune . '

		The author states his case thus : ` To apply morality in the concerns of the indi - vidual life is to adopt religion .

		It is to become the highest type of man , the philosopher artist , for the philosopher is the man of clear vision , the believer in cause and effect , the one who sees in what happi - ness essentially consists ; and the artist is the doer , the man who carries cause and effect into beneficent action , and practically reaKzes happiness .

		The philosopher represents worth of ends and the artist efficiency of means .

		The moral person must be a combination of the two , the man who knows and the man who does .

		He must be competent and he must be wise .

		If he be neither of these , or only one of them , he is not moral , no matter what his calling or pretensions , no matter what he thinks of himself or others think of him , no matter what his family or possessions .

		The man who demands suc - cess of himself demands a great deal , but if he ask less he is not in earnest in his search for the moral life . '

		Even
Browning	PERSON	never preached so rigid a doc - trine as that .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has little sympathy with fruit - less good intentions .

		Frankly and uncompro - misingly he blames desert for unsuccess .

		Worth of ends without efficiency of means he condemns as * the immorality of the second-best , ' just as completely as he condemns the converse .

		With characteristic humor he writes : ' One would prefer to strike for heaven and make only a few steps on the journey , rather than to set out for
Hoboken	LOCATION	and get there .

		But the fact re - mains that it would have been still better to have made Heaven . '

		Xor is Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	content with static goodness as a worthy end .

		To him the good life , that which represents good fortune , must be palpitating , vital , experimental .

		There is no virtue in inexperience .

		* It is a curiously inverted view of morals , the view which regards as praiseworthy those narrow , inexperienced , poverty-stricken souls whose slender virtue consists in the evil they have omitted to do .

		To renounce the world , to renounce Uf e , to renounce the self , -- this is not the path of the moral life .

		The timid little souls who live in a corner and keep out of harm 's way by keeping out of the way of good , are not moral persons .

		They are not even harmless , for by their cowardice they inspire others with a similar lack of courage .

		Resignation , renunciation , self-sacrifice , asceticism , monasticism , all the cheap devices by which men and women abdicate life , are as unsound morally as the more amusing devices by which men and women abuse life . '

		This radical denunciation of the doctrine of self-sacrifice , which we have been accustomed to regard as the basis of morality , seemed rev - olutionary when it was first met in ' Education and the Larger Life . '

		It was a part of the conventional creed that had been taught for generations , and that received respect for its age if for nothing else .

		The only way for Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	to redeem his fault was for him to offer , in place of the doctrine he so boldly dis - carded , some new code of deeper worth and greater efficiency in creating happy human be - ings and a better state .

		This he has done in his ' Children of Good Fortune . '

		For self-sacrifice , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	substitutes self-realization ; for renunciation , that eager seeking after good fortune which promotes both individual happiness and social welfare .

		To him good fortune is not * a tangible possession , to be mentioned in one 's last will and testa - ment , and subject to the inheritance tax . '

		It is an individual ideal , varying according to a man 's possession of the human wealth of strength , beauty , accomplishment , and goodness .

		To one it is health , to another fame , wealth to a third , and knowledge to a fourth .

		It is that which the individual man most wants .

		` Good fortune is a personal possession , an affair of consciousness .

		However a man comes by it , it must be his own ideal of good fortune .

		For no man can follow a light which he does not see .

		The tragedy of
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	comes in large part from the per - sistent ' attempt to force our own ideas down our neighbor 's throat .

		The pathos of life comes in large part from his too amiable compliance , his vain attempt to follow a light he does not see .

		If we ourselves have found the light , or believe that we have , let us by all means try to reveal it to our brother .

		If he share our confidence in believing that we have a light not yet perceived by him , let him by all means try to catch sight of the beatific vision !

		But .

		meanwhile , let us be ourselves , both me and my brother , the sincere followers of such light as we genuinely have . '

		356 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, The chief necessity for the achievement of this good fortune , next to the ambition to achieve it , is freedom .

		We are all bound to a greater or less extent by the tyranny of circum - stance , hampered by bodily weakness , mental or manual incapacity , the accident of birth .

		There seems , in the nature of things , no way to escape from these marks of our humanity , al - though determined effort may lessen the evils entailed .

		But there is a freedom that any state may well attain when there are within it enough individuals who desire this as a part of their good fortune .

		That is the mingKng of the anarchist ideal of non-interference and the so - cialist ideal of opportunity , which shall still leave to the individual his initiative while se - curing to him the nearest possible release from the tyranny of things .

		This is only another in - stance of the unity of social welfare and indi - vidual good fortune .

		Every man who desires such freedom in his own life and works to se - cure it for himself helps to give it to those more helplessly bound , to raise the standard of gen - eral good fortune .

		Summing up his arguments in favor of the new philosophy , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	writes : ' To save myself , -- and therefore to save that part of society for which I am directly responsible , -- 1 must do three things .

		I must blot out all impulses and desires that are evil .

		It is negative work , rather a dull sort of weeding in the garden of the heart , and not calculated to arouse any great enthu - siasm , but it is very necessary .

		Then I must culti - vate the impulses and desires that are good , make habits of them , for the garden devoid of wheat is hardly better than a garden full of tares .

		Finally I must work , not merely for good fortune , for happi - ness , but for high good fortune , for great happiness .

		I want not only to be saved from evil and to attain good , but I want the largest good , the most wel - fare . '

		It is this insatiable greed for happiness , this longing for more and ever more good fortune , which all of Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's work breathes , that makes it inspiring and effective .

		It satis - fies a natural human instinct , -- the desire to be - lieve that happiness is righteousness and that every man possesses within himself that power of pereonal salvation that shall be also the sal - vation of the race .

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's books , moreover , are not written from strange heights which none but the moral philosopher can scale .

		They are clear and simple , showing a rare first - hand knowledge of the larger life .

		They com - bine to an unusual extent the attitudes of the observer and the experimentalist ; they are at once dispassionate and enthusiastic .

		It is easy to predict for ' The Children !

		of Good Fortune ' a welcome equal to that accorded to ' Education and the Larger Life , ' and one equally deserved .


Edith J. R. Isaacs	PERSON	.

		Brieps ox Xe ^ v Books .

		The ' ` White Since the
Boxer	PERSON	uprising of five Peril ' in years ago much has been made the Orient .

		of the so-called ` yellow peril ' and of the alleged necessity that rests upon west - ern peoples to exercise eternal vigilance to protect themselves against a threatened gigantic outburst of Oriental savagery and lust of con - quest .

		It has remained for Dr.
Sidney L. Gulick	PERSON	, in his recent book on ' The White Peril in the Far East ' -LRB-
Bevell	PERSON	-RRB- , to turn matters around and con - sider the relations of Orient and Occident exclu - sively from the standpoint of the traditions and interests of the former .

		That Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	is entirely competent to speak upon the subject no one can doubt who has read his deservedly popu - lar volume on ` The Evolution of the Japanese . '

		After seventeen years of constant intercourse with men in all stations in
Japan	LOCATION	he is able to give us , not only a highly interesting interpreta - tion of the fundamental character of Japanese civilization and life , but also a thoroughly con - vincing statement of the attitude of the Japanese toward the outside world to-day , especially as revealed in the conduct of the war with
Russia	LOCATION	.

		This , indeed , is the main purport of the book , -- to show how
Japan	LOCATION	attained the power , material and temperamental , to face and conquer the Muscovite , and to explain the significance of the war as ` an act in the tragedy of the white peril . '

		By the white peril Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	means at bottom the proneness of western nations to force the peoples of the Orient out of their natural channels of development , through efforts to exploit their economic resources and donainate their affairs for political , commercial , or financial ends .

		For
Japan	LOCATION	the danger has in times past been very real ; to-day it scarcely exists , except from
Russia	LOCATION	, and the prospective outcome of the present war promises at least temporary relief from that quarter .

		If upon its first intimate con - tact with western races an Oriental people has backbone enough to adopt ideas and institutions that are beneficent without falling into mere ser - vility , the white peril becomes for it the white blessing ; and this , on the whole , is what
Japan	LOCATION	has done .

		` The white peril , ' says Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	, ` so long feared , has proved for
Japan	LOCATION	to be the very tonic and stimulus required to place her in the advance guard of progressive nations . '

		The field where the white peril is most seriously to be reckoned with is
China	LOCATION	, for there seems small ground for hope that
China	LOCATION	will succeed as
Japan	LOCATION	has done in thwarting the designs of greedy nations upon her integrity .

		Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	expects Japanese victory in the present war to have some weight in inducing the white man to treat the yellow man with justice and civility , but in his judgment the problem of the white peril can be solved ultimately only through belief on part of the white race in the essential equality in worth and rights of all men .

Madame Mary King Waddington	ORGANIZATION	's second instalment of letters , ` Italian Letters of a Diplomat 's Wife ' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , gives many a pleasing glimpse .

		As seen through her eyes the men and women she meets are all interesting and interested .

		Three months --
February	DATE	,
March , April , 1880	DATE	-- were spent by her and her husband in
Italy	LOCATION	, chiefly in
Rome	LOCATION	.


M. Waddington	PERSON	had just resigned the French pre - miership , and the two were off on a vacation .


Eugene Schuyler	PERSON	, who had manied a sister of Mme.
Waddington	PERSON	, was then consul-general at
Rome	LOCATION	, and of the Schuylers and numerous other King and
Waddington	PERSON	friends and connections we hear much in the course of the book .

		The high oflicial and social station of our tourists secured them the most cordial reception in the highest quarters .

		At an audience with the Pope , his Holiness advanced to meet them so hospitably that the regulation curtseys were impossible ; and he even made them sit down , one on each side of him , and they had a really interesting three - quarters-of-an-hour talk .

		As Mme.
Waddington	PERSON	speaks of having some years before ` approached ' Pope
Pius IX.	PERSON	, and as she afterward describes an audience with the present pontiff , the reader incidentally acquires some little familiarity with papal receptions .

		Audiences with King * Hum - bert , with Queen
Margherita	PERSON	, a dinner at the Ger - man
Embassy	ORGANIZATION	with Crown Princess
Frederick	PERSON	, balls and other functions at the different embas - sies , and a succession of less important society events , furnish ample matter for the letters Mme.
Waddington	PERSON	so dutifully and so frequently despatched to her mother in
America	LOCATION	and to other members of the family .

		Twenty-four years later , in the same three months of
February	DATE	,
March	DATE	, and
April	DATE	, she revisited
Italy	LOCATION	, this time a widow , and took up the old round of sight-seeing and social functions .

		The book as a whole , though entertaining , hardly equals its predecessor in interest .

		It has no comation of a Czar , for one thing ; and perhaps the scenes described are too familiar to arouse and sustain the keenest curi - osity .

		One queries , too , whether here and there a letter has not been ` doctored ' for the press , as for example the one containing a long reminis - cent passage -LRB- more than twenty pages -RRB- describ - ing an ascent of Vesuvius and other events that occurred in
1867	DATE	.

		A delightfully human touch is Queen
Elena	PERSON	's chat about her children and how they prized above their other playthings a rag doll given them by the wife of the American Ambassador .

		Numerous illustrations accompany the text , but most of the portraits are disappoint - ing .

		Chapters on That the drama does not occupy contemporary anything like its rightful position dramatists .

America	LOCATION	a vital intellect - ual force as it is in
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	, and even in the lesser European countries , is a fact so obvious that it hardly calls for statement .

		The remedy for an evil is apt to follow a close realization of its existence , and the wider our acquaintance with what the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	stage is doing for literature , the nearer we shall come to the rehabilitation of a branch of letters in which
England	LOCATION	once set a shining example for the rest of the world .

		For this reason , if for no other , we should welcome such books as Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	's ` Iconoclasts ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- and Professor Edward
Everett Hale	PERSON	's ` Dramatists of To-day ' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		But both books deserve a welcome on their own account , for they are noteworthy examples of literary criticism in one of the most interesting of literary fields .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's book discusses no less than twelve contemporary dramatists , while Mr.
Hale	PERSON	's book considers four of the same list , and adds three others .

		The writers discussed in both books are
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	,
Herr Suder	PERSON	- mann ,
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	; Mr.
Hale	PERSON	's list is completed by
M. Rostand	PERSON	, Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	, and Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, and Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's by Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	,
Herr Strindberg	PERSON	, Mil .

		Becque and
Hervieu	PERSON	, Yilliers de I ` Isle
Adam	PERSON	, Princess
Mathilde	PERSON	, Sig .

		d'Annunzio , and Mr.
Gorky	PERSON	.

		The two books together are thus seen to provide a varied menu of the most interesting character , although its thorough digestion by English stomachs -LRB- not wholly used to such strong meat -RRB- may be a matter of some diflSculty .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's manner of writing is pointed and almost brilliant , but the joumadistic origin of his essays is too apparent .

		He is sometimes violent in his way of saying things , as if he were determined , writing about ` iconoclasts , ' to show that he could , an he would , do a pretty ` stunt ' at image-breaking himself .

		He gives us many epigrams , some his own , others felicitously borrowed for the occasion .

		His longest paper is upon Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, and is useful for its summaries of plots , besides being stimulating in its suggestiveness .

		Professor
Hale	PERSON	's book has a na'ivetS of style that is engaging , and he estab - lishes confidential relations with the reader from the start .

		But his impressionistic method and conversational maimer do not preclude the exhibi - tion of verj ' definite opinions , clearly reasoned and amply fortified by example .

		Besides the discussions of his seven chosen dramatists , he gives us a ` Note on Standards of Criticism ' , and an essay on ' Our Idea of Tragedy ' .

		An appendix presents a useful table of plays , with the dates and places of their first productions .

		A certain portion of the contents of this book will be recog - nized by our readers as having been reprinted from The Dial , but they will find it well worth reading a second time .

		TJie story Recently , on a ramble through the of a famous island of
Guernsey	LOCATION	, Mr.
Henry	PERSON	love affair .


Wellington Wack	LOCATION	came across a bundle of papers that had been thrown out as valueless by the occupants of
Hauteville House	ORGANIZATION	368 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, after
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's death .

		An examination showed them to comprise a fragment of a journal and some letters addressed to the poet .

		The journal seems to be a small part of the journal of Frangois Hugo described by
M. Octave Uzanne	PERSON	in ` Scribner 's Magazine ' in
1892	DATE	.

		It contains nothing of importance .

		Of the letters , two are from a young woman who writes in an ecstacy of admiration and devotion to arrange further secret interviews with her * sublime poet ' ; they were written during the
fall of 1851	DATE	.

		The others , about forty in number , are from ` Juliette , ' the beautiful Princess
Negroni	PERSON	of the first represen - tations of ` Lucrece Borgia , ' who , as everybody knows , was destined to play in the drama of
Vic	PERSON	- tor Hugo 's life , as
Madame Drouet	ORGANIZATION	, a part infi - nitely more important than any that her meagre histrionic talents permitted her to aspire to in the mimic actions of the stage .

		These letters , with one exception , are also from
1851	DATE	.

		The other , from
1836	DATE	, is the only one of real interest in connection with the history of the poet .

		These letters exhibit the attitude of Madame Drouet towards Hugo , but not for the first time .

		They but repeat the expressions of letters that had already been published .

		And though this repe - tition was doubtless sweet to the object of
Madame Drouet	ORGANIZATION	's devotion , and perhaps did not cease to be so through all the thousands of mis - sives -LRB- six thousand are still preserved -RRB- of that long correspondence , it is not particularly illu - mining to the student of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's life or interesting to the general reader .

		These letters are , however , now made the occasion for the pub - lication of a book of one hundred and fifty pages of wide-spaced lines and open print , of which the letters fill about fifty pages .

		Twenty pages are given to an introductory notice by
M. Francois Coppee	ORGANIZATION	, in which personal reminiscences and anec - dotes of Hugo , not always new , are told with a charm that suffers sometimes at the hands of the translator , and not without a sly thrust at
Hugo	ORGANIZATION	's republicanism in a reference to the pres - ent republic 's use of exile as a mode of dealing with political opponents .

		The rest of the book is mainly taken up with a rather scrappy account of Hugo 's life and home surroundings at
Haute	LOCATION	- ville
House	ORGANIZATION	, in the course of which Mr.
Wack	PERSON	betrays the fact that he is no authority on mat - ters of Hugo biography .

		Less than twenty pages are devoted to the story of the ` Romance of
Vic	PERSON	- tor Hugo and
Juliette Drouet	PERSON	' that the title promises ; and these pages are but a rather unsat - isfactory summary of an article by
M. Leon Seche	PERSON	in the ` Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	' for
February 15 , 1903	DATE	.

		There was in Mr.
Wack	PERSON	's treasure-trove hardly the excuse for a short magazine article .

		His book is quite without adequate raison d' etre .

		-LRB- Putnam . -RRB-

		Dr.
Alexander H. Japp	PERSON	, who found about ` R.l ' .

		s. ' ^ publisher for ` Treasure Island ' and a public for its author , has a better warrant than most to write about
Steven	PERSON	- son .

		Of this , he has taken advantage in his recently-published volume entitled `
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	: A Record , an Estimate , and a Mem - orial ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , in which some personal remi - niscence is supplemented by much criticism , original and quoted , and by a little controversy .

		The chapters supplying the latter element deal with
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	as an amateur critic , and with Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	as an authority on the subject of the history of the ` Treasure Island ' manu - script .

		The criticism is largely of the familiar appreciative order ; and since so few dissentient voices are admitted to the chorus of praise , it seems a pity to give so much prominence to Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's unfortunate utterance .

		There can be little need to-day of lengthy quotation from this article , even for the sake of refutation .

		Dr.
Japp	PERSON	gives
Stevenson	PERSON	's dramatic attempts a decidedly fuller share of consideration than they have hitherto received from most critics .

		Accord - ing to him , the chief flaw of these compositions is lack of ethical purpose , -- a failure to believe that ` goodness and self-sacrifice and surrender are the only strength in the universe . '

		The admission might seem to render untenable the position in the ranks of the optimists that , curi - ously enough , seems to have been awarded
Stev	PERSON	- enson to-day by almost universal consent .

		But Dr.
Japp	PERSON	qualifies his criticism by ascribing
Stev	PERSON	- enson 's immoral and consequently undramatic belief that ' badheartedness was strength ' to the influence of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	.

		It seems as though a phrase in a passage quoted from
M. Marcel Schwob	PERSON	might go further towards explaining
Stevenson	PERSON	's weakness as a dramatist , as well as his failure in other respects , with all his mar - vellous attainments , to reach the highest level .

		In speaking of
Stevenson	PERSON	's characters ,
M. Schwob	PERSON	says : ` Ce sont des fantomes de la v ^ rite ; hallueinants comme de vrais fantomes . '

		And to those readers who , loving
Stevenson	PERSON	the man no less than the writer , are yet able to see him with - out the glamor through which some of his wor - shippers delight to gaze at their idol , the criti - cism may seem to have application to the life of its subject as well as to his work .

		In the dedi - cation of `
David Balfour	PERSON	, ' written shortly before his death ,
Stevenson	PERSON	said that ` he bowed his head before the romance of destiny . '

		Destiny had in truth given him a life full of the romance that he loved , but in so doing set him something apart from the rest of us , to whom losses and gains come more dully .

		And if the life he gave his characters seems more unreal than that which belongs to the work of less skilful artists , what wonder ?

		The life and ' ^ ^ ^ notion that artists are the fit - work of test persons to write understand -
Aliert Durer	PERSON	.

		ingly about art and artists would be truer were discernment always matched by power of verbal expression .

		Mr.
T. Sturge Moore	PERSON	's volume on
Albert Diirer	PERSON	,
Avhich	PERSON	is the latest addition to the ` Library of Art ' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , is an instance of an excellent book marred by an involved and slipshod style .

		This , together with the rambling treatment and frequent use of metaphor , makes it somewhat difficult to read .

		Three sentences from the first of the biographi - cal chapters may be cited as characteristic . '

		It is perhaps Impossible to place oneself in the centre of that horizon which was of necessity his and belonged to his day , a vast circle from which men could no more

		THE DIAL 359 escape than we from ours ; this cage of iron ignorance -LSB- sici in which every human soul is trapped , and to widen and enlarge which every heroic soul lives and dies .

		This cage appeared to his eyes very different from what It does to ours ; yet it has always been a cage , and is only lost sight of at times when the light from within seems to flow forth , and with its radiant sapphire heaven of buoyancy and desire to veil the eternal bars .

		It is well to remind ourselves that ignorance was the most momentous , the most cruel condition of his life , as of our own ; and that the effort to relieve himself of Its pressure , either by the pursuit of knowledge , or by giving spur and bridle to the imagination that it might course round him dragging the great woof of illusion and tent him in the ethereal dream of the soul 's desire , was the constant effort and resource of his days . '

		Comment is supplied by the author himself when he says , though in another connection , that ` it is easier to bob to such phrases than to understand them . '

		The book does not claim to embody any new research .

		In form it is an elaborate essay , or sequence of essays , on
Diirer	ORGANIZATION	's life and work , considered in relation to certain general ideas which are rather vaguely set forth in the first section .

		In deference , no doubt , to
Diirer	ORGANIZATION	's search for a canon of proportion for the human figure , the opening chapter deals with various truisms under the caption of ` The Idea of Pro- pK > rtion , ' as the author calls it , though ` composi - tion ' is the usual term for what he has in mind .

		This is followed by a chapter on the influence of religion on the creative impulse , which Mr.
Moore	PERSON	holds to be the vital force that prevents its per - vei ` sion or exhaustion .

		The really valuable parts of the book are those that deal with
Diirer	ORGANIZATION	's life in relation to his times , and with his work as a creator .

		The chapters on the former subject have been drawn chiefly from
Sir Martin Con	ORGANIZATION	- way 's ` Literary Remains of
Albrecht Diirer	PERSON	' and Professor Thausing 's
Life of Diirer	ORGANIZATION	.

		So far as possible the story is told in the artist 's own words , through extracts from his letters and diary , and is of great interest .

		In his estimate of Diirer as an artist Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is eminently sound and dis - criminating .

		Here he is on sure ground , and his words may be taken without the grain of salt that is needed in reading other parts of his work .

		He sees clearly in what the greatness of Diirer consists , -- that he was a marvellous draughts - man , an engraver of unsurpassed skill , a designer of the very first rank , but not a painter born , in the sense that Titian and
Correggio	LOCATION	and Rem - brandt were , or the equal of these masters as a colourist .

		The author 's aesthetic judgments are made more intelligible by the abundant illustra - tions , many of them from drawings and the less well-known works of the artist .

		These are ac - ceptably reproduced ; and through the courtesy of the
Diirer Society	ORGANIZATION	four of their photogravures of copperplate engravings are included .

		Mr.
Robert Ross	PERSON	, to whose care the fasTvoYuLT inanuscript was confided , has edited Oscar `` Wilde 's posthumous work ` De Profundis ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , written during the unhappy man 's imprisonment and preceding in point of time the composition of ` The Ballad of Reading Gaol . '

		The essay has , as might be expected , great literary charm , and possesses im - questioned authenticity as a contribution toward the comprehension of the abnormal and in many ways inexplicable psychology of its author .

		WiJde confesses to nothing more than a sense of outrage upon finding himself reduced to the sorry lot of a common felon , confirming the impression that he was quite without sense of guilt .

		It can - not be said that at any point in his narrative does remorse for his crime manifest itself ; he is content with reprobation of the general hedonism by which he governed his destiny ; contrition and repentance in the theological sense are unknown to him .

		Nor is it clear that a more refined sort of hedonism does not p > ersist .

		Most interesting of all the questions raised by a reading of the narrative is the writer 's attitude toward Christ , whose character
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	believes himself to com - prehend better than others .

		But he nevertheless regards the gospel account as chiefly wonderful for its complete and rounded literary charm , -- the sesthetic aspect is still all-important .

		The end arrived at by
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	appears to be a species of Nature worship . '

		I am conscious now , ' he writes in conclusion , ` that behind all this beauty , satisfying though it may be , there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and shapes are but modes of manifestation , and it is with this spirit that I desire to become in harmony .

		I have grown tired of the articulate utterances of men and things ... Society , as we have constituted it , will have no place for me , has none to offer , but Nature , whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike , will have clefts in the rocks where I may hide , and secret valleys in whose .

		silence I may weep undisturbed . '

Great Britain	LOCATION	down to the extirpation of piracy by the treaty with
Algiers	ORGANIZATION	in
December , 1816	DATE	.

		Several naval expeditions reflecting the highest credit upon the service , the nation , and the best interests of the world at large , were un - dertaken during this period , and aside from the direct results accomplished were of great im - portance as affording a training school for that gallant race of captains who so effectually dis - appointed the British on the sea in the War of

		The author often reverts in his writings to Mr.

		The Vicomte seems to have had a pleasant time in his sojourn under the British flag , beginning with
London	LOCATION	during the corona - tion and passing through

		Some Press Comments on The Dial 's Twenty = fifth Anniversary The Dial , that excellent literary periodical which is published in
Chicago	LOCATION	, celebrates on
May	DATE	i its twenty - fifth anniversary .

		Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, who edited the first number , still directs the policy of the paper , and to him and his colleagues the warmest congratulations are to be offered on the rounding out of a quarter of a century of useful and successful work .

		The leading editorial in the current number is written in a modest strain .

		The editor contents himself with saying that the effort of his paper has been `` to achieve distinction through consist - ency and persistency ; to be itself , with its own standards and character ; to have its ideals and live up to them . ''

		But to the many readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, and especially to those laboring in the same field which has benefited by its activities , it must be a pleasure to testify to the valuable services rendered by this sturdy publication ; it has been not only consistent and persistent in the cause of high literary standards .

		It has brought judgment , taste , enthusiasm , to the execution of its task .

		If it has been active in the dissemination of sound opinions , it has also done invaluable work in helping to create in the West that atmosphere which means not so much the making of opinion , but the development of a feeling for literary interests generally .

		Not alone in
Chicago	LOCATION	, but throughout a wide territory .

		The Dial has been a force in raising up readers of books of all kinds .

		It has steadily increased , both in influence and in prosperity , and it passes its twenty-fifth anniver - sary to continue upon a campaign in which it has the good will of everyone concerned in the welfare of literary journalism .

		^ ^ ^
^ York Tribune	ORGANIZATION	.

		During all these years The Dial has been an inde - pendent critical journal among many `` literary organs '' whose tune has almost always been in harmony with the literature published by the house which simultaneously owned both books and periodicals .

		It is refreshing to know that this , the only journal in
America	LOCATION	given up exclusively to the criticism of current literature , and the only literary periodical not owned or controlled by a book publishing house or a newspaper , has its home in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		That a paper like The Dial should be printed for a quarter of a century , continually sending forth its clean pages of well balanced criticism , is surely cause for felicitation .

		Its existence must prove stimulating to good taste and a love of good literature ,
May	DATE	it live long to record the sunny hours of prosperity and progress .

		The Standard -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		With its issue dated
April	DATE	i6 .

		The Dial completes a quarter of a century of such service to American literature as has been rendered by no other periodical .

		This does not mean that there has been no other competent literary criticism in the
United States	LOCATION	-- ^ though the sum total of that worth any consideration has been slight indeed by comparison .

		But The Dial has been the only journal to set for itself as an exclusive task to weigh , to measure , in some degree to interpret , and to pronounce judgment upon the current literary output .

		This was the purpose with which it was founded twenty-five years ago , and to this ideal it has held unswervingly , making no attempt to be `` popular , '' .

		but maintaining always the serene dignity , somewhat austere , yet kindly , befitting a Court of Last Resort .

		Wherever it is known , its utterances carry with them the weight that always attaches to the deliberate voice of the scholar speaking upon the subjects in which he is ^ '' P * ' ^ - Out West -LRB-
Los Angeles	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		With its current issue The Dial enters its
second quarter century	DATE	.

		Outside of bookish circles this fact will not seem as worthy of note as it will within .

		But where - ever in
America	LOCATION	there is any care for the maintenance or development of sound and disinterested literary criticism there will be gratification that The Dial has not only survived so long `` the tumult and the shouting , '' but enters auspiciously upon a fresh stage of its career of usefulness ... It is pleasant to consider that the only magazine wholly given to literary criticism and quite independent of any publishing concern was founded in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and has been maintained here for twenty-five years .

		During that period it has made its way wherever competent and disinterested criticism is sought .

		-LRB- From a column article in
Chicago Evening Post	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		Twenty-five years ago , on the first day of
May	DATE	, The Dial was founded in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and now it is celebrating its
Quarter Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editorial on the occasion speaks with becoming pride of the career of the paper .

		Indeed , that a purely literary magazine should remain for so long a time under the management of the man who created it , that it should always stand for the better things in litera - ture , and that it should now be prosperous , is a record as honorable as it is rare .


New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	.

		All friends of whatsoever things are best in the litera - ture of this generation will note with interest that
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary with the issue of
May	DATE	I. Throughout the
last quarter	DATE	of a century this purely critical literary magazine , published in the intensely commercial city of
Chicago	LOCATION	, has steadfastly held to the high aim with which it was founded , gaining for itself an undisputed place among the best critical journals in the world .


Chicago Record-Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of more than passing note among newspaper jubilees is the quarter century attained on
May Day	DATE	by
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, the journal of literary criticism whose place of publication is
Chicago	LOCATION	, but whose reading public is scattered over the length and breadth of the land , and also across the seas in other lands than our own ... Curiously enough , to this day
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	is the only paper in the
United States	LOCATION	devoted exclusively to literary criticism .

		Furthermore , it is the only literary periodical in the country which is not owned or controlled by a book publishing house .

		Therefore it stands on an eminence of dignified solitude that has always helped to give to its judgments the excep - tional value that is recognized as belonging to them by all in touch with American literature ... We extend cordial congratulations to our contemporary on the com - pletion of a
full quarter century	DATE	of honorable service .

		May the hands of The Dial always keep steadily moving , may it continue to ring out the hours of literary achieve - ment with resonant chime , and may the wheels behind the clock face be always well oiled , as heretofore , with the unguents of sound wisdom , clear discernment , and sober judgment .

		Los Angeles Times .

		The
Dial of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has just celebrated its twenty - fifth anniversary .

		It is an unusual record of which the editor , Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, writes modestly in the anniversary number , recalling his own unbroken editor - ship from the first number .

		The service which a literary paper of such high ideals and persistent courage In main - taining them has been able to render in the formative period of the
Interior	ORGANIZATION	deserves wide recognition .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS 39o A HL ^ NDRED BOOKS FOR SUMMER READING .394 -LRB- A. select list of some recent publications . -RRB-

		JfOTES 396 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS .397 LIST OF NT ; W BOOKS 397 A PUBLISHER 'S CONFESSIONS .

		Confession is good for the sonl , as the old • saying has it , and whoever first formulated that familiar dictum doubtless meant that the soul of the confessor was the one to get the benefit .

		But the writer of ' A Publisher 's Confession / an entertaining little book recently published , knows a trick worth two of that , and his con - fessions turn out to be counsels for the admo - nition of others rather than the humble setting forth of his own shortcomings .

		To chasten man -RCB- - souls with the same rod is obviously a worthier object of endeavor than selfishly to con - fine the discipline to the simple case of the writer himself .

		The first concern of the book is with the greedy souls of those authors who undermine the financial foundations of the publishing business by their unscrupulous demands for large royal - ties .

		The number of these inconsiderate scrib - blers who refuse to accept with due gratitude the traditional ten per cent is yearly increasing , and there is a progressive augmentation in the audacity of their stipulations .

		The average author has always found it diflficult to under - stand the equity of leaving the other ninety per cent in the hands of his publisher .

		This ninety per cent is , of course , a purely imaginary quan - tity -LRB- since nearly half of it disappears in the cus - tomary discount exacted from the publisher by the bookseller -RRB- .

		There remains then , on the basis of the ten per cent royalty , rather less than fifty per cent for all the preliminary expenses of type-setting , stereotj ` ping , and advertising , and for all the continuous expenses of manufacture and marketing .

		It is obvious enough that a book must sell to the extent of something like two thousand copies to pay expenses alone , and that if the publisher is to get any profit at all , it must come from the sale of a large edition .

		The writer of the present ' confession ' presents these elementary facts in a convincing manner , and his argument needs no strengthening .

		There are , however , a few points to be made on the authors behalf , which this argument ignores .

		For the book of moderate sale , respect - ably manufactured and properly advertised , the ten per cent royalty is undoubtedly a fair bar - gain for the author .

		But for the book of very large sale , a twenty per cent royalty would not be unfair to the publisher and not unduly gen - erous to the author .

		The problem is , of course .

		876 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, to form some idea before a book is published of the sale that may reasonaibly be expected for it .

		In our opinion , the sliding scale of royalties offers the most practically equitable way of deal - ing with this uncertain element in a publishing venture .

		The speculative element in most such ventures can not be eliminated , and it is only fitting that the benefits of an unexpected suc - cess should inure to both parties .

		The fact that the publisher finds it unwise , and even ruinous , to contract for large royalty payments before the salability of a book has been tested does not conflict with the other fact that it is unjust to an author to limit his rewards by a forecast that the event may show to have been unnecessarily conservative .

		A matter of minor importance , but not one to be neglected altogether , is found in the sales , not inconsiderable in amount , which every pub - lisher makes direct to the individual book-buyer .

		The profit resulting from these sales must widen materially the narrow margin upon which his business with the trade is admittedly done .

		One other point we have emphasized upon sev - eral former occasions .

		It is that books published under the ' net ' system call for a special rule on the subject of royalty .

		To give the author of a ` net ' book the traditional ten per cent is equivalent to depriving him of one-fifth of his legitimate reward .

		But we have seen no evi - dence since the inauguration of ' net ' prices for books that authors ' royalties upon these publi - cations have been advanced as they should have been .

		Not to make this advance spontaneously and as a matter of the barest justice is to take an underhanded advantage of a class of persons not as a rule well equipped for business dealings .

		One of the most salient features of our little book of confessions is the emphasis which it places upon professional , as distinguished from commercial , publication .

		The root of this impor - tant matter is found in the following passage : ` It was once a matter of honor that one pub - lisher should respect the relation established be - tween another publisher and a writer , as a physician respects the relation established between another physician and a patient .

		Three or four of the best publishing houses still live and work by this code .

		And they have the respect of all the book world .

		Authors and readers , who do not know definitely why they hold them in esteem , discern a high sense of honor and conduct in them .

		Character makes its way from any man who has it down a long line -- everybody who touches a sterling char - acter comes at last to feel it both in conduct and in product .

		The very best traditions of publishing are yet a part of the practice of the best American publishing houses , which are conducted by men of real character .

		But there are others -- others who keep `` literary drummers , '' men who go to see popular writers and solicit books .

		The authors of very popular books themselves also -- some of them at least -- put themselves up at auction , going from publisher to publisher or threatening to go .

		This is demoralization and commercialization with a vengeance .

		But it is the sin of the authors . '

		Here is an issue squarely presented , and it is one of the greatest importance .

		Shall pub - lishers underbid each other in the effort to add popular names to their lists ?

		Shall authors hawk their wares from house to house for the purpose of getting a number of offers and accepting the highest of them ?

		If we change the terms of these questions , substituting ' physi - cian ' * or ' lawyer ' in the one case , and ' patient ' or ' client ' in the other , they will be very promptly answered in the negative .

		It seems to us that insistence upon a profes - sional relation between publisher and author is absolutely necessary if the complex process of writing and uttering books is to be kept upon a dignified plane , and the best intellectual inter - ests of the country are to be served .

		Commercial methods may do well enough for the publication of the cheap rubbish that still , as in all past time , is produced for the infection of the public taste -- just as the department store is a fitting place for its sale -- but books that have anything to do with literature or with the advancement of knowledge should not be subjected to such degrading conditions of pro- duction .

		The plea of our anonymous author for the ethics of professionalism in the publishing busi - ness is so reasonable and so convincingly urged that little ground is left for any opposing argu - ment .

		And yet there runs through this little book a line of thought , perhaps rather a line of suggestion , that is strikingly at variance with the main tenor of the discourse .

		We refer to the slighting and even contemptuous language with which the writer speaks of those who apply critical standards to literature .

		A few quota - tions will illustrate this curious bias , the ex - pression of which is almost tantamount to the rejection of the fine ideals for which the writer elsewhere seems to stand .

		At an early oppor - tunity , he takes occasion to make the reckless pronouncement : ' I , for one , and I know no publisher who holds a different opinion , care nothing for the judgment of the professional literary class . '

		Later on , we find such sayings as these : ' The one thing that is certain is that the critical crew and the academic faculty are sure not to recognize literature at first sight .

		^ ' Most publishers ' readers are literarv ' folk , pure and simple . '

		If you have a book to publish , first find out who conducts the business of the publisher you have in mind . '

		If it is conducted by a lot of hired literar -RCB- - men , avoid it .

		They are , most of them , men who have failed at authorship ; they read and advise for salaries ; and most of them know nothing about the houses that thev serve . '


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 Expressions like these betray a curious lack of balance ; they suggest the man - vrith a griev - ance , who lets his temper get the better of his judgment .

		And the animus becomes still more marked when any reference is made to the * liter - ary ' journals . '

		We are told that when some worthless novel is made ephemeraUy popular by the * brass band method ' of the sensational pub - lisher , these journals ' forthwith fall to gossip - ing , and keep up a chatter about great sellers , and bewail commercialization in literature . '

		Fur - thermore , we read of ' nonsense such as review - ers write in the literary magazines , ' and of * oui shallow gabble called reviews . '

		We are also gravely assured that publishers rarely waste their time in reading the reviews of their own pub - lications , and that periodicals which ' go only to the literary class are to a degree superfluous ' for advertising purposes .

		There is no mistaking the spirit of such words as these ; it is the spirit of the very commercialism which the writer else - where deprecates , and it serves to weaken his main plea immeasurably .

		If all ' literary ' opin - ion is to be held thus in contempt , what sort of opinion , we ask in our bewilderment , does out confessing publisher consider deserving of respect ?

		If the judgment of expert criticism is to go unheeded , what judgment is there left for his guidance , save that of the philistine with his commercial aims and his worship of mere success ?

		The dilemma is thus squarely pre - sented , but our writer seems to seize first one horn and then the other , instead of boldly mak - ing his choice once for all .

		For our own part , there is no difficulty at all in making the choice .

		The publisher who does not rest his ventures upon a sound basis of literary judgment , and with whom the approval of expert opinion does not count for more than the gains resulting from a meretricious popu - larity , is not a publisher at all in the higher sense of the term .

		He is at the best a trades - man , at the worst a ' quack ' or a * shyster . '

		He can probably make more money by catering to vulgarized tastes than by appealing to refined intelligences , but in adopting this course , he sac - rifices every claim to the respect of those whose respect is worth having .

		That the writer of the little book now under our consideration is to be reckoned among those who would justify this sordid type of publishing by the magnitude of its unholy rewards we do not for a moment sup - pose .

		But we can not help feeling that he has allowed himself to indulge in certain vagaries of expression that , logically developed , would lead to so unfortunate a conclusion .

		His real ideal , however , we believe to be contained in the following passage : ` As nearly as I can make out the publishing houses in the
Tnited States	LOCATION	that are conducted as dignified institutions are conducted with as little degrading commercialism as the old houses whose history has become a part of English literature , and I believe that they are conducted with more ability .

		Centainly not one of them has made a colossal fortune .

		Certainly not one of them ever failed to recognize or to encourage a high literary purpose if it were sanely directed .

		Every one of them every year invests in books and authors that they know can not yield a direct or immediate profit , and they make these investments because they feel consoled by trying to do a service to literature . '

		We have little doubt that an investigation into the motives and guiding principles of the houses thus held up to honor would disclose the fact that their very genuine success has resulted from a constant deference to those very literary stand - ards that are made the object of our writer 's ill-advised and immerited scorn .

		TEE DECAY OF THE GHOST IN FICTION . '

		For one , I can not purge my raind of tbat forlorn faith . '

		For approximately a generation , the ghost has been missing from fiction ; after a disappear - ance so sudden and of such far-reaching implica - tions that it is a matter of some amazement that those who profess to concern themselves with the phenomena of imaginative literature should have paid so little attention to it .

		It is a com - monplace that ever since literature began , as well as considerably before that interesting period , what we call Hhe supernatural ' has been a staple material of the tellers of tales .

		As there has always been a literature of love , so there ha ^ always been a literature of fear ; and until the development of the present narrow and timorous popular taste , one had perhaps as strong an appeal as the other .

		Ghosts in their most literal acceptation -- not as the more or less imper - sonal shades we have sometimes indifferently pictured them -- have always been held an essen - tial complement of tangible everyday life , inex - tricably bound up with religion , with love for the dead , with hunger for the unknown , with many of the most intimate and profound emo - tions : and their literary use has seemed , to the greater public , not only no less , but even more * realistic , ' than the modem exploitation of the commonplace .

		Twenty-five years ago , even , the reader of ma ^ zine fiction was still able to shudder to his heart 's content .

		Spectres glided with the pre - cision of long-established custom through the pages of the more conventional compendiums of light literature .

		The familiar paraphernalia of supernatural incident , -- draughty chambers , tempestuous nights , blood-staans , wan-faced women , -- were still in constant and elaborate 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, requisition .

		And while there was a discreet drib - bling of phantoms from week to week or from month to month , a magnificent convocation of the spectral tribe occurred annually .

		That is to say , a curious association of ideas connected the maximum of ghostly prevalence with
Christ	LOCATION	- mas , the season of popular rejoicing ; and by way of making sure of these dismal but doubt - less salutary companions , it was customary , as Mir .

		Anstey once remarked , ^ to commission a band of ingenious litterateurs to turn out batches of ready-made spectres for the Christ - mas annuals . '

		The business of chilling the popular spine was taken with due seriousness and was all the more effectually brought about in that the ' magazine ghost , ' as this source of popular refreshment was termed , was as stereo - typed and conventional as the old-fashioned novel-heroine .

		Its looks , manner , haunts , com - panions , and alleged errands were those long since laid down by tradition ; it evinced no sen - sational modern unexpectedness .

		But suddenly , and it must surely have seemed mysteriously , the magazine ghost vanished ; nor were its eerie footprints traced .

		Whether by a concerted action of magazine editors , or by a swift and complete paralysis of the contributor ^ ' imaginations , or by a profound alteration of popular sentiment , or by the operation of a prin - ciple presently to be suggested , the literature of the supernatural ceased to be produced .

		Can this have happened without protest , without comment , even ?

		The subject is rich in its pos - sibilities of speculation .

		For if the acceptance and enjoyment of ghost-lore imDly a childish quality of mind , as one sometimes hears supe - rior persons assert , then our rejection of them would argue that we are the wisest generation that ever lived .

		If , again , the reading or writ - ing of such tales demand a freshness of imagina - tion that in our little day has become desiccated , then our plight is pitiable indeed .

		There is at hand , of course , an easy but super - ficial explanation to the effect that a prevalence of ghost-stories must depend upon a stout popu - lar belief in ghosts ; and that having lost the one , we must forego the other .

		The slightest reflec - tion shows that this position is untenable .

		Not believe in ghosts ?

		We believe in them with all our hearts .

		Never before , since spectral feet first crossed a man-made threshold , have ghosts been so squarely , openly , and enthusiastically believed in , so assiduously cultivated , as now .

		We have raised ghost-lore to the dusty dignity of a science .

		The invocation of the spirits of the dead , far from having its former suggestion of vulgar myster -RCB- ^ , is one of the most reputable of practices , which men of learning carry on pub - licly , with stenograpliers conveniently at hand .

		There even flourishes a ' Haunted House Com - mittee , ' appointed and maintained by the fore - most society for the promotion of ghosts , and this for the express purpose of encouraging the presence of the shyer and less aggressive spectres in what seem their appropriate habitations , -- of making them , as it were , feel at home .

		We believe in ghosts as sincerely as we believe in the very poor ; and in similar fashion we en - deavor to live among them , establish a cordial understanding , and write about them in our notebooks .

		Nor do we believe in them the less because , when on our learned behavior , we may refer to them as ' phan - tasmogenetic agencies . '

		Not believe in ghosts ?

		They are our fetish .

		Let it never be imagined that ghost-stories have suffered decline because of our indifference to their subject-matter , ' material ' though our age is commonly held to be .

		By our very zest in their pursuit , we have possibly proved the reverse of Scott 's mistaken theory that to see ghosts it is only necessary to believe in them , -- to wish to see .

		Much truer is the proposition that the seer of ghosts commonly does not premeditate his vision ; that spectres manifest themselves by preference to ' unimag - inative people in perfect health . '

		No small share of the fascination exerted by the ancient and outgrown ghost of fiction was due to its invariable and satisfactory conformity to type .

		However frequent its intrusion , or how - ever familiar , it was never suffered to deviate from its character , so deeply rooted in human consciousness , as a source of dread .

		It was the function of the ghost to be consistently unpleas - ant , and that function was relentlessly fulfilled .

		No one personal characteristic of the ghost as we Icnow it in song or story or as we learn from the unimpeachable testimony of our friends ' friends , can explain its unequalled power to arouse the emotion of fear .

		Distasteful as is the ghostly habit of reducing its unfleshly essence to a threadlike , infinitely ductile filament -- like a bit of transsubstantial chewing-gum -- in order sneakily to penetrate keyholes ; disturbing as is its fashion of upsetting our gravely accepted laws of nature ' ; intolerable as is its lack of vocal organs -LRB- for phantoms , with few exceptions , can - not or will not speak -RRB- ; -- neither one nor all of these undesirable characteristics can completely solve the interesting riddle of its fear-compelling power .

		And it is undoubtedly almost as remark - able that having for centuries , in and out of fiction , maintained this consistent and extreme - ly prevalent personality , the ghost should have dropped out of literature altogether .

		Now , how can this have been ?

		To go as far back as the early English folk - tales and ballads , when the wherefore of phan - toms was even better understood than now , and when fiction more essentially took its origin
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 from life , ghost-tales gained their grim effective - ness from the accuracy with \ rhich they reflected popular belief .

		The audiences of that simple day had not attained a sufficient refinement of imagination to delight in vague , casual , inco - herent spectres ; every ghost had a name and date .

		What is more important is that there was no ghost that had not a reason for being .

		The ingenious notion that the spirits of the dead re - turn from an allegedly peaceful Elysium simply to make themselves disagreeable , by way of eat - ing their minds , had not yet suggested itself .

		On the contrary , the animistic trend of popular thought , which of course greatly favored the .

		ap - pearance of ghosts in general , assigned them likewise adequate and intelligible motives , among the chief of which were : to reveal treas - ure , to reunite happy lovers , to avenge a crime , and to serve as * a primitive telegraphic service for the conveyance of bad news . '

		Ghosts were therefore not only the recognizable shades of the familiarly known dead ; they were sinister symbols of crime , remorse , vengeance .

		If you shuddered at sight of them , it was for a better reason than weak nerves .

		Horror was not piled on horror , in early ghost-tales , merely to satisfy the artist 's own sense of cumulative effect .

		Each detail had a powerful conventional significance , and the consequent power to arouse a strong primitive emotion .

		This system not only lent an artistic strength and symmetry to the early literature ; it was intensely satisfactory to the Anglo-Saxon mind .

		But .

		inevitably , when the motives and the language of literature became more complex , the rationale of ghost-lore became affected .

		Phan - toms began to lose their original force , fell into the habit of haunting from motives relatively unworthy .

		Evidences multiplied of their degen - eration into a morbid and meddlesome tribe , with a sadly diminished sense of the fitting and the picturesque .

		Their visits were even con - cerned with the payment of debts , of strictly mortal contraction ; and thev lamentably lost caste by exhibiting themselves as the victims , rather than as the scourge , of conscience .

		A ghost has been known to go to the trouble of haunting a house for the mere purpose of ensur - ing the payment of a shilling , -- an episode that might well permanently compromise the dig - nity of the entire spectral tribe .

		Likewise when they acquired the intrusive habit of giving evi - dence in trials , the original and forceful idea that ghosts were agents of retribution became se - riously coarsened .

		Legally , the fact that the issue of many an actual trial has hinged on ghostly testimony is of extraordinary interest .

		So far as imaginative terror-literature is con - cerned , however , the introduction of this matter serves as a mixed and weakened motive , only .

		During the later years of the ghosf s popu - larity in literature , it will readily be seen that the greater number of the earliest ghost-motives were outgrown .

		It is some time , for instance , since the motive of recovering buried treasure through supernatural aid has been able to ' csxry , ' the custom of burying treasure having itself somewhat tamely died out .

		Far more in - congruous , even , came to seem the supernatural reunion of lovers , as in the familiar case where the posthumous suitor reappears to bear his still living sweetheart back to the grave with him - Ghosts that are to be imderstood as the projec - tions of the spirit at the moment of deatii hsLve always been popular , it is true , but this motive is not in itself strong or picturesque enough to serve as the backbone of a corporate section of imaginative literature .

		In short , the only ghost-motive that retained its strength , plausibility , and appeal to the Anglo-Saxon mind was the retribution-motive , -- the idea that the ghosf s function was to re - call , expiate , or avenge a crime .

		This was im - pressive ; it was terrifying ; it had moral and religious significance ; it was not subtle ; it was susceptible of indefinitely repeated adjustment to time and place .

		It was the perfect , periiaps the only perfect , ghost-motive for English literature .

		So valorous is the Anglo-Saxon temper that it Booms or is ashamed to tremble at mere empty shadow-tales .

		It demands not only to be im - pressed ; there must be an adequate basis for the impression .

		The clue to the whole matter is that the ghost must not be a wanton and irre - sponsible power .

		It must be a moral agent .

		Unfortunately , the realization of tiiis simple truth has never been complete .

		Only subcon - sciously has the public known what it wanted .

		As for the tellers of tales , they seem , in those latter days of the ghost 's Hterary existence , to have remained in criminal ignorance of the vital principle of their business .

		The decay of the ghost in fiction occurred , not through any loss of human interest in the spectral world , but through an indolent misapprehension , on the port of the story-tellers , of the real character of the ghost as we Anglo-Saxons have conceived it .

		Thus it came about that the ghost , previous to its subsidence , was , as Mr.
Lang	PERSON	truly observed , ' a purposeless creature .

		He appears , nobody knows why ; he has no message to deliver , no secret crime to conceal , no appointment to keep , no treasure to disclose , no commissions to be executed , and , as an almost invariable rule , he does not speak , even if you speak to him . '

		And he adds that inquirers have therefore concluded that the ghost , generically , is ' not all there , ' -- a dreary result of scepticism , indeed !

		At the same time , what direct and utilitarian folk could put up with a confirmedly inconsequent ghost .

		380 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, even for the creepy fascination of shuddering at his phantom footfall ?

		And could there be , on the whole , a more perfect example of the opera - tion of natural selection in art than that , the ghost of fiction becoming unmoral , superficial , and flabby , it was its pitilessly appropriate penalty to be dropped and apparently forgotten ?

		A small group of kindred volumes , which have appeared during the past year or so , now for the first time indicate that a perception of the true nature of the literary ghost is returning to the absent-minded craft .


Stevenson	PERSON	ha 'd , it is true , an admirable perception of the terror - inspiring , and he did not make the mistake of being vague ; but his was not the temperament that produces the perfect ghost-story .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, in that masterpiece , * The Turn of the Screw , ' has shown that he can convey a sense of mystery and terror more skilfully than any of his contemporaries ; but his work is prob - ably too esoteric to stand as typical , and it re - mains true that the pattern ghost-tale must be writ large and obvious .

		If , as now appears , a half - dozen of the ablest writers of the day are realiz - ing this , there is hope for the renaissance of the literary ghost .

		It has already been proved that the problem of its readjustment to our literature is not insuperable , -- that the chambers of our untenanted imaginations stand ready and wait - ing to be haunted by wraiths that our logic can approve .

		There may indeed develop with time a regenerated ghost-literature well worth ac - quaintance ; for , as an essayist of other times has somewhat grandiloquently observed , ' Our in - born proneness to a love of the marvellous and unimaginable , which has originated in our im - perfect acquaintance with the laws of nature and our own being , does not appear to suffer diminu - tion las education and culture advance ; for it is found to coexist with the highest intellectual development and the most refined critical ioia - P ^ r.

		In Garden and
Orchard	ORGANIZATION	.

		* More and more do our amateur gardeners commit to paper what they have learned by experience , observation , and reading , and what they have dreamed as they worked .

		They are moved possibly by the joy and help they have themselves found in similar works of other writ - ers , or perhaps they are stirred by that renais - sance of garden literature in recent years which has been accompanied by a truer knowledge of gardening as a science and a keener insight into its possibilities as an art .

		The earlier books were nearly all English , although scattered pub - lications like
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	's charming little volume , ` An Island Garden , ' go to show that not all the gardening done on this side was of the ' bedding plants ' variety that has lately received so many hard words , and that not all the owners of garden plots turned them over to the ` hired man ' for cultivation and decoration .

		Now , indeed , the books on this justly popular subject come so thick and fast that beginners hardly know where to turn , and even the experi - enced are embarrassed by the riches for their choosing , -- whether they are looking for practi - cal advice or for the sympathetic ramblings of other garden lovers like themselves .

		But the true gardener is not to be deterred by quantity , or even by quality ; for it is a fact that no mat - ter how simple or commonplace or amateurish a garden book may be , there is rarely one that does not contain some interesting facts or com - ments before unthought-of by the reader .

		More - over , the true gardener is just as eager to read and criticise the latest advice and comments about the plants he knows by heart as he is to study the annual seed-catalogues when they first appear -- and the latter state of mind is pro- verbial .

		Most imposing of the garden books that have lately appeared is an English collaborated pro- duction entitled ' Garden Colour . '

		THE DIAI .

		381 paper , broad margins , and fifty-one colored plates seem to mark it as a book for ornament only ; but the contents are extremely practical , and nearly every picture illustrates some point in the text .

		These pictures , which are from water-colors by Miss
Margaret Waterfield	PERSON	-LRB- who also supplies the greater part of the text -RRB- , require a few words of caution .

		To one seeking for the beauties of individual flowers they wiU prove only disappointing , for that it is neither their purpose nor their effect to depict .

		They were painted to show what combinations of color will make the garden itself a series of pictures , and as such they are a success .

		They should not be viewed at too close a range , or by an artificial light .

		But one who has considered the subject only casually will certainly get some inspiring suggestions from both pictures and text .

		A few of the most attractive of the plates are the frontispiece , showing purple Clematis climbing over an open iron gate , with
Tritoma	ORGANIZATION	and
Michaelmas Daisies	ORGANIZATION	in the foreground ; those of
Anemone Blanda	PERSON	and
Daffodil Cemuus	PERSON	, of
Oriental Poppy	ORGANIZATION	and Lupin , of Delphiniums , Lilies , and Poppies , of Cluster Rose , of Fox - gloves and
Rose Euphrosyne	PERSON	, of a border of annuals , of Tropaeollum Speciosum , and of Mi - chaelmas Daisies alone .

		Many of these were painted from the artist 's own garden at Xack - ington ,
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Waterfield	PERSON	herself writes the garden notes for the various months , giving advice in regard to cultivation only inci - dentgiUy , but chiefly in regard to artistic arrangement , -- those methods of planting whereby each plant or shrub shows its own beau - ties to best advantage , while at the same time enhancing those of its neighbors .

		It is true that most English books are of little practical use to American gardeners , but the very lack of cul - tural directions makes this volume an exception to the rule .

		For it is the principles rather than the actual facts that the various writers wish in this case to enforce .

		Miss TTaterfield 's col - laborators include Mrs.
C. W. Earle	PERSON	,
Miss Rose Kingsley	PERSON	, and other well-known English garden lovers and writers .

		Mrs.
Helena Rutherfurd Ely	PERSON	won so many friends two years ago by her volume entitled * A Woman 's
Hardy Garden	ORGANIZATION	, ' which united in a most delightful manner the serious and the pleasant sides of garden work and lore , that it is no surprise to find she has been encouraged to prepare a sequel , which we now have in * An - other
Hardy Garden Book	ORGANIZATION	. '

		In the later book , however , Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	has not confined herself to the flower garden , but has rather laid emphasis upon the material side of the subject , -- perhaps with a view to reaching masculine readers , for she says : * I do not remember a single instance of showing the flowers to a man who failed to inquire with a strong note of interest about the vegetable garden , ' She remarks , besides , that on the woman 's part ` the raising of vegetables is often a propitiatory offering to the other mem - bers of the family . '

		However , after the prac - tical-minded man has read the chapters on vege - tables , fruits , and trees , there still remains for the woman who gardens only for beauty about half the book , giving additional suggestions in regard to perennials and other flowers , * A
Gar	PERSON	- den of Lilies and
Iris	PERSON	, ' and special
spring	DATE	and autumn work in the flower garden .

		Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	is always interesting because of the close per - sonal note in what she writes .

		Yet she does not overdo this note : her books are far from being sentimental , but are infused with a very vigor - ous personality , and with occasional touches of humor that prove she is not taking herself too seriously .

		She seldom pauses to rhapsodize , being more concerned with the possibility of helping others to get as much joy from a life out-of-doors as she does herself .

		Nor does she forget that the greater number of home gardens are on a much smaller scale than hers , and so gives her advice in such a way that it is easily adaptable to other places and circumstances .

		Still more utilitarian than Mrs.
Ely	PERSON	's book is Mr.
E. P. Powell	PERSON	's * Orchard and
Fruit Garden	ORGANIZATION	, ' which appears in the new ' Coimtry Home Library . '

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's purpose is to instruct , not to amuse ; he is deeply in earnest , and seeks to make possible delicious food and financial success for the men and women whom he has in a previous volume so ardently urged to make a home , however small , in the country .

		The greater part of the book is taken up by advice as to the best varieties of fruit to plant , ranging from apples to small fruits and including some Uttle-grown fruits and some nut-trees .

		The usual order is reversed here , for after this long dissertation on kinds of fruit , there follow a few chapters on culture , training , packing , and marketing .

		Our chief criticism on Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's book would be that in these last sections he gives ear to too many other advisers .

		For beginners , as so many of his readers will be , this is sure to prove confusing .

		One method , forcibly put , is worth a half-dozen from which to choose , even though they all have their value .

		In the main , however , it is evident that Mr.
Powell	PERSON	knows his subject , as indeed we might expect , since it is imderstood that he is a prize fruit-grower of
New York state	LOCATION	, and has had orchard experience in
Michigan	LOCATION	and
Missouri	LOCATION	as well .

		This latter fact insures the reader against that onesided - ness which is so exasperating in many of those writers who deal only with * the northeastern
United States	LOCATION	. '

		The chief charm of Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's book , soberly written as it is , is the author 's manifest enthusiasm , his deep absorption in his 882 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, subject .

		He is at once conservative and pro- gressive , and has given us a book valuable to have at hand .

		A serious defect , however , is the lack of an index ; few indeed are the books that can keep rank nowadays without a good index .

		Altogether bright and clever is Mrs.
Edith Loring Fullerton	PERSON	's ' How to Make a
Vegetable Garden	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ The writer has managed to avoid everything dull and prosy , without omitting anything essential , and so readable is the book that the veriest ignoramus can not fail to under - stand and the most hardened opposer of garden labor must be tempted to ` have a try . '

		And the illustrations !

		-- truly , they illustrate , -- everything from seedlings and tools to the aspect of the garden in winter .

		Mrs.
Fullerton	PERSON	does not relegate the vegetable garden to the tender mercies of men , -- at least not all parts of it .

		She is as much at home there as in the flower garden , and as fully determined to make it beau - tiful .

		Indeed , she constantly recurs to the idea of the ` vegetable flower garden , ' and describes particularly a Japanese radial vegetable garden , which combines use and beauty .

		She is fertile in helpful devices for all purposes , and her book ig likely therefore to be a boon to the amateur .

		After several chapters of general advice , she devotes herself to special vegetables , telling not only how to grow and keep them , but how to serve them as well , thereby earning the special gratitude of the housewife .

		She has included the small fruits generally raised in a home gar - den , and has capped her beneficences by a com - plete and very helpful planting-table .

		Those who are readers of ' Country Life in
America	LOCATION	' and ' The Garden Magazine ' will recognize some portions of this book ; but its value is by no means decreased thereby , and at any rate the most entertaining parts are new .

		The last book on our list , Mrs.
Sarah `` Warner Brooks	PERSON	's ' A Garden with
House Attached	ORGANIZATION	, ' is a rather thin volume of reminiscence , meditations , and garnered scraps of information about flowers , mingled with garden lore gained by personal experience .

		The writer is not alto - gether modem in her tastes , and the chapters have an old-time flavor in spite of their evident current knowledge .

		The style is somewhat dif - fuse and parenthetical , except where direct ad - vice is given , in which case it is clear enough .

		The practical portion includes a chapter on house plants -LRB- a paper delivered before the '
Cambridge Plant Club	ORGANIZATION	' and published in ` The American Garden ' -RRB- , chapters on perennials , roses , bulbs , annuals , climbers , and herbs .

		An interesting chapter consists of gathered items on the cere - bral processes of plants as shown in their move - ments toward light , food , and support , -- a sub - ject of charm and mystery concerning which we yet have much to learn .

		It was an old garden in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	that furnished the founda - tion for Mrs.
Brooks	PERSON	's experiments and improve - ments , mingling the old with the new , destroy - ing or adding , as the spirit moved her .

		It was a gracious task , and one from which she evidently reaped much joy .

		So there we will leave her , with the feeling we all should have in a garden of beauty , ` attuned to the blessed influences of the hour , at peace with all mankind . '

		Sir
Frederick	PERSON	was privileged to meet two rulers on his journey , the
Mikado	LOCATION	of
Japan	LOCATION	and the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Though far too long to be reproduced here , his contrasted impressions of these two men are assuredly worth careful reading .

		Especially valuable at this moment is the following statement regard - ing one of the vital questions of the day : ` The visitor to
China	LOCATION	is likely to make early enquiry from prominent European residents in the matter of the `` Yellow Peril '' .

		It will be with some disappointment that he learns that the `` Yellow Peril '' does not exist .

		The Chinese have no desire to spread themselves over foreign lands in devastating hordes like the Goths and the Huns .

		They are fired by no desire for conquest , nor for new territory .

		The wish dearest to their hearts is to be let alone .

		The cry of the people is ``
China	LOCATION	for the Chinese '' , and the extreme bitterness of this cry has led from time to time to trouble , in the form of risings , riots , and indiscriminate murder .

		On each of these occasions the Chinese worm has turned , and turned unpleasantly ... The prayer of the Chinaman is for peace , not for power to run riot over the earth ; for remunerative work , and not for the privilege of filling the dramatic part of a Peril , yellow or otherwise . '

		The author 's photographs taken on the journey have been reproduced by his publishers with un - usual delicacy .

		It is difficult to do justice to such a book as Dr. and Mrs.
William Hunter Workman	PERSON	's ' Through Town and Jungle . '

		At the cost of great self-sacrifice the writers forsook their fav - orite pastime of mountain climbing amidst eternal snows and descended to the Indian plain , probably the hottest portion of the thickly popu - lated earth .

		On heavily laden bicycles , which occasionally had to oe pushed by hand over long stretches of sand , they visited not only all the ordinary show places of the peninsula but num - erous out-of-the-way spots heretofore unknown to readers of travel books , their quest being gen - erally for specimens of Indian architecture ,
Buddhist	LOCATION	,
Brahman	ORGANIZATION	,
Jain	PERSON	, and Moslem .

		After accumulating several hundred photographs of temple and village scenes , a flood left them as poor as before , and most of the journey was made over again in order to replace , at least in part , their lost negatives .

		Java and
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, though not portrayed in this large volume , the authors had explored thoroughly in the architec - tural sense some time before , and the learning thus acquired is c-onstantly placed at the read - er 's disposal .

		Yet , in spite of all the descrip - tions and discussions of the text and the hun - dreds of reproduced photographs , the reader 's resulting impression regarding the Indian art of building is confusion itself , the value of the vast mass of unrelated facts being lost through lack of s ^ - stematic setting forth .

		The series of tours are put down in chronological and geographical order , quite regardless of the particular class of architecture , and it is made evident that there is vastly more remaining than has been seen .

		Xor can it be said that the recital of experiences among the natives adds to our knowledge of that vast congeries of human souls , exceeding the population of the
United States	LOCATION	fivefold .

		The inhabitants of higher caste of course declined all intercourse with the waj ^ f arers , and the rest were too oppressed by the weight of taxation and over - population to be of service in most cases .

		Such religious observances as were seen have been fully described by others .

		There were no adven - tures except the most prosaic .

		European con - vention excludes reproduction of many of the most interesting photographs .

		In fine , the book is quite the dullest that has come from Dr. and Mrs.
Workman	PERSON	's hands .

		On the other hand , it would be most unfair to deny the value of the material , both textual and pictorial , here gath - ered together , however unsystematized , or the fact that no other recent work on
India	LOCATION	gives any such general impression of the Indian peo - ples and architectures .

		And certainly the list of minor difficulties surmounted is sufficiently appalling , taken in the mass , to make it unlikely that any one less devoted than this congenial couple will feel inclined to emulate their tour .

		Nor should the suggestions to Western architects regarding the almost virgin field of the Indian art be dismissed lightly by those to whom it is chiefly addressed .

		^ Mecca and the details of the orthodox pil - grimage enjoined upon devout Mohammedans have been made known to the Kaffir world through the courage and self-devotion of many Europeans , notably Englishmen ; but never be - fore has there been an account written from the point of view of a follower of the Prophet , how - ever sceptical the Persian author of ^ ith the Pilgrims to Mecca ' may be .

		The interest of his 884 THE DIAli -LSB-
June	DATE	ly account is further heightened by the magnitude of the pilgrimage three years ago , when a quar - ter of a million souls from all quarters of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	world visited the holy city in one vast mass .

		The author , whose name is composed entirely of terms of dignity , is a putative devotee in a sect unbeloved of the orthodox , and has been brought by an English education to thoughts still further remote from orthodoxy ; but he did not fail to renew the devotional feel - ings of his youth when brought into contact with such myriads of his co-religionaries , and his state of mind when passing through the intricate and prolonged ritual was as fervent and unques - tioning as could be desired .

		He describes the most sacred object in
Mecca	LOCATION	thus : ` At first the Stone was whiter than milk , but it grew to be black , either by the touch of a certain class of woman , by the sins of mankind , or by the kisses of the pilgrims .

		All believers , whatever may be the cause to which they attribute the change of color , agree that the defilement is purely super - ficial , the inside of the Stone being still as white as the driven snow .

		Let us hope that the same thing can be said of the hearts of the Faithful , whose lips are supposed to have wrought on this lodestone of theirs a transformation so miraculous .

		The silver box wherein it lies is about twenty inches square , and is raised a little more than five feet from the ground .

		A round window having a diameter of some nine inches is kept open on purpose to enable the pilgrims to kiss or to touch the treasure within , which is known as ' ' the right hand of God on earth '' .

		This year the act of oscu - lation was not performed by more than ten pilgrims out of every hundred that attempted it , the crowd being utterly undisciplined in its zeal .

		It must be confessed that I owed my good fortune to main strength , for I shoved my way through the excited mob and examined the Stone curiously while kiss - ing it .

		In color it is a shining black ; in shape , hollow like a saucer , presumably the result of the pressure of devoted lips .

		A pilgrim , if he fail in touching the Stone , must make a reverential salam before it , and then pass on .

		Certain prayers are also said . '

		The entire ceremonial is exceedingly impressive , and to many who look upon Islam in the conven - tional Western manner the elevation of its thought and ethics will come as a surprise .

		It is the ability to sympathize with these religious essentials that gives the book its chief value , since it is a real interpretation of perhaps the greatest of all the world 's existing rituals in the number of its devotees and in the effect it has upon them and their fellows .

		No portion of the book lacks interest for the curiously inclined , and it is admirably and graphically written .

		Miss
Edith Durham	PERSON	's book , ' The Burden of the
Balkans	LOCATION	, ' would , single-handed , redeem her sex from the accusation of a lacking sense of humor .

		The author 's wanderings took her through
Montenegro	LOCATION	and the Albanian provinces of
Turkey	LOCATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	, part of the time in fur - thering the relief work the British had set on foot , the remainder in a veritable dash through the realms of the Sultan .

		She was brought into intimate contact with the little known races that inhabit -LRB- and infest -RRB- those regions , and she views them here , not merely with sympathy , but with an ability to laugh at every annoyance they caused her .

		Tlie earlier chapters are given up to a consideration of racial problems , in which a fine contempt is shown for the artificialities of those European statesmen who seek to partition the land with little or no relation to the Slavs , Bulgars , Serbs , Greeks , Vlahs -LRB- Wallachians -RRB- , Albanians , and others , who constitute essentially different peoples , with varying traditions , his - tories , tongues , beliefs , and political aspirations and ideals .

		` At present we have a free Servia , a free Bul - garia , a free
Greece	LOCATION	, a but half ruled and wholly disaffected
Albania	LOCATION	with no
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	frontier , and a no man 's land of mixed population , which each race hopes ultimately to possess , and over which the Porte has yearly less and less control .

		The
Turk	ORGANIZATION	's death is now considered so imminent that the chief concern of each race is how to keep him alive until each has made its own claim clear to
Europe	LOCATION	. '

		The conditions are mediaeval throughout these lands , but
Miss Durham	LOCATION	takes pains to remind those who complain of the lack of twentieth cen - tury refinement in the
Balkans	LOCATION	that ' '' Human - ity '' was not invented even in
England	LOCATION	till the beginning of the nineteenth century , ' following this with another pregnant statement of fact : ` When a Moslem kills a Moslem it does not count ; when a Christian kills a Moslem it is a righteous act ; when a Christian kills a Christian it is an error of judgment better not talked about ; it is only when a Moslem kills a Christian that we arrive at a full blown `` atrocity '' ' .

		While working in the
Ochrida	LOCATION	hospital Miss
Durham	LOCATION	became thoroughly familiar with human nature as it exists in those parts , and she leaves this amusing record of her native assist - ants : ` If I dropped in at an unexpected hour , I almost always had to `` tell them that they must not '' .

		Then they said , first , that they had not been doing it ; secondly , that it was what they always did ; thirdly , that the doctor had told them to ; fourthly , that they did not do what had been ordered ; and , lastly , that they had been just about to carry out the orders when I had arrived .

		Then we all laughed , for they did not in the least mind being found out , and the original order was fulfilled in the end . '

		It would be pleasant to quote further incidents of similar vein from this most instructive and amusing book , did space avail .

		At least a part - ing tribute must be paid to
Miss Durham	LOCATION	's nerv - ous and idiomatic English , characteristically that of an educated and refined woman , un - spoiled by grammars .

		As correspondent for the
London	LOCATION	' Daily Mail , ' Mr.
Edmund Candler	PERSON	was attached to
Colonel Younghusband	ORGANIZATION	's column in its invasion of
Tibet	LOCATION	, and he has preserved an account of the
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 journey in Ms volume called * The Unveiling of
Lhasa	LOCATION	/
Xo	ORGANIZATION	small part of the book deals with politics , the events leading up to the expedition and the events likely to follow it , and here Mr , Candler seems to be flatly apologetic and not always consistent .

		He characterizes
Great Britain	LOCATION	's attitude previous to this expedition as * weak and abortive , ' meaning thereby that
Tibet	LOCATION	was allowed to mind its own business and com - pelled the British to mind theirs .

		All the dis - putes arose through Tibetan unwillingness to establish commercial relations , and it once more appears that the rights of a race in regard to dealing with foreigners are based upon no prin - ciple of justice that a stronger nation is obliged to respect .

		Something is said of Eussian in - fluence , but the book fails to reveal anything of the sort , -- though why the Tibetans should not have the same right to deal voluntarily with
Russia	LOCATION	as with
Great Britain	LOCATION	under compulsion is not apparent to the non-British mind .

		For the rest , the story is surprisingly tame .

		Mr.
Candler	PERSON	bears forced tribute to the bravery of the natives with whom the superior arms of the British engaged ; but he nowhere succeeds in in - vesting his accounts of the fighting with any vividness or sense of reality .

		Lhasa itself was profoundly uninteresting in the main , though the religious rites were not without elements of awe , as is made evident in the following extract from an account of the services in the great Jok - hang , or cathedral : ` Service is being held before the great Buddhas as we enter , and a thunderous harmony like an organ peal breaks the interval for meditation .

		The Abbot , ■ who is in the center , leans forward from his chair and takes a bundle of peacock-feathers from a vase by his side .

		As he points it to the earth there is a clashing of cymbals , a beating of drums , and a blowing of trumpets and conch shells .

		Then the music dies away like the reverberation of cannon in the hills .

		The Abbot begins the chant , and the monks , facing each other like singing-men in a choir , repeat the litany .

		They have extraor - dinary deep , devotional voices , at once unnatural and impressive .

		The deepest bass of the West does not approach it , and their sense of time is perfect . '

		One does not gather from Mr.
Candler	PERSON	's pages that the Tibetans are in any sense barbarians , and their religion has certainly preserved them from development of the warlike spirit and con - sequent acts of foreign aggression .

		So charming are the late
George Gissing	PERSON	's anecdotes and reminiscences of travel on the eastern coast of southern
Italy	LOCATION	, collected under the alluring title of ' By the
Ionian Sea	LOCATION	, ' that if is respectfully suggested that more novelists be persuaded to travel in little known comers of
Europe	LOCATION	and bring back a sheaf of realities .

		^ Ir .

		Gissing is in love with antiquity , and Latin and Greek are still real to him .

		It is in the full classical and historical spirit that he wanders from the beaten path of modem davs and takes up the tale where it was interrupted by the bar - barian centuries ago .

		He did not always find local appreciation , -- as when he sought the an - cient home of Cassiodorius at
Coscia di Stalletti	ORGANIZATION	. '

		I had just begun to explain my interest in the locality , and I mentioned the name of Cassiodorius .

		As it passed my lips the jovial fellow -LSB- a local guide -RSB- burst into a roar of laughter .

		`` Cassiodorio !

		Ha , ha !

		Cassiodorio !

		Ha , ha , ha ! ''

		I asked him what he meant , and found that he was merely delighted to hear a stranger utter a name in familiar local use .

		He ran out from the cave , and pointed up the valley ; yonder was a fountain which bore the name , `` Fontana di Cassiodorio '' .

		Thereupon , I tried to discover whether any traditions cUng to the name , but these informants had only a vague idea that
Cassiodorius	PERSON	was a man of times long gone by . '

		Illness , bad food , occasional extori : ion , and vast ignorance were not permitted to outweigh the delight Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	found in localities conse - crated by age and association with happier times , and he has conveyed his enjo -RCB- Tnent to his readers with undiminished force .

		The volume contains some wood engravings by way of pictures , -- a welcome departure from the almost universal half-tone .

		Many books have been written of our far northern possessions , and from them it might be possible to obtain most of the information brought together by Mr.
J. S. McLain	PERSON	in his volume entitled `
Alaska	LOCATION	and the Klondike . '

		But Mr.
McLain	PERSON	resorted to no such device of com - pilation , obtaining his knowledge at first hand in company with a sub-committee of
United States Senators	ORGANIZATION	, who searched the country to learn its needs and report thereon to their col - leagues .

		Every advantage was offered , there - fore , to see both the dark and bright side of life on the edge of and within the arctic zone , and the result is a most informing volume .

		Some novel impressions will be gained by tiie reader , as when the author says : ' I do not care to be regarded as a believer in large agricultural possibilities fer
Alaska	LOCATION	, but I am impressed with the probability that in the interior of that remote country , where food supplies from the States must always be expensive , it will be practicable and profitable to produce meat and dairy and poultry and garden products in such quantity and at such prices as to solve the problem of development of large areas of gold-bearing gravel . '

		Nearly every part of
Alaska	LOCATION	was visited , and the book should serve for a long time -- ■ as books go in these rapid days -- in the capacity of an authoritative reference work .

		Dr.
George Aaron Barton	PERSON	's * A Years Wander - ing in Bible Lands ' is an unpretentious work made up of letters written home during the author 's journey through
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Palestine	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	.

Ephesus	LOCATION	and eating ice - cream frozen with the snows of
Lebanon	LOCATION	, the 386 THE DIAL -LSB-

		After seeing the dancing dervishes in
Constantinople	LOCATION	, this member of the Society of Friends writes , ' One comes away with a new sense of the kinship of humanity , and , if he has any sympathy with mysticism , he departs with the feeling that , strange as are the practices of these people , it is possible to understand the root from which they

		Birds ani > Other Folk .

		* It is interesting to notice that there is little blurring of the line between the bird books and the other nature books of this season .

		The all - round nature-lover who writes of the general fascination of out-of-doors , and embroiders his theme with a little bird-lore , has for the time betaken himself to silence .

		So far as this fact proves the absence of new volumes from Mr.
John Bun-oughs	PERSON	and Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	and others of their class -- if there are others of the same class -- it is wholly lamentable .

		So far as it proves a growing modesty on the part of amateurs it may not be very deplorable .

		Per - haps the time is already at hand when a mere love of the wild and the things of the wild does not so greatly distinguish the lover from his fellows as to justify him in publishing his thoughts .

		It may be that like the famous White Company , we have all stepped forward .

		Or it may be that instead of becoming more universal , the love of nature is taking deeper hold of those who profess it , and inspiring in them thoughts that do lie too deep for books .

		In either event we are not the losers by the fact that the new writings come to us from specialists , and are either bird-books or not hird-books , with no ' mixed up ' class between .

		Of the two characteristically English books on our present list , one is distinctly devoted to birds , the other as distinctly to the general study of nature .

		Mr.

		to teach their pupils to observe nature , it is admirably fitted .

		It is packed with scientific facts , with clear and practical suggestions for class room and study club , and with eye-opening and thought-stimulating questions .

		The draw - ings are accurate and easily comprehensible .

		There is no avoiding the query whether the cause of science is advanced by an arrangement which places in succession chapters on the rock-barn - acle , rats and mice , natural history clubs , the purple saxifrage , water lilies , and house flies .

		But no arrangement or lack of arrangement can destroy the value of the good sense and clarity with which these and all the other subjects are treated .

		The chapters on grasses , wood sorrel , and the house cricket are especially interesting .

		Another English book , ' Bird Life and Bird Lore , ' by the scholarly historian Mr.
R. Bos	PERSON	- worth
Smith	ORGANIZATION	, is full of delight for all bird-lov - ers , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	loves the lore almost as well as he loves the birds themselves , and it is scarcely too much to say that he knows everything that has been said in literature about his favorites , since the creation .

		However , he does not thrust the greatness of his knowledge upon j ^ ou , but uses it only to enforce his opinions of his winged friends .

		It seems curious at first that his favor - ites should be the owl and the raven ; but his preferences are justified by his experience .

		For the owl he pleads that it is not destructive , except of pests , and that other birds mob it because as a bird of night , quite unlike them - selves , it is a stranger to them .

		The owl 's dig - nity he holds in great admiration , saying of his visit to the eagle owls in the keep of Arundel Castle that ' as you entered you felt somewhat as the rude
Gaul	PERSON	or as the envoy of Pyrrhus felt , when he entered the
Roman Senate	ORGANIZATION	, that it was an assemblage , if not of gods , at least of kings , ' The raven , his next best friend , he insists was belied by the representative
Noah	PERSON	sent forth from the ark , for he is faithful , intelligent , and companionable , although mischievous and greedy .

		The author celebrates many other Eng - lish birds with almost equal affection .

		The book is one to be on permanently good terms with , for its genuine love of all feathered folk , its hatred of cruelty -- and Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's influence has been potent in abolishing the pole-trap and other villainies , -- its delicate humor , and its poetical perspective .

		Mr ,

		The land-crab who died climbing telegraph poles because he would not move an inch out of his accustomed path , the little antelope who for his discontent was transformed into a giraffe , the grasshopper that made a river valley , -- all these have things to say not unbecoming a wise man to hear .

		And while the wise man listens he will be delighted in eye and refreshed in soul by the illustrations , which are the very bub - bling-over of the author 's genius .

		Admirable fooling as this book of Mr.
Thomp	PERSON	- son -
Seton	ORGANIZATION	's is , it whets rather than blunts the reader 's appetite for two books of very different type , which will for time to come mark the present season as one of notable accomplishment .

		The first of tliese is the work of Mr. and Mrs.
George W. Peckham	PERSON	on ` Wasps , Social and Soli - tar -RCB- ' . '

		Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	in his introduction to the volume calls this Hhe most charming monograph in any department of our natural history that I have read in many a year , ' and adds : ` It is a wonderful record of patient , exact , and loving observation , which has all the interest of a romance .

		It opens up a world of
Lilliput	LOCATION	right at our feet , wherein the little people amuse and delight us with their curious human foibles and whimsi - calities , and surprise us with their intelligence and individuality .

		Here I had been saying in print that I looked upon insects as perfect automata , and all of the same class as nearly alike as the leaves of the trees or the sands upon the beach .

		I had not reckoned with the Peckhams and their Solitary wasps .

		The solitary ways of these in - sects seem to bring out their individual traits , and they differ one from another , more than any other wild creatures known to me . '

		The book is written so untechnically that a reader who does not know a wasp from a bee can understand and enjoy it .

		The first chapter records a series of experiments which prove that wasps detect differences in color , and are affected by smells more than sounds ; the last , which is devoted to the difference between instinct and intelligence , shows that the wasp 's sense of direction is due to a careful study of the geography of her nest , and not to a mysterious sense of location .

		The intervening pages describe some score of wasps , -- their nest-building and house-keeping , their killing and conveying of their prey , their care of their eggs .

		The authors are so careful and minute in their observation that they can sometimes correct ahd amend the great authority
Fabre	PERSON	himself .

		They say , for instance , of Philanthus punctatus : ` This is a pretty Little yellow-banded species much resembling Cerceris in appearance .

		The nest con - sists of a main gallery with pockets leading from it , each pocket being stored with one egg and enough bees to nourish a singlet larva .

		When the wasps emerge from the cocoon they find themselves in the company of their nearest relatives and in pos - session of a dwelling place , and they all live to - gether for a time before starting out independently to seek their fortunes .

		On the fifth of
August	DATE	we discovered on the island a happy family of this kind , consisting of three brothers and four sisters , the females , with their bright yellow faces and mandibles , being handsomer than the males .

		They seemed to be on the most amicable terms with each other , their only trouble being that while they were all fond of looking out , the doorway was too small to hold more than one at a time .

		The nest was opened in the morning at about nine o'clock , and during the next thirty or forty minutes their comical little faces would appear , one after another , each wasp enjoying the view for a few minutes with many twitchings of the head , and then retreating to make way for another , perhaps in response to some hint from behind . '

		Ko less care and devotion , and much more travel , has gone to the making of Mr.
Job	PERSON	's ' Wild Wings , ' a bird book that will be a lasting joy to everyone who has a heart for life in the open .

		From the
Magdalen Islands	ORGANIZATION	to the Flor - ida Keys , Mr.
Job	PERSON	has hunted - svith his camera ' the wild , hardy birds of the sea , whose strong wings make them masters of the elements . '

		He has had the grace , moreover , to tell the story of his conflicts and victories in a simple , straight - forward way .

		However firm the ordinary bird seeker may be in his affection for thrush , bobo - link , and other land birds , he can not but own the greater daring and romance of Mr.
Job	PERSON	's quest for pelican and ibis , spoonbill and kittiwake , or withhold his admiration for the wild and often grotesque beauty of the pictures Mr.
Job	PERSON	brings home .

		For the securing of these pictures the ardent ` hunter ' is impervious to all creature discomforts , standing regardless for hours in swamp water , or lying prone on a sand beach in the broiling sun , or cramping himself into a basket which his friends let down over a rock .

		Often he fastens his camera in a tree above a nest , and shutter-string in hand , hides in a thicket beneath until the wary bird comes home .

		He has work for his wits also , as in this con - quest of a small oyster catcher : ` The young rascal never moved a feather while it was being photographed .

		But when I thought to take it standing , we had a long , hard tussle .

		Finally I conquered by sheer persistence , putting my cap over it and removing it suddenly , to snap .

		When I let it go , it was comical to see those long stout legs measure off the rods over that sand to - ward its fond parents , apparently shouting , -- in gesture if not in voice , -- `` Mamma ,
Mamma	LOCATION	, here 's your little oyster catcher coming like a good one . ''

		* Mr.
Job	PERSON	's grammar is not always as shaky as in this case , but his struggles are always equally successful .

		Xo such collection of ` portraits ' can be found anywhere else , of kittiwakes and gan - nets wheeling and tumbling , of unfledged peli - cans and herons gawking in their nests , of jaegers and petrels skimming the waves , of a laughing gull really laughing , of plovers and 388 THE DIAL .

		* ITie merits of * The Garden of Allah ' are such as to place it distinctly at the head of its author 's works .

		Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	has hitherto been rather unfortunate both in his themes and in their treatment , showing a tendency to portray morbid types of character and to indulge in much unpleasant detail in the working-out of his situations .

		This tendency he has nearly over - come in the present instance , and he has , also , found a theme that permits of poetic treatment , besides lending itself to a strikingly dramatic purpose .

		A man and a woman are thrown together in an oasis on the edge of the
Sahara	LOCATION	, and the imagined peace which both have sought in repairing to this outpost of civilization becomes real in the joy of their mutual love .

		The joy is not lasting however , for when the man 's secret is revealed , it appears that he is a Trappist monk , who has broken his vows , and escaped into the world in quest of that knowledge of life which the monastery walls had hidden from him for a score of years .

		But the consciousness of sin still gnaws at liis soul , and finally forces him to the agony of confession .

		In this spiritual crisis , the wife proves herself the stronger of the two , for it is she who shows to him the path of duty -- which is the patii of renunciation and expiation -- leading him back , at first reluc - tantly , then willingly , and in the end almost gladly , to his living tomb .

		New York :
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, supreme self-sacrifice , both man and woman achieve a serener peace than that which they had before vainly sought in the desert .

		The story is one of poignant appeal to the spiritual sense , and the grave heauty of the tragedy finds fitting language for its expression .

		There is a far greater variety of interest than would be imagined from the foregoing outline , and the author has achieved a brilliant success in his picturesque effects .

		Neither the desert nor its denizens seem to have any secrets from him , and he records for us the soul of both with pen - etrating observation and subtle phrase .

		In all the three essentials of invention , style , and thought , this performance is highly commend - able , and entitles Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	to more serious consideration than ever before . '

		Hurricane Island ' is a romance of adventure of the good old-fashioned sort , dear to the hearts of boys of all ages , and written , withal , in a style that commends it to the judicious reader .

		There is a notable villain , a charming heroine , and an acceptable hero , all thrown together upon shipboard for a while , and then cast upon a desert island .

		The villain leads a mutiny to gain possession of the treasure on board , and there follows a desperate and protracted con - flict .

		Meanwhile , the ship , having touched at
Eio	PERSON	and
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	, proceeds through the Straits of
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	into the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and runs into
Hurricane Island	LOCATION	-LRB- invented for this pur - pose -RRB- .

		There the chief villain dies , riddled with bullets , and those of the lesser villains who do not share his fate are marooned upon the island , while the ship sails off with triumphant virtue at the helm .

		By this time the heroine , a princess by birth , is sufficiently subdued , and the hero -LRB- the ship 's doctor -RRB- has won the ship , the treas - ure , and the maiden all at once .

		This is a very stirring stor
-RCB- %	PERCENT	and is almost as good as
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	could have made it .

		The novels of Mr. and Mrs.
Castle	PERSON	have a charm that almost puts them in a class by them - selves , a charm which is as manifest as ever in their latest joint production , ' Rose of the World . '

		The charm is essentially one of style , for the plot is not remarkable , and the situations verge upon the melodramatic .

		But the style invests the whole affair with a sort of magical glow , and the romantic sentiment of the story is admirably sustained .

		Beginning in
India	LOCATION	, it ends in
England	LOCATION	, after a series of successful assaults upon our emotions , and one situation so startling as to be difficult for even romance to justify .

		That the first husband of the heroine , mourned for dead , should have been able to become a member of her household in the dis - guise of an Afghan , and remain unsuspected until he declared himself , involves a severe strain upon the credulities .

		But such things do happen

		THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	389 -LRB- in romance -RRB- , and when they happen to such striking dramatic purpose as in the present instance , we should not grumble very fiercely over their improbability .

		There is humor in the book , too , and of a subtle kind , supplied chiefly bv the travelling Frenchman who psychologizes about the people he meets , and frames the most charmingly plausible theories to account for their actions .

		He is nearly , if not quite , the most delightful figure in the story .

		We can find no fault with the fashion of collaboration as long as it continues to give us such charming work as *
Kose	PERSON	of the World , ' or the motor-car novels of C. ?

		^ .

		and
A. M. Wil	PERSON	- liamson . '

		The Lightning Conductor ' of these vivacious writers proved so entertaining that all who read it will be eager to get possession of ' The Princess Passes , ' its worthy successor .

		Here are picturesque travel , humorous incident , and tender passion all in one , skilfully com - mingled in just the right proportions .

		It is not altogether a tale of motoring , for mechanical means of locomotion give place in the Alps , and at a certain exciting juncture , to the primitive and picturesque donkey .

		This story is so delight - ful that we are not disposed to carp overmuch at the impossibility of its central situation -- that of a man travelling for some weeks with a girl in boy 's disguise , and not discovering the imposition .

		Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's new novel , * The Mar - riage of
William Ashe	PERSON	, ' is having its full share of critical attention , as was made inevitable by the great and solid reputation of its accomp - lished author .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is one of the few novelists who take their art with entire serious - ness , and is hence deserving of the most respect - ful attention .

		There is nothing particularly striking about the new book .

		It moves in the circles of English society with which the author has already made us acquainted by many other novels ; it has an Italian setting for some of the most striking chapters ; it again borrows some of its material from the lives of actual historical persons as recorded in the memoirs of a past age ; and it presents an intricate problem of conduct for our investigation .

		All these things it does admirably , with the fimmess of handling which Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has taught us to expect from her , and its ethical plane is high throughout .

		The author dearly loves a lord , and her hero in this instance is a very paragon of his class .

		Infatuated by a young woman of doubtful ante - cedents , a young woman who may fairly be described as a minx , he makes her his wife , and accepts all the consequences of the act .

		The ^ e turn out to be rather serious , for her escapades involve both his political career and his per - sonal honor ; but he bravely meets them all , and is so preposterously magnanimous about it that he seems far too good for this wicked world .

		The interest of the work is sustained , rising to an effective dramatic climax , and subsiding into the pathos of a closing scene of deathbed repent - ance and forgiveness .

		` The Vicissitudes of
Evangeline	LOCATION	, ' by Mrs.
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	, is the sprightly story , told in the first person , of a young woman with red hair and green eyes , who lives and moves and has her being in the smart set of English society .

		She is an irresponsible little creature , not to be com - mended for either grammar or behavior , and her subsequent career , were it unfolded to us , would probably not be unlike that of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's heroine .

		Mrs.
Glyn	PERSON	gives us a minx in the mak - ing , while Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	describes the finished product .

		This is the author 's third book in similar vein , and it has the whipped-cream con - sistency of its predecessors .

		It is mildly amusing .

		Dartmoor , for many years the undisputed literary province of the late Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	, has now fallen under the rule of Mr.
Eden Phill	PERSON	- potts , who holds sway therein by the same divine right of genius .

		To his lengthening list of novels with a Dartmoor setting Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	has recently added ` The Secret Woman , ' the strongest and the most sombre of all these fic - tions .

		The gloom of impending tragedy shad - ows the book from the very outset , and the breaking of the storm is direful in its fury .

		At the very close there comes a gleam of light to soften the tragic effect of what has gone before , but the impression ha & been too deep to be thus effaced , and the memory long lingers of the sin which has wrought all this ruin , and of its dreadful consequences .

		We are tempted to find for this book a motto in Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's familiar lines : ' In tragic
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	, God wot .

		No Yillain need be !

		Passions spin the plot : We are betrayed by what is false within .

		* So in ' The Secret Woman ' there is no cheap effect of downright viUainy , but there is instead a subtle study of impulsive sin and its corroding effects -- a study that rivals * The Scarlet Let - ter ' in earnestness and psychological pene - tration .

		What relief the story offers may be found in the sayings and doings of the rustic types which fill the canvas , grouped around the central figures .

		In the delineation of these types the author fairly rivals Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, making the indigenous population of Dartmoor as real to us as that of
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The Morals of
Marcus Ordeyne	PERSON	, ' as por - trayed by Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	in the novel which he has thus named , constitute a curious departure from what is conventionally approved , yet , considered essentially , they may fairly escape censure .

		He is a scholar , almost a recluse , by habit , yet he maintains sentimental 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, relations with two women which so flout the accepted observances of society that his conduct is under grave and not unnatural suspicion .

		Eeally , these relations are strictly decorous , but they illustrate almost tragically the danger of playing with fire .

		One of the women he has befriended after her desertion by a blackguard husband , and has been held to her through many years by a strong bond of intellectual sympathy .

		Thinking himself passionless , he does not realize that she has loved him passionately all the time .

		This particular entanglement is broken by the appearance of the errant husband , in the guise of the repentant sinner -- the unctuous guise of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's Einar , -- and the wife renounces love for duty , devoting the remainder of her life to the ordering of his irresponsible footsteps .

		Meanwhile , the other woman has appeared upon the scene .

		She is a fascinating creature -- a child in disposition and hardly more than a child in years , -- half Oriental in her parentage , escaped from a Syrian harem where she was reserved for marriage with an objectionable old person named Mustapha , and found homeless and disconsolate by
Marcus Ordeyne	PERSON	in a Lon - don park .

		He takes her to his home , treats her like the untutored child that she is , and seeks to fashion her into some sort of conformity with the ways of the Western world .

		Gradually he finds himself taking more interest in his strangely-acquired ward than in his studies , and the projected ' History of Eenaissance Morals ' gets less and less of his attention as the weeks pass .

		Just as he discovers that he loves the girl , and is about to make her his wife , she elopes with a dare-devil fellow who has been impru - dently admitted to the intimacy of his house - hold , and
Marcus	PERSON	finds himself the prey of emotions which he had never dreamed would touch his equable life .

		After the misery has become a little less poignant , he sums up his experiences in a passage which we may quote .

		` In the days gone by I was the victim of a singular hallucination .

		I flattered myself on being the one individual in the world not summoned to play his part in the comedy of Life .

		I sat alone in the great auditorium like the mad king of
Bavaria	LOCATION	, watching with little zest what seemed but a sorry spectacle .

		I thought myself secure in my solitary stall .

		But I had not counted on the high gods who crowd shadowy into the silent seats and are jealous of a mortal in their midst .

		With - out warning was I wrested from my place , hurled onto the stage , and before my dazzled eyes could accustom themselves to the footlights , I found my - self enmeshed in intolerable drama .

		I was un - prepared .

		I knew my part imperfectly .

		I missed my cues .

		I had the blighting self-consciousness of the amateur .

		And yet the idiot mummery was intensely real .

		Amid the laughter of the silent shadowy gods I sought to flee from the stage .

		I came to
Verona	LOCATION	and find I am still acting my part .

		I have always been acting .

		I have been acting since I was born .

		The reason of our being is to amuse the high gods with our histrionics .

		The earth itself is the stage , and the starry ether the infinite auditorium . '

		From this despair , none the l ^ s deep because it has reached the philosophical stage , our unpre - pared actor slowly worli his way out .

		Finally , the child whose departure had so torn his heart - strings comes back to him , • abandoned by her lover , and developed into womanhood by the bitterness of her experience .

		The broken threads of life are picked up one by one , and the end is a real though chastened happiness for both man and woman .

		We have outlined this plot at some length , because a briefer abstract would have been worse than useless .

		It remains to say that the story is intensely interesting from first to last , besides being rich in the sort of liter - ary and scholarly allusiveness that appeals most strongly to the cultivated mind .

		Mr.
Locke	PERSON	has given us excellent work before , but this is by far the best thing he has done , and we give it an ungrudging welcome .

		In the matters of typography , illustration , and decorative detail , Mr.
Eobert Ames Bennet	PERSON	's ' For the
White Christ	ORGANIZATION	' is a companion volume to Miss
Liljencrantz	PERSON	's two tales of Viking days and deeds .

		In theme , also , the work is similar , for it is a romance of the days when Karl the Great was engaged in the most difficult part of his task of empire-building , and its hero is a Norseman who becomes pledged to the great ruler and who eventually marries his daughter .

		The canvas of the work is very large indeed , and includes battle-fields all the way from the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	to the
Baltic	LOCATION	, and the hosts of the
Dane	PERSON	, the
Frank	PERSON	, the
Saxon	LOCATION	, and the Moor .

		All this portentous historical material , blended with much intrigue and passion , together with some of the gentler elements of romance , is skilfully brought into a tale of much action and dramatic vigor , couched in language that makes a fair pretence of archaism -LRB- of the conventional type , naturally -RRB- , and brought to a satisfactory issue .

		The story of
Roland	LOCATION	at
Roncesval	ORGANIZATION	is but one of the many episodes which ornament this ambi - tious historical portrayal .

		Various verse-frag - ments from mediaeval saga and epic serve as chapter-headings , and add not a little to the poetical effectiveness of the book .

		But we know not '
Gummerle	PERSON	, ' who is cited as one of the author 's authorities .

		Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's latest romantic production is called ` The Two Captains , ' and consists of two parts -- i a preface and a histor - ical tale .

		The latter is a narrative of the duel between
Kapoleon	PERSON	and
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, ending with the Battle of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, and introducing many pic - turesque incidents and figures .

		The love-inter - est is provided by an Irish Captain imder

		THE DIAL 391 of a royalist emigre and ci-dsvant admiral in the royal navy of
France	LOCATION	.

		The figure of this gentle - man is drawn with fine sympathy , and makes those of the two great historical protagonists seem like lay figures in comparison .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	gets up his historv - very carefully , and is almost over-technical in his description of sea-fighting .

		His pref ac-e , although brief , is quite as interest - ing as his romance , being aimed at the critic for the purpose of guiding aright the footsteps of that miserable person .

		He is enjoined to discuss the book itself , and to refrain from discussing the personality of the author , or his literary fecundity , -- in short , to refrain from minding the author at all .

		We have sought , with diffi - culty , to follow this admirable counsel , but feel bound to observe that the pages which contain it have a pxmgency which make them no less in - teresting -LRB- as well as instructive -RRB- than any of those that follow .

		Mr.
Samuel M. Gardenhire	PERSON	has written , in * The Silence of Mrs.
Harrold	PERSON	, ' a novel of strong '' and complex interest .

		It is one of those novels that begin in half a dozen places , and keep the reader puzzling over the possible relations of the persons and incidents introduced , until gradually order is evolved out of the seeming chaos , and all these disjecta membra are per - ceived to be parts of a single organic whole .

		It is a dangerous method to employ , and is more likely than not to lack adequate justification when the complete pattern of the plot is dis - closed , but in the present case we are bound to admit that the writer has done his work skil - fully enough to escape serious censure .

		The weakness of the book is in the fact that the reasons for Mrs.
Harrold	PERSON	's silence -LRB- and the agony following thereupon -RRB- prove to have been less cogent than we had a right to expect , and regarded in this light , the book is rather disap - pointiag .

		But there is no denying its power to hold the attention .

		The story is essentially one of modem life -LRB- mainly in
Xew York	LOCATION	-RRB- , and it makes a special feature of exploiting the ways of the unscrupulous syndicate that has of late years fastened itself upon our dramatic activity .

		Thus , various types of actors and managers divide our interest with the other characters , millionaires , lawyers , and inventors -- ^ to say nothing of the women -- who people these pages .

		It is certainly a novel of the better sort , and deserves respectful consideration .

		The dramatic incidents and the humors of a presidential campaign provide a theme for ' The Candidate , ' Mr.
Altsheler	PERSON	's new novel .

		The campaign described is an eclectic affair , not to be identified with any particular campaign in our recent histor -RCB- ' .

		but borrowing features from more than one , while in the personality of the candidate there are certain suggestions , at least .

		that make us think of Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	rather than of any other recent leader .

		But the author has skilfully avoided anything like precision of characterization , seeking to project into the future the imagination of his reaxiers , although necessarily dravring his essential material from experience of the past .

		In the ordinary mean - ing of construction , there is very little to be found in this story .

		It is a chronicle of the doings , the haps and mishaps , of a presidential candidate from the time of his nomination to the night of his triumph .

		He seems to be the nomi - nee of the Democratic party , although even that point is left in uncertainty , for all that may be positively averred is that he is a West - erner , filled with a righteous hatred of Wall Street , and for that reason opposed by the influ - ential
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	minority of his party .

		When he takes a decided stand against the iniquities of the tariff , that opposition becomes virulent , but the very boldness of the step brings him enough new support from unexpected quarters to bear him on to victory .

		It is not exactly easy to reconcile one 's imagination to an election in which tariff reform carries the State of
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania ; but that is the situation which meets us in the closing chapter .

		The interest of the gtory is largely provided by certain episodes dragged into the narrative by force , as it were , in which the candidate acts as a. deus ex machina in straightening out private difficulties .

		Some - thing of this sort was necessary for the sake of variety , but the book is made thereby a very disjointed affair .

		The newspaper reporter who has already figured in one of Mr.
Altsheler	PERSON	's earlier stories is the secondary hero of the pres - ent work .

		He is the close friend of the candi - date , and accompanies him throughout the cam - paign .

		He also falls in love with the candidate 's niece , which provides a pretty element of romance .

		The author often descends to carica - ture of a kind too broad to be really effective , particularly in the case of one correspondent of a l ^ ew York newspaper .

		There can be little doubt as to what particular journal is meant , and none whatever of the malicious animus with which it is assailed .

		Mr.
Altsheler	PERSON	has given us a thoroughly readable story , written in the breezy journalistic manner for which his expe - rience has fitted him ; it is a story , moreover , which reveals an intimate acquaintance with our political life , and a well-developed moral sense of its underlying issues .

		392 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Notes on New Novels .

		It is a curious coincidence that in Mr.
Frank Lewis Nason	PERSON	's `
The Vision of Elijah BerF	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
John H. Whitson	PERSON	's `
Justin Wingate	PERSON	,
Ranchman	ORGANIZATION	, ' both published by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the theme should be taken from the visions of two religionaries , the former book bearing out the proph - ecy of a Californian valley made softly green and luxuriant with orange trees grown by irrigation , the latter doing the same thing with a valley in Colo - rado brought into fruitfulness through the small farms that supplant the older cattle ranches when irrigation is introduced .

		Here , however , resem - blances cease .

		Mr.
Nason	PERSON	, himself an engineer , accords the place of hero to the man who dams the rivers , tunnels the mountains , and brings into being the dream of the visionary Berl ; while Mr.
Whitson	PERSON	, experienced in newspaper work and life in the West , shows how a little foundling lad grows up into whole - someness in spite of sordid surroundings , owing to the teachings of a good man and the love of a bright and worthy girl .

		Mr.
Nason	PERSON	introduces a theme of practical honesty and commercial integrity , showing how the almost fanatic Calvinist , sure of his own election , is too easily persuaded into rank betrayal of trust and actual felony , his moral delinquency being accentuated by his discarding the love of his adoring and colorless wife for the unretumed love of a thoroughly capable Californian woman of business .


Justin Wingate	PERSON	's temptations come to him while he is a member of the
Colorado	LOCATION	legis - lature , but he keeps his soul and body clean even while those most closely connected with him suc - ceed in turning the monopoly of the cattlemen into the monopoly of water following the introduction of irrigation .

		An episode in
Boston	LOCATION	society is portrayed by an anonymous hand in ` The Opal ' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the book taking its title from the soubriquet of the girl whoi plays the leading part .

		She has been so reared that she takes on the color of the company she chances to be with , and is married to a man whose nature ^ requires constant bolstering .

		The result is not fortunate , each intensifying the lack of the other .

		Another girl confesses her love for the husband when she is on the point of sub - mitting to an operation which promises to be fatal .

		She survives , the wife eventually dies , and after a considerable time needed to convince the girl that she is not being proposed to merely because she had been too confiding , there is a second mar - riage and the curtain falls .

		It will be seen that the argument is unusual , and it is strikingly pre - sented .

		It seems , however , to be a theme too ex - tensive for treatment so brief , and there are other evidences , slight but convincing , of lack of crafts - manship .

		There can be little doubt , for all that , of the accuracy of the picture it presents of a certain phase of
Boston	LOCATION	social life , and its interest is unfailing .

		Mr.
Alfred Henry Lewis	PERSON	, as the interpreter of life in a cattle town of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, is able to com - bine fact and fancy into a convincing whole , and ` The Sunset Trail ' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- follows the `
Wolfville	LOCATION	' stories in logical succession .

		Just as an earlier vol - ume related the more or less apocryphal deeds and sayings of Colonel
William Greene Sterett	PERSON	, so this is written around Mr.
William Barclay	PERSON	-LRB- ` Bat ' -RRB- Mas - terson , informing the world of that worthy 's cool - headed and unquestioning courage and sureness of aim while sheriff of a
Texas	LOCATION	county .

		The quaint and expressive vocabulary of those parts dominates all the conversations , and Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	's keen wit and almost hypertrophied sense of the ridiculous makes the volume intensely interesting to those who have any well developed humor of their own -- enough , say , to keep them from being shocked at a code of morals sufficiently practical for the time and place but coinciding at few points with that of our more usual civilization .


Dodge City	ORGANIZATION	, the very crown of the cattle region , is the scene of this tale of the simple life as lived in
Texas	LOCATION	a generation ago .

		The difficulties that lie between the idealism of a woman 's college and the finding of one 's self iu the greater practical world , when that self has a Latin temperament and is forced to dwell in
America	LOCATION	, are set forth by Miss
Anna Robeson Brown	PERSON	in ` The Wine Press ' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a study of character of much worth .

		The heroine is the daughter of a
New England	LOCATION	mother and an Italian poet who has abandoned his family for the love of a great actress .

		To the college where
Giovanna	PERSON	is struggling with a conventional education comes the actress and her daughter .

		Giovanna takes charge of the irresponsible little girl , her half sister , fol - lows her to
New York	LOCATION	, and is with her when she comes to an end that
Gipvanna	ORGANIZATION	thinks morally culpable .

		Thence
Giovanna	PERSON	goes as governess to the daughter of a distinguished painter , a man quite devoid of morals , fleeing thence to the house in northern
New England	LOCATION	in which her mother was born .

		A physician is the hero of the tale , a fine fellow who holds the reader 's sympathies .

		The book is unconventional in its interest , and above the average of contemporary fiction .

		Notwithstanding the flood of Revolutionary romances during the past few years , there is still room for so true a tale of love and adventure as Miss
Theodora Peck	PERSON	recounts in `
Hester	PERSON	of the Grants : A Romance of Old
Bennington	LOCATION	' -LRB- Fox , Duf - field
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The reference in the main title is to the
New Hampshire Grants	ORGANIZATION	out of which the state of
Vermont	LOCATION	came into independent being .

		The border warfare of the period , culminating in the vividly and convincingly described battle of
Bennington	LOCATION	, the part played by the scouts and spies of the oppos - ing armies , the varying fortunes of war by which the captor of to-day becomes the prisoner of to - morrow , the strife of three or four men of different aspirations and widely variant character for the love of the beautiful and patriotic
Hester	PERSON	, the intro - duction of
Ethan Allen	PERSON	, Colonel Stark ,
Ira Allen	PERSON	, and other historic characters , -- all these elements combine to form a panorama of the times which deserves careful reading and much commendation .

		In ` Psyche : A Romance of the Reign of Tibe - rius ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Walter S. Cramp	PERSON	has done an ambitious and gratifying bit of inter - pretation , portraying on one side the simple and satisfying family life of humbly situated Greeks in exile at
Rome	LOCATION	and on the other the inconceivably corrupt practices of the imperial Roman court .

		It is Psyche , the dancing girl , and Gyges , the chariot - eer , who are heroine and hero of the little romance that runs through the story , but the writer 's chief concern is with
Tiberius	PERSON	himself and with the infa - mous ^ lius Sejanus , whose rise from prefect of the Praetorian Guard to the consulship by the most infamous means and whose sudden downfall just as he expected to grasp the reins of power are vividly set forth , -- in spite of the literary conventions which stand between the modern reader and a com - plete account of heathendom at its worst .

		The lead - ing figures of Roman palace life appear ,
Agrippina	LOCATION	, widow of Germanicus , chief among them , to show what

		THE DIAL 393 Mr.
William Dana Orcutt	PERSON	's ` The Flower of Des - tiny ' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- contains the full story of the love between
Mademoiselle de Montijo	ORGANIZATION	and Prince
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	, from the moment of their meeting at Lady
Blessington	PERSON	's in
London	LOCATION	to the striking scene at
Compiegne	LOCATION	when the newly crowned emperor of the French introduces the beautiful girl to his brilliant court as the future
Empress Eugenie	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book opens with the coming of
Louis	LOCATION	to the British capital just ofter his escape from the fortress of Ham , and he is permitted to tell in his own words the .

		well-planned release from imprisonment .

		The sincerity of the affection which rises in the princely adventurer 's heart at his first introduction to the lovely Spaniard , the hold it takes and keeps upon him ,
Eugenie	PERSON	's disinterested willingness to with - draw that her lover may wed according to his station , and the manner in which her last objection is removed form a romance that was well worth the interesting treatment Mr.
Orcutt	PERSON	has given it .

		A word should be said for the physical beauty of the book , its inset illustrations and violet decorations for every page being as appropriate as they are artistic .

		At last the American fireman has had something like justice done him in our literature , Mr.
Harvey J. O'Higgins	PERSON	's ` The Smoke-Eaters ' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- being an interrelated series of tales of the
New York	LOCATION	fire department , -- more particularly of one of the companies in it , its captain and its members .

		Mr.
O'Higgins	PERSON	, in fine contrast to many of his fellow - writers , has paid his readers the compliment of carefully revising his work so that it presents itself as a homogeneous whole without repetitions ; he has also confined himself to the heroic deeds and curious idiosyncrasies of his characters without at - tempting to thrust any love of woman into the narrative .

		With one exception all the characters are Irishmen , who seem to have a general qualifica - tion for the cool-headed courage which makes mod - em successful fire-fighting possible .

		When these heroes of peace are not actually engaged in saving lives and extinguishing flames , they are rather more human than lovable , as Mr.
O ` Higgins	PERSON	depicts them , though the writer never lets any sympathy for his characters be lost .

		Miss
F. F. Montresor	PERSON	borrows the title for her latest novel , ` The Celestial Sxirgeon ' -LRB- Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , directly from
Stevenson	PERSON	's poem , but she fails rather palpably to convince her readers that the title is fully applicable .

		A baby girl , the unblest offspring of an Englishman of family and a Frenchwoman of education , is taken for adoption by an English spinster whose estates adjoin those of her father 's people , the latter property being now in possession of a retired tradesman who is writing the family history .

		The spinster marries a discredited physician , and the girl goes to the kindly natured neighbor in consequence .

		The end does not come with her eventual marriage to him , but is delayed until after his death , the birth of a posthumous child , and the reconciliation not only of the girl and her mother , but of the mother 's husband .

		This sounds somewhat confused , but the book itself has a diversity of interests which do not admit of succinct statement .

		The theme , as suggested in the title , lies in the gradual awaken - ing to charitable thought of the heroine , keeping pace with her increased knowledge of life .

		Nothing previously written by Mr.
Charles Heber Clark	PERSON	-- `
Max Adeler	PERSON	' -- has given promise of a storj - 80 creditable as that of ` The Quakeress ' -LRB-
John C Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the charming and ill-fated heroine of • which stands out clearly among the multitudinous heroines of contemporary fiction .

		The scene is laid in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	just before and during the Civil War .

		The girl is beloved by a fine young man of her own creed , but a worldly brother and sister from the South come into the ; lives of the almost betrothed pair with serious results .

		An ele - ment of humor is supplied by the wife of an Epis - copalian rector , a character almost worthy of being mentioned with
Anthony TroUope	PERSON	's famous Mrs.
Pronty	PERSON	.

		Some admirable descriptions add to the interest of the book , and there is a chapter con - cerned with the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, as it was seen by the inhabitants of the region , which gives a vivid conception of the horrors of war .

		The transition stage between the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	civiliza - tion and that of the world 's people in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	before the Civil War .

		more especially as illustrated in the single career of the firmly drawn character whose name is that of the book , is the central theme of Mr.
Edward Uffington Valentine	PERSON	's new novel , `
Hecla Sandwith	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- .

		The story is a long one , and not firmly knit together , but it has much to do with the development of the spiritual side of a girl whose education has taken her far from the simplicity of the Friends .

		An Eng - lish mining engineer prevails upon
Hecla	ORGANIZATION	to marry him while her heart is still in the keeping of her cousin , the latter being effectually barred from her by the prejudice of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	against the mar - riage of cousins .

		The conclusion , wherein the hus - band wins at last the real affection and respect of his recalcitrant wife , is the best written portion .

		- if a book that preserves with almost photographic fidelity the manners and customs of a time fully departed .

		The four stories of varying length that Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	brings together under the title of ` Fond Adventures ' -LRB- Harper -RRB- will be something of a disappointment to nearly all of the large circle of admirers who have followed this writer 's work from the beginning .

		The brief tale of love , min - strelsy , and rapine that opens the volume leaves anything but an impress of artistic sincerity , while its successor , a revival of the ` Captain
Brazenhead	PERSON	' of a former volume , is spun out until it is nothing less than dull .

		The third story , setting forth the ruthlessness with which a lover is murdered by his opponents in the
Florence	LOCATION	of renaissance days , has a climax striking for its exhibition of this quality of ruthlessness .

		and in that is fully up to the stan - dard Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	has set for himself in work pre - viously published .

		The last of the four stories , ` The Love Chase , ' is the longest , but is more con - spicuous for manner than for matter .

		Taken as a whole , the impression remains that the book is made up of work done early in Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's literary career , and denied publication until now .

		Romance of the fourteenth century fills the pages of Mr.
C. E. D. Phelps	PERSON	's ` The Accolade ' -LRB-
Lippin	LOCATION	- cott -RRB- .

		The hero , son of a worthy Englishman , being kidnapped into
France	LOCATION	by a ship 's captain , betakes himself to
Italy	LOCATION	, wins a knighthood through gallant - ry , and returns to his native
England	LOCATION	with wealth and honor just in time to prevent his sweetheart from entering a convent for lack of him .

		The poets are reverenced in the persons of Chaucer and Pe - trarch , and it is from a careful study of the writ - ings of the former that the rather difl & cult and mul - tifarious dialects of Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	's book are con - structed , even the ordinary narrative being loaded with archaisms .

		The book shows the most careful study and great painstaking , and abounds in varied adventure .

		The rudeness of the
England	LOCATION	of the period and the refinement of
Italy	LOCATION	serve as foils .

		394 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, each for the other , and the whole tale is - in the nature of a treasure house for the student of customs .


Cape Cod	LOCATION	is in a sense the heart of that
New England	LOCATION	which remains untouched and unassimil - ated by modernity .

		There Mr ,
Joseph C	PERSON	, Lincoln places all the action of his latest story , ` Partners of the Tide ' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , and to the book many an exiled man and woman of our northeastern states can turn for joyful recollection of earlier days .

		A small boy is adopted on the death of his parents by two maiden kinswomen , goes to school , and falls under the influence of the captain of a vessel in the coasting trade .

		After some years on board his ship , the dishonesty of their employers forces them back upon their own resources and they become the joint owners of a wrecking schooner .

		The interest of the story is pretty well divided between the young fellow 's love for a neighbor and schoolmate and his business success , but it is in the sketches of
New England	LOCATION	character threaded upon the nar - rative that its chief attractiveness lies .

		Dry Yan - kee wit , shrewdness , and common sense are scat - tered through the pages in a way to delight lovers of the sea and of
New England	LOCATION	.

		` The Belted Seas ' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Mr.
Arthur Colton	PERSON	, is both picaresque and nautical , being made up of the varied adventures on sea and shore -- with a sin - gle excursion inland , due to a tidal wave -- of one Captain
Thomas Buckingham	PERSON	, a
New Jerseyman	LOCATION	, in company with a select assortment of ` down-east ' Yankees , South Americans , savages from the
Pacific Islands	LOCATION	, Central Americans , Chinese , Burmese , an.l others , the whole culminating in an elopement after the doughty captain had abandoned the sea for the comparatively prosaic occupation of hotel-keep - ing along
Long Island Sound	LOCATION	.

		The captain himself tells the story of his thirty years ' wanderings with a humor characteristically American , interspersing his narrative with reflections upon the conduct of life in general which sum up no .

		small part of tho wisdom of the ages .

		Some of his turns of thought are provocative of the heartiest laughter , and he never permits his auditors an instant of boredom .

		The charming art shown by Mrs ,
Sara Andrew Shafer	PERSON	in her second book , ` Beyond Chance ot Change ' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has a certain resemblance to that of the actor .

		The life of children not yet in their ` teens , inhabitants of a little city of the middle West at a time soon after the Civil War , is set forth in a manner that will recall his own childhood to every grown person into whose hands the book may
fall	DATE	.

		It is a little girl who holds the center of the stage , and girls and women are accorded practically all the realism of the tales , the men and boys being -- from a masculine point of view , at least -- considerably idealized .

		No smnll part of the charm of the narrative lies in its re - moval from the strentiosities of modern city life , while for the little people there is the most careful inculcation of a pure morality which never degen - erates into cant .

		Mr.
Harold MacGrath	PERSON	contributes two volumes to ` The Pocket Books ' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- .

		` The Prin - cess Elopes ' is a brief tale of that eastern
Europe	LOCATION	which lies near the Bohemian coasts , wherein a young American college man of great wealth and attractiveness ' succeeds in winning the heiress to a little throne , it being discovered in the process of this adventure that he is the long lost heir to a throne adjoining .

		The story would be much more interesting if its outcome were less clearly foreshadowed , though it is difficult to see how this could be avoided in the space accorded the nar - rative .

		The other volume , ` Enchantment , ' con - tains five tales , most of them having to do with some little turn of destiny rather remote from the ordinary course of human existence .

		The scenes of four are in the
United States	LOCATION	, and deal severally with politics , polite adventure , and love ; the other takes place at
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	.

		Without being in any way remarkable , both books will provide amuse - ment and entertainment , and were not written with any other end in view .

		It is the glamour of the artistic temperament that leads Mrs.
Willa Sibert Cather	PERSON	to name her collection of short stories ` The Troll Garden ' -LRB- Mc -
Clure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Seven truly entertaining studies of somewhat abnormal human nature fill the little book , and leave abundant food for re - flection .

		The first possesses subtlety , being an account of a woman who runs after celebrities of various sorts , is grossly insulted by one of them , and yet persists in blundering on , a subject for mirth to her enemies and of pity to her friends , ` The Sculptor 's Funeral , ' which follows , is quite as vivid in its abruptness of contrast , the bringing home to a sordid little western village of the body of a distinguished artist affording the opportunity for contrasting noble artistic ideals and the crass - est commercialism .

		Taken as a whole , the book indicates more than usual talent for close delinea - tion .

		BRIEFER MENTION 423 NOTES 423 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 424 THE MAZZINI CENTENARY .

		`` Worsliippers of the ideal who found last month chiefly noteworthy because it rounded the first hundred years since the death of
Schil	PERSON	- ler may find the present month mainly memor - able as marking the first centennial of
Mazzini	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		A believer in the doctrine of metempsy - chosis might well be impressed with the fact that some six weeks after the German poet yielded up his breath the apostle of Italian unity became a living soul , and entered upon a life which was destined to be consecrated to the same lofty aims , and to be crowned with a fairer vision ere its close .

		And those to whom the transmigration of souls is but a baseless imagin - ing may find in the coincidence an apt illustra - tion of the old figure of the torch-bearers , each handing to his successor the sacred light of the truth that in the end must surely make man free .

		Different as were the circumstances environ - ing the lives of
Schiller	PERSON	and
Mazzini	PERSON	, different not only in their personal bearings , but also in all those broader aspects whereby the eighteenth centur -RCB- ' was separated from the nineteenth , we must recognize nevertheless that the two men were inspired by one and the same patriotic impulse , one and the same gospel of human brotherhood , one and the same austere ethics of devotion and self-sacrifice .

		Each in his own way all his life long fought the good fight ; each was a true knight of the spirit in thought and deed ; and the memory of each remains to us as a shining example of fortitude in adver - sity , of hopefidness in discoura ^ ment , and of faith in an ideal whose light was dimmed for duller visions by the sullen mists of c -RCB- `` nicism , and indifferentism , and selfishness .

		All honor to these souls , and to all kindred souls whose keen sight , purged as with euphrasy and rue , is fixed steadfastly upon goals too far-set to be discerned by the commonalt -RCB- ' , yet surely es - tablished as the ultimate aims of human aspira - tion .


Mazzini	PERSON	was not without his meed of sympa - thy and fitting appreciation during his lifetime , and to few men have such tributes been paid as were bestowed upon him in his later years , and have continued to be bestowed , by the noblest spirits of the age , since his death .

		` All honor to thee , thou noble
Mazzini	PERSON	, ' said
Clough	PERSON	, writ - ing from Eome in the last days of the Trium - virate , ' when from Janiculan heights thundered the cannon of
France	LOCATION	. '

		Carlyle , usually grudg - ing of praise , called him ' a man of genius and virtue , a man of sterling veracity , humanity , and nobleness of mind . '

		The
Master of Balliol	ORGANIZATION	said of him that ` he had a genius beyond that of most ordinary statesmen , ' and Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	pronounced him ` probably the highest moral genius of the century . '

		Imagiaative writers , too , have glorified him in verse and prose : he is exalted in Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's ` Vit - toria , ' and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has constituted himself paneg -RCB- Tist-in-chief of him whose ad - 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, vent is thus prophesied in '
Marino Faliero	PERSON	' : * Men that hear His name far off shall yearn at heart , and thank God that they hear , and live : but they that see , They that touch hands with heaven and him , that feed With light from his their eyes , and fill their ears `` With godlike speech of lips whereon the smile Is promise of more perfect manhood , born Of happier days than his that knew not him , And equal-hearted with the sun in heaven From rising even to setting , they shall know By type and present likeness of a man What , if truth be , truth is , and what , if God , God . '

		These are English tributes only , but they are the most effective for our purpose because of the witness they tear to the fact that
Mazzini	PERSON	's teaching and example far transcend the limits of his own country and the hearing of his own compatriots .

		In spite , however , of the praise thus accorded
Mazzini	PERSON	by ' those who know , ' we may still find here and there traces of the undercurrent of unsympathetic or antagonistic sentiment which during his lifetime sought to asperse his mo - tives and belittle his achievements .

		Those who sat in the seats of the mighty found his ardent propaganda of republicanism -- with its direct and vital appeal to the spiritual aspect of hu - man nature -- a force far more difficult to combat than the efforts of ordinary revolution - ists , and they did their best to create the legend which pictured him as a criminal conspirator against the established order .

		Other critics were found in those who sought by more direct means and practical methods to restore
Italy	LOCATION	to its proper place among the nations , and who , with their partisans , endeavored to exalt those means and methods as the only ones really worth considering , oblivious of the truth tliat the moral regeneration which was the object of
Mazzini	PERSON	's apostol ` ate was the underlying cause of all that the Risorgimento accomplished -- that without this renewal of the spirit neither arms nor diplomacy would have been of serious avail for so great a task .

		Such critics , in their zeal for the glory of Cavour and
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	and
Garibaldi	PERSON	, have particularly sought to min - imize the influence of the man whose silent labors prepared the soil for their harvest , and alone made possible the success which crowned their efforts .

		But all this ' cloud of detrractions Tude ' has wellnigh spent its obscuring effect , and as the years that knew
Mazzini	PERSON	recede from our immediate gaze , we may with more and more confidence echo the words of his poet : ` Life and the clouds have vanished ; hate and fear Have had their span Of time to hurt , and are not : he is here , The sunlike man . '

		The message of
Mazzini	PERSON	, like the message of Scihiller , is one of which our own age ia peculiarly in need .

		Divested of its temporal accidents , it stands revealed as the quintes - sence of Christian ethics , restated in the terms of modem social conditions .

		It is summed up in one pregnant phrase , the duties of man , not ` Conflicting with , but merely complementing , that other phrase , the rights of man , to which the French Ee volution gave such ringing utter - ance .

		Here is the doctrine , embodied in a definition of the religious idea : ` That idea elevates and purifies the individual ; dries up the springs of egotism , by changing , and removing outside himself the centre of activ - ity .

		It creates for man that theory of duty which is the mother of self-sacrifice , which ever was , and ever will be , the inspirer of great and noble things ; a sublime theory , that draws man near to God , borrows from the divine nature a spark of omnipotence , crosses at one leap all obstacles , makes the martyr 's scaffold a ladder to victory , and is as superior to the narrow , imperfect theory -LRB- rf rights as the law is superior to one of its corollaries . '

		What a clearing of the moral atmosphere would result from an infusion of this spirit into the social conflicts of to-day , with their sordid selfishness of motive , their petty and ignoble aims .

		To the belief thus formulated at the age of thirty ,
Mazzini	PERSON	adhered throughout his long life , never perturbed by passion , but calm in the faith that the fundamental rule of himian conduct was to be found in this acceptance of the claims of duty as paramount . '

		Mine is not the work of a writer , ' he said in ' Faith and the Future , ' ' it is the stem and fearless mission of an apostle . '

		But if it were not for
Mazzini	PERSON	's writings we should find it difficult to understand his immense influence , and wellnigh impossible to realize the loftiness of his character .

		These writings are , indeed , a precious legacy from the age of political tur - moil that gave them shape , and their value has by no means lapsed with the historical occasion of their production .

		More enduring than the monument at
Genoa	LOCATION	those fervent appeals to the highest instincts of our nature are likely to prove , and the Italian government has done itself honor in planning a national edition of his complete works .

		If any further excuse than this were needed for speaking of him in the pages of a literary journal , it might easily be found in those of his writings which belong to literature pure and simple , in the keen and graceful essays which he devotes to
Byron	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, to Hugo and Lamennais , to
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Benan	PERSON	, and to the great poet of his own race whose genius overtops all but the half dozen greatest in the history of all literature .

		THE DIAl , 409 ^ ^ t gtfa -RRB- goohs .

		Mr.
IiANG	PERSON	* S XiITERARY liOITERINGS .

		* * Young men , especially in
America	LOCATION	/ saye Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, * write to me and ask me to recom - mend '' a course of reading .

		^ ' Distrust a course of reiading !

		People who really care for books read ail of them .

		There is no other course .

		Let this be a reply .

		No other answer shall they get from me , the inquiring young men .

		^ If the writer of these words does not convey the impression of having himself read quite all lit - erature , he at least has a way of giving one a sense of the splendid vastness and infinite vari - ety of the literary realm .

		Contrast with his tone the somewhat peevish note in an utterance of his fellow-countryman .

		Hume .

		Writing to
Gilbert Elliot	PERSON	in
1757	DATE	,
Hume saj-s	PERSON	, referring to his ' History , ' -- ' I undertook this work because I was tired of idleness and foimd reading alone , after I had perused all good books -LRB- which I think is soon done -RRB- , a somewhat languid occu - pation . '

		But poor
Hume	PERSON	was writing a hun - dred years before the public-library movement had well started , and a century and a half be - fore Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's generosity had endeared him to the Anglo-Saxon world of readers .

		Instead of lamenting now that all good books can be so soon read , one becomes increasingly and de - spairingly conscious how many books in how many languages are always waiting , indeed clamoring , to be read .

		Reading is likened by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	to opium-eating : it unlocks to us artificial paradises .

		The comparison might have been carried further , in that the daily dose has to be steadily increased to satisfy the crav - ing of the true lover of reading , who is a very different creature from the mere book-lover , or book-collector , with whom reading is often the last use to which books are to be put .

		A pas - sage depicting some of the charms of reading may be quoted from the opening chapter of our author 's ` Adventures among Books . '

		He _ is speaking of the ancient classics . '

		There is a eh.ann in finding ourselves -- our common humanity , our puzzles , our cares , our joys , in the writings of men severed from us by race , religion , speech , and half the gulf of historical time -- which no other literary pleasure can equal .

		Then there is to be added , as the university preacher observed , `` the pleasure of despising our fellow creatures who do not know Greek . ''

		Doubt - less in that there is great consolation . '

		The regret is often expressed that the
Bible	LOCATION	has been from our earliest years so often read to us and by us , so regularly dinned into our ears from the pulpit , and so quoted and para - • Adventubes Among Books .

		By
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		With portrait .

		New York : Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		phrased at every turn , that we are incapable , at maturity , of appreciating its worth , spiritual and literary .

		Sir .

		Lang thinks it is much the same with
Tennyson	PERSON	's poems : use has made them too familiar .

		To the boy
Andrew	PERSON	, turning in weariness from Tupper 's ' Proverbial
Phil	PERSON	- osophy , ' the poet of the
Table Round	ORGANIZATION	dawned as a new light ; ' a new music was audibile , a new god came into my medley of a Pantheon , a god never to be dethroned . '

		Concerning our first loves in books , the writer says some irue things .

		` People talk , in novels , about the delights of a first love .

		One may venture to doubt whether everybody exactly knows which was his , or her , first love , of men or women , but about our first loves in books there can be no mistake .

		They were , and remain , the dearest of all ; after boy - hood the bloom is off the literary rye ... As long as we live we hope to read , but we `` never can recapture the first fine , careless rapture . ''

		Besides , one begins to write , and that is fatal .

		My own first essays were composed at school -- for other boys .

		Not long ago the gentleman who was then our English master wrote to me , informing me he was my earliest public , and that he had never credited my younger brother with the essays which that unscrupulous lad -LRB- `` I speak of him but brotherly '' -RRB- was accustomed to present for his con - sideration . '

		Mr ,
Lang	PERSON	's recollections of
Stevenson	PERSON	are among the best things in his book .

		Although not of
Stevenson	PERSON	's closest friends , he was inti - mate enough to feel the full charm of his bril - liant junior .

		Here is his impression of the young man as he first saw him in
1873	DATE	: ` He looked as , in my eyes , he always did look , more like a lass than a lad , with a rather long , smooth oval face , brown hair worn at greater length than is common , large , lucid eyes , but whether blue or brown I can not remember , if brown , certainly light brown .

		On appealing to the author - ity of a lady , I learn that brown was the hue .

		His colour was a trifle hectic , as is not unusual at
Mentone	LOCATION	, but he seemed , under his big blue cloak , to be of slender , yet agile frame .

		He was like nobody else whom I ever met .

		There was a sort of uncommon celerity in changing expression , in thoug ` ht and speech . '

		And yet this smooth-faced , girlish-looking youngster was brimful of pluck . '

		In
Paris	LOCATION	at a cafe , ' narrates Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, ' I remember that Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	heard a Frenchman say the Eng - lish were cowards .

		He got up and slapped the man 's face . ''

		Monsieur , vous m ` avez f rappe , '' said the
Gaul	PERSON	.

		`` A ce qu'il parait , '' said the
Scot	PERSON	, and there it ended . '

		To
Stevenson	PERSON	life was a drama , ' and he delighted , like his own British admirals , to do things with a certain air . '

		He was possessed with the inextinguish - able childish passion for making believe , and it remained with him to the end . '

		I have a theory , ' says Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, ' that all children pos - sess genius , and that it dies out in the general - ity of mortals , abiding only with people whose genius the world is forced to recognize .

		Mr. 410 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	,
Stevenson	PERSON	illustrates , and perhaps partly sug - gested , this private philosophy of mine . '

		But the theory is by no means so private a posses - sion as the author seems to think .

		Of American writers ,
Hohnes	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	are deemed worthy of a Chapter apiece .

		With somewhat superfluous particularity Mr.
Lang	PERSON	explains why he can not reckon Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	among the very great authors .

		No one pr & - eumes so to estimate him , and the Scotch critic does him ample honor in classing him with Dr.
Thomas Browne	PERSON	, Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, and Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, as representing ` the physician in humane letters . '

		In this essay the writer in - cidentally refers to ' the witch-burning , periwig - hating , doctrinal Judge
Sewall	PERSON	. '

		The epithet * witch-burning ' might be suffered to pass as a conventional and convenient fashion of speak - ing ; but in the later chapter on Hawthorne Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's evil genius has made him write ' of those judges who burned witches and persecuted Quakers . '

		It must be that our learned author , on mature reflection , will remember that witch - burning was never a
New England	LOCATION	pastime , or crime .

		The utmost limit to which the Salem frenzy went was the hanging of certain persons for alleged undue familiarity with the powers of darkness .

		Nineteen unfortunates thus met their fate on Gallows Hill , and a twentieth , old
Giles Corey	PERSON	, was pressed to death for refusing to plead .

		Toward the end of this interesting paper on
Holmes	PERSON	, the author appears to be guilty of something akin to the putting on of erudite airs with no sufiicient cause .

		He says of the Doctor , ` How far he maintained his scholar - ship , I am not certain ; but it is odd that , in his preface to '' The Guardian Angel , '' he should quote from ``
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	the younger '' a story for which he might have cited Aristotle . '

		Has not that a very impressive ap - pearance of superior learning , of an enviable familiarity with the writings of the Stagirite ?

		But turn to the preface in question , and there you will find a footnote duly explaining that ` the original version of this often-repeated story -LSB- which the author has just told -RSB- may be found in
Aristotle	LOCATION	's Ethics , Book 7th , Chapter 7th , ' However , it is not beyond the limits of possibility that this note was lacking in the copy of the book read by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, or that it was overlooked by him , or that he recorded its sub - stance and afterward , in a moment of forgetful - ness , credited the item to his own critical acu - men , or finally that he read and remembered the note and yet wrote with no intention to deceive .

		He is at liberty to retort , if he wishes , with an ' honi soit qui mal y pense .

		* Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's relish for
Hawthorne	ORGANIZATION	is notewor - thy and commendable ; but he perhaps does him a little injustice in the following passage : ` It is curious to mark
Hawthorne	PERSON	's attempts to break away from himself -- from the man that heredity , and circumstance , and the divine gift of genius had made him .

		He naturally `` haunts the mouldering lodges of the past '' ; but when he came to
England	LOCATION	-LRB- where such lodges are abundant -RRB- , he was ill-pleased and cross-grained .

		He knew that a long past , with mysteries , dark places , malisons , curses , historic wrongs , was the proper atmosphere of his art .

		But a kind of conscientious desire to be something other than himself -- something more ordinary and popular -- made him thank Heaven that his chosen atmosphere was rare in his native land .

		He grumbled at it , when he was in the midst of it ; he grumbled in
England	LOCATION	; and how he grumbled in
Rome	LOCATION	!

		He permitted the
American Eagle	ORGANIZATION	to make her nest in his bosom , `` with the customary infirmity of temper that characterises this unhappy fowl , '' as he says in his essay , `` The Custom House . '' '

		A trenchant criticism on ` The Scarlet Letter ' is worth quoting .

		` The persons in an allegory may be real enooigh , as
Bunyan	PERSON	has proved by examples .

		But that cul - pable clergyman , Mr.
Arthur Dimmesdale	PERSON	, with his large , white brow , his melancholy eyes , his hand on his heart , and his general resemblance to the
High Church Curate	ORGANIZATION	in
Thackeray	PERSON	's `` Our Street , '' is he real ?

		To me he seems very unworthy to be
Hester	PERSON	's lover , for she is a beautiful woman of flesh and blood .

		Mr.
Dimmesdale	PERSON	was not only immoral ; he was unsportsmanlike .

		He had no more pluck than a church-mouse .

		His miserable passion was degraded by its brevity ; how could he see this woman 's disgrace for seven long years , and never pluck up heart either to share her shame or pec - care fortiterf He is a lay figure , very cleverly but somewhat conventionally made and painted .

		The vengeful husband of
Hester	PERSON	,
Roger Chillingworth	PERSON	, is a Mr.
Casaubon	PERSON	stung into jealous anger ... The person of
Roger ChilUngworth	PERSON	and his conduct are a little too melodramatic for
Hawthorne	ORGANIZATION	's genius . '

		A considerable number of excellent plots for novels and tales are unthriftily given to the public in tliis book -- because of the plot-maker 's constitutional inability -LRB- so he thinks -RRB- to write fiction .

		` Unluckily , ' he sadly confesses , ` my brain is not capable of this aesthetic malady , and to slave my life , or to `` milk a fine warm cow rain , '' as the Zulus say , I could not write a novel , or even a short story . '

		And again , ` As Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	says , a man must view '' his very trifling enterprise with a gravity that would be - fit the cares of empire , and think the smallest improvement worth accomplishing at any ex - pense of time and industry .

		The book , the statue , the sonata , must be gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the unflagging spirit of children at their play . ''

		This is true ; that is the worst of it .

		The man , the writer , over whom the irresistible desire to mock at himself , his work , his puppets and their for - tune , has power , will never be a novelist .

		The novelist must '' make believe very much '' ; he must be in earnest ^ ^ dth his characters .

		But how to be in earnest , how to keep the note of dis -
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 411 belief and derision '' out of the memorial '' ?

		Ah , there is the difficult -RRB- ' , but it is a difficulty of which many authors appear to be insensible .

		Perhaps they suffer from no such temptations . '

		One author , however , who could mock at his puppets and yet write successful novels , will pr ^ ^ ly occur to the reader .

		The very charm of ' Vanity Fair ' is partly due to
Thackeray	PERSON	's refusal to take himself too seriously .

		Last and among the best of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's essays is one on * The Boy .

		^ For awful examples of priggish precocity we are referred to the boy - hood of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, and to that of Bishop
Thirlwall	PERSON	, who * at four read Greek with an ease and fluency which astonished all who heard him , ' at seven wrote an essay ' On the
Uncer	PERSON	- tainty of Human Life , ' and at eleven published a volume of * Primitiae ' which went through three editions in two years .

		His infant ser - mons , thirty-nine in number -- ^ the same as the Articles -- occupy most of this small volume .

		Listen to the little preacher of ten as he piously deplores the latter-day desecration of the
Sab	ORGANIZATION	- bath . '

		I confess , ' Ee sdghs , ' when I look upon the present and past state of our public morals , and when I contrast our present luxury , dissi - pation , and depravity , with past frugality and virtue , I feel not merely a sensation of regret , but also of terror for the result of the change . '

		One marvels that such a child survived his in - fancy .

		Other chapters of * Adventures , ' which can here be little more than named , have to do with * Bab 's Friends , ' * Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's Poems ' -- especially the earlier ones , which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	thinks the best , -- ' Mrs.
Eadcliffe	PERSON	's Novels , ' * A Scottish Romanticist of
1830	DATE	' -- ^ to wit ,
Thomas T. Stoddart	PERSON	, angler and poet , -- ` The Confes - sions of Saint
Augustine	PERSON	' -- wherein a curious parallel is drawn between
Augustine	PERSON	and Catul * lus , -- '
Smollett	PERSON	, ' ` The Paradise of Poets , ' `

Greorge Sinclair	PERSON	, profes - sor of philosophy at
Glasgow	LOCATION	in the
latter half of the seventeenth century	DATE	.

		Those who have a taste for books about books will hunt long before they will find one more tickling to the palate than Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's ' Adven - tures among Books . '

		These chapters , it is true , are reprints of magazine articles , but mostly of a date sufficiently remote to make their reap - pearance practically equivalent to a fresh ap - pearance .

		The fine frontispiece portrait in pho - togravure is after a painting by Sir
William Richmond	LOCATION	,

		The Troubled Tax-e of
Erin	PERSON	.

		* The persistence of Irish nationality is one of tiie marvels of history .

		Wave after wave of invasion has roUed over the island from legend - ary times to recent centuries , yet after each in - vasion the country and people were still pre - dominantly Irish .

		Internal warfare decimated its population in the middle ages ; thousands perished later in the vain effort to dislodge the English conqueror ; half a million Irish exiles fell on
Continental	ORGANIZATION	battle-fields in the eight - eenth century ; hundreds of thousands died yearly in the terrible period of famine in the early part of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's reign ; several millions found homes in our own country ; and yet , after all these ages of national discourage - ment ,
Ireland	LOCATION	is still Irish and the Celtic spirit seems as vigorous and defiant as ever .

		It is only natural that in a country like ours , where the Hibernian element is so numerous , there should be a demand for some reliable popular account of the Irish past .

		Two new histories have recently been offered to the pub - lic , both of which aim to supply such a narra - tive .

		Mr.
Charles Johnston	PERSON	and
Miss Carita Spencer	ORGANIZATION	have written `
Ireland	LOCATION	's Story ' in a volume of four hundred pages .

		Mr.
John F. Finerty	PERSON	has given us a ' People 's History of
Ireland	LOCATION	, ' in two volumes of nearly five hun - dred pages each .

		Both histories are properly bound in green .

		At first sight the volume entitled '
Ireland	LOCATION	's Story ' gives the impression of having been written for text-book purposes ; and no doubt it win be extensively used in schools having an Irish Catholic patronage .

		It is well provided with portraits and illustrations , nearly all of which have historic value ; it has maps , mar - ginal notes , summaries , and an excellent index , -- in fact , practically all the pedagogical helps that one expects to find in the more recent text - books .

		But the book will also interest the gen - eral reader .

		Written in a quiet , almost gentle style , the narrative moves calmly forward and is easily followed .

		The authors make no effort to conceal the fact that they have looked at events from a Catholic view-point ; still , the treatment is sufficiently fair and charitable to satisfy any reader in whom the virtue of tol - erance is properly developed .

		It seems , how - ever , that in thtir selection of facts to be pre - sented they have studiously avoided almost ever -RCB- ` thing that would tend to discredit the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .

		New York :
Dodd	PERSON	,
Head ft Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		412 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, goied that this is a matter of slight importance , as the pope had no authority to transfer the
Green Isle to Henry	ORGANIZATION	or to any other king .

		It is well known , however , that the current doc - trine in the twelfth century as regards papal supremacy was totally different .

		No one can make the history of
Ireland	LOCATION	a joyous tale .

		With so much of treachery , mis - ery , and injustice that must be related , the nar - rative is likely to be a gloomy one .

		Yet our authors have succeeded in telling a fairly cheer - ful story after all .

		Their purpose is not to dwell on what
Ireland	LOCATION	has endured , but on what she has accomplished .

		The legendary age and the early mediaeval period -- the period of saints and scholars and missionaries , of
Patrick	PERSON	and
Bridget	PERSON	and warlike Columba -- are treated with a fulness that is almost disproportionate .

		On the other hand , the
eighteenth century	DATE	, a time when the Irish Catholic was deprived of almost every opportunity and right but the bare permission to exist , is treated with all possible brevity .

		The book closes with four interesting chapters in which are reviewed the achieve - ments of the Irish race in
America	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	, and on the Continent , and also what has been accomplished in the Irish home land in the literary field .

		When the reader turns from this finished product of the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	to the more ex - tensive * People 's History of
Ireland	LOCATION	, ' the im - pression received is not the most favorable .

		The print and the paper are not of the best ; the time-honored preface and the index are want - ing ; aside from frontispiece portraits of O'Con - nell and
Parnell	PERSON	, there are no illustrations ; a solitary map of modem
Ireland	LOCATION	is all that is offered on the geographical side , the map being good but inadequate .

		But after reading a few pages one discovers that this is not the dry book it seems to be .

		The author has had a varied literary experi - ence as editor , lecturer , author , and spell - binder , and when writing on the subject of his native country Mr.
Finerty	PERSON	is utterly incapable of being dull .

		It will not do to say that his style is everywhere excellent ; in places the lan - guage gives evidence of loose and hasty writ - ing ; some of the expressions used are sadly worn , while others lack in point of delicacy ; but the sentences have fire and vigor , and the author employs a great variety of expedients to rouse and impress his readers .

		Melodious lines from
Thomas Moore	PERSON	, tender stanzas from
Thomas Davis	PERSON	, frequent anecdotes illustrative of Irish humor and genial wit , occasional cita - tions from what is best in
Irislh	LOCATION	oratory , -- all these and other forms of embellishment are freely used and give a distinctly Celtic coloring to the pages .

		The narrative is punctuated at regular inter - vals with sharp explosions of the author 's anger and indignation .

		In speaking of the corrupt methods used by the English in dealing with the Anglo-Irish toward the close of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's reign , he says : ` The bait took as might have been expected -- for every good cause has its Iseariots -- and we soon hear of jealous kinsmen of the patriot chiefs `` coming over to '' the queen 's interest and doing their uttermost -- the heartless scoundrels -- to divide and distract the strength of their country , engaged in a deadly struggle for her rights and liberty .

		These despicable wretches are foul blotches on the pages of
Ireland	LOCATION	's history . '

		In the same fashion he characterizes Queen
Anne	PERSON	, ' the unnatural creature she was , ' and tells of
George I.	PERSON	whose ` black career termi - nated in
1742	DATE	, ' and how ' a weight of horror was lifted from
Ireland	LOCATION	's heart when the wel - come news of his death spread rapidly , far and wide , over the persecuted country . '

		In sim - ilar language he expresses his admiration for
George III.	PERSON	,
Lord Castlereagh	LOCATION	, the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	, and many others .

		In fact , if an artist were to draw imaginary portraits of Eng - land 's public men from
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		to
Edward VII.	ORGANIZATION	, using Mr.
Finerty	PERSON	's descriptions and characterizations as his only guides , we should have a gallery of monstrous caricatures the sight of which would strike John Bull speech - less .

		But when our author introduces the great worthies of Irish history , the O'Feills , the O'Connells , and the O'Briens , with
Grattan	PERSON	,
Emmet	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	, and the rest , he uses a wholly different vocabulary .

		But here , too , we must be cautious in accepting his estimates , as en - thusiastic praise is not always evidence of calm judgment .

		He quotes the orator
Walter Burgh	PERSON	as declaring that '
England	LOCATION	has sown her laws as dragons ' teeth and they have sprung up armed men . '

		Of this tattered metaphor our author says : * This magnificent allusion to the rise and progress of the Irish volunteer move - ment is one of the finest passages in the oratory of ancient and modern times . '

		It is state - ments such as this that make the reader sus - picious .

		It is generally believed that a writer of his - tory should approach his subject with an open and unprejudiced mind ; that he should take the position of a judge whose duty and desire are to ascertain the truth in the given case .

		Such a historian Mr.
Finerty	PERSON	is never likely to become .

		He , the Irish radical who has urged Irish independence in season and out of sea - son , whose published utterances of thirty years bear the stamp of an uu weakening radicalism , who heads a great organization of Irishmen the spirit of which is anything but conciliatory , --
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41S he of all men would seem by nature unfitted to write a trustworthy history of his native land .

		He is not a judge , he is an advocate , a bril - liant , forceful , relentless advocate ; but what the world wants is not a plea but a calm judicial statement of a complicated case .

		In the preparation of his history Mr.
Fin	PERSON	- erty seems to have used secondary accounts verj * largely ; in the first volume there is , indeed , little evidence that the sources have been used .

		The author does not , however , show an absorb - ing interest in the earlier period ; he is at - tracted by the great political and parliamentary struggle with
England	LOCATION	that began in the eight - eenth century and continued down to the close of
Pamell	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		Of this struggle he gives an extended and readable account , the entire second volume being devoted to the century fol - lowing the commercial emancipation of
Ireland	LOCATION	in
1780	DATE	.

		Of the two volumes this is the more valuable .

		It tells what
Ireland	LOCATION	suffered throughout the nineteenth century , what her people strove for , and what they accomplished ; and as Mr.
Finerty	PERSON	has for years been in close touch with all the various movements in Ire - land , a measure of authority is added to his statements which the * reader is compelled to respect .

		It is to be regretted that this thor - ough presentation has not been continued down to date .

		The last thirty-five years of Irish history -- the period of the
Land League	ORGANIZATION	and the Home Rule movement -- are summed up in a single chapter of seventeen pages .

		Bound up closely with the history of Ire - land is that of
England	LOCATION	; and on the English side of his work Mr.
Finerty	PERSON	has failed to be accurate and just .

		We are told , for instance , that
Thomas Cromwell	PERSON	was a churchman , and that Praise-God Barebone presided over the parliament that bears his name .

		Trifling though such errors are , they show that the au - thor has not read his English history so care - fully as he should have done .

		Attention has already been called to his estimates of Eng - land 's great statesmen ; in much the same way does he treat the nation at large .

		It must be conceded that
England	LOCATION	's record in
Ireland	LOCATION	is not altogether lovely , and it is not surprising that strong terms are used in discussing it .

		And yet
England	LOCATION	is not wholly to blame for what
Ireland	LOCATION	has suffered .

		If there had been any national spirit , any broad patriotism , in the Celtic people in the middle ages , the Conqueror might have been repulsed .

		If the Irishman of modem times had not listened too eagerly to every disturl > er of
Vae	ORGANIZATION	world 's peace , his lot would have been more endurable .

		It is true that Mr.
Finerty	PERSON	does find an occasional oppor - tunity to say a good word for some English - men , but it is too frequently done in a per - functory and spiritless manner .

		It seems pos - sible that justice could be accorded
England	LOCATION	without in any way diminishing the glory of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		If Mr.
Finerty	PERSON	had studied the his - tory of his native land in the light of European events , the policies of
England	LOCATION	would have be - come intelligible to him , and the ' People 's His - tory of
Ireland	LOCATION	' would have been a far more trustworthy work .

IiAtest Biographeb	ORGANIZATION	.

		* If a reader were to make a mental catalogue of the most romantic and startling fiction that has been written in modem times , it is doubtful if he oould name a single tale more dramatic , more improbable if judged by severe standards , than the actual career of
Honore de Balzac	ORGANIZATION	.

		The life of this man was a summary of the many strange personalities and inddents that are found in Ms partially recorded '
Comedie Humaine	ORGANIZATION	. '

		He seemed to justify his own state - ment that genius is never quite sane , for few would question either Balzac 's possession of genius or his lack of poise .

		With an exaggera - tion that has much of truth at its root , he analyzed his own character for the Duchesse d'Abrantes .

		* I possess , shut up in my five foot eight inches , all the incoherences , all the contrasts possible ; ana those who think me vain , extravagant , obstinate , high-minded , without connection in my ideas , -- a fop , negligent , idle , without application , without reflection , without any constancy ; a chatterbox , without tact , badly brought up , impolite , whimsical , unequal in temper , -- are quite as right as those who perhaps say that I am economical , modest , courageous , stingy , energetic , a worker , constant , silent , full of delicacy , polite , always gay .

		-- Does this kaleidoscope exist , because in the soul of those who claim to paint all the affections of the human heart , chance throws all these affections themselves , so that they may be able , by the force - of their imagination , to feel what they paint ? ''

		In Miss
Mary F. Sandare	PERSON	's newly-published life of the prince of realists are recorded many phases , intimate and varied , of this complex character .

		Though the author has had access to some unpublished bits of personalia , especially such as have come into the possession of
M. de Spoelbereh de Lovenjoul	ORGANIZATION	, and though she has used freely and with good taste the later letters to Mme.
Hanska	PERSON	, the volume fails in many re - spects to equal the excellent Memoir by Miss ^ Wormele -RCB- ' .

		The reader , challenged by the words in

		414 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, reviewing this exhaustive Memoir which intro - duced many of us to the true
Balzac	LOCATION	, finds much to admire anew in the earlier biographer 's wise and scholarly treatment , her careful quotations from many original sources , and her skilfully condensed sentences of analysis .

		At the same time , this new contribution to Balzac study is interesting and valuable .

		Its form is attractive , its illustrations are good , and its sympathetic tone is alluring and generally well-balanced .

		There are exliaustive details of the novelist 's un - successful monetary ventures .

		The last portion of the work is excellent in its interest and se - quence .

		The acknowledged gaps and mysterious lapses in the narrative , impossible for any biog - rapher to fill during the periods of Balzac 's obscure retirements , show how much he needed # i
Boswell	PERSON	to record his vagaries .

		To the sister of
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Laure Surville	PERSON	, who deserves a high place in that list of sisters whose influences have been vital on so many authors , we are deeply indebted for reminis - cences and anecdotes of family traits , and for many a secret episode in the boyhood and ma - turity of the novelist .

		Miss Sandars has well emphasized the sane affection and guidance of this sister .

		Throughout the brother 's life her devotion was often his salvation from financial and mental disaster .

		His nervous mother found this son , so truly inheritor of many of her own faults of temper , a constant source of irritation .

		With new realization of their importance , we read here of the influences exerted on
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's life and writings by many women-friends of varying types .

		At the homes of
Mme. de Bemy	ORGANIZATION	, Mme ,
Carraud	LOCATION	, and the famous
Delpihine Girar	PERSON	- din , he gained not alone social pleasure but also literary stimulus and material , especially for his settings of higher social life .

		His flirtation with the coy Mme. de
Castries	LOCATION	developed his emotional faculty into unwonted vigor , and gave theme for fictional plot and character-drawing in ' La Duchesse de Langeais , ' ' Le Medecin de Campagne , ' and other novels .

		The woman , Mme.
Hanska	PERSON	, who was to beiar his name after years of courtship and passionate longing on his part , by her cold heart in her later relations with her lover arouses our indignation ; but she was his good angel when in
1832	DATE	she wrote him urging with feeling that he should recall him - self from the pruriency and extravagance of his latest work and keep steadily in mind the pur - ity as well as the strength of his best writings .

		The years immediately following this new in - fluence are associated in memory with two of
Balzac	LOCATION	's most perfect and popular novels , ' Eu - genie Grandet ' and ' Le Pere Goriot . '

		At first he doubted the truth of the tribute called forth by these two novels , but later accepted the de - cree of his critical friends , -- ■ an estimate which the later decades have verified .

		Just as
Balzac	LOCATION	had gained this lofty rank as author , just as he seemed about to free himself from the hounds of poverty and debt which had haunted his life thus far , he committed two errors of judgment wMch proved disastrous both to fame and fortune .

		We are reminded of
Fenimore Cooper	ORGANIZATION	and his quarrels with the press , as the biographer cites Balzac 's contro - versies with both printers and editors .

		The second folly was the visionary extravagance of ` Les Jardies , ' the residence erected with lofty ideas and unsupported walls .

		At this crisis he turned yet again to the plan cherished for many years , -- to write a great drama which shoidd retrieve his fortunes and establish his fame .

		Of late , critics have found no little merit in some of
Balzac	LOCATION	's dramas , especially `
Vautrin	PERSON	' and '
Pamela Giraud	PERSON	. '

		The amusing tale of his efforts to waken the unfit collaborator ,
Lassailly	LOCATION	, out of a sound sleep to give him tragic situa - tions , uatil the youth was almost driven mad , justifies Miss Sandars 's comment on ` the wide gulf which separates l ^ alzac the writer , with psychological powers which almost amounted to second sight , and
Balzac	LOCATION	in ordinary life , many of whose misfortunes had their origin in an apparent want of knowledge of human nature , which caused him to make deplorable mistakes in choosing his associates . '

		Much space is given to the lesser-known years of
Balzac	LOCATION	's life , the pathetic ending when he waited patiently but desperately for Mme.
Hanska	PERSON	's consent to marriage , his health fast failing and his will concentrated on the later worlvs of marvellous power , ' Les Paysans / ' La Cousine Bette , ' and ' Le Cousin
Pons	PERSON	. '

		It was the natural revenge of abused nature that ended this turbulent life at its prime .

		The records of those thirty years of industry , productive of more than four-score novels with numberless other writings , furnish their own comment .

		Though Miss
Sandars	ORGANIZATION	's book is confessedly a study of personality , with meagre attempt at literary or critical estimate , in the final pages she considers , with discrimination ,
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's rank as realist , compared especially with
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	and Zola .

		There is resemblance to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in his recognized power to create strong types that are also individuals .

		He had ` the gift of see - ing vividly -- as under a dazzling light -- ^ to the very kernel of the object stripped of supernu - merary circumstance , ' yet he was kin of the Eomantieists ` in his feeling for the beauty of atmospheric effects . '

		* Bath by resemblance and by contrast , Profes - sor
Miinsterberg	ORGANIZATION	's essay reminds us of the dia - logue in the church in
Morris	PERSON	's ' Dream of
John Ball	LOCATION	/ It is the record of a supposed con - versation between two friends , who have just returned from burjing the body of a third .

		A conversation , I call it , but one of them does all the talking , while the other offers silent but clearly expressed comment .

		It is written in a charming manner , and is really a description of the author 's philosophy .

		The argument is this : Science is a method of interpreting experiences so that they stand in a definite relation toward one another , the conceptions of time and space , cause and effect , being necessary to bring order out of what would otherwise be chaos , ' The scientist connects the things of this chaotic world in an orderly sys - tem of causes and effects which follow one an - other ; and , as he can do his work only if he i & kes for granted that the end can be reached , he considers the world of objects as a system in which ever3-thing must be understood as the effect of causes . '

		In reality , science can say nothing about ourselves , who make the sciences ; but it is possible , and for some purposes neces - sary , to regard ourselves in a purely objective manner , and then , ' all the ideas and imagina - tions , feelings and emotions , go on in the brain just as it rains and snows in the outer world , and our own will is a necessary product of its forgoing causes .

		Such consistency is admirable in its realm , but it must not make us forget that its realm is determined by our own decision , yes , that it is our own free will which decides for a certain purpose to conceive ourselves as bound , our will as a causal process . '

		Time and space relate not to personality , but merely ex - press attitudes of personality towards its objects .

		The real personality no more occupies time than space ; * my real life as a system of interrelated will-attitudes has nothing before or after , be - cause it is beyond time . '

		Eegarding existence as a mere series of phenomena in time , it could not have any value for anyone .

		Time is a system in wliich the reality of one moment excludes the reality of all others ; only the present exists , the past is irrevocably gone , the future is not yet .

		Personality is not thus self-devouring , and extension in time would have no more value than extension in space : ' a mere expansion , a more and more of phenomena in space and time , is a valueless amassing of indifferent and purposeless material . '

		History may be con - ceived as the description of a great causal mechanism , in which everything follows of • The Eternal Life .

		necessity ; but this is merely science , and the true historian sees rather the play of will upon will , each compelling acknowledgment , demand - ing agreement or disagreement , obedience or combat .

		The resulting phenomena are arranged by science in a time-series , but the wills them - selves are the expression of judgments which are independent of time . '

		If you insist on metaphors , I should liken our will to a circle ; a circle has no beginning and it has no end ; it is endless , infinite . '

		What , then , is the value of such a will-life ?

		Its value consists in itself and the ends it recognizes , which are absolute , not relative .

		Thus , ' truth .

		.

		does not allow any further question as to whether or not it is useful for s -LRB- wnething else , but it is itself the end of all questioning .

		Only that which is such an ultimate end for us is really a value . '

		Onr goal is not endless duration , but ` complete re - pose in the perfect satisfaction which the will finds when it has reached the significance , the in - fluence , and the value at which it is aiming . ' ''

		However , each one of ns is more than merely an individual , and the ultimate realization of our aims can be found only in the totalitj - of wills , or ' the over-individual consciousness , the over - soul . ' '

		If we were to substitute for that empty thought of a continuation of time the deeper thought of an endless personal influence of vrill , endless not in time but endless in personal rela - tions , it would seem as if we had really ex - pressed an ultimate goal . '

		Yet to realize the totality of this proce ^ would be to destroy the very thing which makes our individual person - alihr , and the impossibility of complete achieve - ment gives meaning to our striving . '

		This con - trast between what is aimed at in our attitude and what is reached in our influence is indeed full of pathos , yet inexhaustible in its eternal value . '

		So much by way of description .

		For myself , the Miinsterbergian philosophy seems to con - tain much that is of value , and yet in its totality to be strangely meaningless .

		It is quite possible to regard time and space as merely modes of extension , independent of duration .

		At any moment of time , things are varied only in space ; at any point in space , things are varied only in time .

		Thus the universe may be per - manent in all its features , and our personalities the only things capable of change , and that by the succession of experiences due to motion through phenomena .

		If this motion were on a certain plane always in one direction , or along the arc of a circle , the effect would be that of time , with its succession of events said to be related as cause to effect .

		Are not things in space always similarly related ?

		The physicist recognizes that every atom is influenced by every other , and is in fact held in its place by the 416 THE DIAL # j4 '' el6 .

		totality of forces in the universe ; a relation exactly as binding as between successive events .

		At each moment , things ha \ `` e to be what they are ; and in ultimate analysis we find ourselves simply saying , ' What is , is / According to such a view , our personality might be thought of as independent of time and space in the sense that it moved irrespective of them ; and yet finding its being in the reality of experiences understandable only as based on projected phenomena .

		One could postulate a latent personality , like latent energy , losing all power of motion througih phenomena , and con - sequently of receiving successive experiences ; but such latency would be pure dormancy , and if perm ` anent extinction .

		The complete attain - ment of the desired experiences would naturally result in such a cessation of motion , were it per - manent , since any departure from the point gained would be detrimental .

		Thus the Bud - dhist idea of Nirvana would be the logical out - come of such a theory , as also the idea of the necessity for continued search while attainment remiained incomplete .

		The very conception of God ^ s life in Christ depends upon the thought that experience is only purchased at the expense of imperfection of attainment , though not neces - sarily imperfection of aim .

		Here is the neces - sary pathos which Professor Miinsterberg de - scribes in his closing words .

		The fault I find with Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's philosophy is really this : that it pretends to get rid of time and space in considering personal - ity , and yet does not do so , and can not , in the nature of things .

		Our mental make-up is a totality which can not be divided in the way proposed , and while we must necessarily recog - nize the truth of much that he urges , we seem , in the attempt to grasp his complete meaning , to be lost in a mere maze of words .

		Who can speak of ` the eternal life , ' and get away from the thought of time ?

		Who can think of ` an endless personal influence of will , ' and get away from time and space ?

		There may be truths which we can not grasp , but the psychologist should be the last to suggest the practicability of building a philosophy independent of the one element which gives phenomena their reality for us .

		Echoes from the
Eastern Struggle	ORGANIZATION	.

		*
The Libraiy of Congress	ORGANIZATION	has published , in a sumptuous form altogether unlike the generality of the productions of that institution , a ` Catalog of the
Gardiner Greene Hubbard Collection of Engravings	ORGANIZATION	' compiled by Mr.
Arthur Jeffrey Par	PERSON	- sons .

		This collection , which was presented to the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	by Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	, contains 2,707 prints , representing many schools , the French , German , English , Dutch , and Italian examples mak - ing up about nine-tenths of the whole .

		Besides the catalogue proper , the volume contains a sketch of the donor , a series of ten plates , and elaborate indexes .

		Two grievances gleam wearily through the pages of the volume entitled ' Following the Sun-Flag , ' by Mr.
John Fox	PERSON	, Jr. .

		These are that the author was not permitted to see any - thing of the actual fighting in the earlier land battles of the Russo-Japanese war , leaving Liao - Yang just as the heavy fighting was beginning ; and that the
Mikado	LOCATION	's officers did not tell him the truth , according to any occidental notions of wihat it is that constitute verity .

		Deprived of opportunity for accomplishing the purposes which took him to the
Bast	PERSON	, denied all chance of informing the world of the actual struggle which he went to see , he has been compelled to con - tent himself with describing , in his own vivid and picturesque manner , the details of his five months ' tedious waiting in Tokio and as many weeks with his fellow-correspondents from
America	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, on the trail of the Japanese armies in
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		He has made the work interesting by the sketchy , breezy manner in which it is written , although it is imbued with that fine race prejudice against men of darker skin which is the heritage of the Anglo-Saxon in general and of the Southern - born American in particular .

		Of the spirit of the Japanese people in their heroic struggle , Mr.
Fox	PERSON	has much to say .

		` The women let their hair go undressed once a month , that they may contribute the price of the dressing -- five sen. A gentleman discovered that every servant in his household , from butler down , was contributing a certain amount of his wages each month , and in consequence offered to raise wages just the amount each servant was giving awaj * .

		The answer was , `` Sir , we can not allow that ; it is an honor for us to give , and it would be you who would be doing our duty for us to
Japan	LOCATION	. '' '

		A Japanese lady apologized profusely for being late to dinner .

		She had been to the station to see her son off for the front , where there were already three of her sons .

		Said another straightway , ' ' How fortunate to be able to give four sons to
Japan	LOCATION	! ''

		` Hundreds and thousands of families are deny - ing themselves one meal a day that they may give more to their country .

		And one rich merchant , who has already given
100,000 yen	MONEY	, has himself cut off one meal , and declares that he will if necessary live on one the rest of his life for the sake of
Japan	LOCATION	. '

		Describing a pretty little girl in one of the houses where he lodged , Mr.
Fox	PERSON	says : ` Among the thousands of applications , many of them written in blood , which the war office has received from men who are anxious to go to the front , is one from just such a girl .

		In her letter she said that she was the last of an old Samurai * Following the Sun-Flag .

		Her father was killed in the war with
China	LOCATION	; her only brother died during the Boxer troubles .

		She begged to be allowed to take her place in the ranks which had always belonged to hen family .

		She could shoot , she said , and ride ; and it would be a lasting disgrace if her family name should be missing from the rolls , where it has had an honored place for centuries , now that her country and her Emperor are in such sore need . '

		Mr.
Eichard Barry	PERSON	was more fartunate than Mr.
Fox	PERSON	.

		Representing a number of periodicals in
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, from the pages of • which the materials for his book on Port
Arthur	PERSON	have been taken , Mr.
Barry	PERSON	saw all the later fighting before
Port Arthur	PERSON	, and was a wit - ness to its surrender .

		The heroism of both
Eus	ORGANIZATION	- sians and Japanese is freely attested , although it is in the latter that he finds the larger share , since he was their guest and within their lines .

		This book is that of an eye-witness profoundly and sympathetically impressed , still young enough to have every impression deep and clear , and old enough to set it down justly and vividly .

		He , like Mr.
Fox	PERSON	, has the skill of seizing upon illustrative episodes , of which we take a few examples . '

		The Russians made a sortie into the plain , parad - ing for several hundred yards in front of the Two Dragons .

		That was before the lines were as closely drawn as they are now , and the Japanese looked with amusement on the show-off .

		At the head marched two bands , brassing a brilliant march .

		Then came the colors flashing in the sun .

		The officers were dashingly decorated , and the troops wore colored caps .

		It was a rare treat for the Japanese , for they had never seen anything like that in their own army .

		Like a boy bewildered at the gay plumage of a bird he might not otherwise catch , the simple and curious Japanese let the foe vaingloriously march back into the town . '

		Of the commander of the
Mikado	LOCATION	's forces dur - ing the siege , much is said by Mr.
Barry	PERSON	.

		` We expected to meet a man of iron , -- for
Nogi	PERSON	is the general whose eldest son , a lieutenant in the
Second Army	ORGANIZATION	, was killed at
Nanshan	LOCATION	; who has under his command a second son , a lieutenant ; and who wrote home after the first disaster , `` Hold the funeral rites until
Hoten	PERSON	and I return , when yon can bury three at once . ''

		` The General received us in his garden .

		He was at a small table , under a willow , working with a magnifying glass over a map .

		He wore an undress blue uniform with the three stars and three stripes of a full general on the sleeve , -- no other decora - tion , though once before I had seen him wearing the first-class order of the Eising Sun .

		His parch - ment-krinkled face , brown like chocolate with a
summer	DATE	's torrid suns , beamed kindly on us .

		His smile and manner were fatherly .

		It was impossible to think that any complicated problem troubled his mind .

		A resemblance in facial contour to
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	arrested us , ... with beard gray , shaded back to brown where it met the skin , so that he seemed a monotone in sepia , with eyes small and wide apart , perfect teeth , tiny , regular nose , and a beautiful dome of a head flaring out from the temples in tender and eloquent curves .

		He stands five feet ten , unusually tall for a
Japan	LOCATION	- ese , showing the loose power of a master in his joints and in that mighty jowl shaded by the gray - brown beard . '

		The following passage te \ -RSB- s of a successful attack upon one of tiie forts , and is a sample of pages of similar writing .

		` At half - past four in the afternoon , Tereda orders the final charge .

		Three cheers go up -- Banzail Banzai !

		Banzai !

		With bayonets fixed , the squads deploying as before , the khaki-covered spots begin to move .

		In advance the men crawl hand over hand , helped by blessed waraji -LRB- straw sandals -RRB- .

		Twenty feet from the parapet they pause and fling something that leaps through the air like balls from catcher to second base .

		These hand-grenades of gun - cotton explode on and in the parapet .

		The brilliant bursts play off the fast setting evening , as the khaki-covered ones go in , Tereda pausing and peer - ing with his glass .

		The entire battalion tumbles over the parapet .

		Then the reserves begin climbing from the base .

		` Silence .

		All is over .

		What has happened ?

		Five , ten minutes pass , then the firing recommences , but now the object is changed ; all the Japanese shrapnel is playing over the road leading to the Chair fort , and all the Russian fire is directed against Xamicoyama .

		The Russians are retreating , throwing away their rifles as they run .

		the centre . '

		Mr.
Barry	PERSON	went forward to the limit of the trenches , within a few score yards of the enemy 's outworks , where he saw greweome sights .

		It is small wonder , with the breastworks constructed in no small part of their own slain , the interval between tiironged with corpses , that Mr.
Fred	PERSON	-
eric Yilliers	PERSON	, present in seventeen campaigns , should have expressed himself thus , as reported by Mr.
Barr \	PERSON	- : ` Scientific warfare !

		Let me tell you the facts about science .


Archibald Forbes	PERSON	predicted twenty years ago that the time would come when armies would no longer be able to take their wounded from the field of battle .

		That day has come .

		We are living in it .

		Wounded have existed -- how , God alone knows !

		-- on that field out there , without help , for twelve days , while shell and bullets rained above them , and if a comrade had dared to come to their assistance his would have been a useless suicide .

		The searchlight , the enginery of scientific trenches , machine guns , rifles point-blank at 200 yards with a range of 2,000 -- these things have helped to make warfare more terrible now than ever before in history . '

		The book entitled ` The Yellow War , ' for which the initial ' ' is responsible as author , is of another sort , though dealing witli similar material .

		It is , as the brief ' Foreword ' avers , the work of one intimate with the war for a year , and an eye-witness of most that is described .

		It is concerned with fighting on sea as well as on land , and is more discriminating in its choice of incidents and of language than either of the foregoing books .

		There is much idealization rather than a precise report , and the result is an impression even more veritable than the others have been able to convey , not - withstanding a certain sense of the fiction that 418 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, is truer thani mere fact .

		An example of the quality of this book may be found in the fol - lowing graphic parage , which purports to give the details of the fighting on the Eussian flag - ship of the
Pacific	LOCATION	squadron in its last naval engagement , but which can be held as equally descriptive of the more recent fighting in the Corean Straits .

		` The great ship quivered -- then quivered again .

		For a moment the flag-lieutenant thought that a torpedo had struck her .

		His nervous system remem - bered that first torpedo under Golden Hill .

		It was only the twelve-inch guns .

		But they made the con - ning-tower rock .

		The Japanese had manoeuvred , and were now standing in on the starboard beam .

		The Russian Admiral changed his course .

		Great projectiles were ricochetting overhead , and raising geysers of salt spray all round them .

		But for the present the flagship could answer shot for shot , and one of the hostile battleships -- the Shikishima it looked like -- had drawn out of the fighting line .

		` The Admiral clenched the handrail .

		His face was still pale , but the fighting light was in his eyes .

		For a moment his gaze turned from the
Mikasa	LOCATION	, with her black hull flashing yellow up and down its lean length .

		The mist was up again in the south - west , and the sea was rapidly getting up . ' ' '

		Make the fleet signal , ' Close up -- follow me . ' ' '

		Then he turned to the officer at the navigating tube : `` For the promontory ! ''

		` At the same moment there was a deafening report , and the vessel swung so that every one in the conning-tower was thrown against the walls . ' ' '

		What was that -- mined ? ' '

		` The dread of mine and torpedo was by this time firmly ingrained in every Russian sailor , and as the flag-lieutenant sprang down the ladder the hor - rible nightmare of the
Petropavlovsk	LOCATION	leaped up before his mental vision .

		It was nothing .

		A deck officer , who seemed as unconcerned as if he were at manoeuvres , came hurrying forward .

		He reported that a large shell had hit the after 12-inch turret , glanced , and in bursting wrecked the top above .

		` The vessel staggered from two terrific blows forward .

		The flag-lieutenant stumbled ahead , draw - ing his hands mechanically to his ears , while the torn fragments of iron and splinter soughed past him .

		Biting , stinging smoke blinded him , while the force of the concussion flattened him against a ventilator .

		The first sight he saw was the man - gled frame of his comrade .

		The top of the poor wretch 's head was gone ; a half - burned cigarette was still between the clenched teeth .

		He threw his glance upwards , -- the forward smoke-stack was rent from top to bottom , and the flame and smoke were licking round its base .

		The 12-inch guns in the forward battery solemnly fired , and the ear - splitting discharge brought the youth to his senses .

		He made for the ladder .

		Great God !

		the conning - tower and forward bridge were but torn , smoking , and twisted wreck .

		A man jumped to the deck .

		His face was as black as an Ethiopian 's , his uni - form and beard torn and discolored to a filthy yellow ; his left arm severed at the biceps , was dang - ling by a sinew . '

		`` All are killed , the Admiral , -- all ! ''

		the figure gasped , as it reeled and sank fainting to the deck .

		` Then the port gung fired .

		The flag-lieutenant realized that the ship was not steering -- she was veering round .

		He dashed to the after-bridge , past the quick-firer crews lying prostrate , amid the wreckage and the corpses .

		He found the commander superintending the shipping of the after steering - gear , and reported the paralyzing intelligence .

		For a moment the commander looked at him blankly .

		He was bleeding from a skin wound in the neck , and such of his uniform not stained yellow was scarlet with blood . '

		`` Good ! ''

		he ejaculated ; `` she is steering again .

		Full steam ahead !

		Make a fleet signal .

		Make the signal , ` The Admiral transfers the command . '' '

		The sympathies of the writers of these three books , setting forth the rigors of war with a Verestchagin-like fidelity , adequately represent the feelings of the English-speaking world , English and Americans being quoted with , impartiality .

		All rejoice at
Russia	LOCATION	's downfall , as a menace to the more peaceful nations of the earth well removed .

		But what of the religions of Christ and Buddiha , apostles both of peace and life ?

		Little of their spirit and influence is to be found in the hideous scenes and incidents set forth in works like these .


Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		The story Professor
Edwin E. Sparks	PERSON	's latest of American work , ` The
United States	LOCATION	of Amer - nationaiity .

		jgj ^ ^ > constitutes a valuable addition to the ` Story of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		It is a pleasant variation from our usual expe - rience to find a work which out of some eight hundred pages devotes but twenty-two pages to the events of the years 1861-1865 , and in these refers to but one battle .

		The space thus gained by eliminating ` drum and trumpet history , ' Pro- fessor Sparks employs to good advantage in explaining the political and social growth of the
United States	LOCATION	, and the economic changes and currents of public opinion which characterized the first century of our national existence .

		The tone of the work is fair , and the author avoids unkind epithets and biassed partisan feeling .

		Yet one can hardly call the work a history in the truest sense ; it is rather a prose epic of American nationality .

		It is frankly centralistic and expansionist .

		` To apply to
America	LOCATION	, ' says the author in conclusion , ` the term `` the States , '' as in the custom in foreign lands , is to ignore both past history and present tendency .

		It is to think of units instead of a whole .

		Historically and prophetically , the
United States	LOCATION	as a fed - eration of States have ceased to exist and the
United States	LOCATION	as a centralized Republic has taken the place . '

		To this thesis the whole work leads up .

		A spade is called a spade , and _ no vain idealism is permitted to distort our vision .

		Thus , speaking of American ideals , Professor Sparks gives us neither the old-fashioned eagle screaming nor the modem cry of helpless negation and obstruction .

		Instead , his comment is this : '
America	LOCATION	Is not what many hoped it would be .

		What - ever social equality was construed Into the Declaration of Independence by enthusiasts and reformers has been abandoned .

		They form , we are told in a prefatory note , the final instalment of the series ; but is it not just possible , and indeed rather to be hoped , that the diarist , like many another celebrity before him , will change his mind and make one or more further farewell appearances ?

		The English ` Who 's Who ' records as our author 's recreations , fencing , botanizing , travelling , and conversation ; and one who con - verses so well and has a knack of hearing so many good things said , ought to let his light shine .

		His manner , it is to be inferred , is not exactly that of a
Johnson	PERSON	, who delights to lay mind to mind in an Atellectual wrestling match , or still better to fold his legs and have his talk out in monologue ; it is rather the light fencing and graceful repartee of a
Chesterfield	LOCATION	.

		He refers with evident satisfaction to ' a perfect debauch of interesting talk ' in which he took part on one occasion .

		It is curious to note his repeated references to Mrs.
Craven	PERSON	and her ` Recit d'uneSoeur . '

		Here , as in former volumes , she is evidently on his mind .

		A good story about
Samuel Warren	PERSON	is short enough to quote .

		Waiting for a train with

		` Well ,
Warren	ORGANIZATION	, ' was the reply , ` there are not many to whom I would entrust the secret ; but it is safe to do so to you .

		The truth is , I wrote it myself ! '

		Another story , less credible , is also good and short .

		A plea for the Dr.
Henry G. Hanehett	PERSON	's book on appreciation ` The Art of the Musician ' -LRB- Mac -
0	DATE	/ music .

		millan -RRB- is addressed to all students of music , whether performers or not , and is ` designed to emphasize the distinction between the real study of music and the study of the arts of playing and singing which has so long been mistaken for it . '

		The author 's chief plea is for the understanding of music as an art -- the understanding of the rhythms , harmonies , melodies , and motives which composers have used , and their aims , purposes , and methods in using them .

		With this object in view .

		Dr.
Han	PERSON	- chett has made a unique and useful book , and one which goes far to demonstrate his theory that music can be thoroughly and usefully taught without teaching the art of performance .

		He insists that ` the true assthetic delight to be derived from the art of the musician is some - thing widely different from and far above the mere sensuous charms of musical sounds , how - ever luscious , ' and agrees with St.
Paul	PERSON	that he ` would rather speak five words with his under - standing than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue . '

		Thorough and scholarly understanding he himself has , combined with a rare clearness of statement and keenness of analysis .

		He calls rhythm the life of music , harmony its soul , melody and phrasing its beauty , and motives its germ .

		Not everyone may incline to the changes he suggests in musical phraseology -- ` meter ' for ` time , ' ` clause ' for ` phrase ' -LRB- except when all the notes under one slur are meant -RRB- , ` mozarta * for ` sonata-form . '

		But everyone can learn much from the examples of music he gives with mark - ings which point unmistakably to the art used in their composition , -- studies of rhythm from
Bach	LOCATION	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, and
Schumann	PERSON	, of melodies from
Rheinberger	PERSON	and
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	, of theme-develop - ment from
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and so on through a wide - ly varied list .

		Technically , this latter is the most valuable part of the volume .

		In the clos - ing chapters on Interpretation and
Musical Education	ORGANIZATION	Dr.
Hanchett	PERSON	maintains , with pointed good sense , his thesis that ` What we need is education in music ; not more professors , but 420 THE DIAL -LSB- JuDe 16 , more amateurs ; not more concerts , but more intelligent interest in those we have ; not more compositions , but more comprehension ; not more vocal culture , but more and larger choral societies ; not more technic , but more interpreta - tion . '

		In spite of his faith that one may be a cultivated musician without being a performer , Dr.
Hanchett	PERSON	gives the final praise to the inter - preter -- the artist who absorbs the composer 's thought , and gives to compositions their crowning touch by interpreting their beauties to the world .

		Brisk and breezy , we will not say b ' ^ a ^ welter ^ r ^ ^ ® ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ frisky , but certainly instinct with the indescribable and unmistakable buoyancy and vitality of the great West , combined with something of the rich scholarship more often associated with the older East ,
Miss Kate Stephens	PERSON	's ` American Thumb - Prints ' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- deserves more than cursory notice at the reviewer 's hands .

		The first chapter , ` Puritans of the West , ' presents some striking peculiarities of the writer 's fellow-Kansans .

		The matter with
Kansas	LOCATION	appears to be too many ` isms .

		Chapter two , `
The University of Hes	ORGANIZATION	- perus ' -- which is , being interpreted , the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Kansas	LOCATION	-- discusses with the wisdom of bitter experience some of the evils afflicting a state university .

		The woman professor dismissed from the Greek chair much on the rotation-in - oflfice principle , one surmises to have been Miss
Stephens	PERSON	herself .

		At any rate , her abundant allusions to and quotations from Hellenic litera - ture go to show her ability to fill such a chair .

		The
St. Louis	LOCATION	and the
New England	LOCATION	types of men and women are treated at some length .

		The parting hit at ` the distorted morality and debilitating religion ' to which the writer says Yankee women -LRB- and men , too , we infer -RRB- have been subjected , is , to say the least , a rather harsh way of expressing oneself .

		Like Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	,
Miss Stephens	PERSON	makes Christian Science a direct descendant of
New England	LOCATION	transcendentalism .

		` The idealism of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	foreran the dollar-gathering idealism of Mrs.
Mary Baker Eddy	PERSON	as the lark of
spring	DATE	foreruns the maple worm . '

		Lack of space forbids argu - ment or protest here .

		A retrospective and pros - pective treatise on cookery , displaying scholarly research , forms the seventh essay ; and a decid - edly informing and original presentation of Franklin as a plagiarist closes the book .

		A word in conclusion on Miss
Stephens	PERSON	's style .

		Pos - sessing as she does a command of excellent Eng - lish , she does not need to write in polyglot .

		A lavish sprinkling of foreign words and phrases , undistinguished by italics or quotation marks , may delight the philologist , but it annoys the unlearned reader .

		The translation , too , is often quite as effective , even to a scholar , as the orig - inal .

		` Unextinguishable laughter ' will be rec - ognized by the Homeric student as readily as its Greek equivalent , and will bewilder no one .

		Too frequent quotation , in any language , is the trick of one whose learning sits not quite easily on the shoulders .

		A few unnecessary departures from common usage arrest the eye in Miss
Stephens	PERSON	's pages , as fool for foolish , pertain for obtain or prevail , and longanimity for the shorter and equally expressive patience .

		Her ` summa sum - marium ' it is safe to take for a mere misprint .

Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	, which will be opened with much eagerness , and laid aside with some disappoint - ment , by the admirers -- still sufficiently numer - ous -- of the robust , manly , witty parson who brightened the literature of the early nineteenth century .

		It is not that the book is ill done -- quite the contrary ; but that Mr.

1845	DATE	; and to this was soon added a volume of extracts from his letters , com - piled by Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	.

		In
1856	DATE	, Mr.
Evert A. Duyckinck	PERSON	published -LRB- through the forgotten house of
J. S. Redfield	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- , a work enti - tled `
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	's Wit and Wisdom , ' quar - ried largely from the collected ` Works , ' the Lady Holland ` Memoirs , ' and the
Austin	LOCATION	` Let - ters . '

		Mr.
Duyckinck	PERSON	's book remains the best compilation extant on
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	; and Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's smaller work , good though it is , has only sent us back -LRB- on the Emersonian principle -RRB- with renewed zest to the larger collection .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's chief merit , then , consists , not in new material discovered , or in any specially clever exploitation of the existing material , but in the shrewd and kindly criticism which he bestows upon
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	's energy , goodness , wit , and occasional foibles .

		His battles for Catholic eman - cipation , his keen satires on the weaknesses of Anglicanism , his complete failure to do justice to Dissent , his imperfect sympathies -LRB- as Lamb would have called them -RRB- with art and music ; and over , in , and through all , the bubbling perennial fountain of a wit that was as sponta - neous as
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	's music -- all these are ` tasted ' for us by Mr.
Russell	PERSON	with much intelligent relish .

		His book will properly hold its place in the series , and serve as an adequate intro - duction to the study of
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	's Students of Classical history and lectures on civilization will be interested in a Hellenism .

		i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ volume on ` The Progi-ess of Hellenism ' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by Professor
J. P. Mahaffy	PERSON	of
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		The learned author has written much on Greek subjects , and in this book he sums up the conclusions that he has reached after years of study of Greek civi - lization as developed at
Athens	LOCATION	and Antioch and
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		Six lectures delivered at the Uni - versity of
Chicago	LOCATION	in the
summer of 1904	DATE	make up the work .

		In the opening lecture Professor
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 431
Mahaffy	PERSON	discusses ` Xenophon the Precursor of Hellenism , ' whom he views as a somewhat cos - mopolitan Greek , one of larger tastes and broader views than those possessed by the aver - age cultured Athenian .

		Through his extensive travels he had come in contact with Oriental civ - ilization , of which he had absorbed a great deal , at the same time losing certain characteristics and surrendering certain opinions that would be classed as distinctly Greek or Athenian .

		The development of Athenian culture after it had been transplanted to
Macedon	LOCATION	,
Syria	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	is the subject of the following three lectures .

		The author does not find that Hellenism was the formal and sterile thing that it is reputed to be : it produced a literature that inspired Tirgil and ser \ - ed as a model for the writers of the Christian gospels ; it gave us the Victory of Samothrace and the Venus of Melos ; it left us the Corinthian style of architecture .

		Of par - ticular interest is the closing lecture in .

		which the author discusses
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	influences on Christianity .

		A deeper meaning is given to the trite statement that Greek was the language of the apostolic missionaries .

		The author holds ` that the peculiar modemness , the high intellec - tual standard of Christianity , as we find it in the New Testament , is caused by its contact with Greek culture , ' Tbe doctrine of the logos as presented in the gosp > el of
St. John	LOCATION	is , he believes , * a purely Hellenistic conception derived ultimately from Plato . '

		In St.
Paul	PERSON	's epistles F ^ rofessor
Mahaffy	PERSON	finds much of the phrase - ology of Stoicism , and also some peculiarly Stoic doctrines , notably the doctrines of the unity of the human race , the value of the human soul , the active nature of human virtue , and the necessity of complete reform of each individual life , or what may be called conversion .

		In a lecture the author can not , of course , present much evidence ; but the subject is of too great interest to be disi > osed of in a few pages , and we trust Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	will discuss it more fully in his promised work on ` Greek Life from
Polvbius	LOCATION	to
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	. '

		He kept the faith .

		The ardent poet - soul .

		Once thrilled to madness by the fiery gleam Of Freedom glimpsed afar in youthful dream .

		Henceforth was true as needle to the pole .

		The vision he had caught remained the goal Of manhood 's aspiration and the theme Of those high luminous musings that redeem Our souls from bondage to the general dole Of trivial existence .

		Calm and free .

		He faced the Sphinx , nor ever knew dismay .

		Nor bowed he to extremities the knee Nor took a guerdon from the fleeting day .

		But dwelt on earth in that eternity Where Truth and Beauty shine with blended ray . '

		The publication contains , besides this interest - ing autograph material , complete programmes of the
Chicago	LOCATION	exercises , the prize poems -LRB- in Eng - lish and German -RRB- written for the occasion , and a series of illustrations -- portraits , pictorial scenes , and reproduced title-pages .

		Taken alto - gether , it is a creditable production .

		A group of We have received from the Gut `` n - recent German berg-Verlag of Dr.
Emst Schultze	PERSON	, publications .

		^ f
Hamburg	LOCATION	, a group of interest - ing publications , of which a few notes may be made .

		`
Das Maifest der Benediktiner	ORGANIZATION	und An - dere Erzahlungen , ' by the late
Karl Rick	PERSON	, is the third edition of the three stories comprised with - in the volume .

		The stories are pictures from the life of the Catholic clergy , and are remarkable for their psychological insight as well as for their intimate acquaintance with the themes pre - sented .

		Rick -LRB- 1815-1881 -RRB- was an Austrian poet and novelis # of distinction , and the present volume has an introduction by his son ,
Herr Wofgang Rick	PERSON	.

		`
Wunder	PERSON	und Wissenschaf t , ' by Dr.
Richard Hennig	PERSON	, is a book of popular science , dealing with the ` occult phenomena ' of hypnotic suggestion , the sub-liminal consciousness , and telepathy .

		The treatment is not imscientifie , although it seems to us to go too far in the direction of credulity , or of willingness to accept as thinkable certain alleged happenings which to most well-balanced minds are flatly impossible .

		It must be admitted that Dr.
Hennig	PERSON	is not with - out good company in his conclusions .

		Dr.
J. Loewenberg	PERSON	's `
Deutsche Dichterabende	ORGANIZATION	' is a volume of studies in modem German literature .

		Among the subjects of the essays are Lenau ,
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	,
Herr Detlev von Liliencron	PERSON	,
Herr Gustav Frenssen	PERSON	, and
Herr Hauptmaim	PERSON	.

		A thin volume reprints the ` Rede auf
Schiller	PERSON	' of
Jakob Grimm	PERSON	, an address given in
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1859	DATE	, and very timely in this year of
Schiller	PERSON	celebrations .

		An ` Auswahl aus den
Kleinen Schriften	PERSON	von
Jakob Grimm	PERSON	, * with an introduction by Dr.
Schultze	PERSON	, gives us
Grimm	PERSON	's ' Selbstbiographie , ' his
Schiller	PERSON	address , his address upon the death of his brother , and his paper upon his dismissal from
Gottingen	LOCATION	in
1837	DATE	.

		This latter is a document of great importa.nce in the history of the German stnigele for intellec - tual freedom .

		Several brief philological papers are also included .

		Finally , this group of publi - cations reprints in a handsome volimie the trans - 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
June	DATE	16j lations made by the
Grimm	PERSON	brothers of Ekke - hard 's ` Walthari-lied , ' of ` Der Arme Heinrieh , ' and of the songs from the Elder Edda .

		Shortcuts From ancestors whose work in the to health field and shop would have made and strength .

		anything in the nature of addi - tional ` exercise ' appear preposterous , the mod - ern American has come to be a person who sits at a desk throughout the hours of sun and seeks to make up the resulting inevitable physical deficiencies by spasmodic movements of one sort and another in the privacy of his apartment .

		As a result he is accumulating at a rapid rate a library on the art of keeping well by devoting a few minutes to real muscular labor while spend - ing many hours in doing his best to fall ill .

		Two contributions of this sort appear nearly simultaneously : Mr.
George Elliot Flint	PERSON	's
` Power and Health	ORGANIZATION	through Progressive Exercise ' -LRB-
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- ker
& Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and Mr.
H. Irving Hancock	PERSON	's ` The Physical Culture Life : A Guide for All Who Seek the
Simple Laws of Abounding Health	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Mr.
Flint	PERSON	's book is devoted to proof that the way to get strong is to take those exercises , chiefly by the use of parallel bars and heavy weights , that make the utmost demand upon the muscles , -- a proposition that would be self-evident to the least intelligent if there had not arisen a curious school which caters to the physically slothful by making them believe that great strength can be produced through trifling exertion .

		It is pleasant to find Mr.
Flint	PERSON	not so wholly committed to his ideas that he is unwilling to concede to swimming the palm for being the best and most wholesome of all forms of physical effort .

		Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	is in sub - stantial agreement with Mr.
Flint	PERSON	on the main question raised , and takes it rather for granted .

		He improves , we believe , on Mr.
Flint	PERSON	's pre - scriptions by introducing a number of exercises in which the element of play and of rivalry enters , passe-tem/ps h deux so to speak .

		A brief introduction to Mr.
Flint	PERSON	's book , written by his father .

		Dr.
Austin Flint	PERSON	, confirms the son 's opinions , and the work is illustrated by photo - graphs of the author in action .

		Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	uses pictures of others , and he has much to say about hygiene in all its aspects .

		Both books shoTild act as stimulants to the slothful and those whose waist line is growing unduly .

		.

		With keen insight and a peculiar essays * ^ art .

		warmth of description , Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- yon Cox has given us , in ` Old Masters and New ' -LRB- Fox ,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a series of appreciations of individual masters of art -- a sort of vade mecum presenting , in a gen - eral way , the course of painting since the six - teenth century .

		The author states that his book has the unity of a point of view -- that of a painter , seeing with his own eyes and not bound by authority ; it expresses the feeling and the judgments of one who practices , with credit , one of the arts of which he writes .

		Much of the material used has appeared at different times during the past twenty years in various peri - odicals , but it has been subjected to thorough revision , so that the more youthful essays con - tain no expressions which the author does not still hold .

		He points out that art in the past has been traditional , national , and homogeneous ; art in our day has been individual , international , and chaotic .

		Modern means of commimieation and modem methods of reproduction have brought the ends of the earth together , and placed the art of all times and countries at the disposal of every artist .

		While in no sense a systematic history of art , Mr.
Cox	PERSON	has so har - monized his colors , and weaved them into a s3tii - metrical whole , that his work will appeal not only to the artist and scholar , but to the ordi - nary lay reader of intelligence .

		Chapters for Polite learning of a delightful sort the meditative pervades the pages of the anony - fisherman .

		j ^ ^ ^ ^ g volume entitled ` Super Flumina : Angling Observations of a Coarse Fisherman ' -LRB- John Lane -RRB- -- the word ` coarse ' m the sub-title referring to the quality of the fish caught and not at all to the angler himself .

		The book might be summarized briefly as a modem and more erudite revival of
Izaak Walton	PERSON	, so gentle and humane is its attitude towards the finny tribe , so liberal and comprehensive its learning .

		In this latter respect , and in its knowledge of human nature , ancient and modem , it is reminiscent also of Montaigne .

		These things must indicate that it is a very good book indeed .

		There is a chapter of more than ordinary humor ` In Dispraise of the Latins , ' inspired by the dis - respectful attitude of the Romans toward fish iu any other aspect than as a means of humaa sustenance .

		The Greeks gain the author 's appro - bation , because they were so much more of the gentleman and so much less of the pot fisherman .

		Several chapters are devoted to specific ` coarse ' fish , such as the pike , dace , perch , and chub , and these are shown to have virtues and characteristics quite at odds with the adjective used to describe the quality of their flesh .

		But there is a deal of practical learning also , and a plea for rational economy in the use of rods , reels , and flies .

		No better gift for an ingrained fisherman who preserves the meditative tradition could be found in re - cent literature .

		New volumes in - ^ volume of ' Selections from the the ` Musician 's Music Dramas of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, ' Library . '

		arranged for the piano by Mr.
Otto Singer	PERSON	, is a recent addition to the ` Musician 's
Library ' of Messrs. Oliver Ditson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The transcriptions are not too difiicult for the ordi - nary amateur , and illustrate the eleven dramas from `
Rienzi	PERSON	' to ` Parsifal . '

		There are twenty - four numbers in all .

		A portrait of
Wagner	PERSON	, a facsimile of ' Tristan ' manuscript , a bibliography , and an introductory essay by Mr.
Richard Aldrich	PERSON	, are the accessory features of this singularly wel - come volume .

		Another addition to this series is a book of ` Twenty-four Negro Melodies ' , tran - scribed for the piano by Mr.
S. Coleridge-Taylor	PERSON	.

		This is an extremely interesting work .

		42S poser has sought to do for the melodies of his race what has been done for Hungarian and Bohemian and Norwegian melodies by
Brahms	PERSON	,
Dvorak	LOCATION	, and
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each number is prefaced by the original melody in motto form , and con - sists of a series of variations upon the theme thus presented .

		The special interest of this work is that it gives us ^ not only American plantation songs -LRB- which are to some degree sophisticated -RRB- but also primitive examples from several regions in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	provides the volume with an introduction .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		* The Athlete 's
Garland	PERSON	' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , compiled by Mr.
Wallace Eiee	PERSON	, is ` the first attempt in any language to gather together verses relating exclu - sively to athletic sports . '

		The volume is happily prefaced by a couplet from
William Morris	PERSON	: ` For no fame may a man win better the while he hath his life Than from what his feet have accomplished , or his hands amid the strife . '

		The selections are from a wide range of authors , English and American , and number about one hun - dred and fifty .

		Something like thirty sports and games are celebrated , the favorites being boating , cricket , football , and golf .

		Each of these subjects has a score or so of poems .

		Strange to say , an exhaustive search through Canadian literature yielded no pieces in celebration of la crosse and tobogganing , although the Canadian poets are other - wise well represented .

		Good taste and judgment characterize this selection throughout , and it is sure of a welcome from all lovers of sport .

		The new ` Biographical ' edition of
Eobert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, now in course of publication by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, finds its chief excuse for being in the series of introductions written by Mrs.
Stev	PERSON	- enson , on much the same plan as in Mrs.
Eichmond Eitchie	PERSON	's edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		These prefaces , though brief , are of much interest , and the edition is in all other ways an attractive one .

		The volumes are convenient in size , clearly and openly printed on thin paper , and bound in prettily-stamped maroon cloth .

		For the many who can not hope to possess the expensive '
Edinburgh	LOCATION	' or ' Thistle ' sets , this edition will prove a decided boon , and we fancy that even the owners of those works will be glad to have this also .

		Six volumes have so far appeared .

		` Shakespeare : The Man and his Works ' is a little book published by
Messrs. Sibley & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has for its contents a reprint of all the matter about Shakespeare contained in `
Moulton	PERSON	's Library of Literary Criticism , ' and thus serves the double pur - pose of calling attention to the merits of that admirable work and of providing students of Shakes - peare with a compendium of the opinion of critics new and old concerning the greatest of poets and his separate plays .

		` The Student 's
American History	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
D. H. Montgomery	PERSON	, is a text-book upon Lines similar to those followed in the author 's ` Leading Facts , ' but is much fuller than that elementary work in its treatment of political and constitutional topics .

		It has all the teaching apparatus of the best type of modern high-school book , and may be cordially recommended .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publish - ers .

		Notes .

		` The Corrected English New Testament , ' edited by Mr.

		by Mr.
W. S. W. Anson	PERSON	, are two reference books , of vest-pocket dimensions , pub - lished by
Messrs. B. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		High-school and college students will give this book a warm welcome .

		To the `

Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, there has been added ` The Autobiography of

		This is one of the charming Dent reprints , and is noteworthy as being the first edition of the fuU and authentic text to be printed in
England	LOCATION	.

		An English nature calendar entitled ` The Country Day by Day , ' by Mr.
E. Kay Robinson	PERSON	, will be pub - lished this month by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author has aimed to fit each day with its proper seasonal accompaniment in the form of a note about the life of birds , animals , insects , or some distinct - ive aspect of nature .

		A volume of ` Specimen Letters , ' selected and edited by Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	and Mr.
Allen R. Benham	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The collection is an admirable one , repre - sentative of every form of the epistolary art , and made particularly attractive to the general reader bv its freedom from editorial encumbrances .

June 16	DATE	, Among the books of the now half - forgotten seven - teenth century lawyer , courtier , and author ,
Francis Quarles	PERSON	, perhaps the most interesting for the pres - ent-day reader is his ` Sions Sonets , ' a poetical par - aphrase of the Song of Songs .

		In this work
Quarles	PERSON	succeeded in retaining no little of the im - passioned beauty of the Hebrew book , and achieved besides a few flashes of original poetic fire .

		As was common in his day ,
Quarles	PERSON	regarded the Song as a religious allegory , representing the union of Christ and the Church ; but beyond a few the - ological references in the form of footnotes , this interpretation is not forced upon the reader .

		In reprinting ` Sions Sonets ' as one of their Eiverside Press Editions ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		have performed a grateful task .

		The little book is a charming one in every detail of make-up .

		It is printed on handmade paper of antique tone , from a large size of old-style type set within rules , the whole effect being a most successful imitation of seventeenth-century typography .

		The binding is of boards , appropriately crimson in hue .
