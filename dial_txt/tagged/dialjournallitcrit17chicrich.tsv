		21 ENGLISH IN THE LOWER SCHOOLS .

		The recent agitation in behalf of better in - struction in elementary English , now so prom - inent a feature of educational discussion , may almost be said to date from the publication , a year or two ago , of the famous Harvard Re - port on Composition and Rhetoric .

		That Re - port , at least , gave to the reform movement its strongest impulse , and made a burning '' ques - tion of the day '' out of a matter previously little more than academic in its interest .

		The sub - ject reached a larger public than it had ever addressed before , and this new and wider pub - lic was fairly startled out of its self-complacency by the exhibit made of the sort of English writ - ten by young men and women supposed to have enjoyed the best preparatory educational advantages , and to be fitted for entrance into the oldest and most dignified of our colleges .

		The Report was more than a discussion of the evils of bad training ; it was an object-lesson of the most effective sort , for it printed many specimen papers literatim et verbatim , and was even cruel enough to facsimile some of them by photographic process .

		The seed of discontent having thus been sown broadcast , the field was in a measure pre - pared for the labors of the
English Conference	ORGANIZATION	named by the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	; and the re - port of that Conference , made public at the beginning of the present year , has kept the question of English teaching as burning as ever , if , indeed , it has not fanned the flame into greater heat .

		Not only the educational periodicals , but also many published in the in - terests of general culture , and even some of the newspapers in their blundering way have kept the subject before the public .

		Edu - cational gatherings have devoted to it much of their attention , and it has been taken up by the pamphleteers , notably by Professors Gay - ley and
Bradley	PERSON	of the
University of Califor	ORGANIZATION	- nia , whose `` English in the Secondary Schools '' we take pleasure in commending as both prac - tical and sane .

		The English Conference of which mention has been made , although appointed to investi - gate secondary education only , soon found that the subject of English is a unity , and felt obliged to make its recommendations apply to the whole course of training below the college to the work of twelve years instead of four .

		The recommendations made for the first eight years we.re substantially as follows : For the first two years , elementary story-telling and the description of objects ; for the next four , the use of reading-books , the beginnings of written composition , and a certain amount of informal grammar ; for the
last two years	DATE	, for - mal grammar and reading of a distinctly liter - ary sort .

		The '' speller '' is to be discarded altogether , and the '' reader '' after the sixth year .

		We wish , indeed , that the Conference THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, had gone still farther in the latter case and re - jected the '' reader '' altogether .

		The impor - tant principle seems to be that nothing but lit - erature should be read at all , and the `` readers '' in current use certainly contain much matter that can not by any courtesy be called litera - ture .

		This criticism is altogether apart from the other defect of scrappiness , inherent in the plan of the typical reading-book .

		Even '' Mother Goose , '' as Mr.
Horace Scudder	PERSON	has convincingly argued , is a sort of literature , and there is no lack of other substitutes for the thin and innutritions pabulum of the graded -LRB- we were on the point of saying degraded -RRB- books called '' readers '' which enterprising pub - lishers have forced upon several generations of over-complacent school authorities .

		The sug - gestion that , as far as possible , complete works should be studied , is of fundamental impor - tance , and should have been given greater em - phasis .

		The following recommendation is ad - mirable : '' Due attention should be paid to what are sometimes thoughtlessly regarded as points of pedantic detail , such as the elucidation of involved sentences , the expansion of metaphors into similes and the compression of similes into metaphors , the tracing of historical and other ref - erences , and a study of the denotation and connotation of single words .

		Such details are necessary if the pu - pil is to be brought to anything but the vaguest under - standing of what he reads , and there is no danger that an intelligent teacher will allow himself to be dominated by them .

		It should not be forgotten that in these early years of his training the pupil is forming habits of read - ing and of thought which will either aid him for the rest of his life , or of which he will by-and-by have to cure himself with painful effort . ''

		Upon the proportion of time to be allotted English in the first eight years , no definite pro- nouncement is made ; but it should be greater rather than less than the share of attention given to the subject during the high-school years .

		This share , in the opinion of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	, should be a full fourth of the time throughout the four years of work , and of this share literature proper should get rather more than half , the rest being given to composition , rhetoric , and grammar of the historical or systematic sort .

		The demand for a full fourth of the secondary school period does not seem to us excessive , and other reforms may well wait until the justice of this claim becomes generally admitted .

		Given such a recognition of the importance of secondary English , the accomplishment of its educational purpose must follow from insist - ence upon a few simple and well-understood principles rather than from any new devices or startling innovations of method .

		The Confer - ence rightly emphasized the fundamental im - portance of requiring good English in all school work , whether written or oral .

		As long as slovenly composition is allowed to pass un - censured in mathematical or natural science ex - ercises , as long as slovenly speech is tolerated in class translations from foreign languages , the case remains hopeless .

		This is the root of the matter , and other reforms are of minor import - ance .

		Theme-writing in the English classes is useful , but written exercises in all the classes must be treated as themes , and bad English in a mathematical paper must count against it no less than bad logic .

		Teachers should also avail themselves to the utmost of the invaluable com - parative advantages offered by the study of whatever ancient or modern languages are be - ing pursued at the same time by the English student .

		The Conference was wholly right in asserting that '' the best results in the teaching of English in high schools can not be secured without the aid given by the study of some other language . ''

		As for the study of English literature in sec - ondary schools , we are firmly convinced that a historical text-book of the subject should be in the hands of every student , and that he should frequently recur to it for the proper correla - tion of groups and the chronological develop - ment of schools and forms .

		Such a book should be used sparingly , and for certain purposes only ; not , for example , as a storehouse of cut - and-dried critical estimates .

		There has been of late a marked tendency to get along with the study of typical works of the great periods , just as in biology there has been a tendency to con - fine the work to study of a few typical forms .

		But the average student , left to his own devices , will not master the classification , in the one case , or the chronology , in the other ; and without the indispensable framework of bare fact , his special studies will fail to come into proper re - lation with each other , and will lose much of their significance .

		The greater part of the work done in English literature must of course consist in reading as many whole pieces of literature as it is possible to crowd into the time allotted .

		Since no two classes can be alike , and no two teachers ought to be alike , there is no greater mistake than the arrangement of a Procrustean course , to be followed by all , and repeated year after year .

		Whether the annual divisions of the high-school work be based upon literary periods or literary forms , or graded according to difficulty of sub - ject-matter , there should be within each year 's
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL work an almost unbounded latitude for the dis - play of the teacher 's individuality .

		He should be free to read as much as he chooses , and what he chooses , and in whatever way he chooses .

		To impose rigid methods upon the secondary teacher , or to select for him the texts which he shall study with his classes , is an act of sheer and utterly unjustifiable arrogance .

		To sum up , we are inclined to think that the problem of secondary education in English re - duces itself to getting teachers who know good literature and care for it , and minimizing to the utmost the restrictions placed upon their work .

		Duplication of work in different years must be avoided , but beyond the limits set with this ob - ject in view there should be no effort made to secure uniformity , both because every attempt to secure it costs something in vitality , and be - cause there is no good reason for uniformity anyway .

		Our suggestions doubtless seem tame in comparison with the brilliant new departures here and there noisily heralded , but radical re - constructions appear to us no less suspicious in the body educational than in the body politic .

		It will be time to seek for the `` new thing '' when we have done all that is possible with the old .

		week ; as a matter of fact , it offers considerably more .

		The English courses fall into three distinct nat - ural groups language , composition , and literature , in each of which work may be pursued for four or more years .

		One year of this work is required of all students ; the rest is elective .

		With two ex - ceptions , all our courses run throughout the year .

		The linguistic work is under the charge of Asso - ciate Professor
Davidson	PERSON	.

		The elementary courses are a beginning class in Old English prose , and one in the history of the language .

		Then follow a course in
Chaucer	LOCATION	, the Mystery Plays , and Middle English romances and lyrics ; an advanced course in Old English poetry , including a seminary study of Bgo - wulf ; the history of Old and Middle English liter - ature ; and a course in historical English grammar , which makes a special examination of forms and constructions in modern prose .

		In these classes the intention is to lead the student into independent in - vestigation as soon as he is prepared for it .

		In composition , the work is as completely prac - tical as we can make it .

		Writing is learned by writing papers , each one of which is corrected and rewritten .

		There are no recitations in '' rhetoric . ''

		The bugbear known generally in our colleges as Freshman English is now a part of our entrance re - quirement , and university instruction in composition begins with those fortunate students who have some little control of their native language when a pen is between their fingers .

		We are still obliged , how - ever , to supply instruction to students conditioned in entrance English , and the conditioned classes make the heaviest drain upon the instructors ' time .

		The first regular class receives students who write clearly and can compose good paragraphs .

		The sub - jects of the year 's work are narration , description , exposition .

		In the next year 's class , an attempt is made to stimulate original production in prose and verse .

		A certain amount of criticism upon contem - porary writing enters into this course , the object being to point out what is good in -LRB- for example -RRB- current magazines and reviews , and thus to hold before the student an ideal not altogether impos - sible of attainment .

		A young writer confronted with the virtues and defects of Macaulay and De Quincey is likelier to be discouraged or made indif - ferent , than inspired , as far as his own style is con - cerned .

		If he is shown wherein a '' Brief '' in THE DIAL is better than his own review of the book , he is in a fair way to improve .

		And so with sketches , stories , and even poems .

		Of course current maga - zine writing is not held up as ideal literature ; nor , on the other hand , is the production of literature deemed a possible part of college study .

		The work in this branch of English is rounded off by a class for stu - dents who intend to teach composition .

		The theory of rhetoric is studied , and something of its history ; school texts in rhetoric are examined ; and finally the ' class learns the first steps in teaching by taking charge of elementary classes .

		In the literary courses the required work comes first .

		Many students take no more English than these 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, prescribed three terms of five hours a week ; many others continue the study ; and the problem has been to arrange the course so as to create in the former class the habit of careful and sympathetic reading , and at the same time to give the latter class a safe foundation for future work .

		The plan is to read in the class , with the greatest attention to detail , one or more characteristic works of the authors chosen -LRB-
Scott	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	-RRB- , and to require as outside work a good deal of rapid collateral reading .

		This class and most of the composition classes are conducted by Mr.
Sembower	PERSON	and Mr.
Harris	PERSON	, who will be as - sisted during the coming year by one or two addi - tional instructors .

		The course in English prose style begins in the second year , and follows the method of the late Professor
Minto	PERSON	.

		Macaulay , De Quincey ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Arnold	PERSON	are the writers taken up .

		A course in American authors finds here a place .

		Then comes a course in poetry :
Coleridge	PERSON	, Words - worth ,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	.

		Complete editions of all the poets , except the last , are used , and the year 's work is meant to serve as an introduction to the critical reading of poetry .

		A separate course of one term in metrics accompanies the poetry course .

		In the drama there is a full course in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and other Elizabethans -LRB- which presupposes the first year 's work in Shakespeare -RRB- , and also a course in classical drama , Greek and French , studied in translation .

		The dramatic courses begin with a discussion of Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's books on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and on the Greek drama , and then take up independent study of as many plays as possible .

		The last regular course is the literary seminary , which during the coming year will investigate , as far as the library will allow , the rise of romantic poetry in
England	LOCATION	.

		Special re - search courses are arranged for students who wish to pursue their English studies .

		It may be added that in order to graduate in English , work must be taken in each of the three groups of the department .

		It has been my effort , naturally , to arrange the courses in a logical order , advancing from the simple to the more difficult , and covering as wide a range as is consistent with thoroughness ; this lat - ter quality being an ideal kept always in view would we might say as confidently , in reach .

		And as to the method of conducting classes , each in - structor teaches as he pleases ; any man 's best method is the one that appeals to him at the time .

		And now , as to that vexed question : How shall literature be taught ?

		Class-room methods vary in the department , but our ultimate object is the same .

		The aim , then , in teaching literature is , I think , to give the student a thorough understanding of what he reads , and the ability to read sympathetically and understandingly in the future .

		If we use the phrase '' to read intelligently , '' we name the object of every instructor 's teaching .

		But in the defini - tion of this ideal we come upon so many differences of opinion that in reality it means not one thing but a thousand .

		To touch upon a few obsolescent notions , to one teacher it meant to fill the student full of biography and literary history ; to another it meant to put the student in possession of what the best critics , or the worst ones , had said about the artist and his work ; to another it meant mak - ing a pother over numberless petty details of the text -LRB- a species of literary parsing -RRB- ; to another it meant harping on the moral purposes of the poet or novelist ; anything , in short , except placing the student face to face with the work itself and acting as his spectacles when his eyesight was blurred .

		The negations of all these theories have become the commonplaces of - day , truisms among a cer - tain class of teachers .

		To repeat those principles that have thus become truisms of theory -LRB- not yet of practice the difference is profound -RRB- , we have first the truth that the study of literature means the study of literature , not of biography nor of literary history -LRB- incidentally of vast importance -RRB- , not of grammar , not of etymology , not of anything except the works themselves , viewed as their creators wrote them , viewed as art , as transcripts of humanity , not as logic , not as psychology , not as ethics .

		The second point is that we are concerned with the study of literature .

		And here is the parting of the ways .

		Granting we concern ourselves with pure literature only , just how shall we concern ourselves with it ?

		There are many methods , but these methods are of two kinds only : the method of the professor who preaches the beauty of the poet 's utterance , and the method of him who makes his student sys - tematically approach the work as a work of art , find out the laws of its existence as such , the mode of its manifestation , the meaning it has , and the sig - nificance of that meaning , in brief , to have his students interpret the work of art and ascertain what makes it just that and not something else .

		Literature , as every reader profoundly feels , is an appeal to all sides of our nature ; but I venture to insist that as a study and this is the point at issue it must be approached intellectually .

		And here the purpose of literature , and the purpose of study - ing literature , must be sharply discriminated .

		The question is not , Apprehending literature , how shall I let it influence me ?

		The question most definitely is , How shall I learn to apprehend literature , that thereby it may influence me ?

		As far as class study is concerned , the instructors must draw the line once for all between the liking for reading and the understanding of literature .

		To all who assert that the study of literature must take into account the emotions , that it must remem - ber questions of taste , I can only answer impatiently , Yes , I agree ; but between taking them into account , and making them the prime object of the study , there is the difference between day and night .

		It is only by recognizing this difference that we pro- fessors of English cease to make ourselves ridicu - lous in the eyes of those who see into the heart of things , that we can at all successfully disprove
Freeman	PERSON	's remark caustic and four-fifths true
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL '' English Literature is only chatter about
Shelley	PERSON	. ''

		As a friend of mine puts it : To understand litera - ture is a matter of study , and may be taught in the class-room ; to love literature is a matter of char - acter , and can never be taught in a class-room .

		The professor who tries chiefly to make his students love literature wastes his energy for the sake of a few students who would love poetry anyway , and sacri - fices the majority of his class , who are not yet ripe enough to love it .

		The professor who tries chiefly to make his students understand literature will give them something to incorporate into their characters .

		For it is the peculiar grace of literature that whoso understands it loves it .

		It becomes to him a per - manent possession , not a passing thrill .

		To revert to our
University	ORGANIZATION	work in English , we have been confronted with a peculiar local condi - tion .

		Sometime ago , Professor
Hale	PERSON	wrote to THE DIAL that the students of
Iowa University	ORGANIZATION	had lit - tle feeling for style .

		That is true of the
Indiana	LOCATION	students I have met .

		But the lowans , it was my experience , were willing to study style and develop their latent feeling .

		Widespread in
Indiana	LOCATION	, how - ever , I find the firm conviction that style is un - worthy serious consideration .

		A poem is simply so much thought ; its `` form-side , '' to use a favorite student expression , ought to be ignored .

		And of the thought , only the ethical bearing of it is signifi - cant .

		Poetry is merely a question of morals , and beauty has no excuse for being .

		The plan of pro- cedure is : believe unyieldingly in a certain philos - ophy of life ; take a poem and read that philosophy into it .

		Our first year has been largely an attempt to set up other aims than these .

		CONTEMPORAKY ITALIAN NOVELISTS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was surprised to read in the leading article of your issue for
June 16	DATE	the following sentence : '' It is a little curious that
Italy	LOCATION	, from whom we have reason to ex - pect much , should have no contemporary writer of fic - tion deserving mention here . ''

		I fear that the writer is acquainted only with such Italian novels as have been translated into English .

		If he were a student of contemporary Italian literature he could hardly have made such a statement .

		In point of fact ,
Italy	LOCATION	now has a school of novelists that is not sur - passed by that of any other country .

		While their state of society is very similar to the French and their plots are necessarily of the same somewhat objectionable character , and while they are fully as realistic , yet some - thing of the spirit of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, something of the idealization of love even in its guiltiest forms , still clings to their souls , and saves them from the cynicism of the French ; so that they may well be placed above the contemporary French school .

		Every dog has its day .

		A few years ago it was the Russian dog ; now it is the Spanish ; and when people get tired of that , the Italian will doubtless have its turn , and everybody will be raving about Italian books which are now passed over unnoticed .

		To mention the able Italian novels of to-day would take too long .

		I may say , though , that I know of no contemporary French novel equal to Fogazzaro 's ''
Dan	PERSON	- iele Cortis , '' the story of the struggle of two noble souls against a guilty love , a struggle in which they came out victors .

		It is said that
Fogazzaro	PERSON	has been the recipient of very many letters from men and women thanking him for saving them in the hour of temptation , and that one famous Italian beauty who died rather than yield to a guilty passion had the book placed in her coffin .

		Then , to go to the other extreme , I know of no French novel equal in its way to that marvellous , perverse , and perverting book , '' L' Innocente , '' by
Gabriele d'Annun	PERSON	- zio .

		It is probably impossible to find in any language a study of morbid psychology that will compare with it .

		Those sentimentalists who think that the infidelity of the husband is as blamable as that of the wife should read this awful book .

		The writer , a very young man , is perhaps the most highly gifted of living authors .

		It is probably safe to say that the writer of your ar - ticle has never read
Rovetta	PERSON	's ''
Mater Dolorosa	PERSON	, '' Mem - ini 's `` Marchesa d'Arcello , ''
Roberti	PERSON	's `` L * Illusione , ''
Gentile	PERSON	's `` II Peccato , `` or Sperani 's `` Numeri e Sogni , '' or he would have written differently .

		-LSB- The editorial article to which our correspondent refers dealt with its subject in the most summary fashion , and attempted to name only a very few of the living writers of fiction .

		Probably many of its readers felt aggrieved at the omission of favorite names , and we are glad to afford a lover of the new Italian literature this opportunity of expressing his particular grievance .

		But we still think that no one of the writers mentioned by him yet occupies a suf - ficient space in the field of literature to deserve being classed with the few whom we singled out .

		Even the work of the young poet Sig .

		d'Annunzio , remarkable as it is , has the fatal defect of being morbid , and we did not mention it for the same reason that would have prevented us from mention - ing the work of
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, had he still been among the living .

		To call the former '' the most highly gifted of living authors '' seems to us a very wild bit of criticism .

July 1	DATE	, Ejje ISoofcs * LETTERS OF Two MUSICIANS .

		* To the musical world the publication of
Liszt 's Letters	ORGANIZATION	is an event of first-rate import - ance ; and they will be found , in the main , to fulfil anticipation .

		Their critical value is of a high order , and criticism is their dominant note .

		They tell us something of Liszt the man and much of Liszt the artist , and are fairly rich in those personal allusions and judgments which are the spice of productions of their class . ''

		Spice , '' however , is hardly the right word here , for
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, when speaking of others , is too amiable to be pungent .

		Though a true son of Pho3bus Apollo , there were no poisoned shafts in his quiver ; and his words have scarcely a sting even for Shelley 's '' stupid and malig - nant race , '' from whom , as a frequent con - temner of beaten paths , he had some provoca - tion . ''

		Whether one worries a bit more or a bit less , '' he writes to
Kbhler	PERSON	, `` it is pretty much the same .

		Let us only spread our wings ' with our faces firmly set , ' and all the cackle of goose-quills will not trouble us at all . ''

		As
Schlegel	PERSON	divided men into two main classes of Platonists and Aristotelians , so Liszt seems to have divided them into the fools and the non-fools ; and against the rock-ribbed Ehrenbreitstein of folly he resolved to waste no sparrow-shot in the shape of argument or appeal .

		The unvexed composer wrote to Dr.
Franz Brendel	PERSON	, an active polemic in the lists his friend declined to enter : '' People may think about it what they please , but the truth is that I do not bother myself about fools of any species , whether German , French , English , Russian or Italian , but am peacefully industrious in my seclu - sion here -LRB-
Rome	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		` Let me rest , let me dream , ' not indeed beneath blossoming almond trees , as
Hoffman	PERSON	sings , but comforted and at peace under the protection of the
Madonna del Rosario	ORGANIZATION	who has provided me with this cell . ''

		In point of literary charm ,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	's letters generally fall short of
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	's ; and the un-musical reader will find them over-full of the caviare of musical lore and technicality .

		Music was the god of Liszt 's idolatry , and his devotions left him little time or concern for what he may have thought profaner interests .

		His letters are mostly addressed to people whose * LETTERS OF FRANZ LISZT .

		pursuits and interests were kindred to his own fellow-artists , composers , publishers , critics , and amateurs of music , etc. ; and one notes lit - tle to indicate that his sympathies ever left for long their wonted channel .

		Sparing in his cen - sures , he bestowed his commendation with a free hand .

		In

		Heavens !

		what sufferings , what misery , what tortures in those four strings ! ''

		Of
Wagner	PERSON	he wrote to
Belloni	PERSON	in
1849	DATE	: ''
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, a
Dresden	LOCATION	conductor , has been here -LRB-
Weimar	LOCATION	-RRB- since yesterday .

		That is a man of won - derful genius , such a brain-splitting genius indeed as beseems this country , a new and brilliant appearance in art . ''

		In a letter to
Kohler	PERSON	, in
1853	DATE	, he tells of the '' several Walhalla-dajs '' recently spent with
Wagner	PERSON	, and adds , '' I praise God for hav - ing created such a man . ''

		Writing to
Wilhelra von Lenz	PERSON	in regard to the latter 's book on ''
Beethoven	PERSON	and his Three Styles , '' Liszt finely says : '' For us musicians
Beethoven	PERSON	's work is like the pil - lar of cloud and fire which guided the Israelites through the desert a pillar of cloud to guide us by day , a pil - lar of fire to guide us by night , ' so that we may pro- gress both day and night . '

		His obscurity and his light trace for us equally the path we have to follow ; they are each of them a perpetual commandment , an infallible revelation . ''

		Proceeding to discuss the ground idea of
Lenz	PERSON	's book , Liszt continues : '' Were it my place to categorize the different peri - ods of the great master 's thoughts , as manifested in his Sonatas , Symphonies , and Quartets , I should certainly not fix the division into three styles , which is now pretty generally adopted and which you have followed ; but simply recording the questions which have been raised hitherto , I should frankly weigh the great question which is the axis of criticism and of musical sestheticism at the point to which
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	has led us namely , in how far is traditional or recognized form a necessary determinant for the organism of thought ?

		The solu - tion of this question , evolved from the works of Beet - hoven himself , would lead me to divide this work , not into three styles or periods , the words style and period being here only corollary subordinate terms , of a vague and equivocal meaning , but quite logically into two categories : the first , that in which traditional and rec - ognized form contains and governs the thought of the master ; and the second , that in which the thought stretches , breaks , recreates , and fashions the form and style according to its needs and inspirations .

		Doubtless in proceeding thus we arrive in a direct line at those incessant problems of authority and liberty .

		But why should they alarm us ?

		In the region of liberal arts they do not , happily , bring in any of the dangers and

		THE DIAL disasters which their oscillations occasion in the polit - ical and social world ; for , in the domain of the Beau - tiful , Genius alone is the authority , and hence , Dualism disappearing , the notions of liberty and authority are brought back to their original identity .

		Manzoni , in de - fining genius as ' a stronger imprint of Divinity , ' has elo - quently expressed this very truth . ''

		It is well known that Liszt virtually defrayed the expenses -LRB- about 60,000 francs -RRB- of the
Bonn	LOCATION	monument to
Beethoven	PERSON	out of his own purse .

		The contributions had flowed in very meagerly , and Liszt impatiently wrote to
Berlioz	LOCATION	, '' such a niggardly almsgiving , got together with such trouble and sending round the hat , must not be allowed to help towards building our Beet - hoven 's monument . ''

		There is perhaps a shade of sarcasm in his letter to the
Bonn	LOCATION	committee : '' As the subscription for
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's monument is only getting on slowly , and as the carrying out of this undertaking seems to be rather far distant , I venture to make a proposal to you , the acceptance of which would make me very happy .

		I offer myself to make up , from my own means , the sum still wanting for the erection of the monument , and ask no other privilege than that of naming the artist who shall execute the work ... '' Writing to
Brendel	PERSON	-LRB- 1854 -RRB- , he styles Ru - binstein '' the pseudo-Musician of the Future . ''

		He continues : '' He is a clever fellow , possessed of talent and char - acter in an exceptional degree , and therefore no one can be more just to him than I have been for years .

		Still I do not want to preach to him he may sow his wild oats and fish deeper in the Mendelssohn waters , and even swim away if he likes . ''

		Of
Hans von Biilow	PERSON	he writes to Lessman : '' His knowledge , ability , experience are astounding , and border on the fabulous .

		Especially has he , by long years of study , so thoroughly steeped himself in the un - derstanding of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, that it seems scarcely pos - sible for any one else to approach nearer to him in that respect . ''

		A brief note to
Edvard Grieg	ORGANIZATION	indicates
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	's esteem for this clever leader of the
Young Northern School	ORGANIZATION	: '' I am very glad to tell you what pleasure it has given me to read your Sonata .

		It bears testimony to a talent of vigorous , reflective , and inventive composition of excellent quality , which has only to follow its natural bent in order to rise to a high rank ... ''
Chopin	PERSON	's genius is finely characterized in a letter to
Lenz	PERSON	-LRB- 1872 -RRB- : '' Let us reascend to
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, the enchanting aristocrat , the most refined in his magic .

		Pascal 's epigraph , ' One must not get one 's nourishment from it , but use it as one would an essence , ' is only appropriate to a certain extent .

		Let us inhale the essence and leave it to the druggists to make use of it .

		You also , I think , exag - gerate the influence which the Parisian salons exercised on
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	.

		His soul was not in the least affected by them , and his work as an artist remains transparent , marvellous , ethereal , and of an incomparable genius quite outside the errors of a school and the silly trifling of a salon .

		He is akin to the angel and the fairy ; more than this , he sets in motion the heroic string which has nowhere else vibrated with so much grandeur , passion , and fresh energy as in his Polonaises , which you bril - liantly designate as ' Pindaric Hymns of Victory . ' ''

		In a note to
Schumann	PERSON	-LRB-
1839	DATE	-RRB- there is a playful touch worthy of
Heine	LOCATION	, which shows the master in a warmer light than usual .

		He says : J , '' As to the
Kinderscenen	PERSON	, I owe to them one of the greatest pleasures of my life .

		You know , or you do n't know , that I have a little gir .1 of three years old , whom everybody agrees in considering angelic -LRB- did you ever hear such a commonplace ? -RRB-

		.

		Her name is
Blandine	PERSON	-
Rachel	PERSON	, and her surname Moucheron .

		It goes without saying that she has a complexion of roses and milk , and that her fair golden hair reaches to her feet just like a savage .

		She is , however , tie most silent child , the most sweetly grave , the most philosophically gay in the world .

		I have every reason to hope also that she will not be a musician , from which may Heaven preserve her ! ''

		There is a fine ring of patriotic pride and wounded dignity in a letter -LRB- 1840 -RRB- to
Buloz	LOCATION	, editor of the '' Revue des Deux Mondes . ''

		That the national honor paid him in his native Hun - gary should be confounded with the plaudits bestowed on an artist whose art lay -LRB- as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	once put it -RRB- in '' making a Manx penny of her - self , '' was too much even for
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	's serenity ; and he wrote to the offending editor : '' In your Revue Musicale for
October	DATE	last my name was mixed iip with the outrageous pretensions and ex - aggerated success of some executant artists ; I take the liberty to address a few remarks to you on this subject .

		The wreaths thrown at the feet of Mesdemoiselles Elssler and Pixis by the amateurs of
New York	LOCATION	and Palermo are striking manifestations of the enthusiasm of a pub - lic ; the sabre which was given to me at Pest is a re - ward given by a nation in an entirely national form .

		In
Hungary	LOCATION	, sir , in that country of antique and chiv - alrous manners , the sabre has a patriotic signification .

		It is the special token of manhood ; it is the weapon of every man who has a right to carry a weapon .

		When six of the chief men of note in my country presented me with it amidst the acclamations of my compatriots , whilst at the same moment the towns of Pest and
Oeden	PERSON	- burg conferred upon me the freedom of the city , and the civic authorities of Pest asked His Majesty for let - ters of nobility for me , it was an act to acknowledge me afresh as a Hungarian , after an absence of fifteen years ; it was a reward of some slight services rendered to Art in my country ; it was especially , and so I felt it , to unite me gloriously to her by imposing on me serious duties , and obligations for life as man and as artist .

		I agree with you , sir , that it was , without doubt , going far beyond my deserts up to the present time .

		There - fore I saw in that solemnity the expression of a hope far more than of a satisfaction .

		Hungary hailed in me the man from whom she expects artistic illustriousness , after all the illustrious soldiers and politicians she has so plentifully produced .

		As a child I received from my country precious tokens of interest , and the means of going abroad to develop my artistic vocation .

		When 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, grown up , and after long years , the young man returns to bring her the fruits of his work and the future of his will , the enthusiasm of the hearts which open to re - ceive him must not be confounded with the frantic dem - onstrations of an audience of amateurs .

		In placing these two things side by side it seems to me there is something which must wflund a just national pride and sympathies by which I am honored . ''

		While somewhat lacking , perhaps , on the personal side , the Letters of Liszt make an ar - tistic biography , of rare inner truth and , form considered , fulness .

		The editing is helpful and thorough , and the translation acceptable .

		At one point the translator '' misses it '' rather oddly .

		Writing of the bringing out of the ''
Faust Symphony	ORGANIZATION	for 2 Pianofortes , '' Liszt went on to say , punning -LRB- like Homer , he sins once -RRB- , `` None the less ... bully him -LSB-
Schu	PERSON	- berth the publisher -RSB- into action with '
Faust	PERSON	-
Recht	PERSON	' '' meaning , of course , with club-law , law of might .

		Miss Bache gravely renders it , in parenthesis , '' Faust rights or Faust justice '' a small matter , but worth mending .

		There is a fine portrait of Liszt , and the work resem - bles in size and typography the Wagner-Liszt Letters .

		In preparing a volume of
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	's let - ters , the editor , Mr.
W. F. Alexander	PERSON	, has made a fair selection and an excellent transla - tion , and Sir
George Grove	PERSON	has added an In - troduction which , like the annals of the poor , is '' short and simple . ''

		Sir
George	PERSON	tells us , first , that he was asked to write which we should have taken for granted ; and , second , that he approves of both author and editor which will be gratifying to the latter .

		There are thirty-three letters in all , sixteen of them addressed to the writer 's relatives , and the rest to
Zelter	PERSON	,
Moscheles	LOCATION	,
Pastor Schubring	PERSON	, von
Falkenstein	PERSON	,
Julius Rietz	PERSON	, and other friends and acquaintances .

		In the earlier ones there are some suggestive glimpses of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, nota - bly in an account of a family dinner at the poet 's .

		Mendelssohn says : '' I found him outwardly unchanged , but at first some - what silent and reserved ; I fancy he must have wanted to observe me , but at the moment I felt disappointed , and thought to myself , ' Now he is always like that . ' ''

		Presently , however , the talk turning on the
Weimar	LOCATION	`` Women 's Association '' and the Wei - mar women 's newspaper matters in them - selves provocative of Teutonic wit , '' The old man all at once became jovial , and began to quiz the ladies about their philanthropy and their in - tellect , also about their subscriptions and their visita - tions of the sick , which seemed particularly to move his wrath .

		He appealed to me to join him in a revolt against these things , and , when I would not , he re - turned to his former indifference , but at last he became more friendly and intimate than I had ever known him before .

		It was beyond everything !

		... After din - ner , he all at once began to hum ,
Gute Kinder	PERSON	hiib - sche Kinder miissen immer lustig sein tolles
Volk	PERSON	, ' and his eyes grew like those of an old lion just falling asleep .

		So presently I had to play to him , and he said it was very strange to him to think how long it was since he had heard my music , and meanwhile great advances had been made and he knew nothing of them . ''

		Goethe seems to have made unsparing drafts upon his young friend 's abilities both of ex - position and execution .

		Says Mendelssohn : '' In the morning I have to play the piano to him for an hour , pieces from all the great composers arranged in the order of dates , and then explain to him how mu - sic has progressed in their hands ; meanwhile he sits in a dark corner , like a Jupiter Tonans , and his old eyes flash fire .

		About Beethoven he was indifferent .

		But I said he must endure some , and played him the first movement of the symphony in C minor .

		It affected him very strangely .

		First he said , < That does not touch one at all , it only astonishes one . '

		Then he murmured to himself , and said presently , ' It is very great , it is wild ; it seems as though the house were falling ; what must it be with the whole orchestra ! ' '

		Mendelssohn was in
Italy	LOCATION	in 1830-31 ; and his letters from thence , especially the Roman ones , show how fully he was in harmony with his new surroundings .

		Like Goethe , he drank deep of the cup that
Italia	ORGANIZATION	proffers to those who understand and love her , his descriptions re - calling the poet 's paradox that '' one finds in
Rome	LOCATION	only what one brings there . ''

		But every - one , the poorest , finds something ; and the bar - renest /
Sjnessburger	PERSON	^ who grunts his disapproval of the Pantheon and the tomb of the Scipios , relents before the wicker-bound
Orvieto	LOCATION	and the purple figs of
Spoleto	LOCATION	.


Felix Mendelssohn	PERSON	brought to
Rome	LOCATION	a mind open and receptive to the best she had to offer .

		The traditions of her two-fold past , the memorials of the Em - perors and the Pontiffs , alike filled him with a '' measureless delight . '' ''

		I proceeded with these free gifts of hers , '' he says , '' very leis - urely . ''

		One day it was a ramble in the Forum or on the
Aventine	LOCATION	, the next a visit to the Bor - ghese Gallery , the Capitol , or the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	; '' so each day is one never to be forgotten , and this sort of dallying leaves each impression firmer and stronger . ''

		Reading now for the first time the '' Italian Journey , '' it pleases
Mendels	PERSON	- sohn to find that he and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	reached
Rome	LOCATION	on the same day , and that
Goethe	PERSON	, too , went first to the Quirinal and heard a requiem there . ''

		He says also that at
Florence	LOCATION	and
Bologna	LOCATION	a sort of impatience took possession of him , and on arrival here he felt calm again , and , as he calls it , well-knit in mind ; so I have experienced all he describes , a reflection which pleases me . ''

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 His reverence , however , for his '' old hero '' of
Weimar	LOCATION	results in no mean subservience of opinion .

		He can doubt his oracle where most men , or most Germans , would incline to accept the judgment as final .

		So when
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	finds a certain Titian '' meaningless '' a mere set scene or elegantly-arranged tableau , in the style of
Veronese Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	says : '' I flatter myself , however , that I have found a deep significance in this picture , and maintain that he is right who sees most in a Titian , for the man was simply di - vine .

		He , indeed , found no opportunity to display the whole breadth of his inspiration , as
Raphael	PERSON	did here in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	; yet one can never forget his three pic - tures at
Venice	LOCATION	, and this of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, which I first saw
this morning	TIME	, stands in a line with them . ''

		Mendelssohn waxes wroth over the
Philis	LOCATION	- tinism of the artists he saw in
Rome	LOCATION	a poor lot mostly , it seems , distinguished as a class chiefly by eccentricities of dress and manners .

		The chronic delusion that fustian coats , long hair and loose habits make the painter , was rife with these degenerate pittori , and their chief professional concern was to find , not the color - secret of Titian , but where the most brandy was to be had for the least money .

		Mendels - sohn says : '' It is terrible to see them at their
Cafd Greco	PERSON	.

		I seldom go there , for I am rather afraid of them and the place they haunt .

		It is a small dark room about eight paces wide ; on one side it is permitted to smoke tobacco , on the other not .

		They sit round on the benches with their brigand - hats and their big bloodhounds ; their throats , chins , and faces are entirely covered with hair , and they pout - out dense volumes of smoke and exchange incivilities with one another while the dogs are ex - changing their insects .

		A necktie or a frock-coat would be a modern weakness ; all the face that 's left by the beard is concealed by their spectacles ; they swill their coffee and discourse of Titian and
Porde	PERSON	- none as though these persons were sitting there with beards and brigand-hats like themselves .

		Their busi - ness is to paint sickly madonnas , ricketty saints , and effeminate knights , things one longs to dash one 's fist through .

		As for
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's picture in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, which you ask about , these infernal critics have no respect for it .

		According to them it has neither subject nor con - ception , and it never occurs to one of them that a mas - ter who gave laborious days of love and reverence to a picture , may still have seen as far as they can through their glistening spectacles , and if all my life I never contrive to do anything else , I am resolved , at least , to be as rude as I can to people who have no respect for the great masters ; that will be one good work accom - plished . ''

		The many who know
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	only through his music will find in this little book a fair test of his quality as a letter - writer a character in which he is unusually attractive .

		The vol - ume has a good portrait .

		E. G. J. SIGNS OF LIFE IN LITERATURE .

		* There are in
Paris	LOCATION	during the Spring of the year a good many exhibitions of pictures which trouble the soul of the conscientious lover of the arts .

		Not only at the two great Salons are there generally certain alarming manifestations , but there are also smaller collections gathered together by Independents , Rosicrucians , or other such persons , in which the wildest gymnastics in the name of art are not only allowed but en - couraged .

		Dazed and antagonized by these indulgences , the feeling of many an ordinary and honest art-lover must be , '' Almost thou persuadest me to be a Philistine . ''

		Fortunately , however ,
Paris	LOCATION	herself furnishes an antidote to any such despair , in the annual exhibition of the pictures and sculptures entered in compe - tition for the Prix de
Rome	LOCATION	.

		One goes to these shameless revelations of academic horror , and becomes in a great degree reconciled to the ex - istence of new notions in art , however extrava - gant .

		They really do but little harm -LRB- except to their ingenious sponsors -RRB- , and they are ex - tremely useful in keeping up a healthy circula - tion of ideas .

		Now I am not familiar with any evil things in literature analogous to these Prix de
Rome	LOCATION	exhibitions , unless perhaps we might count col - lege oratorical contests and commencements .

		But the feeling that there might be something worse should make us look with benignity , if not pleasure , on such books as Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	's '' Crumbling Idols '' and Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	's '' Salome . ''

		Different as they are in all other points , both books are of that foam and froth of literature which is indicative of true life and action somewhere , which is itself shortly blown away and lost to sight and re - membrance .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's book , we are informed by an unknown sponsor , is '' a vigorous plea for the recognition of youth and a protest against the despotism of tradition . ''

		It might have been added that it is an assertion of the necessity of Americanism in American Literature .

		Surely these things are very good things , looked at in their ordinary light .

		But when we look at them in Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's light , it must be confessed that the feeling is not one of approbation but of irritation .

		12 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, earthly use can there be in Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's say - ing all this ?

		For the main points in Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- land 's discourse are by no means new .

		He takes
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's thesis as to a native literature , looks at it in the light of the expe - rience of the last twenty-five years , and puts forth the whole thing as his own prophecy for the future .

		As one reads '' Crumbling Idols '' it comes more and more strongly to mind that the book is a sort of apology for existence on the part of its author .

		Now Mr.
Garland	PERSON	of course need make no such apology .

		`` Main Travelled Roads '' and '' Prairie Songs '' are reasons enough for anyone 's existing , temporarily .

		They are their own excuse for being : no one doubted the fact , until Mr.
Garland	PERSON	set himself to force us into admitting it .

		For , unfortunately , Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- land is not persuasive : he is bellicose , obstrep - erous , blatant .

		Nobody could possibly agree with him , whatever he said .

		The real difficulty seems to be that Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- land , being himself able to write excellent things of a certain sort , can not conceive that there can be anything else excellent of a kind totally different .

		Feeling himself very virtuous , he becomes enraged that anyone else should ven - ture to be still attached to cakes and ale .

		Now this is all wrong .

America	LOCATION	may never come to anything without plenty of local color and provincialism -LRB- to use Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's expressions -RRB- , but it will never be a great liter - ature so long as it has nothing besides .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	would do us but poor service if he could persuade people to write nothing but '' local novels . ''

		But of course one need not take the book very seriously .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's engrossing fear seems to be that Americans will turn their en - tire attention to writing '' blank - verse tragedies on
Columbus	LOCATION	or
Washington	LOCATION	, '' or that they will '' copy the last epics of feudalism . ''

		Such an apprehension seems to have very slight basis .

		It is probable that during the last year there have been thousands of what Mr.
Garland	PERSON	would call '' local '' stories written by young
America	LOCATION	for every single blank-verse tragedy or epic of feudalism that has seen the light this side the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Everybody writes '' local '' stories nowadays ; it is as natural as whooping-cough .

		There is no need of encouragement : to tell the truth , a little restraint would do no harm .

		For , even with the best of intentions , one may write a '' local '' story so badly that it will be worse than a blank-verse tragedy on Washing - ton or anybody else , But to turn from such serious foolishness to a more sprightly trifler .

		Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	never troubles one with taking himself too se - riously , and the history of '' Salome '' is Oscar Wilde all over .

		It was written in French and produced in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Desirous then of favoring his own countrymen , Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	made prepara - tion to present it in
London	LOCATION	.

		In this worthy attempt , however , he was hindered so the papers told us by some official folly which enraged him so much that he was even strongly tempted to stop being an Englishman , in favor of that less imbecile people across the Chan - nel .

		But not wishing to keep his anger for - ever , Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	finally allowed his noble friend Lord
Alfred Bruce Douglas	PERSON	to do the play into English .

		It was then '' pictured , '' as the phrase is , by Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	, and is now ready for the delight of a somewhat indifferent world .

		Such an extraordinary conjunction of affecta - tions is ominous .

		But , strangely enough , there are some things in '' Salome '' that are good .

		It is impossible to read it without feeling cu - riously moved and stirred .

		The careless talk of the loungers on the terrace , the soldiers and the Cappadocian , is good ; the squabbling of the Jews , the Pharisee , the Sadducee , the
Naz	PERSON	- arene , is good .

		So , also , is
Herod	LOCATION	, indeed the character of
Herod	ORGANIZATION	is quite the best con - ceived thing in the play , as his description of his treasure is the best written .

		The play may well have been very effective on the stage , for there is a constant feeling of movement , of life , and it is certainly worth reading now that it is published .

		With all this , however , the play is wholly ephemeral .

		Its action is trivial and its dia - logue affected .

		Its ideas , and its language too , are extravagances , without much more founda - tion than the extravagances of Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	.

		But while in Mr.
Garland	PERSON	we have the prophet of Literature as Life , we have in Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	the follower of Literature as Art .

		Mr.
Garland	PERSON	is a '' veritist , '' and prefers the fresh novelties of nature .

		But Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	seeks beauty , in art and art 's most latent sub - tleties .

		He contrives expressions and concep - tions of the most curious and self-conscious refinement , of the strangest and most ultra - precious distinction .

		As ever , he scorns the ordinary , the every-day , the generally pleasing , and is unremitting to attain the romantic beauty , the strange , the wonderful , the remote , the reward of no art but the most devoted , the delight of no taste but the most distinguished .

		As suchj his work lends itself eminently to

		THE DIAL 13 the illustration of Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	.

		* Mr.
Aubrey '' Beardsley	PERSON	receives a good many hard words nowadays , and certainly his pic - tures are strange things , more affected than Oscar Wilde himself , and more remote from obvious apprehension .

		What one is first in - clined to criticise in Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	is his lack of originality .

		His pictures remind us of al - most every phase of art that has ever existed ; or , at any rate , of every phase which had ever a tinge of the grotesque or the trivial in its character .

		From the bald priestly pictures mingled among Egyptian hieroglyphics , down to the graceful frivolities of Willette of the
Red Windmill	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	seems to have laid everything under contribution .

		His work seems by turns one thing and then another Japanese , Gothic , Preraphaelite , what you will .

		So it seems at first .

		But the great excellence is that , however Protean , Mr.
Aubrey Beards	PERSON	- ley , like Satan in '' Paradise Lost , '' is always himself , even in the midst of his disguises .

		Just what is his own quality , is hard to say ; but there can be little doubt that it exists , and it would be worth somebody 's while to de - termine it in the shifting dazzle of his influ - ences , to fix it for an instant for us , to get its true character and flavor unadulterated .

		But whatever be his quality , it is eminently in keeping with the work of Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	.

		Of our two literary eccentrics , some will pre - fer Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	and some Mr.
Garland	PERSON	.

		If they could be seized each with an admiration for the other , it would have an excellent effect on the work of both .

		But even as they are , they are good evidence of life in literature , and an as - surance that it will not yet awhile harden down into utter conventionalism .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		* Characteristic of author and artist is the tribute of ad - miration which we see in the portrait of the former , opposite page 24 .

		That Mr.

		RAMBLES AND REFLECTIONS OF A LOVEII OF
NATUIIE	ORGANIZATION	.

		*
William Allingham	PERSON	, during his life , was known almost exclusively as a poet ; but a three - volume edition of '' Varieties in Prose , '' just published by his wife , proves him to have been a delightful prose writer as well . ''

		Patricius Walker '' he calls himself in the first two vol - * VAHIKTI us IN PKOSE .

		By
William Allingham	PERSON	.

		In three volumes .


New York	LOCATION	;
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green	ORGANIZATION	,
$ Co	MONEY	, umes , which consist of '' Rambles '' through
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Wales	LOCATION	, and furnish the opportunity for much charming description of natural scenery , flavored with literary and ar - tistic comment and generalizations .

		Few ex - periences in life are more enjoyable than long and leisurely out-door strolls through a pleas - ing country , with a chatty companion who has an eye for the picturesque , a well-stored mind , and a ready fancy .

		Something of the same satisfaction we feel in these books ; for the time being , we are fellow-ramblers with
Patricius	PERSON	, and share in his quiet but responsive moods .

		He calls attention to much that would have escaped our own more prosaic eyes and minds : while the physical aspects of the country might have been apparent , its sentiment and associa - tions would probably have continued un re - vealed .

		For example ,
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	is perhaps not specially interesting to the average man , but our companion recalls that it was here , one
Sunday	DATE
evening	TIME	, '' a certain young poet now forever young , '' felt and sung the rich sadness of
Autumn	DATE	. ''

		Young
Keats	PERSON	's gaze that
Sunday	DATE
evening	TIME	was upon the Winchester stubble-fields like a spiritual setting-sun , and left them lying enchanted in its fadeless light ... After all , it is permissible to believe , the poet draws the best lot from Fortune 's urn .

		Whom could he envy ?

		Not alone is his delight in life the keenest , but his in - sight the most veracious .

		Yet , ah me !

		how thin-skinned he is how open to suffering how sure to suffer , in a world such as this !

		Is it partly the world 's fault for being such a world ?

		Was
Keats	PERSON	, pensive among the sheaves , a happier man than
Hodge	PERSON	, who reaped them , and quaffed his ale-cup at the harvest-home ? '

		Hap - pier ' what is happiness 1 Would any man deliberately give up a grain of his intellect or sensibility to win a lower kind of happiness than he was born capable of ?

		escape suffering by stupidity ?

		Here truly is a cat - echism of questions , and food for meditation . ''

		We get very close to our companion 's idio - syncrasies , know his likes and dislikes , and though not always agreeing , learn to expect something spontaneous and entertaining at each step of the way .

		A cathedral service on a Brit - ish
Sunday	DATE	he finds a great resource , and '' the sermon keeps it from appearing too pleasant a set-off against the music and the architec - ture . ''

		As an easy and most valuable reform in the Church of
England	LOCATION	, he suggests the to - tal abolition of sermons in connection with the ordinary service .

		Modern life , whether pub - lic or private , does not interest him ; it is neither romantic nor picturesque , and nothing arouses his indignation more than to see an old building '' restored '' -LRB- that is , defaced -RRB- by mod - ern hands .

		Words can not express his disgust at what he calls the uglifiers of the world .

		He 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, admits that such an evil may be sometimes ab - solutely unavoidable , like shaving a sick man 's head , or cutting off his leg ; but ithe necessity ought to be clear and real , not , as is so often the case , a pretended need , generated in a com - post of stupidity , weak desire of novelty , and some kind of low self-interest .

		On this point he says : '' The world is not ours absol utely , or any part of it ; but only ours in trust .

		We have ' a user ' as the lawyers say , and that without prejudice to all others , born or to be born .

		Pray , how can mortal do , in a common way , worse turn to mankind than by permanently lessening the world 's beauty , in landscape , in architecture , in dress , in -LRB- what is sure to go with the rest -RRB- manners , tastes , sympathies ?

		An evil governor , or the writer of a clever vile book , perhaps does worse , but that is not in a common way . ''

		But we prefer to quote our friend when he is in his usual more serene mood .

		The true poet 's power of seeing the beautiful in the com - mon is quickly stirred in him .

		This is what he finds in an idle hour at the little railway - station of Wimbourne Minster : '' Narrow streets hem in the Minster .

		I first reached the market-place , an irregular open ; and then , through bye-lanes , a pretty field-path on the west side of the town , where , amidst broad meadows , guarded north and south by heavily wooded slopes , winds the tranquil Stour , with deep pools , where , looking into the trans - parent water , I could see some of the inhabitants , little pike at feed , who know nothing of Wimbourne , or Dor - set , or the South Western Railways , but have their own towns and districts and lines of travelling .

		Two young ladies came along the path from the town , sat down on the grassy margin close to an island or promontory shaded with tall green withes , and began to read un - known mysterious books ; it was poetry , I felt sure , and finer than any I have yet seen in print .

		Yet could I have looked over their shoulder it would doubtless have changed into .

		The damsels themselves seemed , in that sunny
spring	DATE	meadow by the clear river , more than semi-celestial ; yet already their features have mingled irrevocably with the cloudy past . ''

		Patricius believes firmly in the educating power of fair and noble landscape .

		Even the peasant , who does not consciously notice it , is better for the beauty , as he is better for the pure air he unconsciously breathes , and he would soon miss both .

		Yet our enthusiastic Nature-lover is forced to admit that even the most responsive do not at all times feel
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's charms .

		Like other pleasures , it is apt to evade too eager pursuit .

		One may find the mountain or the cataract , but can not always command the mood for enjoying them .

		Often , in the fairest scenes , we may repeat
Coleridge	PERSON	's line , '' I see , not feel , that it is fair , '' and unawares , in some happy hour or moment , '' reap the harvest of a quiet eye . ''

		Inspired by a stroll through Devonshire lanes , and the sight of Dean Prior where
Robert Iler	PERSON	- rick was vicar two centuries ago , he treats us to a disquisition 011
Herrick	PERSON	's poetry , com - paring him to Martial , and calling him by names less harsh than are sometimes used .


Robert Herrick	PERSON	is a name that echoes pleas - antly , after all , and he can drink a health to the '' half-disreputable shade '' who was so un - like his contemporary brother-poet and brother - clergyman whose memories are also revived the '' almost too respectable vicar of Fugglc - ston , near
Salisbury George Herbert	PERSON	! ''

		The '' Rambles '' come to an end with the second volume .

		In the third are seven Irish Sketches , and about as many essays on various literary themes , all agreeable though not re - markable .

		Like most poets , Mr.
Allingham	PERSON	seems to have had some ambition towards drama , and the work concludes with a serio - comic play in one act , '' Hopgood & Go . ''

		Be - ing far inferior to the rest of the collection , it might better have been omitted .

		The pub - lishers have given the book a beautiful dress , and a pleasing photograph of the author , from a drawing by his wife , serves as frontispiece .


ANNA B. MCMAHAN	PERSON	.

		FOLK-TALES OF NOVA SCOTIAN INDIANS .

		* The
Algonkin	PERSON	family of Indian tribes was one of the most widely spread in
America	LOCATION	.

		To it belonged tribes so different as the Blackfeet of the far West , the Sacs and Foxes and the Ojibways of the interior , the Delawares of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and the
New England Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		To it , too , the Micmacs of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	and
Prince Edward	ORGANIZATION	's
Island	LOCATION	belong .

		The Rev.
Silas Tertius Rand	PERSON	in many ways a remarkable man was for forty years or more a missionary to this tribe .

		Scholarly in his tastes and pro- foundly interested in the people among whom he labored , he gathered a great mass of mate - rial , both linguistic and mythological , of much value .

		Part of this material is in the volume before us .

		It contains eighty-seven stories , of varying interest and importance , simply told .

		There is already considerable Algonkin folk - lore in print .

		Ojibway legends have been often studied and told with more or less of accuracy .

		Mr.
George Bird Grinnell	PERSON	has beautifully put the Blackfeet Lodge-Tales into English .

		THE DIAL 15 Others have busied themselves with other tribes ; and Mr.
Charles G. Leland	PERSON	has given us in his * ' Algonkin Legends of
New England	LOCATION	'' a wonderful book stories from the Indians of
Maine	LOCATION	and
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	.

		In fact , Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's book contains many of these very Micmac legends , for he was permitted by Mr.
Rand	PERSON	to make liberal use of the manuscript of these in preparing his book .

		Thus , much of the choic - est part of Mr.
Rand	PERSON	's book was already in print .

		It is , however , very desirable to have as here the whole collection in the very form in which it was gathered .

		The reader is at once impressed with the profound difference between the best of these Micmac tales and those of the more Western tribes of the Algonkin group such as the Blackfeet .

		They are more massive in struct - ure , bolder in conception , more wild in spirit .

		This is true only of those which are plainly un - touched by modern European influence .

		There are some stories in the collection which are plainly modifications of European fairy-tales of recent introduction .

		Most of this latter class betray themselves , but are interesting as illustrations of myth-changes due to new con - ditions .

		Curious heroes figure in the better of these stories : giants , magicians , chenoo .

		The Al - gonkins have sorcerers , and medicine and magic were realities in their old life ; they figure in these stories .

		The great hero is Glooskap .

		He is a mighty magician , kind usually , ready to help the poor and punish the bad , a joker withal whose jokes are sometimes rather grim .

		He knows the language of beast and bird , he can control nature 's powers -LRB- though with cu - rious limitations -RRB- , he can change the size and form of himself or others .

		Cheated and robbed , he can yet overtake his spoilers and put them to confusion .

		As he can grant fulfilment of wishes , he is much sought by men ; but often , in granting their desires , he shows them their folly and weakness .

		Very common , too , in
Micmac	LOCATION	stories is it to hear of the remarkable adventures of the Rabbit .

		He is cunning and has great '' medicine '' power , but he is hasty and thoughtless , often putting himself into strange predicaments , although he usually comes forth the victor .

		But most curious of all the curious beings in Micmac stories are the Chenoo dreadful , wild , cannibalistic , with heart of ice , endowed with more than hu - man powers for both good and ill , but seldom exercising the power .

		Scarcely anywhere will we find a more beautiful bit in folk-lore than the story of the Chenoo converted by kindness .

		His savage nature is tamed by love , but with the change comes , necessarily , death .

		Some of the legends are , or appear to be , simple nar - ratives of real events battles , incidents of tribal history : in some of these there is no im - probability in the narrative , in others an ele - ment of magic enters in which weakens our faith .

		From these to pure hero myths is not a long step .

		The modified fairy-stories of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , but recently introduced , are interesting .

		They are plainly exotic , but they often have acquired some new flavor and undergone some curious modification .

		A fair example is the story of '' The Magical Food , Belt , and Flute . ''

		The widow 's stupid son
Jack	PERSON	goes to sell a cow to get money for the rent ; he is inveigled into parting with it for an apparent trifle a tiny dish with a bit of food upon it .

		A second cow goes for a belt , and a third one for a flute .

		All are magical , but will not pay the rent , and the mother is in despair .

		Of course the stu - pid boy with his magical treasures gets the rent remitted , seeks his fortune and marries a king 's daughter .

		The most interesting fact in these Micmac stories remains to be stated .

		In many points they show unquestionable and startling resem - blance to old Scandinavian sagas .

		This re - semblance has been well stated and ably dis - cussed by Mr.
Leland	PERSON	, to whose book we must refer for the argument .

		Sometime , somehow , somewhere , a Scandinavian influence deep and profound has come into the life and thought of the olden
Micmacs	LOCATION	; the resemblance is too great and too minute to be of no significance .

		And here , curiously , is a vital matter , so far as the book before us is concerned .

		The late Pro- fessor
Horsford	PERSON	's interest in
Norse	LOCATION	settlement of
New England	LOCATION	is well known .

		Everyone has heard of '' Norumbega '' and Professor Hors - ford 's belief that he had discovered the very site of that '' city of the past . ''

		There is no doubt that it was the Norse strain in these Mic - mac legends which led him to purchase Dr.
Rand	PERSON	's manuscripts and present them to
Welles	LOCATION	- ley College .

		It was his belief that '' traces of the Northmen might be found in these Indian tales , and that the language of the Micmacs might , upon closer study , reveal the impress of the early Norse invaders .

		In this belief he helped toward the publication of the material . ''

		The Legends of the Micmacs '' is the first of the ''
Wellesley	LOCATION	Philological Pub - lications . ''

		It is edited by Miss
Helen L. Web	PERSON	- ster , and is , we hope , only the forerunner of a 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, valuable series of volumes .

		The
Library of American Linguistics of Wellesley College	ORGANIZATION	is rich both in manuscripts and printed material .

		Of Mr.
Rand	PERSON	's manuscripts it possesses nearly all , amounting to more than a score of volumes upon Micmac and
Maliseet	LOCATION	.

		Of his printed works it has a fine series of about fifty num - bers ; of the
Bible	LOCATION	in various Indian languages it has a notable collection ; and Major
Powell	PERSON	's private collection of over a thousand linguistic papers and books is in its keeping * From such a wealth of matter we shall expert to receive important results .

		A second volume is already in preparation ; it will consist of grammatical material from the Micmac language .

		Besides gathering this library and publishing these vol - umes , the college is moving toward instruction in
American Linguistics	ORGANIZATION	and Ethnology .

		A beginning has been made , with a small class , under Miss
Webster	PERSON	.

		Workers in anthropol - ogy everywhere will watch the growth and de - velopment of this promising work with great interest .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		If there are in the English language any more delightful letters than those of
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, we would not at this moment venture to name them .

		Cowper 's , much belauded ;
Shelley	PERSON	's , with their sweetness and dignity ;
Thackeray	PERSON	's , with their boyish exuberance even these seem less attractive when one is per - mitted to enjoy the intimacy of Omar 's translator .

		Lamb 's ?

		but '' comparisons are odorous . ''

		Those who already have the '' Letters and Literary Re - mains '' will none the less welcome the new edition of the '' Letters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and will find a place for them upon the shelf , for divers reasons .

		First of all , they are prettily published in two '' Eversley '' volumes ; second , there are some forty hitherto un - published letters ; third , there is a good index to the whole .

		If these be not sufficient reasons , we know nought of logic .

		The happy reader will of course begin by picking out all the plums -LRB- being the new letters -RRB- if we may apply the metaphor to a pud - ding which is all plums ; he will then read the old letters over again .

		Last of all , he will rejoice -LRB- while impatient of delay -RRB- at the announcement of Mr.
William Aldis Wright	PERSON	, the editor , who promises a wholly new volume to be devoted to the letters written by
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	.

		The new letters contained in the present edition are ad - dressed to a number of people .

		Fully half of them are added to those of which Professor
E. B. Cowell	PERSON	was the fortunate original recipient , and from these are the following selections .

		Writing in
1857	DATE	,
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	says : '' In truth I take old Omar rather more as my property than yours : he and I are more akin , are we not ?

		You see all -LSB- his -RSB- Beauty , but you do n't feel with him in some respects as I do .

		I think you would almost feel obliged to leave out the part of Hamlet in representing him to your Au - dience , for fear of Mischief .

		Now I do not wish to show Hamlet at bis maddest : but mad he must be shown , or he is no Hamlet at all .

		G. de Tassy eluded all that was dangerous , and all that was character - istic .

		I think these free opinions are less danger - ous in an old Mahometan , or an old Roman -LRB- like Lucretius -RRB- , than when they are returned to by those who have lived on happier Food . ''

		Two years later , after telling his friend of a great bereavement , he writes : '' Well , this is so : and there is no more to be said about it .

		It is one of the things that rec - oncile me to my own stupid Decline of Life to the crazy state of the world Well no more about it .

		I sent you poor old Omar , who has his kind of Con - solation for all these Things .

		I doubt you will re - gret you ever introduced him to me .

		... I hardly know why I print any of these things , which no - body buys ; and I scarce now see the few I give them to .

		But when one has done one 's best , and is sure that that best is better than so many will take pains to do , though far from the best that might be done , one likes to make an end of the matter by Print .

		I suppose very few People have taken such Pains in Translation as I have : though certainly not to be literal .

		But at all Cost , a Thing must live : with a transfusion of one 's own worse Life if one can ' t retain the Original 's better .

		Bet - ter a live
Sparrow	ORGANIZATION	than a stuffed Eagle . ''

		The fol - lowing characteristic bit is dated 1863 : '' Oh dear , when I do look into Homer ,

		I took
Dante	ORGANIZATION	by way of slow Digestion : not having looked at him for some years : but I am glad to find I relish him as much as ever : he atones with the Sea ; as you know does the ' Odyssey ' these are the Men . ''

		We note that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has omitted from this edition -LRB- as was proper -RRB- the ref - erence to Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	which gave such offence to her husband , and impelled him to an outburst of temper , which , however great the provocation , must always be regarded as deplorable .

		The only refer - ence to
Browning	PERSON	in the present edition is a new one , dated
1882	DATE	, and with it we end our extracts : ''
Browning	PERSON	told Mrs.

		THE DIAL Language and ^ more valuable contribution to the Linguistic Method pedagogy of a special branch of edu - in the School .

		cation has been made in recent years than the series of '' Lectures on Language and Lin - guistic Method in the School , '' delivered in the Uni - versity of
Cambridge	LOCATION	, by Prof.
S. S. Laurie	PERSON	, of the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	, which first appeared in
1890	DATE	, and a new edition of which has lately been published -LRB- James Thin ,
Edinburgh	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The new edition is improved in several respects .

		The quantity of matter has been increased from 147 pages to 197 pages ; all the lectures have been re - written in part , the matter has been rearranged with a view to make the volume more suitable as a text - book ; and a lecture on the teaching of French has been added , as well as a supplement .

		In no other way can the scope of the book so well be given as to present the heads of lectures . ''

		Lan - guage the Supreme Instrument in Education '' ; '' The Real and Formal in Language '' ; '' Language as a Real Study Conveying Substance of Thought '' -LRB- three lectures -RRB- ; '' Language as a Formal Study '' ; '' Grammar of the Vernacular Tongue '' ; '' Lan - guage as Literature '' ; '' Foreign Tongues , Latin as Type '' ; '' Method ot Teaching Latin '' ; '' Method of Teaching Foreign Languages '' ; `` Language vs. Science in the School . ''

		These lectures are all marked by that clearness of thought and expression , and that completeness and balance of view , which are so char - acteristic of their author .

		The volume opens with this suggestive paragraph : '' Every human being is educated by the experiences of life .

		The experiences begin very early .

		The babe at its mother 's breast is receiving impressions for good or for evil as cer - tainly as a seed , which has just begun to sprout , is already absorbing from the soil what is to make it or mar it as a vigorous plant of its kind .

		There - after , as the child walks non cequis possibles at his mother 's side , the whole world of nature is seeking to form him .

		Earth and sky , the events of his lit - tle life , the words and acts , nay , even the gestures , of those about him , are all busy in the work of his education .

		Unconsciously at first , and thereafter con - sciously , he is organising into himself the vast and infinite material of outer impression and inner feel - ing .

		Every human being undergoes this process of education ; and it is not at all a question whether he is to be educated or not , but simply how and to what end he is to be educated . ''

		A passage on the meaning and influence of the mother-tongue is also well worth quoting : '' Mind grows only in so far as it finds expression for itself ; it can not find it through a foreign tongue .

		It is round the language learned at the mother 's knee that the whole life of feeling , emotion , thought , gathers .

		If it were possible for a child or boy to live in two languages at once equally well , so much the worse for him .

		His intellectual and spiritual growth would not thereby be doubled , but halved .

		Unity of mind and of character would have great difficulty in asserting itself in such cir - cumstances .

		Language , remember , is at best only symbolic of a world of consciousness , and almost Contemporary Thought and Thinkers .

		every word is rich in unexpressed associations of experience which give it its full value for the life of mind .

		Subtleties , and delicacies , and refinements of feeling and perception are , at best , only suggested by the words we use .

		The major part lies deep in our conscious or half-conscious life , and is the source of the tone and colour of language , and of its wide - reaching unexpressed relations .

		Words , accordingly , must be steeped in life to be living ; and as we have not two lives , tut only one , so we can have only one language . ''

		Two volumes of leaders and reviews written for the

Richard Holt Hutton	PERSON	have been collected under the title , '' Criticisms on Con - temporary Thought and Thinkers '' -LRB-

Carlyle	PERSON	's '' Reminiscences , '' Mr.
Les	PERSON	- lie
Stephen	PERSON	's Essays , Mill 's `` Autobiography , ''
Mori	PERSON	- son 's `` The Service of Man , '' Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's `` Types of Ethical Theory , '' and some of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's later poems .

		The papers are all brief , but several are often devoted to the same subject .

		There are groups of four each upon
Carlyle	PERSON	and Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	, of .

		three each upon Mill and Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	, and a group of no less than eight upon Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	's studies of insect life .

		These groups produce something of the effect of extensive essays , and serve to make the book less fragmentary than at first appears .

		It will be seen from the above incomplete enumeration of topics that the papers touch upon a wide range of subjects ; it might almost be said that no move - ment or tendency of the last twenty years , having to do with religious philosophy or the spiritual life , escapes the author 's attention .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's stand - point and the solidity of his culture are well known to thoughtful readers , and to such only do these vol - umes appeal .

		He is a journalist , but his journalism is so dignified as to make the name almost a mis - nomer .

		His position upon philosophical and relig - ious questions and with him the two are almost one is ultra-conservative ; he is entrenched behind a barricade of prejudices , and from their shelter con - ducts a skilfully defensive campaign .

		One must not expect from him anything like sympathetic treat - ment of such men as
Arnold	LOCATION	and Renan , for ex - ample ; the spirit of such men seems almost wholly to escape him .

		But he is always urbane , or nearly always .

		In the case of
Clifford	PERSON	, indeed , his tem - per nearly deserts him , but then
Clifford	PERSON	was exas - perating at times .

		And the author pays for his lapse into something like invective by allowing him - self to be detected in such puerile reasoning as the following : `` If Professor
Clifford	PERSON	's theory were worth anything , consciousness would develope pari passu with the organic development of all forms of matter , and we ought to have as much con - sciousness behind the action of the motor nerves as 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, Teaching Us Principles and Practice , behind the action of the sensitive neives , as much consciousness of the growth of our hair , as of the flush on our cheeks or the music in ofir ears . ''

		We might extract equally childish passages from what is said upon that dangerous subject or free will and moral responsibility .

		We are almost jiempted to say that Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	is too good a writer to be an exact thinker .

		His rhetoric is doubtless of a high char - acter , but his fate is nevertheless that bf far cheaper rhetoricians : he is entangled in the Network of his own verbiage .

		Still , he has a point of view , and those who wish to know what can be isaid from that point of view upon the most serious aspects of mod - ern thought can not do better than read these vol - umes .

		Mr.
Joseph Landon	PERSON	, the author of '' Principles and Practice of Teach - ing '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , tells us in his pre - face that his work is `` the outcome of nearly a quar - ter of a century 's experience as lecturer on school management in a training college , and of a still larger experience as a teacher , as well as of a considerable amount of reading , and of numerous observations and experiments in teaching carried out at various times and in various ways '' ; and the work itself amply confirms this testimony .

		He has produced , not an original or a brilliant book , but a useful one , well thought out , solid , and methodical from cover to cover .

		He adheres to the tradition in including '' principles '' as well as '' practice '' ; but , as he frankly tells us , the book treats the subject '' on the art side rather than on the scientific side , '' so that it may be of as thoroughly practical and useful a character as possible .

		Still , the underlying science he has carefully kept in mind .

		The art of the ex - perienced teacher and of the experienced teacher of teachers is apparent in the minuteness of the discussion , and in the detail with which the analysis is carried out .

		While this minutiae and detail may commend the book to many private readers , it will not conduce to its popularity as a text-book , at least in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Like all the new books of like character , this one emphasizes the study and teaching of English .

		Mr.
Landon	PERSON	pronounces the neglect of the study of the subject in
England	LOCATION	'' aston - ishing '' ; and he fortifies his general argument with this neat quotation : '' That a language should be , as English is , so apt and clear in expression as to com - mend itself to almost universal use , so wide and full in its capacity to voice high thought and deep feeling as to win universal acclaim , and yet should be com - paratively worthless for the training of Us own chil - dren , is a paradox that falls below the dignity of a tolerable joke .

London	LOCATION	.

		The plan of publication is certainly novel .

		The first number made its appearance early in
April	DATE	, and the last will be issued at the end of
1896	DATE	.

		Subscrip - tions are only received for the complete set of twelve parts , payable yearly in advance .

		Only as many sets will be issued as are subscribed for in advance , and subscribers are thus guaranteed against broken sets and depreciation in value .

		The publishers be - lieve that an opportunity has now presented itself to give to those interested a series of papers by writers of authority on various points of book-lore which require special treatment , without being of sufficient importance to be made the subject of sep - arate works .

		A special feature in the magazine will be the admission of articles in French as well as English .

		In Part I. , Mr.
W. Y. Fletcher	PERSON	writes on '' A Copy of Celsus from the Library of Gro - lier '' ; Mr.
Charles I. Elton	PERSON	on `` Christina of Swe - den and her Books '' ;
M. Octave Uzanne	PERSON	on '' La Bibliophile Moderne '' ; Mr.
E. Gordon Duff	PERSON	on '' The Stationers at the Sign of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	'' ; Mr.
Alfred W. Pollard	PERSON	on `` The Books of Hours of Geoffroy Tory '' ; while Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	writes felicitously about '' Names and Notes in Books . ''

		Names are to be preferred to book-plates , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	thinks , and he finds appropriate and inoffensive such pointed notes as that written by Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	on a fly-leaf of
Maule	PERSON	's '' History of the Picts '' : '' Very rare , therefore worth a guinea ; very sense - less , therefore not worth a shilling . ''

		A word must be added in commendation of the decorative ini - tials and tail-pieces specially designed by Mr.
Lau	PERSON	- rence
Housman	PERSON	.

		To the individual collector , the librarian , the professional bibliographer , and the book-lover , if not to the general reader , `` Biblio - graphica '' will not make its appeal in vain .

		`` My
Paris	LOCATION	Note - Book '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- , an aftermath of memories by that amusing quidnunc who set us all guessing some months ago with his '' An En - glishman in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' should find favor with lovers of light literature .

		Like its predecessor , the book is a racy medley of stories and pen-pictures of nota - ble people
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	,
Renan	LOCATION	,
Thiers	PERSON	,
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	, GreVy ,
Simon	PERSON	, de Kock , MM .

		Erckmann - Chatrian , de Musset , etc. .

		From the mass of quo - table matter we select one extract a caustic news - paper hit at Thiers : `` The Minister of the Interior is no doubt the man who in a given time can ' spout ' the greatest number of words and ' squirt ' the largest number of verbal blue-bottles upon the air .

		He is , moreover , the man who can talk for the longest period without taking ti'ouble to think .

		As a rule , one idea is all-sufficient for him ; one idea , and a tumbler of water with a lump of sugar in it .

		With these ,
M. Thiers	PERSON	will go on prating for twenty - four hours at a stretch , like the skilful wire-drawer who from an ounce of metal will produce twenty - four leagues of wire . ''

		The book is a capital one for dog-day reading , and contains a good many odds and ends of curious information withal .

		THE DIAL 19 BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Mark Samuel	PERSON	, of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, publishes `` The Amateur Aquarist '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a lit - tle book of instructions on the subject of aquaria .

		The preface , commendably brief , is as follows : `` A collec - tion of simply-expressed suggestions to amateur aquar - ists is all this book claims to be .

		Its descriptions are terse , tried , and true . ''

		The book gives full and exact information about the collection of fresh-water fishes and plants , and tells how they are to be kept alive and in good health .

		It is simply written and well illustrated .

		What is described as a '' first series '' of '' Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights '' comes to us with the imprints of
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	and Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The text is selected from
Galland	LOCATION	, and edited virginibus puerisque by
Miss E. Dixon	PERSON	, of
Girton College	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are fifteen tales in this volume , among them be - ing the seven voyages of Sindbad , whose name is un - accountably printed '' Sinbad . ''

		The illustrations of the book , by Mr.
J. D. Batten	PERSON	, are its most striking feature , and are very artistic , particularly the five full-page plates .

		We hope that there will be as many more se - ries of this work as there are '' Nights '' to fill them .

		Among books for the young not one in a hundred de - serves such hearty commendation as this .

		We quote the preface of Mr.
T. M. Clark	PERSON	's '' Build - ing Superintendence '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as the best descrip - tion of a work of value so approved that it has now reached its twelfth edition . ''

		This is not a treatise on the architectural art , or the science of construction , but a simple exposition of the ordinary practice of building in this country , with suggestions for supervising such work efficiently .

		Architects of experience probably know already nearly everything that the book contains , but their younger brethren , as well as those persons not of the profession who are occasionally called upon to di - rect building operations , will perhaps be glad of its help . ''

		Mr.
Frederick Jones Bliss	PERSON	, in '' A Mound of Many Cities '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , describes the excavations carried on from
1890	DATE	to
1893	DATE	by officers of the Palestine Ex - ploration Fund at
Tell el Hesy	ORGANIZATION	, a mound situated in
Judsea	LOCATION	, between
Hebron	LOCATION	and
Gaza	LOCATION	.

		The Tell in ques - tion was about sixty feet high , and was found to con - tain the ruins of no less than eight cities , in superim - posed strata .

		The conjectural chronology of these cities , fairly well supported by the evidence , ranges from about
1700	DATE	B.C. to 400
B.C.	LOCATION	.

		The book is extra - ordinarily interesting ; hardly less so to the general reader than to the archaeologist and historian .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
June 25 , 1894	DATE	.

		The death of
Howard Seely	PERSON	by his own hand at the home of his parents in
Brooklyn	LOCATION
last Friday	DATE
night	TIME	was a severe shock to his many friends among the younger men of letters in this city .

		Only a few of them knew that he was subject to recurrent attacks of insanity , especially in the early
summer	DATE	of each year .

		At other times he preserved a cheerful interested manner which endeared him to all who knew him .


Edward Howard Seely , Jr.	PERSON	, to give his full name , was a member of the Class of
1878	DATE	at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, where he distinguished himself in literary work , becoming one of the editors of the `` Yale Literary Magazine . ''

		Two years later he grad - uated at the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	law school , but overstudy brought on attacks of nervous prostration and he was obliged to abandon his profession .

		He then travelled in
Texas	LOCATION	and through the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, and thus gained the mate - rial which he made use of in his stories , which some - what resemble in scope and character those of Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Seely	PERSON	's first volume , '' A Lone Star Bo-peep , and Other Tales of Texan Ranch Life , '' was published in
1885	DATE	, and has been followed by '' A
Ranch	PERSON	- man 's Stories , '' '' A Nymph of the West , '' `` The Jonah of Lucky Valley , ' 1 and one or two others .

		He was a mem - ber of the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	, and for sometime held an as - sistant-editorship on the newly-revived ''
Peterson	PERSON	's Mag - azine , '' for which he wrote quite freely .

		`` The Publisher 's Weekly '' prints a report of the proceedings in the German Reichstag in relation to the Copyright treaty with this country , referred to in my letter of
May 1	DATE	.

		In reply to the petition to annul the treaty on account of the unfairness of the Copyright Act to Germans , the
Royal Commissioner	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Leh	PERSON	- mann , '' advised strongly against annulling the treaty , as by so doing the branches now fully protected -LRB- music , art works , maps , etc. -RRB- would again fall into the hands of ruthless plunderers without anything being gained for authors or publishers of books .

		He hoped that lit - tle by little the terms of contract could be modified , and felt sure that Americans themselves would realize more and more the weaknesses of the Copyright Act , for which so many had made so brave a struggle , sub - mitting to the restriction of the unsatisfactory clause only because without it the whole Copyright question would again have dropped for years .

		After a short de - bate , in which all the speakers showed a remarkably full knowledge of the situation , it was decided to refer the proceedings and further action to the Reichskanzler . ''

		This would indicate a conciliatory attitude on the part of the German government , and that little is to be feared from the recent aggressiveness of German publishers .

		The '' Overheard in Arcady '' of Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, so warmly praised by your reviewer , has reached a sec - ond edition , of which the
Messrs. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of Lon - don will be the English publishers .

		The American pub - lishers of this book , Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , are to bring out in book form the lectures recently de - livered at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
James A. Froude	PERSON	on the Life and Writings of
Erasmus	LOCATION	.

		This firm will also publish in
America	LOCATION	Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's translations of the odes of
Horace	PERSON	.

		It is interesting to learn that Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	, who was the resident commissioner in
France	LOCATION	of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, has been invited to prepare the European chapter for the official history of the Fair to be published by the Federal government .

		Among the contributors to this chapter will be the Hon.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	, American minister to
Russia	LOCATION	, and Col.

		Some of the friends and admirers of Walt Whitman who have for some time met annually at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	on the occasion of his birthday , inaugurated at their last meeting ,
May 31	DATE	, a Walt Whitman Fellowship , which is intended to be international in character .

		The purpose of the association is not entirely literary , but for human advancement according to
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's ideas .

		When the founder of the house
Daniel Ap	PERSON	- pleton came to
New York	LOCATION	from

		The book business was in charge of his oldest son ,
Willianj Henry Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton , the present head of the firm , who has well earned his title as the Nestor of American publishers , occupy - ing as he does in this country a place !

		similar to that held by the late
John Murray	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	.

		After a short stay in
Exchange Place	ORGANIZATION	,
Daniel Appleton	PERSON	removed to
Clinton Hall	PERSON	, Beekman street , and devoted himself entirely to the importation and sale of books .

		In 1835
William H. Appleton	PERSON	was sent to
Loidon	LOCATION	, where he founded an agency .

		The first publishing venture of the firm was a little 32mo book called '' Daily Crumbs from the Master 's Table , '' issued in
1831	DATE	.

		In
January , 1838	DATE	,
William H. Appleton	PERSON	was taken into partnership , and the firm removed to 200 Broadway .

		In 1848
Daniel Appleton	PERSON	retired , and
W. H. Appleton	PERSON	formed a part - nership with his brother ,
John Adams Appleton	PERSON	.

		Three other sons subsequently became partners
Daniel Sid	PERSON	- ney ,
George Swett	PERSON	, and
Samuel Francis	PERSON	.

		The business was removed from 200 Broadway to the old Society Library building at Broadway and Leonard street .

		The next removal of the firm was to 443-5 Broadway .

		Later a building was erected at 94 Grand street , corner of
Green	ORGANIZATION	, and occupied for some years until a change was made to 549-51 Broadway .

		About
1880	DATE	Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	removed to 1 , 3 , and 5 Bond street .

		And all those piles of wood ? '

		The man assented again , thinking the purchaser undecided .

		` And that , is it coke ?

		PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN
TURKEY	LOCATION	.

		The Turkish papers are publishing some statistics to illustrate the great progress of public instruction in
Turkey	LOCATION	under the present Sultan .

		Since his accession the increase in the number of schools is estimated at 25,000 , said to be attended by a million and a quarter scholars of both sexes .

		It is difficult to ascertain what the number formerly was , but there is no doubt the in - crease is great .

		This is largely due to the measures taken by the late Sultans , Abd ul Mejid and
Abd ul Aziz	PERSON	, in laying the foundation of a
Ministry of Instruc	ORGANIZATION	- tion , which of late years have been bearing fruit .

		The progress is also greatly due to the successful working of the reform of the administration of pious or eccles - iastical foundations .

		CHARLES
HENRY PEARSON	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Charles Henry Pearson	PERSON	, the author of '' National Life and Character , '' died on the
29th of May	DATE	.

		He was born in
1830	DATE	, became a fellow of
Oriel College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, in
1854	DATE	, and held this place until
1872	DATE	, when he married , and emigrated to
Australia	LOCATION	.

		In
1892	DATE	he returned to
England	LOCATION	.

		He was the author of numerous historical works , and took high rank as an educator .

		One of his friends writes of him in these terms : `` He was a most indefatigable worker his whole life long .

		He had a most marvellous memory , and a most rapid power of generalization from the long array of facts and precedents which marshalled themselves spontan - eously before his mind when called upon to pronounce judgment .

		He was a profound classical scholar , but his knowledge of modern literature , English as well as
Continental	ORGANIZATION	, was equally remarkable .

		He was acquainted with most of the modern European languages , and en - joyed
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Gogol	PERSON	in the original no less than
Vic	PERSON	- tor Hugo and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a newspaper writer he dis - tinguished himself by the possession of a most earnest and trenchant style , which he was able at will to vary with the most racy banter .

		His conversation was always striking and fascinating .

		His manner seemed at first sight somewhat cold , but his unruffled exterior concealed the warmest and truest of hearts .

		He especially de - lighted in the society of the young , and he would spare no pains to put an earnest student on the right track .

		As a politician , he was feared by his political opponents on account of his knowledge and intellectual power ; he inspired absolute trust and confidence in his own party .

		He was regarded by both sides as absolutely incorrupt - ible . ''

		THE FINAL HONOR SCHOOL OF ENGLISH AT
OXFORD	LOCATION	.

		We are indebted to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' for the following paragraph : Liberality and progress have made two great strides in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		A last attack upon the establishment of the eighth final school , the '' Final Honour School of English Language and Literature , '' was defeated in congregation on
May 1	DATE	, when the form of statute establishing the new school was promulgated , and its preamble was finally adopted by 120 placets against 46 non-placets .

		The details of this statute are now open to amendment , but the establishment of the school is assured .

		The preamble adopted runs as fol - lows : '' Whereas it is expedient to establish a
Final Honour School of English Language	ORGANIZATION	and Literature , the
University	ORGANIZATION	enacts as follows . ''

		This school must include authors '' belonging to the different periods of English literature , '' and '' the history of the English language and the history of English literature . ''

		Spe - cial subjects '' falling within or usually studied in con - nection with the English language and literature '' are also provided for .

		Candidates must have studied their authors '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- with reference to the forms of the lan - guage , -LRB- 2 -RRB- as examples of literature , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- in their relation to the history and thought of the period to which they belong . ''

		The study of Anglo-Saxon , and of the relation of English to '' the languages with which it is etymologically connected , '' and of the history of English literature , is made the centre of the whole school , and a board of at least twenty examiners is provided for .

		Their duty shall be '' to see that , as far as possi - ble , equal weight is given to language and literature '' in the conduct of the examination , '' provided always that candidates who offer special subjects shall be at liberty to choose subjects connected either with lan - guage or with literature or with both .

		46 ENGLISH IN A FRENCH UNIVERSITY .

		The proceedings of the International Con - gress of Education , held in
Chicago	LOCATION	last sum - mer , have just been published in a carefully - edited volume of a thousand pages .

		The work is an almost inexhaustible storehouse of inform - ation and comment upon most subjects of cur - rent educational interest , and ought to prove helpful and stimulating in the highest degree to the thousands of teachers into whose hands it will come .

		One department in particular , that devoted to the subject of Higher
Educa	PERSON	- tion , is noteworthy for the breadth and schol - arly character of the papers and discussions included .

		There are addresses by Presidents
Gilman	PERSON	,
Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	,
Raymond	PERSON	, Low ,
Angell	PERSON	, Jor - dan , and
Keane	PERSON	, by Professors
Hale	PERSON	,
Shorey	PERSON	,
West	LOCATION	,
Wilson	PERSON	, and
Sproull	PERSON	.

		Upon some of these addresses we commented at the time of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and are glad to see that perma - nent form has now been given them .

		But our special purpose just now is to direct attention to the paper on '' The Study of English Liter - ature in French Universities , '' prepared for the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	of the
Lille Fac	ORGANIZATION	- ulte des Lettres , but , owing to some misunder - standing , not read , and now made public for the first time .

		Few who have not made a special investiga - tion of the subject have any idea of the im - mense achievement of the Third French Repub - lic in the reorganization of public instruction .

		To the thinking mind , the work done in this direction is greater and more significant than the work of political or of military or of social reorganization .

		But it is not of a nature to attract public attention , and is practically un - known outside of
France	LOCATION	.

		M. Chevrillon gives us an amusing illustration of the attitude of the foreigner in this matter : '' I remember , a few years ago , reading an article in the great English Philistine paper < The Daily
Tele	ORGANIZATION	- graph ' in wl ich it was said that the great majority of French people thought that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was a lieu - tenant of
Wellington	LOCATION	, who had helped him to win the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Now , this was unfortunate , as not less than four plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had just been per - formed in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		But the prejudice tinder which the writer in ' The Daily Telegraph ' was laboring is per - fectly natural , when we notice that a nation never knows what its neighbor is , but what it was twenty years ago . ''

		This closing statement is only too true when applied to knowledge of any other than the spectacular aspect of life in a neighboring coun - try , and it is peculiarly true of so unobtrusive a thing as education .

		A quarter of a century ago , when the French nation had sunk to its lowest level in the degration of a sham impe - rialism , when the frenzied populace was shout - ing '' a
Berlin	LOCATION	! ''

		and thought the Prussian capital really lay just across the
Rhine	LOCATION	, the stricture of the English journalist might have been taken as approximately true ; to-day , how - ever seriously meant , it becomes the merest jest .

		Turning now to the specific subject of
M. Chevrillon	ORGANIZATION	's article , we will first reproduce his account of the educational position of English in the sixties . ''

		Twenty or thirty years ago , French boys and stu - dents wrote better Latin verse than they do now , but of English literature they knew nothing , except the 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, names of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Byron	PERSON	.

		Our great arch-critic ,
M. Sarcey	PERSON	, says that they made fun of Taine at the
Ecole Normale	ORGANIZATION	because he was reading English .

		Foreign literatures were , indeed , supposed to be taught ; but any man who had graduated in classics , whether he knew English or not , was supposed to be good enough for that kind of work .

		When he left the
Ecole Nor	ORGANIZATION	- male , after a course of studies in
Plato	LOCATION	and
Aristotle	LOCATION	, he would receive notice that he was appointed professor of foreign literatures , and had to begin work at once .

		One of these , I believe , it was who was complaining of the difficulties of .

		his task . '

		What a language , ' he said , ' English is to pronounce !

		They write
Boz	PERSON	and they pronounce
Dickens	PERSON	. '

		M.
Ernest Lavisse	PERSON	, who has seen this generation of professors of English literature , was telling me , the other day , the following authentic and typical fact : When he was a student at
Nancy	PERSON	, at the faculty of letters he heard a lecture on the literature of
England	LOCATION	in the sixteenth century .

		After three-quarters of an hour the professor had exhausted his subject , but his time was not up . '

		Gentlemen , ' he said , pulling out his watch , ' we have a quarter of an hour yet .

		We have time to do Shakespeare . ' ''

		Let us contrast the state of affairs thus hinted at with the present requirements for a student of English .

		After leaving the lycee , he regis - ters with one of the faculties , and begins to specialize .

		The licence and the agregation are the two stages of the work now before him .

		The lycee has given him the baccalaureate de - gree ; the licence -LRB- which means two years ' work -RRB- may be taken as fairly equivalent to the degree of master ; and the agregation -LRB- which means two years or more of further work -RRB- as stand - ing for the German or American doctorate .

		The work of the licence candidate is thus de - scribed : '' Side by side with the classics , he may take up En - glish or German literature , philosophy , history , or clas - sical philology .

		Every candidate for the licence has to write a French essay on French literature , a Latin es - say on Latin literature .

		Then , according to the spe - cialty he has selected , he writes papers on historical or philosophical subjects , or translations from French into English or German , or from English or German into French .

		The viva voce examination consists , for all can - didates , in questions on French ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and Greek liter - ature , and extempore translations from the classics ; and for those of the candidates who make English a special subject , in questions on English literature , and transla - tions into English and French of the French and En - glish authors on the programme . ''

		The first of the two years required for the licence , the student works at the university . ''

		During this first year , the chief purpose of the En - glish professor is not so much to acquaint him with the whole field of English literature as to give him an insight into the spirit , the genius , of English literature , and to make him feel the artistic element in the great writers .

		A French youth , fresh from his Tacitus , his
Racine	LOCATION	, and his Voltaire , can not , unless he has great natural talent , understand , or rather , feel at once
Carlyle	PERSON	or
Tennyson	LOCATION	, whis is done through minute translations , the aim of Thich is not to acquaint the student with new words or new constructions , but to teach him how to find those French forms that will best express something of the beauty peculiar to the original English text .

		The ten - dency is thus to develop the artistic sense in the stu - dent , and to give him a mastery of his own language .

		At the last examination for the licence , at
Lille	LOCATION	, the En - glish translation being
Milton	PERSON	's ' II Penseroso , ' several candidates were dropped who had understood every word and the literal meaning of the text , but it was clear from their translations that they had not felt the spirit of
Milton	PERSON	's poem , or had failed to express it . ''

		The second year of preparation for the li - cence is spent in absentia , the students being - sent to
England	LOCATION	for twelve months .

		`` They remain correspondents of the university ; that is to say , they have to send papers to the professors of French , Greek , and Latin , thus preparing themselves for those general parts of the licence which are demanded of all candidates to the degree .

		With the English pro- fessor they of course correspond also , and the main thing that he requires them to do is to steep themselves in English life to go to the theatres , sermons , public meetings , to see English university life , to make English friends , to think in English , to assume English forms of habit and prejudices in short , for one year to throw off the Frenchman , to make themselves Englishmen , and to step out of the natural limits of the national mind and sensibility .

		After this experience , when they come back to
France	LOCATION	and settle into the old man again , they have become able to look at English writers from the English point of view . ''

		The work of this Wander jahr is perhaps the most admirable feature of the French system .

		The force with which such men as
Montes	PERSON	- quieu and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	brought English ideals to bear upon French thought was the consequence of the protracted visits of these men to En - gland , and much may be expected , in the way of a sympathetic comprehension of English thought , from this yearly sending of picked men from the French faculties to
England	LOCATION	, for the purpose of studying English life and liter - ature upon their own soil .

		The work of the agregation is essentially the work of preparation for a professorship in a government lycee .

		Since the number of candi - dates is much greater than the number of places to be filled , competition becomes keen and the tests applied are very severe .

		A new list of authors and works is prepared each year , and every candidate for the agregation has fitted himself for examination on two or more of these lists .

		A specimen programme offered by
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	begins with ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	'' and ends with ''
Richard Feverel	PERSON	. ''

		It includes works of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Greene	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, Lan - dor , and
Tennyson	PERSON	. ''

		By their fruits ye shall know them . ''

		The fruits of this system are found in such works ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 now rapidly multiplying , as
M. Angelier	PERSON	's vol - ume of twelve hundred pages on the work , life , and surroundings of
Robert Burns	PERSON	,
M. Bel	PERSON	- jame 's work on English men of letters and their public in the eighteenth century , and M. Jus - serand 's book on English wayfaring life in the eighteenth century .

		M. Chevrillon claims for the study of English that it opens for French students 4t a vast field of interesting , often passionating , artistic literature , instinct with the loftiest ideals , with the deep - est human sympathy ; full of pathos , of feeling , of life ; full of the sense of the good , of the righteous , of reli - gious earnestness , as ours is full with the sense of the true and of the beautiful one of the most powerful to instill into a young mind the germs that will develop upwards ... The modern novels of
England	LOCATION	, the pure , idealistic utterances of a
Carlyle	LOCATION	, of a
Tennyson	LOCATION	, of an
Emerson	LOCATION	, are among the greatest means of education of the present time .

		Of course , the first thing for a Frenchman for every man is to remain in contact with his own race ; to read those writers of the past that have moulded the soul and mind of his own nation , and those writers of the present that discuss the pro- blems which the people of his own blood have to solve in order to live on and to transmit to their posterity the national inheritance .

		But when he has done that , let him turn to those foreign books in which he finds an ideal , a philosophy , an aesthetics views of life widely different from those which prevail in the French books of his own time .

		The national ideal will then ease to appear to him as a central one toward which the whole universe ought to be moved .

		On that day when he becomes able to enjoy a novel of Eliot as well as a novel of Flaubert nay , on that day when he en - joys the very difference between the two types of novel let him be a business man or a bourgeois , he is a man of broader culture , in the true sense of the word , than the scholar who devotes his life to the study of the da - tive case . ''

		It is the spirit of
M. Chevrillon	ORGANIZATION	's paper , even more than the matter , that makes it note - worthy , and it may not be amiss to wish that a little more of this spirit were infused into the English instruction given at our own univer - sities .

		For the year 1894-5 the de - partment offers thirty-one courses .

		Of these , twenty - four , covering seventy-five hours of work -LRB- slightly more than three hours a week each for half the year -RRB- , are designed for undergraduates , and seven -LRB- of two hours a week each -RRB- for graduates .

		There are in the univer - sity
1369	DATE	students , of whom 820 , attending the Acad - emic and Technical Colleges in
Berkeley	LOCATION	, fall to a greater or less extent within the jurisdiction of the English department .

		Last year , including the class of 317 Freshmen , there were , during the first term , sixty per cent of the students in
Berkeley	LOCATION	in the En - glish classes ; during the year there were about seventy per cent .

		The total enrollment of students in English courses during the first term was 873 , of whom 397 , or forty-eight per cent of the students in
Berkeley	LOCATION	, were taking more than one course in English .

		In the .

		consideration of
University	ORGANIZATION	work in any line , four things must be taken into account : the specific pre - paration with which students enter , the equipment and administration of the department in question , the organ - ization of studies , and the methods of instruction and investigation .

		In the matter of entrance requirements in English the
University	ORGANIZATION	has adopted an increasingly high stand - ard .

		It calls for a
High School	ORGANIZATION	course of at least three years , at the rate of five hours a week ; and it ad - vocates , and from some schools secures , a four years ' course .

		These requirements can scarcely be described , as in the fourth article of this series , as similar to those of the
New England Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The requirements of that
Association	ORGANIZATION	, so far as they go , are similar to those of
California	LOCATION	; but they do not go more than two-thirds of the way in extent or in stringency .

		There is noth - ing , to my knowledge , in the English requirements of other universities that is equivalent to our course in
Greek	LOCATION	,
Norse	ORGANIZATION	, and German mythology as illustrated by English literature -LRB- required of all applicants for admis - sion -RRB- , or to the course in Arguments and Orations -LRB- hitherto , three of
Burke	PERSON	's -RRB- or to the course in English poetry which covers some twenty-five of the longer mas - terpieces .

		These are additional to the usual requirements in essay , drama , and narrative .

		While this preparatory work in literature is generally well done , the work in rhetoric and composition is not yet up to the mark .

		Our system of examining and accrediting schools is , however , so strict , and the supervision of English teach - ing in the schools so minute , that we look for decided improvement , within a reasonable period , in the matter of composition .

		The department does not content itself with requiring a satisfactory test-composition of stu - dents at matriculation ; for , although that would be an easy way of shifting the burden from the
University	ORGANIZATION	to the schools , it is but a poor substitute for the pedagog - ical assistance due to the schools .

		With the annual ap - plication for accrediting in English , each school is re - quired to send for inspection samples of compositions and other exercises written by pupils of all classes .

		30 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, the professors of English , who carefully scrutinizes the work of teachers and pupils .

		The department is con - servative in accrediting ; and English is generally con - sidered to be the most difficult study in the curriculum of the schools of
California	LOCATION	.

		Non-accredited pupils are , of course , subjected to the usual entrance examination in literature , rhetoric , and composition .

		In addition to this labor .

		of supervision , the professors of English have recently published for the guidance of teachers a pam - phlet entitled '' English in the Secondary Schools , '' out - lining the preparatory course , indicating the proper se - quence of studies , and suggesting methods of instruc - tion .

		* With regard to the equipment and administration of the department , while the divisions of rhetoric , lin - guistics , and literature and criticism are severally rep - resented by Professor
Bradley	PERSON	, Professor
Lange	PERSON	, and myself , and while each of the instructors is held re - sponsible for a certain subject and certain sections of students , it is the policy of the department to observe a reasonable Lehrfreiheit .

		This it accomplishes , first , by maintaining a conservative rotation -LRB- say , once in three years -RRB- of the teachers in charge of courses in - volving drill and routine ; and , secondly , by encourag - ing each teacher of preliminary courses , when once he has his prescribed work well in hand , to offer at least one elective higher course .

		Accordingly , of our instruc - tors , Mr.
Armes	PERSON	offers the courses in the History of the Drama , and in
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	Poets ; Mr.
Syle	PERSON	in Literature of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
San	PERSON	- ford in
Spenser	LOCATION	, and in the Romantic movement .

		That the same man should teach the elements of style , or of literary history , or should correct themes , year in and year out , is , even though texts and methods be varied , pedagogical suicide .

		The plan here described does much to counteract the insensibility , or disgust , that frequently attends prolonged indulgence in the habit of theme-correcting .

		We find also that the occasional conduct of preliminary courses acts as a tonic upon teachers habituated to higher , and graduate , courses .

		While in all cases the specialty is still pursued , the field of information is widened , methods are liberalized , and the zest of teaching is enhanced by the adoption of the principle of Lehrfreiheit .

		The administration of the department is republican .

		Each instructor is independent within his sphere of ac - tivity .

		When , as in the matter of texts or methods , concerted action is necessary , the decision is made by the instructors concerned , subject to the approval of the head of the department .

		The advisability of new courses , the scope and form of the annual announcement , and matters of general departmental policy , are discussed at the appropriate monthly meeting of the English fac - ulty .

		Ordinarily , and primarily , however , the depart - ment meets as a
Critical Thought Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purpose of the club is to keep abreast of recent contributions to comparative literature , philology , aesthetics , and educa - tional theory .

		The field of reading is apportioned among the members , and informal reports are had on books and articles bearing in any way upon the study of English .

		The organization of studies in a department is per - haps a surer index of the purpose of instruction than any carefully formulated statement of aims .

		glish courses are classified as Preliminary and Higher .

		The Preliminary Courses , whether prescribed or elect - ive , are prerequisite to all advanced work .

		They at - tempt to furnish -LRB- 1 -RRB- the principles of style and the prac - tice of written and oral composition ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the common - places of literary tradition ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a synoptic view of English literature by the study of the principal authors .

		The Higher Courses are subdivided in the usual way , as primarily for juniors and seniors , and primarily for graduates .

		The Preliminary Courses are announced as
Types of English Prose Style	ORGANIZATION	, Supplementary Reading , Practical Rhetoric , English Masterpieces ,
General History of En	ORGANIZATION	- glish Literature , and Argumentation .

		The first is re - quired , at the rate of four hours a week through the year , of all freshmen in the academic colleges ; the sec - ond -LRB- one hour any two consecutive terms -RRB- of non-clas - sical students in these colleges .

		The third and the fourth are prescribed in the
Colleges of Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	and Agri - culture .

		All other English courses are elective ; and in the Engineering Colleges English is altogether elective .

		Of prescribed preliminary courses , that in English Prose Style aims to acquaint the student , at first hand , with the features and elements of effective workmanship in prose-writing , and to train him to discern the salient qualities of any well-marked prose style presented for his consideration .

		The course is based upon the direct study of selected groups of authors .

Supplementary Reading	ORGANIZATION	extends , as far as time will per - mit , the acquaintance of the student with the
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	, Teutonic , or Romance Epics , or other classics in trans - lation .

		It serves as an introduction to the common and traditional store of literary reference , allusion , and im - agery , and as a basis for paragraph-writing .

		This year translations of the Iliad , the Odyssey , and the
Beowulf	LOCATION	, and
Morris	PERSON	's Sigurd the Volsung , have been studied .

		These courses , and the course in Practical Rhetoric for scientific students , in general serve to stimulate con - structive effort and practical skill in writing pari passu with analytical effort and the acquisition of information .

		They accordingly include first the weekly exercise in paragraph-writing , written in the class-room upon some topic not previously announced but involving acquaint - ance with the Supplementary Reading assigned for the week ; and , secondly , a carefully supervised series of com - positions .

		Three themes have been required each term .

		The supervision , which is personal , extends to methods of using the Library , of securing material and of taking notes in scholarly fashion , to limitation and definition of subject ; to construction of a scheme of presentation in advance of the writing , as well as to careful criticism of the finished work .

		The organization and develop - ment of these courses is in large measure due to the exertions of Professor
Bradley	PERSON	, to whom I am indebted for the details of this description .

		It should be added that essays are required in connection with all work in the English department .

		The course in English Mas - terpieces for scientific students , given by Mr.
Armes	PERSON	, involves the careful reading in class of representative poems and essays of the foremost writers , and supple - mentary reading out of class .

		Of elective preliminary courses , that in the
General History	ORGANIZATION	of English Litera - ture is the sine qua non for all higher work .

		It presents a synoptical view of English literature as the outcome of , and the index to , English thought in the course of its development .

		It is accordingly based upon a text - book of English history , and the copious reading of au - thors illustrative of social and literary movements .

		THE DIAL 31 runs as a three-hour course throughout the Sophomore year , and involves the reading by each student , and the discussion in class , of some thirty masterpieces .

		The course entitled Argumentation comprises the analysis of masterpieces , the preparation of briefs , and the de - livery of arguments exemplifying the use of the syllo - gism and the exposure of fallacies .

		It must be preceded by a course in formal logic , and is introductory to a course in Forensics .

		The Higher Courses for undergraduates are grouped as -LRB- 1 -RRB- Rhetoric and the Theory of Criticism : four courses ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Linguistics : four courses , including , be - side grammar , history , and criticism , the comparative study of the Germanic sources of English culture , and Germanic philology ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- The Historical and Critical Study of Literature : eleven courses in chronological sequence , by -LRB- a -RRB- periods , -LRB- b -RRB- authors , -LRB- c -RRB- literary move - ments , -LRB- d -RRB- the evolution of types .

		The first of these groups is essential to the other two .

		It involves the differentiation , for advanced work , of rhetoric into its species -LRB- Exposition , including methods of literary re - search and interpretation ; Forensics ,
Narration	ORGANIZATION	, etc. -RRB- , and an introduction to the comparative and aesthetic methods .

		A course in Poetics outlines the theory of art , the theory and development of literature , the rela - tions of poetry and prose , the principles of versification , and the canons , inductive and deductive , of dramatic criticism .

		It is usually accompanied by lectures on the .

		.

		Esthetics of Literature .

		This course is followed by the Problems of Literary Criticism : a comparative inquiry into the growth , technique , and function of literary types other than the drama .

		The attempt is made to arrive by induction at the characteristics common to the na - tional varieties of a type , and to formulate these in the light of aesthetic theory .

		The resulting laws are ap - plied as canons of criticism to English masterpieces of that type .

		The method has been described by a former student in the `` Century Magazine , ''
Jan. , 1891	DATE	.

		The reading and discussions are guided by questions , sug - gestions , and reference lists part of a manual of Lit - erary Theories now in press .

		For lack of space the courses in Linguistics and Literature can not be enum - erated .

		Students making English their principal study must include in their elections Exposition or Linguistics ,
Poetics	ORGANIZATION	, Criticism , and the intensive study of at least one literary master or one literary type .

		For the teach - er 's certificate Linguistics is indispensable .

		The courses primarily for Graduates have a two-fold aim : First , to impart information ; secondly , and prin - cipally , to encourage original research .

		This differen - tiation by purpose is necessarily relative .

		Under the former heading , however , falls one of the philological courses , Old Icelandic -LRB-
Lange	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Under the latter falls another philological course , First Modern English -LRB- an investigation into the orthographic , phonetic , and syn - tactical changes of Sixteenth Century English -LRB-
Lange	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and various literary courses which may be classified as aesthetic , comparative , and critical .

		The course in the
History of ^ Esthetic Theory	ORGANIZATION	, which , by the courtesy of the professor of philosophy , is at present in my hands , is a study at first hand of the principal authorities in esthetics , and of the literary art that chiefly influenced them .

		The course may be said to deal with fundamen - tal literary forces .

		It is given both terms and extends through three years .

		This year
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and Aristotle were studied and Plotinus begun .

		Next year we shall at - tempt to come down to
Winckelmann	PERSON	.

		The year after we shall begin with
Kant	PERSON	.

		The courses which I have called comparative deal with literary movements .

		They are two in number : The Mediaeval Spirit as related to Art , its chief exponents in English literature and its modern revivals -LRB-
Bradley	LOCATION	-RRB- ; and The Influence of Ger - many on English literature of the eighteenth and nine - teenth centuries -LRB-
Lange	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A purely critical course , deal - ing with literary methods , is offered by Professor
Brad	PERSON	- ley , in the study of the entire production of some author of limited scope .

		To graduate courses of information and of research might legitimately be added courses having a third pur - pose : the encouragement of literary creation .

		We have as yet none such in the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, unless one denominated
Special Study	ORGANIZATION	, under which we an - nounce ourselves ready to assist and advise compe - tent graduates in approved plans of work , may be con - strued as sufficient for the emergency .

		Academic schol - arship does not look with favor upon the attempt to stimulate or foster creative production .

		But , if char - ily advised , sagaciously circumscribed , and conducted under the personal supervision of a competent critic , constructive literary effort may surely find a place in the curriculum of an exceptional graduate , never , of course , unattended by other study with informative or disciplinary purpose in view .

		There is , nowadays , no reason why genius should be untutored or its early pro- ductions unkempt .

		With regard to methods of instruction no stereotyped habit obtains .

		In our lower classes the text-book is not always used .

		When used it is treated as a guide , not as a bible .

		In both lower and higher classes , recitations , reports on reading , discussion of topics , informal or for - mal lectures , interpretative reading , and personal con - ference prevail , in such combination or with such pref - erence as the instructor may deem wise .

		Students , however , are always put to work on the masterpieces themselves .

		With regard to methods of investigation , we believe that a certain catholicity of attitude not inconsistent with alertness should be observed .

		The present an - archy , sometimes tyranny , of method is due generally to a deficient organization of studies ; and that , in turn , to an incomprehensive view of the field .

		Hence , the uncertainty of aim with which instruction in English is .

		frequently reproached .

		This lack of system is , how - ever , indicative only of the fact that literary science is .

		in a transitional stage : no longer static , not yet organic , , but dynamic .

		The study of literature in the sentimen - tal , the formally stylistic , or the second-hand-historical fashion , is out of date .

		Scholars in philology narrowed to linguistics have set the new pace by making of their branch a dynamic study : a study of sources , causes , relations , movements , and effects .

		Professors of liter - ature and criticism are now , as rapidly as may be , adapt - ing dynamic methods , whether historical or asthetic , to their lines of research .

		But each is naturally liable to urge the method that he favors or thinks that he has invented .

		One , therefore , advocates ethical and reli - gious exegesis , another sesthetic interpretation , another - comparative inquiry , another the historical study of style .

		This is to be expected ; and the dynamic , or spo - radic , stage of literary science can not be terminated until , by elimination , attrition , and adjustment of results , we are ready to substitute something organic .

		Hospitality to ideas and conservative liberality of method will hasten the advent of systematic investigation .

		Even now there are those who study the masterpiece , not only in genetic relation to author and type , but also in organic relation / 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	to the social and artistic movements of which author and type are integral factors .

		The sum of the methods of any literary inquiry in any college course should be exhaustive so far as circumstances permit .

		The exi - gencies of time , training , and material are , however , such that due regard , in turn , for Historical Criticism -LRB- linguistic , textual , genetic -RRB- , Technical Criticism -LRB- dis - tinctive of the type : its evolution , characteristic , and function -RRB- , and Literary Criticism -LRB- ethical , psychological , aesthetic -RRB- can rarely be observed in the study of one spec - imen with one class .

		The method , moreover , adapted to one author , masterpiece , or type , is not necessarily of universal applicability .

		But the duty of the English department in the teaching of literature is fulfilled if the student , after mastering the prime courses , with their appropriate means and ends , has acquired a syn - optic view of literary art and science , an organic method of study , and a critical sensitiveness to good literature no matter in what intensive spirit it be approached .

		To this end , it is essential that the synthesis of the courses and the methods of a department furnish a sys - tem .

		With these considerations in mind it is evident that the attempt to limit the teaching of English literature to '' literary history , literary aesthetics , the theory and analysis of style , versification , and rhetoric , and the nec - essary philological apparatus '' would , though attract - ive in its apparent simplicity , end in formalism : that is , remand the science to its static stage .

		But the limita - tion would be impossible .

		For form and thought are as inseparable in literature as in life : the expression is inherent in the idea .

		To appreciate the art of Dis Ali - ter Visum is to understand the ethics of
Browning	PERSON	: that is , to be a philosopher .

		Sociological , metaphysical , and ethical themes are within the function of the belles - lettrist as soon as , emotionalized and clad in aesthetic form , they enter the field of letters .

		Nay , further , the methods of the laboratory , chemical or biological , are within his function as soon as their adaptation may as - sist him to weigh aesthetic values or to trace the devel - opment of literary organisms .

		It is , consequently , un - wise to contemn scientific methods , even though in the hands of enthusiasts they appear to countervail aesthetic interpretation and discipline .

		Monomaniacs are forces in periods of transition .

		It is for those of far gaze and patient temper to compute results and perform the syn - thesis .

		One thing is certain : that , for the determination of critical principles and methods , organized effort is nec - essary .

		To this end I propose the formation of a So - ciety of Comparative Literature , the general scope of which will be indicated hereafter .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In an article in '' The Yale Review '' for
May	DATE	, enti - tled '' Historical Industries , '' the historian Schouler dis - cusses methods of writing history , and , with a glow of pride , illustrates from his own experience .

		Em - phasizing his contention that a writer should do his work in absolute independence of the help of anyone , he says : '' In fine , every real research , where I have published , and every page of composition , has been my own ; and having regularly contracted with my publishers to create a book , in - stead of hawking about its manuscript when completed , and having always been permitted , when ready , to hand my copy to the printers , without submitting it to any mortal 's inspec - tion , I have pursued my own bent , in shaping out the task as I had projected it .

		I have shown my manuscript to no one at all for criticism or approval ; nor have I received suggestions , even as to literary style and expression , except upon printed sheets from the casual proof-reader , as the book went finally through the press . ''

		In view of the above paragraph , one wonders if Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	has not forgotten his earlier efforts , before he could say '' my publishers . ''

		As one turns back through the five volumes of that very useful work , ''
Schouler	PERSON	's History of the

		THE DIAL 33 ABRAHAM LINCOLN 'S COMPLETE WORKS .

		* The editors of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	's Complete Works have prepared them on the same grand scale as their
Life of Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		They had ap - parently sought to collect and publish every - thing extant that claims Lincoln for its author , at least in the period after he reached man - hood ; and if anything has escaped their vigi - lant search it must be something minute and obscure indeed .

		No other great American has received such faithful attention from an editor , neither
Washington	LOCATION	, nor
Franklin	PERSON	, nor Jef - ferson .

		The result is 1414 solid octavo pages of the most diverse material , personal letters , business notes , orders on shopkeepers , frag - mentary memoranda , party resolutions and cir - culars , outlines of speeches and law arguments , lectures , love letters , remarks , formal addresses , telegrams , state papers , etc. , thousands in num - ber , all presented in the order of their produc - tion .

		Much of this matter has no more im - portance or interest in itself than bushels of similar material that never see the light ; and the only reason for publishing it that can be assigned is its authorship .

		The same may be said , however , of the complete works of every other great man .

		And with all reasonable de - ductions there remains in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's Works a great mass of matter that , for the illustration of American history , is second to none in ex - istence .

		For
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's own life and times , and particularly for the years 1860-1865 , the vol - umes are of course invaluable .

		On that point , words can add no emphasis .

		It must be said , too , that many of the documents which at first seem unimportant , at least in such a place , have a decided personal interest and value .

		For instance , here are scores of pages filled with telegrams of the war period , many of them only a line or two in length , that , one might at first think , should have been left to sleep in the ponderous volumes called '' The War of the Rebellion . ''

		But even these are often characteristic , and , as a collection , they exemplify the sleepless vigilance with which the President and Commander-in-Chief of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	followed the events of the war , both po - litical and military .

		Here are the orders re - prieving or pardoning soldiers condemned to * ABRAHAM LINCOLN 'S COMPLETE WORKS .

		death for breach of military duty , that were generally so unwelcome to the officers com - manding , but that , as we now see , detracted nothing in the long run from the strength of the Republic .

		Three sentences from a brief letter written to Secretary Chase ,
May 13 , 1863	DATE	, will show that Lincoln knew , not merely the operations in
General Roseerans	ORGANIZATION	's com - mand at that time , but also whose was the per - sonal initiative of operations . ''

		I return , '' he says , '' the letters of
General Garfield	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Flanders	PERSON	.

		I am sorry to know that the Gen - eral 's pet expedition under
Colonel Streight	PERSON	has already been captured .

		Whether it had paid for itself , as he hoped , I do not know . ''

		We remember a story that at the time of its currency was attributed to Secretary
Seward	PERSON	.

		It was to the effect that , at the opening of his administration ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, when presented with documents for his signature , would require the Secretary to read them to him in full ; as time wore on and burdens multiplied , Lincoln would say , ''
Seward	PERSON	, give me the substance of this paper '' ; while at a still later date his only request was , '' Where do you want my name ? ''

		These volumes are hardly in accord with the spirit of this story .

		There is no better place than these volumes in which to study the slow but steady growth of opinion and conviction in the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	mind on the subject of slavery for the period that they cover , opinion and conviction , we mean , that followed the lines of real politics .

		The first utterance found on the subject is the fol - lowing protest , which was presented to the
Illi	PERSON	- nois
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	,
March 3 , 1837	DATE	, and signed ''
Dan Stone	PERSON	and
A. Lincoln	PERSON	, Rep - resentatives from the County of Sangamon . '' ''

		Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both branches of the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	at its present session , the undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same . ''

		They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but that the promul - gation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils . ''

		They believe that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	has no power under the Constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the different States . ''

		They believe that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	has the power , under the Constitution , to abolish slavery in the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	, but that the power ought not to be exercised , unless at the request of the people of the District . ''

		The difference between these opinions and those contained in the said resolutions is their reason for en - tering this protest . ''

		This was the high-water mark of what would be called practical anti-slavery opinion at that THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, time .

		To remark upon the interval between
March 3 , 1837	DATE	, and
January 1 , 1863	DATE	, only twenty-six years , as measured by dates , is quite superfluous .

		At the opening of his public career Lincoln appears to have been a believer in woman 's suf - frage .

		In an `` announcement of political views '' published in a newspaper in
1836	DATE	, when a can - didate for the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, he said over his signature : '' I go for all sharing the privileges of the Govern - ment who assist in bearing its burdens .

		Consequently , I go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms -LRB- by no means excluding fe - males -RRB- . ''

		The index does not point to any later expres - sion of opinion on the subject .

		The value of these Works does not consist alone in their subject-matter .

		Lincoln has not contributed many lessons to the school '' read - ers , '' or declamations to the '' speakers . ''

		Yet his style , when at the best , will bear the most careful study .

		His diction lacked the majesty of
Webster	PERSON	, the learning of Sumner , the finish of Seward ; but he excelled them all on occa - sions in depth , in ability to find the way to the thought and feeling of unconventional human nature , and in the insight which fits the word to the time and place .

		In his popular ad - dresses his strength lay in the clear and direct statement of his thought , in the iteration of his main ideas , in the avoidance of all superfluities of meaning and expression , in the homely yet apt illustration , all vitalized by the depth of his convictions .

		For the peculiar work that he was called to do , and particularly in the
West	LOCATION	, it is hard to imagine a happier combination of qualities .

		His good humor and his downright moral seriousness sprung from the same root .

		The
Cooper Institute	ORGANIZATION	address , made in
1860	DATE	, shows him at his very best as a popular ora - tor .

		Taking as a text some words that Judge
Douglas	PERSON	had uttered at
Columbus	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, the previous autumn , `` Our fathers , when they framed the
Government	ORGANIZATION	under which we live , understood this question just as well , and even better than we do now , '' he proceeded to build up an argument to show that those fathers had occupied the very ground in respect to the extension of slavery on which he then stood , which it was surely difficult for intelligent sin - cerity to resist .

		A popular orator who desires permanently to impress the public mind could hardly find a better model to study than this masterly address .

		Perhaps it is not going be - yond the proper limits of a review like this to suggest that there are scores of politicians prom - inent in public life to-day who might profitably make that choice .

		Lincoln 's best qualities appear also in the joint debates with Judge
Douglas	PERSON	, held in
1858	DATE	, which debates are here reproduced in full on both sides .


Douglas	PERSON	was a man of vigorous faculties , a practiced stump speaker , popular in
Illinois	LOCATION	, the politics of which State he , more than any other , had long controlled ; but in an evil hour for his reputation he accepted Lin - coln 's challenge to discuss the political ques - tions of the day before the people of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		We now see
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's great superiority to his long-time antagonist even more clearly than the hearers of those debates saw it at the time .

		On his nomination for Senator by the
Spring	DATE	- field Convention ,
June 16	DATE	of that year , Lin - coln had opened his address with the following deliberate and weighty declaration : `` Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention : If we could first know where we are , and whither we are tending , we could better judge what to do , and how to do it .

		We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident prom - ise of putting an end to slavery agitation .

		Under the operation of that policy , that agitation has not only not ceased , but has constantly augmented .

		In my opinion , it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed . '

		A house divided against itself can not stand . '

		I believe this
Government	ORGANIZATION	can not endure per - manently half slave and half free .

		I do not expect the Union to be dissolved I do not expect the house to fall but I do expect it will cease to be divided .

		It will become all one thing , or all the other .

		Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it , and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction ; or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States , old as well as new , North as well as South . ''

		This speech was made four full months be - fore Mr.
Seward	PERSON	delivered his celebrated '' irre - pressible conflict '' speech -LRB-
Rochester	LOCATION	,
October 25 , 1858	DATE	-RRB- in which he declared : '' It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and en - during forces , and it means that the
United States	LOCATION	must and will , sooner or later , become either entirely a slaveholding nation or entirely a free-labor nation .

		Either the cotton and rice fields of
South Carolina	LOCATION	and the sugar planta - tions of
Louisiana	LOCATION	will ultimately be tilled by free labor , and
Charleston	LOCATION	and
New Orleans	LOCATION	become marts for legitimate merchandise alone , or else the rye fields and wheat fields of
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts and
New York	LOCATION	must again be surren - dered by their farmers to slave culture and to the production of slaves , and
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	become once more markets for trade in
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 the bodies and souls of men . ''

		Lincoln 's words are no less weighty than
Seward 's	ORGANIZATION	, and they attracted less attention at the time only because Lincoln then occupied an obscure station as compared with
Seward	ORGANIZATION	.

		Naturally ,
Douglas	PERSON	strove to make the most of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's frank avowal on the slavery ques - tion .

		In the joint debates he demanded to know why the country could not continue half free and half slave , as in the days of
Washington	LOCATION	and the other fathers .

		Lincoln repeated what he had said , and put to his antagonist a tu quoque which he never answered . ''

		He has read from my speech in
Springfield	LOCATION	in which I say that ' a house divided against itself can not stand . '

		Does the Judge say it can stand ?

		I do n't know whether he does or not .

		The Judge does not seem to be at - tending to me just now , but I would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself can stand .

		If he does , then there is a question of veracity , not between him and me , but between the Judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character . ''

		At this distance it seems amazing that men of perspicacity could fail to see the truth of what Lincoln and
Seward	PERSON	asserted ; but we must remember the dulling effect that the pe - culiar institution had on the insight of those who were subject to its bondage .

		In an un - fortunate hour ,
Douglas	PERSON	, to show his inde - pendence of the jarring discord about slavery , flaunted the declaration on the floor of the Sen - ate that he '' did not care whether it was voted up or voted down '' ; and he never wearied of repeating the utterance .

		Here , too , we must remember the environment of Democratic poli - ticians of national reputation and national am - bition in the decade 1850-1860 .

		Judge
Douglas	PERSON	was also fond of making another dec - laration that is due to the same causes .

		This one involved a fallacious assumption , not to speak of moral obtuseness , that Lincoln ex - posed in his speech made at
Cincinnati	LOCATION	Sep - tember 17 ,
1859	DATE	.

		He is addressing for the moment a real or imaginary audience of
Ken	PERSON	- tuckians . ''

		At this same meeting at
Memphis	LOCATION	, he -LSB-
Douglas	PERSON	-RSB- declared that in all contests between the negro and the white man , he was for the white man ; but that in all questions between the negro and the crocodile , he was for the negro .

		He did not make that declaration acci - dentally at
Memphis	LOCATION	.

		He made it a great many times in the canvass in
Illinois	LOCATION
last year	DATE	-LRB- though I do n't know that it was reported in any of his speeches there ; but he frequently made it -RRB- .

		I believe he repeated it at
Columbus	LOCATION	, and I should not wonder if he repeated it here .

		It is , then , a deliberate way of expressing him - self upon that subject .

		It is a matter of mature delib - eration with him thus to express himself upon that point of his case .

		It therefore requires some deliberate attention . ''

		The first inference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro you are wronging the white man in some way or other ; and that whoever is opposed to the negro being enslaved is , in some way or other , against the white man .

		Is not that a falsehood ?

		If there was a necessary conflict between the white man and the ne - gro , I should be for the white man as much as Judge
Douglas	PERSON	; but I say there is no such necessary conflict .

		I say that there is room enough for us all to be free , and that it not only does not wrong the white man that the negro should be free , but it positively wrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be en - slaved ; tlint the mass of white men are really injured by the effects of slave-labor in the vicinity of the fields of their own labor .

		`` But I do not desire to dwell upon ` this branch of the question , more than to say that this assumption of his is false , and I do hope that that fallacy will not long prevail in the minds of intelligent white men .

		At all events , you ought to thank Judge

		`` The other branch of it is , that in a struggle be - tween the negro and the crocodile , he is for the negro .

		Well , I do n't know that there is any struggle between the negro and the crocodile , either .

		I suppose that if a crocodile -LRB- or , as we old
Ohio River	LOCATION	boatmen used to call them , alligators -RRB- should come across a white man , he would kill him if he could , and so he would a negro .

		But what , at last , is this proposition ?

		I believe that it is a sort of proposition in proportion , which may be stated thus : ' As the negro is to the white man , so is the crocodile to the negro ; and as the negro may right - fully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile , so the white man may rightfully treat the negro as a beast or reptile . '

		That is really the point of all that argument of his . ''

		Now , my brother Kentuckians who believe in this , you ought to thank Judge
Douglas	PERSON	for having put that in a much more taking way than any of yourselves have done . ''

		At this distance of time these paragraphs may not seem very uplifting to the mind ; but considered with reference to their object , it is hard to see how they could have been improved .

		However ,
Lincoln	PERSON	did say many things that are uplifting which it is not necessary here for - mally to point out .

		We have sometimes won - dered at the extreme frigidity of style that marked the Emancipation Proclamations .

		It would be hard to compose documents more pragmatical or less marked by felicity of phrase .

		How unlike they are to the pronunciamentos that a liberator of a Latin race would have put forth under similar circumstances .

		The only words in either document that are impressive in themselves form the last paragraph of the second Proclamation : '' And upon this act , sincerely believed to be an act of justice war - ranted by the Constitution under military ne - cessity , I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God . ''

		And these words , or at least the more impressive of them , were contributed by

		* If the errors and uncertainty of history are proverbial , it is equally certain that few biog - raphies , however conscientiously written , pre - sent a truthful and complete likeness of the man whom they attempt to portray .

		The reader sees the man through the bias , be it admiration and love , or indifference and prejudice , of the writer .

		No writer 's mind is an entirely trans - parent medium , clear and unspecked ; but the nearer the biographer 's mind comes to this con - dition -LRB- full information and narrative skill be - ing assumed -RRB- , the better should be the biog - raphy .

		At first we naturally think that the subject of the biography will fare best at the hands of a friend and admirer ; but we soon find that the admirer and friend , unless con - trolled by a peculiarly clear judgment , may really injure the reputation of his hero more than the recognized prejudice of another writer .

		It is a pity to be compelled to say that
Colonel Donn Piatt	PERSON	's Life of General
George H. Thomas	PERSON	is an example of the injury that can be done by the indiscreet friend and admirer .

		It is certain that up to the time of the ap - pearance of this Life no adequate biography had been published of this patriot and soldier who had achieved so much for his country and had impressed himself so strongly upon the minds and hearts of thousands who came in contact with him .

		The field was comparatively unoccupied , the opportunity a fine one ; and many , especially among the soldiers who served under
General Thomas	ORGANIZATION	, will turn eagerly to this book , hoping it may at last make known the true stature of the hero whom they love , but whom their countrymen are still sadly ignorant of .

		They will be disappointed .

		The book will not spread a favorable knowledge of General

		know him it can not bring a pleasant impres - sion .

		Its main faults can be summed up in a sentence .

		It is too bitterly partisan , too argu - mentative , too discursive , too full of vitupera - tion of others .

		It seems as if written quite as much to discredit others as to exalt Thomas .

		The plan of knocking down all who stand around your hero in order that his stature may more fully appear does not attract the sym - pathy of the reader , and does not meet his sense of justice ; on the contrary , it alienates and offends him .

		A simple and graphic nar - rative of General
Thomas	PERSON	's career and of his great achievements , which shall at the same time fitly describe the charm of his personality and the loftiness and purity of his character , is all that is needed to establish his fame as one of the greatest men our country has produced .

		Such a book still remains to be written .

		Were Colonel
Piatt	PERSON	's book not utterly ruined by its constant and unjustifiable partisanship , it still would be far from satisfactory .

		It is weak and faulty in almost every way , and te - dious by reason of its interminable digressions upon all sorts of subjects not connected with its subject .

		It has a preface of ten pages , and an introduction of twenty-three pages , the sub - ject or object of either of which it is not easy to determine .

		They seem to have absolutely no connection with the life of
Thomas	PERSON	, but weary the reader with disquisitions , not very lucid , upon all sorts of irrelevant subjects .

		Throughout the biography this tendency to drop the narrative and indulge in philosophical and argumentative digressions appears to an exasperating extent .

		Indeed , the reader very soon finds to his regret that the author is not a narrator , not fitted to tell the simple straight - forward story of a life , but a fighter , a contro - versialist , and an acrimonious disputant .

		He goes out of his way to discuss every man , be he statesman or soldier , who rose to high dis - tinction during the war .

		Grant ,
Sherman	PERSON	, and
Sheridan	PERSON	are all evil , and have no redeeming qualities ; indeed , in one place they are summed up as '' That trinity of incompetents . ''

		Lin - coln ,
Stanton	PERSON	, and Chase are sometimes right , but more often wrong ; and yet on the whole they seem to have the author 's approval .

		There may be many bad institutions in the country , but the worst of all , in the opinion of
Colonel Piatt	PERSON	, is '' that little school upon the Hudson , '' West Point , which is '' popularly supposed not only to give instruction in the so-called art of war , but to supply through such process the lack of brains found in many of its
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 graduates . ''

		He contends that it is impossible to teach the art of war , and adds , '' The Al - mighty has not seen fit to endow its -LSB- West Point 's -RSB- graduates with military qualities , to say nothing of his refusal to give that little school the monopoly of military talent . ''

		He asserts , '' The fact is , President
Lincoln	PERSON	knew so little how to conduct the war that he feebly left the entire business to
West Point	LOCATION	, when he could as well have given it to an orphan asylum or a medical college . ''

		What a singu - lar power of reasoning there must be in a man who can write so sneeringly of
West Point	LOCATION	, when every .

		man , including his hero , whom through the book he praises as a soldier on the Union or the Confederate side was a graduate of West Point !

		He is , however , in despair about this '' little school '' to the end , and thinks '' were war to be declared to-day , our govern - ment would again call upon the cotton-breasted , full-stomached young men of West Point to leave their drill-rooms and be great generals by the grace of God and the magic of a com - mission . ''

		To the angry man , any good round epithet is as useful as an argument , or cer - tainly Colonel
Piatt	PERSON	would not have fallen into the absurd error of giving the epithet `` full - stomached '' to the young men of that school , where constant and severe physical training has eliminated every superfluous pound of flesh , and rendered their stomachs as flat as their backs .

		West Point is a constant irritation to the gallant Colonel ; and whenever it or its graduates appear throughout his book which means , of course , nearly everywhere , he must go out of the way to have a tilt at it or them .

		And yet , after all , strange to say , he never once hints who were the great and heaven - born soldiers , uncontaminated by West Point train - ing , who could and should have relieved the West Pointers of the burden of commanding the great armies and ending the war .

		It must seem strange to any reader , and almost incredible , that in this ponderous octavo volume of 600 pages , excluding the preface and introduction , the story of the life of General
Thomas	PERSON	, after being only fairly started , is at page 214 absolutely dropped , and not resumed again until page 452 .

		The first fifteen pages of this digression are devoted to the ill-doing of the army of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, and the next ninety - five to a very severe review of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's cam - paign against
Vicksburg	LOCATION	.

		Here the author encounters another officer -LRB- strange to say , also a West Pointer -RRB- , for whom he has a great ad - miration , in the person of
William S. Rose	PERSON	- crans ; and although he is writing , or profess - ing to write , the life of General
Thomas	PERSON	, 126 successive pages are devoted to the glorification of
Rosecrans	LOCATION	.

		The whole
Chickamauga	LOCATION	cam - paign , with
Rosecrans	PERSON	as the hero , is narrated and analyzed with the utmost minuteness , and is styled '' the most brilliant achievement of the war , '' and to the end it is made to reflect only glory upon
Rosecrans	PERSON	.

		This is a curious dictum , in view of the final ending , where an - other had to step in and by his own unsup - ported efforts save
Rosecrans	PERSON	's army , and his objective point ,
Chattanooga	LOCATION	.

		Undoubtedly there is much to admire in the planning and in the earlier conduct of this campaign ; but while our author sees everything that is good and brilliant , he has little or no comment to be - stow on the later , but no less noticeable , errors and mistakes .

		It would be difficult for Col - onel
Piatt	PERSON	to explain or defend the sending of
McCook	ORGANIZATION	's corps to
Alpine	LOCATION	, where he was not only many miles away from any supports , but was directly exposed to overwhelming masses of the enemy , while his back was against an almost impassable mountain range .

		If we grant that his appearance there was an effective men - ace to the enemy , it can not be granted that the orders to remain there , and even to attack the enemy , could have come from anyone but a commander who was utterly deceived as to the position and movements of the enemy .

		Had not
General McCook	ORGANIZATION	very promptly disobeyed those orders and moved his trains , artillery , and troops up the mountain range to the rear , a disaster would probably have happened which our author would have found it difficult to ex - plain .

		Fortune favored
Rosecrans	PERSON	in the ulti - mate concentration of his scattered forces ; but the mistakes on the field were numerous , and what shall we say of a commander who abso - lutely becomes panic-stricken , and deserts the battle-field early in the morning of the decisive day , because one portion of his army has been routed by overwhelming numbers and driven back while the remainder is stubbornly main - taining its position ?

		Whatever else is expected of a commander , it is expected that he shall stay by his army while there is a possibility of success .

		There can be little doubt that Rose - crans 's sudden flight to the rear caused the dis - astrous panic which carried the right wing off the field .

		The fact that he was gone and had left no orders was speedily known all along the line .

		In the face of this knowledge , who can blame his troops and his commanders for fol - lowing him ?

		Had McCook not known that 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	,
Rosecrans	PERSON	had gone he certainly would not have left the field .

		Deserted by his commander-in - chief and the right wing , which he had demor - alized ,
Thomas	PERSON	alone never thought of retreat , but , without orders , stemmed the tide of utter defeat , controlled his troops , inspired them with invincible courage , won the field , and saved the point for which the campaign was fought
Chattanooga	LOCATION	.

		As the faithful biographer of General
Thomas	PERSON	,
Colonel Piatt	ORGANIZATION	surely ought to have shown all this , and thus have done jus - tice to one of his hero 's most glorious achieve - ments .

		But at the time he is too much en - grossed with the eulogy and defence of his sec - ond hero ,
Rosecrans	PERSON	, and so fails to show in bright colors one of the greatest acts of the man whose life he has undertaken to write .

		But the great facts of history can not easily be changed , and
Thomas	PERSON	is and always will be the hero of that field , '' the Rock of
Chickamauga	LOCATION	. ''

		He alone was the rock which stayed the course of the already triumphant enemy , saved the
Union	ORGANIZATION	army , and prevented
Braggs	PERSON	's recap - ture of
Chattanooga	LOCATION	.

		Colonel
Piatt	PERSON	died before completing the book , and from this point on the story is con - tinued by
General Boynton	ORGANIZATION	.

		He too has a sec - ond hero , and devotes sixty-six pages of the biography of Thomas to the gallant leader of the Western cavalry , General
James H. Wil	PERSON	- son .

		This story is an interesting one , and well worth telling at even greater length than is here given to it ; but it does not properly be - long in a biography of General
Thomas	PERSON	.

		This story could well justify another volume , and should some day be so told , and much more in detail .

		We have pointed out only some of the de - fects of Colonel
Piatt	PERSON	's work ; but there are many more .

		He gives no authorities , but al - ways leaves the reader , in a volume in which he constantly opposes the statements of other writers , to take his word for his statement of controverted points .

		This is not satisfactory in either history or biography .

		Again , one can not too much condemn the absurd lengths to which he carries his constant arguments and controversies .

		Narrative and statements of facts are well-nigh lost sight of in the innum - erable discussions .

		The proverbial u if 's '' of the many battle-fields and the many command - ers are almost interminably dilated upon .

		Still worse , the work is evidently very hastily and inconsiderately thrown together , and is filled with bad writing .

		We take to illustrate this four sentences from four successive pages : ''
William S. Rosecrans	PERSON	prided himself in deeds that will live in history to be a man of eminent military genius . ''

		-LSB- Page 196 . -RSB- ''

		McClellan , having got no word from his gallant subordinate , naturally believed , for
McClellan	PERSON	, that he was being defeated , and idly rested in his tent until late in the day , when a portion of
Rosecrans	PERSON	's command came into camp through
Pegram	PERSON	's works . ''

		-LSB- Page 197 . -RSB- ''

		We have no access to the response that Mr.
Stan	PERSON	- ton did not make of record other than in a nature that was strangely bitter , vindictive , and tenacious in its memory of insults . ''

		-LSB- Page 198 . -RSB- ''

		To those who have been busy in egotistical memoirs , letters , and addresses , damning General Thomas in faint praise by saying that he was a good officer , but too slow for a subordinate and too cautious for an independent command , and that he shrunk from all responsibility , had better read the letter he addressed General
Halleck	PERSON	on that occasion . ''

		-LSB- Page 199 . -RSB-

		When four such unformed sentences appear on four successive pages , the reader can imagine what an amount of atrociously bad writing the 600 pages contain .

		It is singular that the pub - lishers have not had such a manuscript care - fully revised for the correction of such faults .

		If our article were not already too long it would be easy to point out many misstatements in the book , and evident contradictions on suc - cessive pages , all of which ought to have been eliminated .

		The book nowhere does justice to the splendid personal qualities of General Tho - mas .

		Among the leading generals of the war , none was so striking in personal appearance .

		He was tall , broad-shouldered and heroic in stature , extremely dignified in bearing , and with a countenance unsurpassed in impressive manly beauty .

		The expression of his face was at once commanding and kindly ; and everyone who came in contact with him was filled with confidence in him , and with admiration and affection as well .

		No commander in history ever impressed his officers and men more uni - versally with confidence and esteem ; most am - ple evidence of this is to be found in the papers on military subjects published since the war by the various commanderies of the
Loyal Legion	ORGANIZATION	throughout the country .

		It was said of him by a well-known writer just at the close of the war : '' General
Thomas	PERSON	is the purest man I met in the army .

		He was the Bayard of our army ' sans peur , sans reproche , ' and I have endeavored in vain to find a flaw in his character .

		His character is free from every stain , and he stands forth in the army as above suspi - cion .

		He has gone through the war without apparently exciting the jealousy of a single officer .

		He has so reg - ulated his advancement so retarded , in fact , his pro- motion , that when , as the climax to two years ' hard ser - vice , he fought a great battle and saved a great army , and was hailed and recognized by the whole country as a hero , not one jealous or defeated officer was found to utter dissent to this popular verdict . ''

		THE DIAL 39 Just after General
Thomas	PERSON	's death , in an address delivered in
New York	LOCATION	,
W. C. Bryant	PERSON	said of hirn : '' When I contemplate his character , and compare it with that of the generality of public men , it seems to me as if I were transported to some other age of the world , in which greater and better men were produced than are brought forth by the mothers of to-day .

		Gen - eral
Thomas	PERSON	was one of that class , of whom Goethe speaks somewhere as antique-minded men characters cast in that noble mould which those who are fond of dwelling upon modern degeneracy place among the years that are never more to return . ''

		He assures his readers that the book lays no claim to literary merit or style ; but his readers can reply that it has the best of literary merit , and the greatest desid - erata of style lucidity , simplicity , and force of expression .

		If the manner of telling is good , the matter is still better , being novel and in - teresting .

		Much discrimination and good taste are also shown in the information given .

		As anything like a decent beard is almost unknown in

		The Lama was very curious to know if we had any English poisons .

		The
Talai Lama	ORGANIZATION	is regularly dosed with medi - cines composed of those ingredients , so there is little marvel that all Talai Lamas die young . ''

		The Tibetans are not so very many years be - hind the English in medical knowledge .

		I have seen many medical prescriptions in use in En - gland and
America	LOCATION	a century ago , of which pearls , coral , and rubies formed a part ; and we know that in Chaucer 's day '' Gold in phis - ike was a cordial . ''

		It is a curious fact , how - ever , that , as our author states , every
Talai Lama	PERSON	, the head of the Tibetan government , dies young .

		A
Talai Lama	ORGANIZATION	would come of age at eighteen , and until then the power is in the hands of a regent .

		With the universal preva - lence of poisoning , and the fact that the power remains with the regent while another young Lama is growing up , it is not difficult to see the reason of their deaths .

		The priests find for a new Lama a child in whom the spirit of the old one has of course become incarnate ; and to prove this , when he becomes four years old he identifies his royal property , and then is removed to a monastery where he remains till his convenient and timely death .

		The Tibetans are very religious .

		Every man has a praying-wheel in his hand , which he con - tinually turns , even when on horseback .

		Piles of stones , manes , flags , and inscriptions , all of religious meaning or mystic significance , are met with in the loneliest spots .

		The differ - ences in religion form a great drawback to the success of the Tibetan traveller 's caravan .

		No Oriental will work or travel unless his stomach is full , and the follower of one religion will not eat meat killed by the believer of another faith .

		And none will eat aught slain , or hallaled , by a heretic European .

		That is , they will not pub - licly violate their vows ; but Captain
Bower	PERSON	adopted the expedient of sending a single Mus - sulman out to bring in the game which had been shot , when the pious man always returned with the animal 's throat cut in the orthodox manner , swearing he found the game still living .

		A very interesting map shows the traveller 's profile route , much of it above the level of the top of
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, and at times reaching 18 , - 760 feet above the sea level .

		This map gives a good notion of the
Chang	PERSON	or great Tibetan pla - teau , the highest on the face of the earth , com - pared with which the Pamirs , called the Roof of the World , sink into insignificance .

		One of the most interesting features of the country explored was the vast salt lakes which lie on elevations much greater than that of the sum - mit of Mont Blanc .

		The observations on so - 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, ciological questions especially on polyandry , which prevails in
Tibet	LOCATION	, and , the author asserts , wisely prevails , the illustrations and descrip - tions of the game and fowl of the country , are most interesting .

		The journey through
Morocco	LOCATION	of a group of artists and newspaper correspondents and well - to-do Englishmen evolved the handsome book '' Among the Moors . ''

		The author ,
Georges Montbard	PERSON	, is both writer and illustrator ; and through a phenomenal use of descriptive ad - jectives he has managed to endow his narrative of this much-travelled region with a certain amount of new interest .

		But the book is es - sentially from an artist 's standpoint ; and its sub-title , '' Sketches of Oriental Life , '' might better read '' Sketches of Oriental Still Life '' as action there is little , and dialogue there is none .

		Its chapters consist of a series of vivid and often voluptuous descriptions of Moorish scenes , such as Constant and
Regnault	PERSON	paint , and are rich in color-terms .

		There is not the slightest attempt at any sociological or ethno - logical research or information .

		The sense of sight is the only one appealed to except that of smell ; for the various Oriental scents and fumes and stenches especially the latter are dwelt upon with much minuteness , plainness of speech , and a reeking opulence of adjectives which dims that of the color-terms .

		The sen - suousuess , even sensuality , shown in the Pref - ace , in the rhapsodic description of the vicious traits and alluring persons of the Semitic wo - men , finds but rare outlet throughout the book , which does , however , in one or two instances , sink into repelling coarseness .

		Still , nothing odious or repulsive seems to have escaped the author 's sight and note-book , and much of the cruelty , filth , disease , and degradation are dis - closed to us .

		But many of the descriptions are also exceedingly beautiful word-pictures , though somewhat cloying in their continued richness , and sometimes too smoothly unctuous .

		The presentments in words of the architecture of the country far excel its representations by the author 's pencil .

		The portraiture of Oriental race-types , which form the tail-pieces of all the chapters , are the most interesting and pictur - esque illustrations ; and in spite of the author 's violent invectives against the camera , these are suspiciously suggestive of dry plates and posing , and differ wholly in method from his other drawings .

		The frontispiece is a portrait , from a drawing by
Godefroy Durand	PERSON	, of the hand - some author of whom it may be said that he looks precisely as one would expect the author of such a book to look .

		He is a Burgundian , and his use of the English language is won - derful , showing a large vocabulary , great fit - ness of expression , and at times much ingen - uity and inventiveness .

		I quote at random these passages : '' Here is a file of camels , the first we have met as yet , slouching along with that intolerable jerking of the body , that pitching insipid movement so characteristic of them .

		Their large feet make no sound when touch - ing the ground ; they glide on with big strides , stretch - ing their long necks , with the undulating motion of rep - tiles ; their hideous heads , with big flat lips , hover over yours before you begin to suspect their presence , and they leave behind them strong , acrid , persistent smells . ''

		Of the women of
Fez	LOCATION	he writes : `` Most of the women are handsome , with a proud , savage , attractive beauty .

		Their attitudes are marked with a strange suppleness mixed with a surprising abrupt - ness , and in the feline movements of their pose , aston - ishingly graceful , unconsciously provocating , there is a suggestion of voluptuous fatigue .

		Some of them , their foreheads entwined with sequins , their eyes enlarged with antimony , their eyelashes and eyebrows darkened , their brows tattooed with blue , stand erect , motionless , with folded arms , fixed eyes , the look lost in space ... One would think , to see them thus rigid in their straight pose , magnificently attired , they were mysterious idols who had been exposed out of their venerated temples .

		Slim young girls with big dark eyes , and a simple silk kerchief around their heads , move about with adder - like flexibility , and their long loosened tresses flow over their shoulders .

		Slaves negresses with hard profiles and sombre faces , with heavy metal rings in their ears , clad in checked garments of red or blue squares on a white ground , their waists encircled by red belts are standing by . ''

		It always seerns ungracious , and sometimes unjust and malignant , to say that one book constantly suggests another , or seems modelled upon a predecessor ; but certainly no one who has read
Pierre Loti	PERSON	's '' Into Morocco '' can fail to be impressed by the strong reflection shown in this book , '' Among the Moors , '' of the fascinating pages on Moorish life by the new Academician .

		The topics and descriptions , even the expressions and phrases , are astonish - ingly similar in both books .

		Sometimes the Burgundian artist excels the Frenchman , but more often the former 's pages are void of that nameless intangible charm that pervades every - thing written by
Pierre Loti	PERSON	.

		The recent books on
Morocco	LOCATION	by De Amicis and
Stephen Bon	PERSON	- sal give us many facts and phases of Mogreb life on which both Loti and
Montbard	ORGANIZATION	are silent ; and a new work by a thoughtful American trav - eller , Dr. Field '' The
Barbary Coast	ORGANIZATION	`` well supplies all that
Montbard	ORGANIZATION	's artist-regard failed to see . ''

		On the Wallaby '' is all that '' Among the Moors '' is not .

		The story of Australian travel 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 is told in a rollicking , familiar way , with no at - tempt at fine writing .

		The comfortable methods of the Moorish travellers were unknown by the two Englishmen who made their journey by steerage , or before the mast , with many amus - ing adventures and ingenious makeshifts .

		It is to be hoped the general reader is not so ig - norant of Australian geography , and also of Australian slang , as was one reader who noted and crossed patiently with the author the Dar - ling ,
Barren	LOCATION	,
Newcastle	LOCATION	,
Flinders	ORGANIZATION	,
Spear	ORGANIZATION	, and other Australian rivers , and awaited the advent of the Wallaby , only to discover , after finish - ing the book , that a small and carefully con - cealed note revealed '' On the Wallaby `` to be an Australianism for '' on the march '' a term applied to persons tramping the bush in search of work .

		The book is certainly a most valuable addition to our knowledge of
Australia	LOCATION	of to - day , and gives us wonderfully vivid though sim - ply expressed pictures of Australian life .

		Oc - casionally such a clear description as this of Barron Falls occurs : '' Imagine yourself standing on a mass of rocks , with jungle-covered hills rising , on either hand , a thousand feet above your head .

		Imagine yourself overlooking a river , in low water , perhaps a hundred and fifty yards in width , rushing headlong , tearing , racing in wildest confusion to hurl itself over one of the most gigantic precipices the mind of mortal man can conceive , a pre - cipice of solid rock a thousand feet or more in height .

		Then fancy that fall of water crashing with the roar of a mighty ocean a roar that can be heard many miles away deep down into a seething , boiling cauldron of whitest foam , lying small as a half-crown in the great abyss below , out of which rises continually a dense mist holding all the colors of a king opal .

		Imagine all that , and you have grasped but a hundredth part of its beauty .

		Everything resounds with the force and majesty of the
fall	DATE	.

		Its thunder is awful ; its grandeur is terrific .

		It is five hundred feet higher than
Niagara	LOCATION	.

		It is more than that it is surely without its equal on the face of the known globe . ''

		On the Wallaby , these Englishmen saw much that was beautiful , much that was pathetic .

		More than once they were in great danger .

		In Windorah '' bounded on three sides by de - spair and on the fourth by the Day of Judg - ment '' - they were in very sore straits .

		But in that wild country they found as a fellow - traveller a young and comely woman , a widow , with her baby strapped to her saddle , camping in the lonely bush , and hunting for work as a bushman , searching a contract to set poles .

		* ' Poor little kinchin , '' she said of her baby , '' it aint every kiddie , I reckon , as has to have the front of a saddle for a cradle . ''

		`` The Gypsy Road '' is the story of a jour - ney over a thousand miles , made by two bicy - clers on their wheels , from
Krakow	LOCATION	to
Coblenz	LOCATION	, through part of
Gralicia	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Moravia	LOCATION	, and
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		Though told in a vivacious and intelligent style , and though seen from the un - usual standpoint of the roadway instead of the railway , and on two wheels instead of four , the account contains little that is novel or startling .

		All the world is now close at hand , and Bohe - mia and
Hungary	LOCATION	have recently been much written about for instance , in the sparkling pages of
Menie Muriel Dowie	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pliny says ,
Nullus	PERSON	est liber tarn malus , ut non aliquaparte prosit .

		This book is not at all bad , and would certainly prove most useful to intending trav - ellers on the wheel in those gypsy lands .

		The illustrations , by
Edmund H. New	PERSON	, are suggest - ive , though sketchy .

		His drawings of the ini - tial letters of the chapters , of the cover , and especially of the title-page , are exceedingly clever and ingenious .

		man o unusua i promise , and his early death removed from the educational ranks a teacher of literature having no touch of pedantry , and singularly endowed with the power of impart - ing to students his own intense sympathy with the beautiful in literary art .

		At the time of his death , little of his work had been published only a school text of ''
Edward II.	PERSON	, '' and a volume of selections from the English critical writers , and it has been left to the pious care of a colleague to prepare for publication the first volume of
McLaughlin	ORGANIZATION	's own work .

		This volume includes half a dozen '' Studies in Mediaeval Life and Literature '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , not altogether finished in form , yet distinctly deserving of preservation .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's editorial introduction to the volume gives the chief facts of interest concerning these papers and concerning the brief life of their author .

		It also includes some sensible reflections upon the subject of instruction in English .

		These reflections deal with '' the easy process '' of '' turning the study into one of a purely linguistic character , in which the discussion of words will take the place of the discussion of literature . ''

		The following is Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's opinion of such methods , and we need hardly say that it has our emphatic approval : '' This is a cheap though convenient method for the teacher to evade the real work he is called upon to perform , and while it may be followed by some incidental advantages , it is almost in the nature of a crime against letters to associate in the minds of young men .

		at the most impressionable period of their lives , the writings of 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, a great author with a drill that is mainly verbal or philological . ''

		The first of the six studies in this volume is devoted to '' The Mediaeval Feeling for Nature , '' the author taking the common view that such feeling , as far as it existed at all , was rudi - mentary and chiefly associated with those aspects of nature which directly affect the comfort or well - being of the individual .

		We must confess that we have never been quite willing to accept this proposi - tion , supported , as it must be , by negative evidence only .

		It takes a great deal of negative evidence to prove that human nature undergoes sensible altera - tions from age to age .

		Even the author seems to have had his doubts , for he inserted into his essay these significant sentences : '' The point , however , should be observed in any inquiry into the reasons for the inadequateness of these ages ' feeling for na - ture ; that many latent sympathies may never have found a voice .

		Many through the centuries before our later ease of publication may have felt the modern sensations , without ever thinking of putting them into words . ''

		The remaining studies in this volume are devoted to u Childhood in Mediaeval Literature , '' the story of
Abelard	ORGANIZATION	and
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	, the poems of Neidhardt von Reuenthal , the ''
Frauen	PERSON	- dienst '' of
Ulrich von Liechtenstein	PERSON	, and the ``
Meier Helmbrecht	PERSON	'' of Wernher the Gardener .

		They are all interesting , and help to an acquaintance with a literary period almost absolutely unknown to the general reader of our day .

		Literary uses of ''
Tennyson	PERSON	's Idylls of the King and the Arthurian story Arthurian Story from the XVIth in four centuries .

		Century '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of a literary study by Professor
M. W. Maccallum	PERSON	, of
the University of Sydney	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title is not exactly descriptive , for an introduction of more than a hun - dred pages discusses the beginnings and the earlier fortunes of the Arthurian tale ; its Celtic proven - ance , its treatment by the chroniclers and romancers , its transformations when touched by the spirit of chivalry , and the forms which it took in the Ger - man epics , the English ballads , and the compilation of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	.

		This preliminary matter is an integral part of the work , and in many respects the most interesting , since the author has availed himself of the results of recent research , such as that under - taken by Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	and Professor
Rhys	PERSON	.

		Having thus cleared the way , Mr.
Maccallum	PERSON	proceeds to comment upon the literary uses to which the Ar - thurian material was put during the sixteenth , seven - teenth , and eighteenth centuries .

		The Elizabethan dramatists ,
Hans Sachs	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and Black - more , are among the writers discussed in this sec - tion of the work .

		We then come to '' The Romantic Revival , '' and consider the impression made by the Arthurian legends upon minds so diverse as those of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Heber	PERSON	,
Peacock	LOCATION	,
Southey	PERSON	, and Words - worth . ''

		Tennyson 's Contemporaries Abroad '' and ''
Tennyson	PERSON	's Contemporaries at Home '' are the sub - jects of the following two chapters ; the first of them deals with such men as
Quinet	PERSON	,
Immermann	LOCATION	, and
Wagner	PERSON	, to mention only the most familiar names ; the second discusses
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	, Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and many others .

		Finally , there are four chapters upon the
Tenny	PERSON	- sonian '' Idylls . ''

		Our enumeration of the books and authors discussed has been very incomplete , and no one not a specialist in the subject can read Mr.
Maccallum	PERSON	's work without being impressed to the point of surprise at the extent to which the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	story with its associated legends has furnished poetical material for the writers of many centuries .

		It is fortunate that the facts should have been thus collected , and the author must be highly praised for the attractive and scholarly character of his work .

		In this connection we will make belated mention of the new and beautiful edition of
Malory	LOCATION	that came to us some months ago .

		It has the im - print of
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and is the most ambitious publication yet attempted by that house .

		There are to be two thick volumes , of almost quarto dimensions , only the first having yet appeared -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		The text is that of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	, as published in
1817	DATE	by
Southey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Spelling and punctuation alone have been modernized .

		Professor
Rhys	PERSON	contributes a critical and historical preface , and Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	a series of fantastic illustrations in which his imagination runs riot more unrestrainedly , if pos - sible , than usual .

		When
Rossetti	PERSON	, in
1845	DATE	, went up to A new biography th Academy schools , he , with the of
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	.

		J .

		, .

		other candidates , was required to give his name to the keeper , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	. ''

		When it came his turn ,
Rossetti	PERSON	, who was rather proud of his mel - lifluous designation , greatly amused his companions and impressed the venerable official by slowly roll - ing out , in his rich , sonorous tones , '
Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti	PERSON	! ' '

		Dear me , sir , ' stam - mered Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, in confused amazement , ' dear me , sir , you have a fine name ! ''

		A fine name
Rossetti	PERSON	undoubtedly has , and in a sense far beyond any implied by the surprised expression of the Acad - emy official , a name now and f orevermore associated with all that is most ardent in artistic aspiration , all that is most beautiful in graphic and poetic achieve - ment .

		The above anecdote is taken from Mrs.
J. W. Wood	PERSON	's book entitled ''
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	, and the Pre-Raphaelite Movement '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , one of the best books , if not the very best , yet devoted to the life and work of the great painter-poet .

		Until Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	shall be moved to write the defini - tive biography of his friend , Mrs.
Wood	PERSON	's book will serve admirably , although it is an account of the painter rather than of the poet and the man , and although it has some slight defects of discursiveness and turgidity , and such an occasional inaccuracy as the quotation , '' Night ,
Night	ORGANIZATION	, Night !

		art thou not known to me ? ''

		instead of '' O lonely night , art thou not known to me ? ''

		The following characterization of
Rossetti	PERSON	's work with the brush may be taken to illustrate Mrs.
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 Wood 's manner , sympathy , and insight : '' Here for the first time in English art is colour supreme , triumphant , as in Titian ; form ethereal and chas - tened , like the visions of a
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	; siibjects , rather than objects , set forth in so direct and often crude an imagery ; not figures merely , but symbols ; fragments of human history , actual and urgent , full of problems and wonders , weighty with meanings and desires . ''

		The illustrations of this beautiful book are deserving of particular mention , for they include the first engravings thus far made of a num - ber of subjects .

		Among them are '' The Boat of Love '' and '' Our Lady of Pity , '' belonging to the Corporation of
Birmingham	LOCATION	; '' The Day-dream '' and '' Pandora , '' belonging to Mr.
Watts	PERSON	; and the study for a '' Head of Christ , '' belonging to Mr.
Moncure D. Conway	PERSON	.

		We are sorry to say that the chapter on ''
Rossetti	PERSON	's Poetry , '' excellent as far as it goes , is much too brief to be adequate .

		An illustrated pic - Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	is the author aSfflS *** of a number of elementary medical Allied Sciences .

		hand-books that have found popular favor .

		Encouraged by his success in this direction , he undertook , some years ago , the preparation of a much larger and more ambitious work of reference for physicians , and the result of his labor now ap - pears in a quarto volume of about the size of Web - ster 's or
Worcester	LOCATION	's Dictionary .

		The work is entitled '' An Illustrated Dictionary of Medicine , Biology , and Allied Sciences '' -LRB- Blakiston -RRB- .

		There are over 1600 double - column pages and a great many cuts .

		Dr.
Gould	PERSON	and his assistants have gone through an enormous mass of recent scientific lit - erature for the purpose of collecting new words and definitions , and the fact that the work is thus brought strictly to date is not the least of its many claims to consideration .

		The term '' allied sciences '' of the title has been construed liberally , and the book is almost as much a dictionary of biology , chemistry , electricity , or microscopy as it is of sur - gery , therapeutics , materia medica , or toxicology .

		Hence we think it particularly important to say that Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's dictionary belongs with the standard reference works that should be found in every well - appointed library .

		It is far more than a manual for the specialist in medical science .

		The work is distinctly encyclopaedic in character , a statement which may be illustrated in many ways , but by none better than calling attention to the many tables that have been introduced .

		A few of the most note - worthy of these are Bacteria -LRB- 30 pages -RRB- , Eponymic Diseases -LRB- 12 pages -RRB- ,
Eponymic Operations	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 30 pages -RRB- , Parasites -LRB- 40 pages -RRB- , Stains and Tests -LRB- 40 pages each -RRB- .

		The pronunciation of terms is indi - cated by a simple but adequate phonetic method .

		In the matter of spelling , a fairly conservative course has been taken .

		The typography of the book is very attractive , and the binding plain but sub - stantial .

		Altogether , the work is one of which Amer - ican scholarship has reason to be proud .

		Mr.
Goidwin Smith	PERSON	Mr -
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	is nothing if not on `` Questions at the same time interesting , conser - vative , and partisan ; and in all three ways his reputation is well maintained by his vol - ume of '' Essays on Questions of the Day '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		It should also be added that even though unable to accept many of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's versions of history and economics , the reader will almost always be stimulated by the author 's forcible style .

		In the face of the fall in the value of silver in
June , 1893	DATE	, consequent upon the action of the Indian govern - ment , it is quite amusing to read his statement that '' Gold and silver are two commodities , each of which has its value settled by qualities and circumstances over which legislatures have no control . ''

		His liking for sweeping and misleading generalizations is illus - trated in his claim that all our communistic societies '' have failed utterly , except in the cases where the rule of celibacy has been enforced . ''

		Yet in an - other essay he quotes from
Noyes	LOCATION	several cases where this is not true .

		He might add the famous and prosperous Amana communities of
Iowa	LOCATION	, where complete family life prevails .

		In the first essay Mr.
Smith	PERSON	pays his respects to socialists , single taxers , greenbackers , strikers , and cooperators .

		In his second essay he favors disestablishment in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		In his third , he makes a wry face over the increasing democracy of
England	LOCATION	, and longs for our constitutional restrictions on the power of the fffc ^ ple .

		In other essays he opposes prohibitory legis - latioii , woman suffrage , imperial federation , and Bo ` me rule , and accounts for Russian opposition to the Jews .

		The rich historical reviews which intro - duce each essay seem often one-sided , yet they ably correct certain tendencies to an opposite bias that sometimes appears in the popular thought of the day .

		The book undoubtedly expresses the conserva - tive thoughts and fears of a very influential portion of every community .

		Anthropological The seventh volume of Professor Essays of
Huxley	LOCATION	's collected essays is entitled Prof. Hu ^ ey .

		u Man > s p lace in Nature , and Other Anthropological Essays '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The contents include the three essays on '' Man 's Place in Nature , '' first published in
1863	DATE	, two ethnological papers of later date , and the discussion of '' The Aryan Ques - tion '' that was published in
1890	DATE	in '' The Nine - teenth Century . ''

		The preface to this volume is brief but interesting .

		The author admits that the first three essays have little more than a historical interest , since their main conclusions have now be - come almost the commonplaces of accepted scien - tific truth .

		Referring to the reception given them thirty years ago , he says : '' The Boreas of criticism blew his hardest blasts of misrepresentation and rid - icule for some years ; and I was even as one of the wicked .

		Indeed , it surprises me , at times , to think how anyone who had sunk so low could have since emerged into , at any rate , relative respectability . ''

		Although the essays in question represent what is now 44
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 16	DATE	, an iiberwundener Standpunkt , they are still valuable as masterly examples of scientific exposition , and the moral to be drawn from their history will always be useful .

		Professor Huxley draws this moral in the following eloquent terms : '' To my observation , human nature has not sensibly changed during the last thirty years .

		I doubt not that there are truths as plainly obvious and as generally denied as those contained in ' Man 's Place in Nature ' now awaiting enunciation .

		If there is a young man of the present generation who has taken as much trouble as I did to assure himself that they are truths , let him come out with them , without troubling his head about the barking of the dogs of
St. Ernulphus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Veritas prce - valebit some day ; and , even if she does not pre - vail in his time , he himself will be all the better and the wiser for having tried to help her .

		And let him recollect that such great reward is full pay - ment for all his labor and pains . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The extension department of
the University of the State of New York	ORGANIZATION	has published another syllabus on American history , by Professor
W. H. Mace	PERSON	of Syra -
cuse University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This forms a supplement to the two prepared by him last year , the first on the American revolution and the second on the American constitution .

		Besides the careful thought shown in the outline ^ pf events during the periods of study , the value olJ ^ e three syllabuses is greatly increased by adding reprint -RRB- -RCB- of original documents referred to in the lecture notes .

		These are used as the basis of further study ana re - search and are specially appreciated by home students or in small villages where historic papers are difficult or impossible to find .

		As in all the syllabuses issued by this department , a carefully selected bibliography is given at the end , with publishers ' names and prices of books .

		Some years ago , Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, we think it was , published a very clever and amusing story en - titled `` The Documents in the Case . ''

		The story was told by printing , without comment , a series of letters , telegrams , advertisements , bills , etc. .

		Mr.
Henry M. Blossom	PERSON	, Jr. has taken up the idea and carried it a step farther , for the story told by '' The Documents in
Evi	ORGANIZATION	- dence '' -LRB-
St Louis	LOCATION	:
Buxton & Skinner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- must be read from photographic facsimiles of the letters exchanged by the principal characters .

		We can not say that it is much of a story , but the form of publication is calcu - lated to attract attention , being both neat and novel .

		Mr.
Langdon S. Thompson	PERSON	is the author of an '' Ed - ucational and Industrial System of Drawing '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- embodied in no less than thirty drawing-books and man - uals , and accompanied by models , colored tablets , and other apparatus .

		The books and manuals are thus div - ided : manual training , two ; free hand -LRB- primary and ad - vanced -RRB- , ten ; model and object , four ; aesthetic and me - chanical series , seven each .

		The entire system provides for a very complete course of instruction . ''

		An Ideal Course in Elementary Art Education '' is the title of an explanatory pamphlet accompanying the books .

		In this pamphlet Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	discusses not only his own sys - tem , but also the philosophical relations of art to the gen - eral scheme of education .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
July 10 , 1894	DATE	.

		The committee in charge of the commemoration ex - ercises iu honor of the hundredth anniversary of Will - iam
Cullen Bryant	PERSON	's birth have announced that they will take place on
August 16	DATE	, instead of the actual date of his birth ,
November 3	DATE	, for the better convenience of those who are to be present .

		The house at
Cumming	LOCATION	- ton ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, near which the celebration is to take place , is known as the
Bryant Homestead	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not , however , the house in which
Bryant	PERSON	was born , but was the resi - dence of his maternal grandfather , to whose home the
Bryant	PERSON	family removed when the poet was a small child .


Bryant	PERSON	's father settled in
Cummington	LOCATION	in
1789	DATE	, ten years after the town 's incorporation , and the birth - place of the poet was the log cabin built by the first settler in the place .

		It was composed of square-hewn logs , and it disappeared many years before
Bryant	PERSON	's death .

		The latter purchased the present
Bryant	PERSON	home - stead and farm in
1866	DATE	, and built the house now occu - pied by his son-in-law , Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	, at that time .

		The homestead itself is the property of his daughter ,
Miss Bryant	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Godwin	PERSON	is now as venerable and striking in appearance as was
Bryant	PERSON	himself , and will make an ideal presiding officer for this important occa - sion .

		His noteworthy discourses at the commemorative meetings in honor of the deaths of
George William Curtis	PERSON	and
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, held by the Century and Play - ers Clubs , are fresh in the memory of all
New Yorkers	LOCATION	.

		He is perhaps the last of the orators of the old school left in this city .

		Mr.
John Howard Bryant	PERSON	, the younger brother of Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	, and himself a poet of some note , now residing at
Princeton	LOCATION	, 111. , will attend and partici - pate in the
Bryant	PERSON	centennial . ''

		A
London	LOCATION	Rose , and Other Rhymes , '' by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	, already mentioned in this correspondence , will shortly be published by
Messrs. Matthews & Lane	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	, and by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's experiments with Kymric measures in English verse seem to be quite successful .

		Among these poems and ballads of
Wales	LOCATION	is an old favorite , '' The Wedding of
Pale Bronwen	PERSON	, '' which first appeared in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Independent . ''

		The volume also in - cludes Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's fine poem , '' Chatterton in
Holborn	LOCATION	, '' which makes one of a section of ''
London	LOCATION	Rhymes . '' ''

		Pembroke , '' by
Miss Wilkins	PERSON	, continues to receive most flattering notices in the English reviews , some of which declare this novel to be the author 's most impor - tant effort thus far .

		It is curious to observe that in a list of the seventeen most popular books , according to
June	DATE	sales in
England	LOCATION	, given by the
London	LOCATION	'' Book - man , '' only two are by American authors '' Pembroke , '' and ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	Abroad , '' by
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	announce two new novels by authors comparatively unknown to this country , `` Music Hath Charms , '' by
V. Munro Ferguson	PERSON	, and '' The Maiden 's Progress '' by Violet Hunt .

		The first of these deals with some interesting points in the rela - tions of the young men and women of to-day ; the sec - ond is evidently reactionary in character , as it is in - tended to show the dangers which may be encountered through ignoring the conventions and conformities of society .

		Both will be suitable for
summer	DATE	reading .

		The new building of the '' Cosmopolitan Magazine '' at Irvington-on-the-Hudson is progressing rapidly , Mr.

		THE DIAL 45 signed in the popular Italian Renaissance style .

		It will be nearly 300 feet long and 75 feet wide , occupy - ing a conspicuous site on the shore of the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		The central dome of three will be surmounted by a repro - duction of one of the World 's Fair groups .

		A special siding has been laid down from the railroad which runs below the building , and a chute or tunnel has been constructed from the basement of the building to this siding for the receipt of paper and ink and the delivery of magazines , some ten carloads of which go out each month .

		The saving in carting and transfers made in this way will be enormous .

		The building is situated on the old Barney estate , Mr.
Walker	PERSON	himself having taken up his residence in the Barney house .

		He now expects to remove the publishing plant from
New York	LOCATION	to
Irv	PERSON	- ington before
September 15	DATE	.

		Prof.
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	will remain in charge of the
New York	LOCATION	editorial office .

		I notice , by the way , that four
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	girls have dramatized Professor
Hardy	PERSON	's '' Passe Rose , '' and that a performance was given last month by some of the students .

		The dramatization of this novel for the professional theatre has often been talked of here , and may yet be attempted .

		The unpublished letters of

		I .

		In glimmering solitude she lay , a melancholy dream ; The golden Goddess gazed no more On curious crowds , the surge and roar Of human stream .

		About her vacant palaces the lazy lake-gull flew ; Her carven eagles high upraised , An empty vaunt , where no one gazed , Against the blue .

		Untrodden , sloped her marble steps down to the dim lagoon ; Where myriad brilliances had quavered , Now in its quiet waters wavered The sickle moon .

		A buried bourg she might have been , forgotten long ago , Where , ` neath deep strata of the soil , Still , fluted columns wreathe and coil , Still , statues glow .

		II .

		But one midsummer 's night she woke from marble dreams of
Greece	LOCATION	, And saw the ruin men had done , Spoiling her temples , one by one ... Better to cease !

		Once more to draw the slavish crowd !

		One last illumination !

		To let the elements defend her , And snatch her palaces , in splendor , From degradation !

		A Bacchanalian reveller she , with death intoxicated !

		Red-flushed with triumph over shame , She wreathed her sculptured halls in flame ... The people waited .

		They watched the wild transfiguration , standing in awe , aloof ; They saw her lurid towers crumble , They heard the doom , the din , the rumble Of ruining roof .

		Her soul exhaled in fire and smoke , fled as a comet flashes ... But still the golden Goddess stands , Outstretching calm Olympian hands O'er heaps of ashes .

		These memoirs , by the private secretary of
Napoleon	PERSON	, are a valuable and important contribution to the history of the Napoleonic period , and necessarily they throw new and interesting light on the personality and real sentiments of the Emperor .

		If
Napoleon	PERSON	anywhere took off the mask , it was in the seclusion of his private cabinet .

		The memoirs have been republished almost as they were written , by Baron de Me * neval 's grandson , with the addition of some supplementary documents . ''

		Lon - don Times . ''

		The Baron de Me * neval knew
Napoleon	PERSON	as few knew him .

		He was his confidential secretary and intimate friend ... Students and historians who wish to form a trustworthy estimate of
Napoleon	PERSON	can not afford to neglect this testimony by one of his most intimate associates . ''


London Daily News	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The work will take rank with the most important of memoirs relating to the period .

		Its great value arises largely from its author 's transparent veracity .

		Me ` neval was one of those men who could not consciously tell anything but the truth .

		He was constitutionally unfitted for lying ... The book is extremely interesting , and it is as important as it is interesting . ''

		It would be hard to say too much in praise of this superb work .

		As a record of mountaineering it is almost , if not quite , unique .

WILLIAM SAMUEL LILLY	PERSON	, Honorary Fellow of
Peter	PERSON	- house ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	; author of '' The Great Enigma , '' etc. 8vo .

		Cloth ,
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		The author takes what might be termed the public - ist 's point of view , and deals with Christianity as a fact in the world 's history .

		He discusses the claims of Buddhism and Islam , and after a masterly analysis of the development of Christianity and the Church , he maintains the necessity of organized spiritual power to vindicate the rights of conscience , especially in our age , when the tendency is to strengthen the state against the individual .

		Mr.
Lilly	PERSON	's historical analysis and incisive discussion of the vital questions of the day form a most timely and suggestive volume .

		74 A YEAR OF
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		In '' The Athenaeum '' for
July 7	DATE	is published the annual summary of literary production upon the Continent that has of late years been so important a feature of that valuable journal .

		There are twelve articles altogether , devoted respectively to
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		For some unexplained reason ,
Norway	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	, and Por - tugal are unrepresented in this survey , an unfortunate omission , since the literary import - ance of those countries is considerable , and since their inclusion would have made the review practically complete .

		Following the precedent of
last year	DATE	, we have thought it desirable to summarize these summaries for the readers of THE DIAL , reproducing the most salient of their comments , and enumerating the more im - portant of the works discussed .

		M.
Joseph Reinach	PERSON	, who makes the French contribution to this symposium , opens the dis - cussion by presenting a classified abstract of a year 's output , representing a total of more than eleven thousand publications of one or more volumes each .

		Medical science is credited with over a thousand titles , and Catholic theology with nearly that number .

		Education , law , his - tory , biography , and fiction are responsible for something like half a thousand each .

		Russian grammar foots the list with three works .

		It is obviously no easy task to single out from this enormous number of publications the few that may be mentioned in a brief article .

		M. Rein - ach gives first place to '' the altogether excep - tional abundance of books dealing with Na - poleon and his times . ''

		Among these he men - tions
M. Levy	PERSON	's ''
Napoleon Intime	PERSON	, ''
M. F. Masson	PERSON	's ''
Napoleon	PERSON	et les Femmes '' and `` Na - poleon chez Lui , '' and the memoirs of
General Thiebault and Chancellor Pasquier	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among other historical works , the highest rank must of course be given to the two posthumous vol - umes that complete Renan 's '' Histoire du Peu - ple d'Israel . '' ''

		They exhibit the same decisive handling , the same lucid historical instinct , as ever ; more than ever do they display the same wonderfully luminous style , with the brilliant parallels and unexpected collocations which were so characteristic of Renan 's imaginative and fas - tidious literary sense . ''

		Mention is also made of
M. Lavisse	PERSON	's '' Le Grand Frederic avant 1 ` Avenement , ''
M. Hano	PERSON	- teaux 's '' Histoire du Cardinal de Richelieu , '' and M. de Mazade 's '' L'Europe et les
Neu	PERSON	- tralites . ''

		Among literary studies there are volumes on Hugo by MM .

		Bire and
Mabilleau	PERSON	, a biography of
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	by
Arvedfe Barine	PERSON	, and a collection of posthumous essays on English literature and philosophy by
M. J. Milsand	PERSON	.

		In fiction ,
M. Zola	PERSON	leads off with '' Le
Docteur Pascal	PERSON	, '' the very last of the 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, seemingly interminable Rougon-Macquart se - ries , ending a task entered upon a quarter-cen - tury ago , and pursued with unflagging energy ever since .

		M. Reinach finds nothing else that is particularly noteworthy in the year 's fiction , although he gives a long list of novels , and com - ments briefly upon a number of them .

		In poetry , the two most important publications have been Hugo 's '' Toute la Lyre '' and
M. de Heredia	PERSON	's '' Les Trophees . ''

		Of the former work we read : '' This collection of separate poems , which is the fit - ting sequel to the former series issued under the same title , exhibits every side of Victor Hugo 's genius .

		He is now the visionary who , in spite of perpetual struggle , believes in a better time to come and in the ultimate triumph of justice ; now the poet whose exquisite sen - sibility comprehends the voice of nature and interprets it unerringly , singing of love in idyls which have an old - world grace ; now the ironical cynic who turns all to ridicule ; now the sympathetic painter of scenes of every - day life ; now ' the mouthpiece of the people 's conscience , ' as he called himself , the singer whose stirring and ter - rible tones pursue with fiery impetuosity all who had to do with the Coup d'Etat , represented in this volume by several poems whose vengeful spirit might well have fitted them for a place in the magnificent pages of
Les Chatiments	ORGANIZATION	. '

		It is surprising that these verses were not collected by the poet in his lifetime , for in vigor of in - spiration and beauty of form they are equal to any he published ; but what is far more amazing is the wealth of genius that could hold such poems in reserve , the gigantic and almost appalling productive power which has made it possible for us , even after we had grown familiar with so many immortal masterpieces , to hear anew the splendid sounds of the poet 's lyre . ''

		The German article , by
Hof	ORGANIZATION	rath
Robert Zim	PERSON	- mermann , tells at relatively great length a story of no great importance . ''

		The combat between ' ancients ' and ' moderns , ' ' idealists ' and ' real - ists . '

		still continues , '' he tells us .

		One-fourth of his article is given up to an account of
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	's new play , ''
Hannele Mattern	PERSON	's Himmelfahrt , '' which we should judge to be an exceptionally dreary composition .

		It '' describes the death-struggle of an ill-treated child of the proletariate , '' and , we are further informed , '' has no action whatever . ''


Herr Halbe	PERSON	's '' Ju - gend '' and
Herr David	PERSON	's ''
Hagar	PERSON	's Sohn '' are two other plays discussed at some length .

		Poetry in
Germany	LOCATION	seems to be mostly submerged be - neath floods of verse .

		The figure is the au - thor 's , who connects poetry with fiction by an - other figure equally suggestive . ''

		If lyric poetry resembles a flooded plain , from which rise but a few peaks on which perch real singing-birds , we might not inaptly compare prose literature of an imaginative sort to a sandy plain of moderate elevation , on the almost endless surface of which , overspread with vegetation , are scattered here and there a few erratic blocks of the ancient formation . ''

		The '' Kleopatra '' of Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	appears to have been the most striking novel of the year . ''

		It deals with the romantic life of the last queen of the Ptolemies , so full of changing fate and advent - ures of love ; but it is not the rosy morning and bright noonday that he depicts , but instead its blood-red sun - set and tragic end in the gloom of a mausoleum built by the heroine herself .

		It is strange that the author should have refrained from the world-famous duet be - tween
Antony	PERSON	and the Armida of antiquity , in order to begin with the gloomy concluding scene of the fifth act of the tragedy . ''

		Other works of fiction are
Herr Hopfen	PERSON	's ''
Glanzendes Elend	PERSON	, ''
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's '' Es War , '' and
Herr Heyse	PERSON	's short story , '' Melu - sine . ''

		The most noteworthy feature of the year 's production seems to be found in the numerous memoirs of men of letters that have appeared .

		The period of literature which be - gan with the foundation of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	is near - ing its close , and many of its authors are tell - ing the story of their lives .

		Among these nar - ratives are those of Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	and
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	,
Herr Hanslick	PERSON	's '' Erinnerungen aus Meinem Leben , '' and
Herr Fontane	PERSON	's ''
Meine Knabenjahre	PERSON	. ''

		A few other books of interest are
Herr Baechthold	ORGANIZATION	's life of
Gottfried Keller	PERSON	, a volume of five lectures by the late
Bernhard	ORGANIZATION	ten Brink , two additional volumes of Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	's speeches , and a work upon Dr.
Ib	ORGANIZATION	- sen 's plays , by
Herr Emil Reich	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	, writing of Danish litera - ture , is '' strictly careful not to mingle it with the Norwegian , '' which is something of a pity , since Norwegian literature , as well as Swedish , does not appear in the '' Athenaeum '' series of articles .

		The number of books produced dur - ing the year in
Denmark	LOCATION	, Dr.
Ipsen	PERSON	writes , '' Has been very great much too great , indeed , for so small a nation , as , although I do not doubt that we are one of the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	which read most , still there is a limit to what even we can consume .

		And be - sides what our own authors can produce , we import and translate numbers of foreign works from all parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, from
France	LOCATION	,
Kussia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	even some from
Italy	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		I am inclined to be - lieve that with our small market we introduce more from foreign languages than the English people . ''

		A movement is on foot to check this general onslaught upon foreign preserves by bringing
Denmark	LOCATION	into the
Convention of Berne	ORGANIZATION	.

		This movement has not yet been successful , but the Danish literary guild has organized an authors ' union , similar to those established last year in
Sweden	LOCATION	and
Norway	LOCATION	.

		The writer of this ar - ticle gives most of his attention to historical works , including Librarian
Jorgensen	PERSON	's book on Chancellor Griffenfeld and Librarian Frid - ericia 's book on the revolution of
1660	DATE	, which 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 53 largely transferred the Danish power from the nobility to the king .

		Another work of great value is that of
Herr Troels Lund	PERSON	, who has told the history of sixteenth century daily life in
Denmark	LOCATION	at great length . ''

		In vivid , picturesque language he depicts the cus - toms and manners of the nation .

		He follows the citizen of that half-civilized century through all the changes of his life from the cradle and nursery to the school , from the school to the shop or the battle-field , through all the civil and ecclesiastical ceremonies through which he had to pass , to the grave .

		It is only natural that such a work , which fills the empty frames of political history with lifelike pictures of people as they were , has found warm admirers not merely in
Denmark	LOCATION	, but also in Ger - many , where it seems to have caused a revolution in the conventional treatment of history as Staatsgeschichte . ''

		There has been nothing very noticeable in Dan - ish belles-lettres , unless we except ''
Solblom	PERSON	- ster , '' a volume of poems by
Herr Michaelis	PERSON	.

		But it is interesting to be told that '' dry , descript - ive realism is passing out of favor , '' and that '' there is a search for ideals of a higher order . ''

		The Belgian literature of the year , in both French and Flemish , is described by Professor Fredericq . ''

		La Jeune Belgique '' is to the fore , represented by
M. Georges Rodenbach	PERSON	, whose '' Le Voile '' has been performed at the Theatre Francais , and
M. Georges Eekhoud	PERSON	, whose `` La Nouvelle Carthage , '' a study of modern Ant - werpian life , has been awarded the quinquen - nial prize of five thousand francs for French literature in
Belgium	LOCATION	.


M. Rodenbach	PERSON	has also published '' Le Musee de Beguines , '' a vivid account of the life led by the inmates of the famous institution of
Bruges	LOCATION	.

		Three `` mari - onette plays , '' by
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, are entitled '' Alladine et Palomides , '' '' Interieur , '' and '' La Mort de Tintagiles . ''

		As becomes a country that has done so much for the produc - tion of the Wagnerian music - dramas ,
Belgium	LOCATION	offers us '' L'Esthetique de
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, '' in two volumes , by
M. J. G. Freson	PERSON	, and a further instalment of
M. Kufferath	ORGANIZATION	's analytical studies .

		A few other works are the conclud - ing volume of '' Belgique Illustree , '' an anony - mous book about
Emile de Laveleye	PERSON	, a volume of essays by that writer , and Librarian van der
Haeghen	PERSON	's bibliography , preliminary to his forthcoming essay upon the works , of the great Erasmus .

		In
Flemish Belgium	LOCATION	, the greatest sensation of the year has been
M. Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	's ''
Het Recht	PERSON	van der Sterkste , '' which '' furnishes a painful and repulsive picture of the conditions under which the lives of beggars , thieves , and poachers are passed on the
Flem	PERSON	- ish countryside . ''

		The most important poet - ical publications of the year have been ''
Clar	PERSON	- ibella , '' by
M. Pol de Mont	PERSON	, and ''
Verzen	PERSON	, '' by Mile .


Helene Swarth	PERSON	.

		A succession of mono - graphs upon the towns and villages of
Flem	PERSON	- ish
Belgium	LOCATION	have also appeared .

		The event of the year in
Holland	LOCATION	, according to
M. Taco de Beer	ORGANIZATION	, has been the publication of '' Majesteit , '' by
Heer Couperus	PERSON	.

		The book seems to be '' modern '' in the morbid sense , as was to be expected , but '' the decorative scen - ery is done in so good a style , and there is so much aristocracy introduced , that the tale is making a deep impression . ''

		Other notable novels are
Heer Lapidoth	PERSON	's '' Goetia , '' a nihil - ist story ,
Heer Adema	PERSON	's ''
Thea	PERSON	, '' a tale of oc - cultism ,
Heer Slothouwer	PERSON	's '' In een Groote Stad , '' '' a picture of pessimism and melan - choly , '' and
Heer Kops	ORGANIZATION	's `` Op
Leven	PERSON	en Dood , '' a story of the French Revolution .

		In poetry , the writer claims for
Holland	ORGANIZATION	the two volumes already named under Flemish
Belgium	LOCATION	, and Dr.
Roster	PERSON	's ''
Niobe	PERSON	, '' said to be finished in the Tennysonian manner .

		Five plays are chron - icled , all of which '' tend to glorify the nervous youngster who claims the right to leave labor to others , and do any mischief he likes . ''

		Sev - eral works of serious aim are enumerated , such as Professor
Pierson	PERSON	's ''
Geestelijke Vooroud	PERSON	- ers , '' or studies in the history of civilization . ''

		Literary criticism and the study of the his - tory of literature are extinct '' in
Holland	LOCATION	, ac - cording to the present writer , and this pessim - istic observation is in keeping with the tone of his entire article .

		We reserve for our next issue a summary of the year 's literature in
Southern and Eastern Europe	LOCATION	.

		DEA THS OF A MONTH .


August Dillmann	PERSON	, the great Semitic scholar , died at
Berlin	LOCATION	on the
fourth of July	DATE	, at the age of seventy-one .

		Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	writes of him in '' The Academy '' as follows : ''
Dillmann	PERSON	and
Schrader	PERSON	were both pupils of
Ewald	ORGANIZATION	, and carried on that tradition of a philological treatment of theological documents which
Ewald	ORGANIZATION	him - self joined with Gesenius to initiate .

		But if it was at Gb ` t - tingen that
Dillmann	PERSON	caught his enthusiasm for the study of languages and of the Bible , to
Tubingen	LOCATION	and
Berlin	LOCATION	he owed a full scope for learned labor .

		Like
Schrader	PERSON	, he was induced by
Ewald	PERSON	to take up Ethiopic ; his Ethi - opic Grammar and Dictionary , and his edition of part of the Ethiopic Old Testament , and of the Book of
Enoch	LOCATION	, have won for him the abiding gratitude of stu - dents of that interesting language .

		Quite lately Dill - mann expressed his hope of revising his text and trans - lation of
Enoch	LOCATION	.

		Dillmann 's Old Testament commen - taries are well known .

		His restless energy in bringing out new editions of them , in some respects thoroughly up to date , was a perpetual surprise to younger scholars .

		The study of Hexateuch-criticism owes much to him ; 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, and if it was provoking to some of his opponents that one so clear-sighted could not join them in their revo - lutionary theories , it surprised and touched them when they saw him , from sheer love of truth , making con - cessions which seemed to them next door to complete surrender .

		As a theologian , he held the cautiously pro- gressive views which might be expected from a disciple of
Ewald	ORGANIZATION	.

		His dissertation on prophecy may still be read with instruction .

		But it is as an historical scholar and a philologist that he will be remembered . ''

		From '' The Academy '' we also take these remarks upon Sir
Austen Henry Layard	PERSON	, who died on the fifth of
July	DATE	, at the age of seventy-seven : '' He was born in
Paris	LOCATION	, and educated in
Italy	LOCATION	, which country he always regarded as a second home .

		When little more than twenty years of age he set off on his travels to the
East	LOCATION	, the account of which is contained in his latest book ' Early Adventures in
Persia	LOCATION	,
Susiaua	LOCATION	, and
Babylonia	LOCATION	, ' including a residence among the
Bakhtiyari	LOCATION	and other wild tribes before the discovery of Nineveh -LRB- 1887 -RRB- .

		It was from
Lord Stratford de Redcliffe	ORGANIZATION	that he received both encouragement and pecuniary means to excavate the site of
Birs Nimrud	ORGANIZATION	, near
Mosul	LOCATION	, in
1845	DATE	.

		His dis - covery of the famous Winged Bulls arrested public at - tention to an extent that has been granted to no subse - quent archaeologist .

		A second expedition , under the auspices of the Trustees of the British Museum , re - vealed the library of Sardanapalus .

		The results were published in two portfolios of 171 plates -LRB- 1848-53 -RRB- , under the title of ' Monuments of
Nineveh	LOCATION	, ' and also in a succession of popular volumes .

		Oxford was the first to recognize his services to learning by conferring upon him the degree of D.C.L. at the Commemoration of
1848	DATE	; and
seven years later	DATE	he was elected Lord Rector of
the University of Aberdeen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Layard now en - tered upon a fresh career as Radical politician and Tur - cophile diplomatist , which it is not necessary to follow here .

		But we must not pass over his devotion to Italian art , which occupied the later years of his life .

		Since
1868	DATE	he has been one of the most active trustees of the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	; and he had formed , in his palazzo at
Venice	LOCATION	, a choice collection of pictures of the schools of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	, under the guidance of his friend , the late
Signor Morelli	PERSON	.

		In
1868	DATE	, he wrote , for the Arun -
del Society	ORGANIZATION	, an account of the
Brancacci Chapel	ORGANIZATION	at Flor - ence , and of the painters Masolino ,
Masaccio	ORGANIZATION	, and Filip - pino
Lippi	PERSON	.

		In
1887	DATE	, when he was already seventy years of age , he undertook single-handed a revision of
Kugler	PERSON	's ' Handbook of Painting , ' in the light of the most recent discoveries ; and yet more recently he wrote a preface to the English translation of
Morelli	ORGANIZATION	's ' Ital - ian Painters . ' ''

		Charles-Marie
Leconte	PERSON	de
Lisle	LOCATION	, the leader of the Parnassiens from the death of
Gautier	PERSON	, was born on the Island of Reunion
October 23 , 1818	DATE	, and died at
Paris	LOCATION	on the seventeenth of
July	DATE	, at the age of seventy-five .

		After much travel in his early years , in
1846	DATE	he took up permanent residence in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		His '' Poemes Antiques , '' published in
1852	DATE	, was the first of many volumes of verse .

		He also made numerous translations from the Greek , including Theocritus ,
Anacreon	LOCATION	, the `` Iliad , '' Hesiod , ^ Eschylus ,
Sophocles	LOCATION	, and
Euripides	LOCATION	.

		In
1886	DATE	he succeeded to Hugo 's chair in the
Academy	LOCATION	.

		His original verse is characterized by perfection of form and rich coloring , and reflects a pantheistic mode of thought .

		He was at the time of his death the greatest of the remaining French poets , with the possible excep - tion of M. Sully-Prudhomme .

		ENGLISH AT
AMHERST	LOCATION	COLLEGE * No study in our American colleges is so directly and practically important as the study of English ; yet none is so beset with problems of administra - tion and method .

		To detail all of these would take up too much space here ; I will merely indicate some of the leading ones , to the solution of which the teachers of English at
Amherst	LOCATION	have been de - voting their attention during the last dozen years .

		There is , first of all , the question what to do with it as a required study .

		For the old idea seems a sound one , that whatever the predominance of elect - ive studies , English , at least English composition , should he required of all ; that is , that no possibil - ity should be opened for any student to gain his de - gree without some training in the practical use of his mother-tongue .

		Yet as a required study in the midst of electives , English is at a disadvantage ; the very fact that it is compulsory weights it with an odium which in many colleges makes it the bug - bear of the course .

		This ill repute was increased in the old-fashioned college course by the makeshift way in which time was grudged out to it in the cur - riculum .

		Under the name of '' rhetoricals , '' En - glish declamations , orations , and essays used to be sandwiched in where some little crevice opened be - tween other studies , once a week perhaps , or at some irregular hour supposably unavailable for anything else .

		Now every teacher knows that a once-a-week study can not be carried on with much profit or in - terest ; it can not but be a weariness to student and instructor alike .

		It finds its way into the hands of incompetent and inexperienced teachers ; it has to rank as the Ishmael among the studies .

		It was the conviction of the teachers of English at

		THE DIAL 55 relation and balance of elective and required study .

		All this came about so naturally as to seem a spon - taneous evolution rather than what it actually was , a strenuous and determined working out of a plan .

		The best name by which to characterize the work in English as now conducted at
Amherst	LOCATION	is labora - tory work .

		Whatever the diversities of aim and method between the teachers , in this respect they are at one : each of their courses is a veritable work - shop , wherein , by systematized daily drill , details are mastered one by one , and that unity of result is ob - tained which is more for practical use than for show .

		The required work in English , which is all under the charge of Professor
Henry A. Frink	PERSON	, has to do with the English of oral expression .

		It consists of two terms of elocutionary drill , or declamation , in Freshman year , and one in
Sophomore	LOCATION	year ; two terms of rhetoric , carried on by means of essays , exercises , and lectures , in Freshman year ; and three terms of debates , both extemporaneous and prepared , in Senior year .

		This comprises in itself a body of work fully as large as obtained in the old days of '' rhetoricals '' ; and when we consider the careful emphasis given to individual drill and crit - icism , in which work the services of five assistants are employed , we may well regard it as far beyond the average of the old courses in efficiency .

		In the elective study of English , each college year has its course characteristic of the year .

		These courses , in the way in which they supplement each other , form a natural sequence ; yet they are inde - pendent of each other , each professor being supreme in his sphere , to plan , carry out , and complete , ac - cording to his own ideas .

		A trio in which the mem - bers work side by side , in cooperation rather than in subordination .

		The elective English of the Sophomore year , un - der the charge of the writer , centres in written ex - pression , the study and practice of rhetoric .

		The rhetoric thus pursued as the many users of the writer 's text-books throughout the country need not be reminded is not the mere broadened study of grammar ; it is a study of the organizing of dis - course , from the choice of words up , as a real au - thor must seek to effect it : a determinate study , in however humble way , of literature in the making .

		Two terms of work , based on the text-book and on the '' Handbook of Rhetorical Analysis , '' are carried on by daily recitations and written exercises ; these latter , invented to illustrate in succession the rhe - torical principles under consideration , being progres - sive in character and requiring as they advance more originative work on the part of the student .

		The course has too many interesting and novel fea - tures to detail here ; one of these , which has proved very profitable and interesting , is the setting up in type of many of the students ' written productions and the reading and criticism of them in proof .

		The third term is devoted to the writing of essays and careful individual criticism of each one in per - sonal interviews .

		Each man in the class presents an essay about once a fortnight .

		By the side of this work there is carried on , as time and numbers permit , a course of reading and discussion of the lead - ing prose writers ; also a voluntary English semin - ary , after the manner of the German universities .

		In the Junior year begin the elective classes of Professor
Frink	PERSON	.

		Two hours a week in the first term are devoted to the study of logic , and two hours to a progressive and systematic course of Public Speak - ing .

		The work of this foundation term takes the form of debates , study and analysis of American and British orations , and Shakespearean readings .

		In a similar manner , public speaking is continued through the second term ; the debates , discussions , and speeches of various kinds having to do with the rhetoric of oral expression .

		Much stimulus to these studies under Professor
Frink	PERSON	is supplied by the numerous prizes offered for proficiency in the work of each term .

		Nor , though the number of men concerned and the extent and variety of the work would seem to necessitate much that is merely perfunctory , is this work anything like a mere rou - tine .

		The industry and genius of Professor
Frink	PERSON	in adapting his labors and interests to the personal peculiarities of each individual precludes that ; and in the sunshine of such friendly relations many a man finds powers awakened that he had not sus - pected in himself , or powers that were running wild ordered and steadied .

		With the third term of the Junior year begins , under Professor
H. Humphrey Neill	PERSON	, the study of English literature .

		Here the aim is to do with a good degree of thoroughness whatever is done ; hence familiarity with a limited number of the great writers is sought , rather than a smattering inform - ation about many .

		The method of work , as in the other English studies , is eminently the laboratory method ; and this , while based in just proportion on facts and details , is so aimed as to get at the spirit of the literature .

		The opening term of the course is devoted , in part through text-books and in part through lectures and discussion of the prin - ciples of literary criticism , to the course of the litera - ture down to the end of the sixteenth century ; spe - cial attention being given to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Dryden	PERSON	.

		Shakespeare is reserved for a special term .

		In the study of these , dependence is placed not so much on reading about the author as on familiarity with the author himself .

		With the beginning of the Senior year the stu - dents work more independently .

		The first term is devoted to the prose writers of the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth century ; the sec - ond to the poets of the same period .

		Two weeks are given to the study of each author ; and on each author certain members of the class read extended and carefully studied essays .

		These essays , in con - nection with the readings and topics prescribed , are made the basis of the class discussions and exam - inations .

		In this way the men are taught to form and test their own opinions .

		In the third term of Senior year -LRB- the fourth of the course -RRB- the study is Shakespeare .

		A minute exegesis of one or two of 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, the greatest plays is given by means of lectures and topics for reading .

		In addition to this , four other plays are studied as a collateral course by the class , and made the subject of written examinations .

		This Shakespearean course is open to all , whether they have elected the three preceding terms or not .

		A special course is also given to a few who in every class , having pursued the course of the three prescribed terms , wish to carry their literary studies further .

		It consists of special investigation under the direction of the professor , but with no stated recitations .

		Such , in a very meagre outline , is the course of English study at
Amherst	LOCATION	.

		To pass judgment on it is for others , rather than for us who conduct it .

		THE
AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION	ORGANIZATION	.

		This well-known body of American scholars has com - pleted the twenty-fifth year of its organization ; an event which in
Germany	LOCATION	would probably be called a Jubildum , and celebrated accordingly .

		The Association , however , remained content with the usual annual meeting , which was held at
Williamstown	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, beginning on
July 10	DATE	.

		An unusually large number of members were in attend - ance , and the papers read , to the number of two dozen , were well received , and generally worthy of the occa - sion .

		Perhaps as interesting , from their novelty , as any , were the paper of Professor
Wright	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, on the votive tablet to
Artemis Anaitis	ORGANIZATION	and Men Tiamou , recently picked up in a
Boston	LOCATION	curiosity shop , and now in the

Allen	PERSON	, of
Harvard	LOCATION	, on the music of the hymn to Apollo recently discovered by the French savans at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, and transcribed by
M. Reinach	PERSON	in modern musical notation .

		The hymn as thus modern - ized was sung by Professor
Sihler	PERSON	, to piano accompani - ment , in the parlor of the hotel next morning , much to the entertainment of the assembled scholars .

		The Association was handsomely treated by the Trus - tees and Faculty of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	.

		President and Mrs.
Carter	PERSON	gave a noon reception and luncheon to the members on
Wednesday	DATE	; after which the majestic sum - mit of
Greylock	ORGANIZATION	was reached by an excursion , which ab - sorbed the entire afternoon , but well repaid all fatigue incurred by affording one of the most superb mountain panoramas in
New England	LOCATION	.

		At one of the sessions a resolution was adopted ex - pressive of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	's sorrow for the death of Professor
W. D. Whitney	PERSON	, and its sense of the loss thus sustained by American scholarship .

		Professor
Whitney	PERSON	was one of the founders of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, and its first President , and has always remained deeply interested in its welfare .

		It was also resolved to hold a joint meeting with the
American Oriental Society	ORGANIZATION	and other similar bodies , at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, in the
Christmas	LOCATION	holi - days , to unite in memorial exercises in honor of Profes - sor
Whitney	LOCATION	.

		This , of course , will not supersede the next regular annual meeting , which will be held at
Cleve	PERSON	- land ,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
July 9 , 1895	DATE	.

		As some objection was made to coming so far '' West , '' on the ground that the
East	LOCATION	- ern members are the most numerous and active , it seems especially incumbent on members , and those who ought to be members , living in the Central and
Western States	LOCATION	, to rally in large numbers at

		THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your correspondent who asks , in THE DIAL of
June 1	DATE	, `` How Shall English Literature Be Taught ? ''

		sug - gests difficulties which meet the teacher of any other literature , as well as of English .

		Those difficulties are less serious with the classical teacher , for instance , only because his pupils are compelled , even to the end of the college course , to devote so large a portion of their time to purely linguistic study .

		The college teacher of En - glish , however , begins with pupils who can read their texts at sight , as far as merely linguistic difficulties are concerned .

		If any material portion of the time be given to linguistics , it is from choice , not absolute necessity .

		If the teacher wishes to devote the time to `` litera - ture , '' he may do so .

		But what is '' literature '' ? ''

		The teacher of English who concerns himself with the sub - ject-matter of his text soon wanders into forbidden fields and lo !

		the dilettante , '' says your correspondent .

		Has the subject-matter , then , so little to do with litera - ture that it can be ignored , and '' literature , '' not simply some one or more aspects of the same , still be taught ?

		It would be interesting to see a detailed argument for such a position .

		In fact , some of the single phases of literary study can not be adequately treated apart from the subject-matter .

		Take the rhetorical , for instance , what is responsible for the wide rhetorical difference be - tween
Lowell	PERSON	's '' Present Crisis , '' '' Fountain of Youth , '' and '' Commemoration Ode '' ?

		between the Twenty-third Psalm and
Whittier	LOCATION	's scathing review of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's '' Oc - casional Discourse on the Negro Question '' ?

		Simply the subject-matter .

		Will any teacher attempt to con - sider these specimens of literature from the rhetorical standpoint , and leave subject-matter out of the account ?

		But the subject-matter leads into '' forbidden fields , '' we are told .

		Why forbidden ?

		Because they '' im - pinge more or less '' upon the territory of other chairs '' concerned with the humanities '' ?

		Has specialization gone so far , then , that there must be a sort of '' Devil 's lane '' between my field and that of each of my col - leagues ?

		Is it not well , on the contrary , that the dif - ferent departments should impinge upon one another here and there ?

		Let us not give the pupil an impres - sion that he is storing various compartments of his brain with materials which are in danger of explosion in case of accidental contact .

		Given the point of view which your correspondent seems to take , and the question should be , not how shall English , or any other , literature be taught , but , can it be taught at all ?

		In the fulness of its meaning , ninety-nine in every hundred of those of us who are trying must humbly answer No !

		But many of us will prefer to work toward such an ideal , even at the risk of '' poaching '' on the territory of our colleagues , or sub - jecting ourselves to that dread term of reproach , '' di - lettante . ''

		THE DIAL 57 A SOCIETY OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Since trustworthy principles of literary criticism de - pend upon the substantiation of aesthetic theory by scien - tific inquiry , and since for lack of systematic effort the comparative investigation of literary types , species , movements , and themes is not yet adequately prosecuted , I should like to call the attention of my fellow-workers to the need of collaboration .

		No individual can , unaided , gather from various literatures the materials necessary for an induction to the characteristic of even one literary type .

		The time has come for organization of effort .

		An association should be formed , as proposed by me in the last issue of THE DIAL , for the comparative investiga - tion of literary growths .

		In this
Society of Compara	ORGANIZATION	- tive Literature -LRB- or of Literary Evolution -RRB- each mem - ber should devote himself to the study of a given type or movement in a literature with which he is specially , and at first hand , familiar .

		Thus , gradually , wherever the type or movement has existed its evolution and characteristics may be observed and registered .

		In time , by systematization of results , an induction to the common and therefore essential characteristics of the phenomenon , to the laws governing its origin , growth , and differentiation , may be made .

		The history of na - tional criticism , and the aesthetics of sporadic critical theory , are , of course , interesting subjects of study ; but to adopt canons of criticism from
Boileau	LOCATION	, or Vida , or Puttenham , or
Sidney	PERSON	, or
Corneille	LOCATION	, or even
Lessing	PERSON	and Aristotle , and apply them to types or varieties of type with which these critics were unacquainted , is to sit in the well in your backyard and study the stars through a smoked glass .

		To come at the laws which govern the drama , for instance , it is not sufficient that we mod - ify by generally accepted aesthetic principles the canons of a school of dramatic critics , and then revise the re - sults in the light of our inductions from the drama of the charmed
Grasco	PERSON	-
Roman	PERSON	-
Celto	PERSON	- Teutonic circle in which we contentedly expatiate .

		The specific principles of technical -LRB- or typical -RRB- criticism must be based upon the characteristics of the type not only in well-known but in less-known literatures , among aboriginal as well as civilized peoples , and in all stages of its evolution .

		Arrangements should be made for the preparation and publication of scientific monographs on national de - velopments of the drama .

		The comparative formula - tion of results would assist us to corroborate or to reno - vate current aesthetic canons of dramatic criticism .

		So , also , with other types lyric , epic , etc and with the evolution of literary movements and themes .

		Of course the labor is arduous , and the limit undefined .

		But the work is not yet undertaken by any English or American organization , or by any periodical or series of publica - tions in the English language .

		The members of this So - ciety of Comparative Literature must be hewers of wood and drawers of water .

		Even though they can not hope to see the completion of a temple of criticism , they may have the joy of construction : the reward of the phil - ologist .

		For several years I have hoped that some one else would set this ball a-rolling .

		If the idea be re - ceived with favor , I intend to issue a detailed statement of the purposes and plans of such an organization .

		As - sistance and criticism from those whom the suggestion may interest are respectfully solicited .

		This letter is signed by four persons , who attach to their names the titles of offices which they suppose them - selves to hold in The

		Neither of these four persons is at present a Trustee of that Society .

		Only one of them has even a colorable claim to membership in good standing therein , and one of them is not a member at all .

		Not one of them has been present at a meeting or council of that Society for two years last past ; and not one of them has ever con - tributed one cent to , nor has an interest to the amount of
one cent	MONEY	in , the twenty-nine volumes which that So - ciety has published , nor in the eighteen which are now leaving its press .

		As I believe there are among THE DIAL 'S readers men and women willing to contribute to the proposed Tennyson memorial , I trust you will kindly print the following : Funds are being received for the erection of a lofty granite monolith , in the form of an lona cross , to the memory of
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	.

		It has been decided to erect the memorial on the highest point of the famous down which overlooks the western end of the Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	, and the spot chosen is the '' edge of the noble down , '' which
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	loved so well , and where he al - most daily walked .

		The permission of the masters of
Trinity House	ORGANIZATION	has been granted for the removal of the present wooden pile known to mariners as the
Nodes Beacon	ORGANIZATION	, and the erection in its place of the
Tennyson Beacon	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a land and sea mark visible from every point for many miles , the beacon cross should form a conspicuous and fitting memorial to the poet .

		The amounts contributed by subscribers to the fund will not be published , but as a tribute to the great poet it is hoped to send to
England	LOCATION	the names of every man and woman '' whose life has been touched ' to finer is - sues ' by the poetry of Tennyson . ''

		THE KARAKORAM HIMALAYAS .

		* Mr.
William Martin Conway	PERSON	's '' Climbing in the Himalayas '' is decidedly a notable book , and at all points a worthy shelf-companion to Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	's fine work on the Andes issued
two years ago	DATE	.

		Apart from its scientific in - terest as the record of an important geograph - ical enterprise , it presents a vivid picture of the perils and , to the Anglo-Saxon apprehen - sion , the pleasures of mountaineering a form of '' sport '' not yet seriously affected by ath - letic faddists on this side the water .

		In point of illustration the volume rather surpasses , to our thinking , even the best of the many beau - tiful books of travel heretofore issued .

		The artist is Mr.
A. D. McCormick	PERSON	, and he has throughout treated the motives furnished him by the magnificent scenery of the Himalayas with a breadth and feeling that lift his work far above the average level of book illustra - tion .

		As these plates are an important factor in the work , forming as they do a pictorial narrative ancillary to the text , we may quote Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's testimony in the '' Alpine Jour - nal '' as to their descriptive value : '' I was careful to impress on
McCormick	ORGANIZATION	at the start that I wanted no topographical accuracy in his sketches only the rendering of the impression a scene made upon him in light and color , a transfer of his vision of it to paper , so that , if possible , I might learn better how to see the hills by finding out how he saw them .

		As a matter of fact , his eye was so true to form that truth - fulness of form was a part of his normal vision , and whoever looks at his works may be assured that they are accurate in outline and mass to a remarkable de - gree .

		His excellence and rapidity as a draughtsman are points that it is only fair that I should emphasize , for I reaped from them the most valuable fruit . ''

		The expedition of which the volume is the record was made in
1892	DATE	, under the auspices of the
Eoyal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	, the

		From Nagyr two long expeditions were made into the snowy region to the south and southeast , before advancing to Hispar , at the foot of the longest glacier in the world out - side the polar regions .

		The rest is a mere patchwork of crazy wooden houses and ugly palaces .

		There is plenteous interest about the life on the river , the boats and barges , the cries of the rowers , the people washing by the dirty shore , the glimpses up foul alleys and what not ; but there is no art in all this , only materials from which the artist can rend forth beauty by educated skill .

		THE DIAL 59 Describing the
New Bazar	LOCATION	, one of the stock sights of
Srinagar	LOCATION	, Mr.
Conway	PERSON	continues : '' Craftsmen were working in the open rooms on the ground floor ; most of the shops were upstairs .

		We were at once surrounded by a crowd , crying , ' I sell you this ! ' '

		I make you this ! ' '

		Come and see my worrk ! ' '

		You not buy from me ; you buy from other man ; see my things ; I do good worrk ; this is my shop ! '

		and so on .

		We climbed crazy stairs and entered a small room wherein were tables covered with silver , copper , and brass inlaid with gay enamel .

		The dealer and his friends stood or squatted round ; no one in particular seemed to own the shop ... We visited the papier-machie man , and noticed that English purchasers were steadily ruining his art by preferring his worst designs .

		He thought to capture us with one in particular . '

		Last year I sold great many of these , every gentleman one pair , two pairs , mostly devil pattern I sold great many devil pattern devil pattern very much admired . '

		Thus do the English befoul the world 's art . ''

		As the writer was formerly Professor of Art at
Liverpool University	ORGANIZATION	, his testimony as to the art phase of the spreading '' Anglo-Saxon con - tagion '' carries some weight .


John Bull	PERSON	, in fact , holding the power of the purse , would seem to have stimulated the once slow and scrupulous artificers of the Orient into a '' pot - boiling '' or
Birmingham	LOCATION	celerity , with not the happiest results as in
Japan	LOCATION	, where art is largely sinking into a trade regulated by the demand of the western market .

		Leaving Gilgit on
May 10	DATE	, the party reached the Hun/a river on the day following , and crossed it by means of ajhula a sort of prim - itive suspension bridge , cleverly enough con - structed and curiously analogous in the main to the complex structures at
Niagara	LOCATION	and
Brook	LOCATION	- lyn .

		As the natives let these bridges get into a rotten state before they mend them , it will be seen that , as the author feelingly testifies , Sijhula out of repair is '' about as nasty a thing for a landsman to cross as may well be imag - ined . ''

		Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	gives a view of the one at Dainyor , a giddy affair spun like a cob - web over a gorge that might shake the nerves of a
Blondin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Says Mr.
Conway	PERSON	: ''
Jhulas	PERSON	are formed of cables of twisted birch or other suitable twigs , each cable having a diameter of from two to three inches .

		Three of these cables , hanging in close contact side by side , and here and there tied to - gether , formed the floor of the bridge .

		There ` is a hand-rope at a suitable level on each side , hanging in a similar curve to that of the floor cable .

		Each of the hand-ropes is formed of a couple of cables twisted round one another .

		They are uncomfortable things to hold , being too thick to grasp , and spiked all along with the sharp projecting ends of the birch-twigs , whose points keep catching the sleeve at awkward moments .

		The gaping void between the hand-ropes and the floor - rope is interrupted every couple of yards by a weak tie , or V , of twisted withe , fastened to the hand-ropes , and passing under and partly supporting the floor-rope .

		At intervals of twelve yards or so there is a horizontal cross-piece of wood , firmly tied to the two hand-ropes , to keep them apart and to prevent them from spread - ing too wide .

		The cross-pieces are about at the level of the waist of a man standing on the bridge .

		These have to be climbed over as they occur ... One bridge , however , was new and strong , and the novelty of the thing was exciting ; so that I crossed without discom - fort , and in a merely inquisitive frame of mind , such as one might have on a first occasion of dying .

		To be quite truthful it should be added that , when I reached the swiftest part of the current , the situation was none of the pleasantest ; for the deceived eye deluded the imagination , and made believe that the water was stand - ing still , and the bridge itself swinging furiously up - stream . ''

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	has duly brightened his pages with descriptions of the people of the remote regions visited .

		Very interesting were the vil - lagers about Hopar in northern
Kashmir	LOCATION	, a race carrying on a primitive and fairly pros - perous agriculture , though still living in a state of chronic inter-tribal or inter-communal war - fare .

		At Hopar , he says , '' We wandered leisurely by a winding path , through fields of green corn and blossoming beans , amongst which there was a quantity of mint in flower .

		Here , or else - where , whenever we approached women or children , they bolted away from us or tried to hide themselves .

		If their houses were near at hand , they ran for them like rabbits into their holes .

		If a familiar shelter was too far away , they hurried into the cornfields and cast them - selves down amongst the corn , by which they were com - pletely concealed .

		These people have the habit of war deeply ingrained .

		A stranger in their fields , who is not a prisoner , is a conqueror .

		Their attitude towards one who travels freely amongst them is thus an attitude of fear , which , however , is easily dispelled , and then they become the friendliest folk in the world , and will do anything for you . ''

		During his stay Mr.
Conway	PERSON	witnessed an overt act of tribal hostility which , offering a fair casus belli , nearly led to a general conflict . ''

		As we were returning through the fields to camp , a man rushed frantically amongst the growing corn and seized two kids .

		He broke their backs , one after an - other , and cast the carcasses on to the path .

		His act was seen by the owner of the kids , a peasant belonging to the next village , who cried aloud and summoned his friends .

		In a few minutes the population of both vil - lages came together and drew up opposite each other , gesticulating and shouting in great anger .

		A peasant war seemed on the point of breaking out .

		We thus had experience of the moods to which the villagers of these parts owe their strongly battlemented walls . ''

		Before leaving Hopar accounts had to be set - tled with the natives ; and the author gives an amusing description of his dealings with the
Raja 's Munshi	PERSON	a sort of local expert account - ant , the ex qfficio representative of the villagers in the arithmetical battle which ensued .

		As the
Munshi	PERSON	a transparent humbug in point 60 THE DIAL -LSB-

Adam Smith	PERSON	says . ''

		Well , what have I to pay for ? ''

		began Mr.
Conway	PERSON	. '' '

		There is dud , atar , gJii yes , and there is wood too . ' '

		How much atar ? '

		The
Munshi	PERSON	, looking hopeless Oh !

		you have had atar ; let us say for ten rupees . '

		Nonsense !

		How much ?

		How many seers ? '

		Why , hazor , these are poor people , and have little atar ; let us say eight rupees ! '

		Habiba and the Gurkhas are called , and inform me of the exact number of seers each has had . '

		Yes , that is quite right , ' says the Mun - shi . '

		But that is not worth eight rupees . '

		Well , how much does it come to , hazor ?

		Tell me , for I do not know . '

		And so on . '

		Now how many seers of milk ? ' '

		Well , the
Khansama	LOCATION	knows ; how much would you say ? '

		Fifteen . '

		< All right ; fifteen is right . ' ''

		In point of understanding the
Hunshi	ORGANIZATION	's clients seem to have been worthy of their deputy , lo - cal information having to be screwed out of them piecemeal . ''

		What do you call that val - ley ? ''

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	would ask . '' '

		I have no tongue . '

		That valley is it Bualtar ? '

		Ah !

		Of the record of the party 's mountaineering experiences , which takes up most of the vol - ume , the following extracts from the chapter on the '' Ascent of Pioneer Peak '' may serve as a sample .

		The ascent of the Peak proper was begun on
August 25	DATE	from '' Upper Pla - teau Camp , '' a point at which an altitude of 20,000 feet had already been gained .

		The preceding night , says Mr.
Conway	PERSON	, was bit - terly cold , and by five o'clock
Zurbriggen	PERSON	, the Alpine guide , was stirring , and began prepara - tions for the journey . ''

		His was the laborious duty of preparing a warm drink of chocolate , with indifferent spirit to burn , and no space to manoauvre the apparatus in .

		The Russian lamp began to roar like a falling avalanche ; and , while the chocolate was cooking , we struggled out of our sleep - ing bags and into our boots , and wound the pattis round our legs , first greasing our feet with marmot fat , for protection against the cold .

		Every movement was a toil .

		After lacing a boot , one had to lie down and take breath before one could lace the next . ''

		Shortly before six all was ready , and the trav - ellers faced the long snow slope stretching be - tween them and the ridge along which the rest of the way was to lie . ''

		For an hour we plodded steadily upwards in the bit - ter cold .

		The risen sun left us still in the shadow , and moment by moment our limbs grew colder and our strength seemed to be evaporating .

		Gradually the se - vere exercise warmed our bodies , but our feet lost all sensation .

		We crunched our toes inside our boots with every step , and stamped our feet upon the ground ; but nothing gave the smallest relief .

		At last it became necessary to halt and pull off our boots , to bring life back to our feet by rubbing .

		We were all on the point of being frost-bitten , and only saved ourselves by the most vigorous measures .

		During our halt the sun came upon us ; and though our feet were numbed for the rest of the day , our bodies were soon far too hot to be com - fortable .

		These variations between biting cold and grilling heat are one of the great impediments to moun - taineering at high altitudes in these parts . ''

		After a quarter of an hour 's walk along the ridge , the first peak -LRB- 20,700 feet -RRB- was reached , and the second peak -LRB- 21,350 feet -RRB- after a rough scramble through rocks and over hard ice in which '' every step taken '' had to be cut with the axe in an hour and ten minutes .

		This labor of step-cutting
Zurbriggen	PERSON	found infin - itely more fatiguing than at the ordinary Swiss levels .

		The rest of the ascent was altogether monotonous a dogged struggle of nearly three hours , with axe , rope , and alpenstock , up an arete heavily corniced on the left , so that the view on that side was completely shut out . ''

		Our advance was necessarily slow , and the terrible heat which the burning rays of the sun poured upon our heads did not add to its rapidity .

		There was plenty of air upon the actual ridge , and now and again a puff would come down upon us and quicken us into a little life ; but for the most part we were in the midst of utter aerial stagnation which made life intolerable .

		I heard the click !

		click !

		of
Zurbriggen	PERSON	's axe , making the long striding steps , and I mechanically struggled from one to another .

		I was dimly conscious of a vast depth down below on the right , filled with tortured glacier and gap - ing crevasses of monstrous size .

		Sometimes I would picture the frail ice-steps giving way , and the whole party falling down the precipitous slope .

		I asked my - self upon which of the rocks projecting below should we meet with our final smash ; and I inspected the schrunds for the one that might be our last not unwel - come resting-place .

		Then there would come a reaction , and for a moment the grandeur of the scenery would make itself felt .

		... At length the slope we were climbing became less steep .

		To avoid a larger mass of cornice than usual we kept away horizontally to the right , and presently discovered that the cornice was the actual summit of the third peak on the ridge .

		We held the rope tight with all imaginable precautions whilst
Zurbriggen	PERSON	climbed to the top .

		He found a firm place where all could cut out seats for themselves , and there at 2.45 P. M. we entered upon well-earned repose . ''

		The victory was won , for the halting-place was the top of Pioneer Peak , the highest point yet authentically reached by man . ''

		The moment we looked round we saw that the peak we were on was the highest point of our ridge .

		Beyond it was a deep depression , on the other side of which a long face of snow led up to the south ridge of the
Golden Throne	LOCATION	.

		From the
Throne	LOCATION	, therefore , we were utterly cut off .

		Ours was a separate mountain , a satellite of
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 its greater neighbor , whose summit still looked down upon us from a height of 1,000 feet , and whose broad extended arms shut out the view to the north-east which I so ardently desired to behold .

		Framed in the passes I have mentioned there were glorious mountain pictures ; that to the south , looking straight down the great Kon - dus valley and away over the bewildering intricacy of the lower Ladak ranges being especially fine , and ren - dered all the more solemn by the still roof of cloud poised over it at a height of 25,000 feet .

		When one beholds a small portion of Nature near at hand , the ac - tion of avalanches , rivers , and winds seems tremendous , but in a deep-extending view over range after range of mountains , and valley beyond valley ,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's forces are reduced to a mere trembling insignificance , and the effect of the whole is majestic repose .

		The clouds seemed stationary above the mountain kingdom ; not a sound broke the utter stillness of the air .

		We ceased to pant for breath the moment the need for exertion was withdrawn , and a delicious lassitude and forgetfulness of past labor supervened upon our over-wrought frames . ''

		The barometer , standing at 13.30 inches , gave an altitude of 22,600 feet .

		The summit of the
Golden Throne	LOCATION	, towering high above the Peak , was about 800 yards away horizontally , and elevated at an angle of 25 . ''

		We were there - fore , '' says Mr.
Con	PERSON	way , `` approximately , 1,100 feet below it .

		... If the
G. T. S.	PERSON	value for the height of K. 2 is correct , the Golden Throne must be 24,100 feet high , and the height of Pioneer Peak is over 23,000 feet . ''

		Tracings taken with the sphygmograph of the author 's and
M. Zurbriggen	PERSON	's pulse showed the damag - ing effect of the altitude . ''

		Our breathing ap - paratus , '' says Mr. Con way , '' was working well enough , but our hearts were being sorely tried , and mine was in a parlous state . ''

		Further climb - ing was out of the question even for the hardy Swiss , who owned that '' another step he could not cut .

		All recognized that the greatest we were going to accomplish was done , and that thenceforward nothing remained for us but downwards and homewards . ''

		The total result of the expedition can be es - timated from the present volume , and from the reports and scientific memoranda to be pub - lished separately , with maps , in the coming autumn .

		It is hardly necessary to say of Mr. Con way that no better man could have been chosen either as leader or chronicler of the ex - pedition .

		A copious author , a Fellow of the Society of Arts and of the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, the Vice-President of the
Alpine Club	ORGANIZATION	and editor of `` The Alpine Journal , '' his name is familiar to the scientist and the general reader .

		We can point to no more readable , solidly in - forming , and outwardly attractive book of trav - els than '' Climbing in the Himalayas . ''

		E. G. J. DUTCH INFLUENCE UPON
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* The making of history is a gradual process .

		There are occasional wars , or political or social commotions ; but the every-day life of the peo - ple occupies by far the greater part of the years of a nation 's life .

		Little things are apt to pass unnoticed ; local customs change ; the charac - ter of a community is altered ; old landmarks are swept away , and in the busy rush of our American life a new generation forgets the old , and the familiar customs of the fathers become strange to the children .

		The writers of our history have too often been content with a recital of the leading events of military and political life , or have confined their attention to constitutional discussions , neglecting to note the fact that the develop - ment of the people , in their social , economic , and industrial conditions , gives the substantial basis to the nation 's strength , and that much of history is made in quiet ways , without the scenic effects of the thunder-and-lightning of warfare .

		But when once the writers turned their thought to the people , manifest differences ap - peared , strange and surprising difficulties ; and various methods were adopted to harmonize these with the old theory that the American peo - ple are but transplanted Englishmen .


Douglas Campbell	PERSON	stirred up a great deal of interest when he published his '' Puritan in
England	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, '' two years ago .

		It led to the examination of the origin of certain features of American institutions , by a gentle - man who has but recently published the results of his study in '' Sources of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	'' ; and it no doubt stim - ulated Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	to reexamine the facts of Dutch history , which had already appealed to him , and which he had collected into readable form in a pamphlet of his own .

		His volume on '' Brave Little
Holland	PERSON	, and What She Taught Us '' is valuable for two reasons , cer - tainly : it puts in a very attractive form the story of the growth of
Holland	LOCATION	, and , more espe - cially , it presents many new and important con - siderations affecting the question , Just what influence did
New Netherlands	LOCATION	have upon American life , and how large an increment of population was thus added to the cosmopolitan colonies ?

		The claim is set forth that the foundations of the
Empire State	ORGANIZATION	were laid by the Dutch , * BRAVE LITTLE HOLLAND , AND WHAT SHE TAUGHT Us .

		By
William Elliott Griffis	PERSON	.

Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, and that , notwithstanding the short life of the colony before the occupation by the English in
1664	DATE	, impressions had been made which were lasting , so that when
New York	LOCATION	, as a State of the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	, formed its con - stitution and developed its institutions , the pre - cedents from the monarchical form of govern - ment of
England	LOCATION	were disregarded for the principles of the republic across the sea .

		De - tails are given in illustration , and the array of claims is quite imposing .

		The list is somewhat familiar to students , but it goes without saying that there is a vast deal of importance in the sentence : '' From the Dutch system they -LSB- our fathers -RSB- borrowed the idea of a written constitution , a
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, or States - General , the
Hague	LOCATION	, or
District of Columbia	LOCATION	, the Su - preme Court -LRB- with vast improvements -RRB- , the land laws , registration of deeds and mortgages , local self-govern - ment from the town and county to the government of governments at
Washington	LOCATION	, the common-school sys - tem , freedom of religion and of the press , and many of the details of the Dutch state and national systems . ''

		But the interest of the volume does not come from this grouping of claims for Dutch influ - ence , so much as from the many chance sug - gestions and references found all through the chapters , accounting for names and symbols , and throwing light upon peculiar customs or characteristics , noticed by others , but not so fully explained .

		No one can read the little book without feeling the truth of what is said about the relations existing between the Dutch Eepublic and that of the
United States of America	LOCATION	.

		Following the story of the one , the impression grows that when
Benjamin Frank	PERSON	- lin declared , '' In love of liberty and bravery in the defense of it , she has been our great ex - ample , '' he told but part of the truth .

		There must have been the influence of the example of a republic struggling for the improvement of constitutional government , and there must have been untold and hardly described influ - ences which permeated the society of the mid - dle colonies , where the seven thousand Dutch made their homes , weaving into the life of the people the web of Dutch character and Dutch ideas .

		Even if the reader be one of those who con - tend that there was no influence but the En - glish affecting American life and character be - fore the great tides of immigration began to set in , there will be positive enjoyment in read - ing again the accounts of the various ways in which the people of
Holland	LOCATION	showed their sym - pathy for the American cause during the Rev - olution .

		Friends were scarce enough in those times , and '' Brave Little Holland '' should have a warm place in our hearts for her ex - pressions of friendship then .

		There is a lack of footnotes and references to support the statements of the text , but the book was not written for students and histo - rians .

		The story is put in simple language for the young folks of
America	LOCATION	, and the author expresses his trust that by the book a deeper interest may be awakened in the little country of which
John Adams	PERSON	wrote : '' The originals of the two Republicks are so much alike , that the History of One seems but a Transcript from that of the other . ''


FRANCIS W. SHEPARDSON	PERSON	.

		UNCONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION .

		* Mr.
Coxe	PERSON	's work on `` Judicial Power and Unconstitutional Legislation '' is incomplete .

		He planned two volumes , the first to contain a history of the relation of judicial power to a superior binding rule of right , the second to be a commentary on the text of our Constitu - tion and devoted to establishing the thesis that the power to declare acts unconstitutional and void is expressly granted .

		The author died leaving the second volume so incomplete that his executors did not feel warranted in sending it to the press .

		The first volume , therefore , is the one before us .

		It is a very elaborate dis - cussion of cases in Roman Law ,
Canon Law	ORGANIZATION	, English Law , and Modern Law , on the conti - nent of
Europe	LOCATION	, as well as in the American colonies before the Revolution and in the
United States	LOCATION	under the Articles of Confeder - ation .

		Cases are found in each division in which a court held a specific legislative enact - ment void because repugnant to what was held to be a superior rule .

		These scattered cases , however , would hardly have sufficed to set up a distinct legal prece - dent .

		What doubtless weighed most with the Constitutional Convention of
1787	DATE	was not precedent at all , but the absolute necessity of the situation and the impracticability of any other plan .

		Under the Articles of Confedera - tion the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was impotent because there was no means of bringing its will to bear on any individual citizen .

		The legislation of the sep - arate States might , and not infrequently did , directly nullify acts of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or treaties of * AN ESSAY ON JUDICIAL POWER AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
Kay & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This must be remedied or the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was doomed .

		Two ways were sug - gested .

		One was for a Federal veto on
State	ORGANIZATION	legislation ; the other relegated the matter to the courts , and merely provided that the or - ganic law of the nation should be the supreme law of the land .

		The first was preventive ; the second was remedial .

		The latter was adopted , doubtless as being less objectionable in the view of those who would be opposed to great cen - tralization .

		And no other way of dealing with the difficulty than these two can easily be im - agined .

		So the action of the Convention is easily accounted for .

		The power in question is by no means inher - ent in a written constitution .


Switzerland	LOCATION	has such a constitution , in large part formed after the pattern of our own .

		But by that instru - ment the Swiss judiciary is expressly forbid - den to pass on the constitutionality of statutes .

		Nearly every nation on the European continent has now a written constitution .

		But in none is the judicial power allowed to extend to con - stitutional questions .

		The reasons for this jeal - ousy of the courts are partly historical ; the judges have always been in a more or less de - pendent position .

		At the same time the
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean conception of the nature of government is radically different from that which prevails here .

		We regard court , executive , and legis - lature , as alike merely the agents of sover - eignty , and each as strictly limited by specific - ally delegated powers .

		The European view is substantially that of
England	LOCATION	and that is , the omnipotence of the legislature .

		Such varia - tions in detail as exist may tend to the inde - pendence of the executive , as is the case in the German Empire .

		But the historic causes which have left the monarch strong have not acted to add power to the courts .

		They still hold a subordinate place .

		The whole question has a new interest to the American student of political science in the light of the extraordinary position of the Su - preme Court in the memorable case of Juil - liard vs.
Greenman	PERSON	.

		That ground is substan - tially this : that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has all the powers which the national legislatures of foreign sov - ereign and civilized governments have and use , as incidental to powers identical with the ex - press powers given to our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	provided only that such powers are not prohibited to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by the constitution .

		It is difficult to see how this doctrine does not come very near to confounding the radical difference between the European and American views of government .

		It certainly stops little short of vesting in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the English par - liamentary omnipotence .

		And if , as Mr.
Coxe	PERSON	suggests ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	were to enact that the Su - preme Court should under no circumstances declare a Federal statute unconstitutional , so long as the decision in Juilliard vs.
Greenman	PERSON	remains law the court would certainly be bound to accept such supposed enactment as valid .

		And that at one blow would destroy the coor - dinate independence of the judiciary .

		Is not the decision in
Juilliard	LOCATION	vs.
Greenman	PERSON	, then , in effect a grave menace to the very power of the court which we have come to regard as one of the strongest bulwarks of constitutional free - dom ?

		In the light of these considerations , the ques - tion of judicial power as related to unconstitu - tional laws is worthy of careful and renewed attention .

		It lies at the very heart of the vital distinction which we have been accustomed to make between
the State	ORGANIZATION	and the government of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet art thou with this earth 's immortal Three , With him in

		It seems , according to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's notes , that
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	led a Scottish force at
Lagny	LOCATION	, that she her - self declared her portrait to have been made by a Scottish archer , and that two Langs -LRB- or Lains -RRB- were in the French service about
1507	DATE	.

		All of which afford excellent reasons , if any were needed , why a fin de dix-neuvieme siecle Scot should have paid this beautiful tribute to the
Maid of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	.

		Be - fore turning to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's lighter verse , we must find room for this characteristic erratum concern - ing the sonnet `` Britannia '' : '' Reader , a blot hath escaped the watchfulness of the set - ter-f orth : if thou wilt thou mayst amend it .

		The sonnet on the forty-fourth page , against all right Italianate laws , hath but thirteen lines withal : add another to thy liking , if thou art a Maker ; or , if thou art none , even be content with what is set before thee .

		If it be scant measure , be sure it is choicely good . ''

		But how could a man who is a Maker let such a thing escape him ?

		The sonnet called '' Gallia , '' at least , is correct in scheme , and is worth reproducing because of the abbreviated verse so rarely employed by English sonneteers . ''

		Lady , lady neat Of the roguish eye , Wherefore dost thou hie , Stealthy , down the street , On well-booted feet ?

		From French novels I Gather that you fly Guy or Jules to meet .

		`` Furtive dost thou range Oft thy cab to change ; So ; at least , ' t is said : Oh , the sad old tale Passionately stale , We 've so often read ! ''

		This is something of a tour de force , although less so than the Frenchman 's sonnet-epitaph for a young S M : ``

		Mr.

		How many and many a weary day , When sad enough were we , ' Mark 's way ' -LRB- Unlike the Laureate 's Mark 's -RRB- Has made us laugh until we cried , And , sinking back exhausted , sighed ,
Like Gargery	PERSON	, Wot larx ! ''

		One looks askance at a group of poems described as '' written under the influence of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' but the following example will show that it is only Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's f-f-fun : '' Mist , though I love thee not , who puttest down Trout in the Lochs -LRB- they feed not , as a rule , At least on fly , in mere or river-pool When fogs have fallen , and the air is lown , And on each
Ben	PERSON	, a pillow not a crown , The fat folds rest -RRB- , thou , Mist , hast power to cool The blatant declamations of the fool Who raves reciting through the heather brown . ''

		Much do I bar the matron , man , or lass Who cries ' How lovely ! '

		and who does not spare , When light and shadow on the mountain pass , Shadow and light , and gleams exceeding fair , O'er rock , and glade , and glen , to shout , the Ass , To me , to me the Poet , ' Oh , look there ! ' ''

		But we must leave something for readers of the
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL book itself , and will close with a few lines inscribed `` The Unknown Correspondent , who , With nndefatigable pen , And nothing in the world to do , Perplexes literary men , '' and to whom is addressed this solemn adjuration : ' ' friends with time upon your hands , O friends with postage stamps in plenty , poets out of many lands , youths and maidens under twenty , Seek out some other wretch to bore , Or wreak yourselves upon your neighbours , And leave me to my dusty lore , And my unprofitable labours ! ''

		Mr.
Richard LeGallienne	PERSON	's volume of '' English Poems '' opens with some lines '' to the reader , '' from which we make this quotation : '' O shall we hear an English song again !

		Still English larks mount in the merry morn , And English May still brings an English thorn , Still English daisies up and down the grass , Still English love for English lad and lass Yet youngsters blush to sing an English song ! ''

		We should not call attention to these verses if they were not obviously intended to provide the collec - tion with a keynote , and if the poems that follow seemed to bear out the suggested claim .

		But the quality of Mr.
LeGallienne	PERSON	's work seems to us any - thing but distinctively English .

		If it reminds us of one poet more than of another ,
Rossetti	PERSON	is the man ; and we can never think of
Rossetti	PERSON	as other than an exotic in the English garden of song .

		The fol - lowing lines on '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	of Venus '' will illus - trate our meaning : '' Not that Queen
Venus	PERSON	of adulterous fame , Whose love was lust 's insatiable flame Not hers the house I would be singer in Whose loose-lipped servants seek a weary sin : But mine the Venus of that morning flood With all the dawn 's young passion in her blood , With great blue eyes and unpressed bosom sweet .

		Her would I sing and of the shy retreat Where Love first kissed her wondering maidenhood , And He and She first stood , with eyes afraid , In the most golden house that God has made . ''

		This is charming verse , but its inspiration is not ex - actly English .

		The first half of Mr.
LeGallienne	PERSON	's book is given up to '' Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	, '' a poem in Spenserian stanza ; '' Love Platonic , '' a group of poems having the common motive suggested by their title ; and '' Cor Cordium , '' another group similarly linked together .

		These three divisions of the book are apparently intended -LRB- we quote from a recent English critic -RRB- '' to contrast three phases of sexual affection : passion overleaping social law , passion re - strained by social law , and passion sanctioned by social law . ''

		The idea is a good one , and the parts of the trilogy are well contrasted .

		Our own selec - tion shall be taken , not from these groups , but from the miscellaneous portion of the book , and is enti - tled '' Sunset in the
City	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Above the town a monstrous wheel is turning , With glowing spokes of red , Low in the west its fiery axle burning ; And , lost amid the spaces overhead , A vague white moth , the moon , is fluttering .

		`` Above the town an azure sea is flowing , ` Mid long peninsulas of shining sand , From opal unto pearl the moon is growing , Dropped like a shell upon the changing strand . ''

		Within the town the streets grow strange and haunted , And , dark against the western lakes of green , The buildings change to temples , and unwonted Shadows and sounds creep in where day has been . ''

		Within the town , the lamps of sin are flaring , Poor foolish men that know not what ye are !

		Tired traffic still upon his feet is faring Two lovers meet and kiss and watch a star . ''

		Mr.
LeGallienne	PERSON	's work is very uneven , but is prom - ising at its best .

		He is still a minor poet , but is pos - sibly in the chrysalis stage of development into some - thing better .

		Mrs.
Hinkson	PERSON	's '' Cuckoo Songs '' are mostly sim - ple lyrics and ballads , versified Irish legends , and mediaeval aspects of religious emotion . ''

		A small monotonous song I sing , My notes are faint and few , Like his whose coming wakes the
Spring	DATE	, Cuckoo !

		Cuckoo ! '' ''

		The Resurrection : a Miracle Play , '' is the most pretentious and perhaps the best of these pieces . ''

		God 's Bird '' is a pretty conceit , and may be taken for our illustration .

		`` Nay , not Thine eagle ,
Lord	LOCATION	, No golden eagle I , That creep half-fainting on the sward , And have not wings to fly . ''

		Nor yet Thy swallow dear , That , faring home to Thee , Looks on the storm and hath no fear , And broods above the sea . ''

		Nor yet Thy tender dove , Meek as Thyself , Thou Lamb !

		I would I were the dove , Thy love , And not that thing I am ! ''

		But take me in Thy hand , To be Thy sparrow , then ; Were two sparrows in Holy Land , One farthing bought the twain . ''

		Make me Thy sparrow , then , That trembles in Thy hold ; And who shall pluck me out again , And cast me in the cold ? ''

		But if I fall at last , A thing of little price , If Thou one thought on me hast cast , Lo , then my Paradise ! ''

		A defective sense of rhythm is manifest in most of these '' Cuckoo Songs , '' marring what would often otherwise have been an effective bit of lyric .

		In the season which is , at least theoretically , one of rest , relaxation , and recuperation , one might do worse than heed the voice of the
summer	DATE	philoso - pher who persuades us to join him in his rustic re - treat with such arguments as these : '' Here the sleek shorthorns in the shade Crop clover by the gate , Without -LRB- thank heav ` n -RRB- a dairymaid Who , tossed by savage Fate , Comes our weak intellect to vex ,
Like D'Urbervilian Tess	PERSON	, With sombre riddles of the sex , Far too abstruse to guess .

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, '' When the spruce chaffinch twitters clear , Amid the apple bloom , No social problems bore my ear , No prophecies of gloom ; And when the sparrows in the eaves Salute the morning haze , I catch among the ivy leaves No word of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's plays . ''

		These stanzas are extracted from '' The
Kestrel	ORGANIZATION	's Nest , and Other Verses , '' by Mr.
Alfred Cochrane	PERSON	, a volume of vers de societS which we do not hesitate to place among the best of its class with the work of Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	, Mr.
Locker	PERSON	, and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	.

		Which position we proceed to defend by these lines from ''
Omnia	ORGANIZATION	Vincit '' : '' Love , I said in my wisdom , Love is dead , For all his fabled triumphs and instead We find a calm affectionate respect Doled forth by Intellect to Intellect . ''

		Yet when Love , taking vengeance , smote me sore , My Siren called me from no classic shore ; It was no
Girton	PERSON	trumpet that laid low The walls of this
Platonic Jericho	LOCATION	. ''

		For when my peace of mind at length was stole , I thought no whit of Intellect or Soul ; Nay !

		I was cast in pitiful distress By brown eyes wide with truth and tenderness . ''

		Another example may be taken from the stanzas '' To
Anthea	PERSON	, '' which illustrate a form of self-abase - ment not uncommon among lovers . ''

		My taste in Art she hailed with groans , And I , once charmed with bolder tones , Now love the yellows of Bume - Jones : But then , She likes them .

		My tuneful soul no longer hoards Stray jewels from the Empire boards ; I revel now in
Dvorak	LOCATION	's chords : But then , She strikes them .

		Our age distinctly cramps a knight ; Yet , though debarred from tilt and fight , I can admit that black is white , If she asserts it .

		Heroes of old were luckier men Than I I venture now and then To hint retracting meekly when She controverts it . ''

		What could be more delicious in its humor than `` The Ballade of Classical Music '' '' What time the string quintette is long , And concert chairs grow hard , may be , While strange-named fiddlers , going strong , Have ntt yet finished ' Movement 3 , ' '' Think not our saddened air ennui , Others have this dejection had ; We do but with the poet agree , And still sweet music makes us sad '' with its '' Envoy '' '' Be merciful , fair devotee , The Lett motiv , which makes you glad , Sometimes the novice fails to see , And still sweet music makes us sad . ''

		One complete poem ''
Upon Lesbia	PERSON	, Arguing '' must end our extracts . ''

		My
Lesbia	LOCATION	, I will not deny , Bewitches me completely ; She has the usual beaming eye , And smiles upon me sweetly : But she has an unseemly way Of contradicting what I say . ''

		And , though I am her closest friend , And find her fascinating , I can not cordially commend Her method of debating : Her logic , though she is divine , Is singularly feminine . ''

		Her reasoning is full of tricks , And butterfly suggestions ; I know no point to which she sticks , She begs the simplest questions ; And , when her premises are strong , She always draws her inference wrong . ''

		Broad , liberal views on men and things She will not hear a word of ; To prove herself correct she brings Some instance she has heard of ; The argument ad hominem Appears her favorite stratagem . ' '

		Old
Socrates	PERSON	, with sage replies To questions put to suit him , Would not , I think , have looked so wise With
Lesbia	PERSON	to confute him ; He would more probably have bade Xantippe hasten to his aid . ''

		Ah !

		well , my fair philosopher , With clear brown eyes that glisten So sweetly , that I much prefer To look at them than listen , Preach me your sermon : have your way , The voice is yours , whate'er you say . ''

		We commend this masterly study to those inter - ested in the comparative psychology of the sexes .

		The '' Poems '' of Mr.
Langdon Elwyn Mitchell	PERSON	are grave , thoughtful , and refined .

		While never rising to great altitudes , they exhibit mastery of material , and the restraint of one who recognizes his limitations .

		They have , for the most part , a healthy objectivity that removes them as far as pos - sible from the mere Hirngespinnst of most amateur writers of verse .

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	can paint a quiet picture or give expression to a passing mood with much command of subtle verbal effect .

		For a pic - ture , let us take these lines : '' There is an old town by the sea , That lies alone and quietly .

		Behind , the sand-dunes bleak and gray Stretch to the low hills away ; Before , the ripple laps and calls , Running along the weedy walls ; Like crescents pale , on either side The silver sands receive the tide ; And from the winding streets you see The great green waters of the sea . ''

		And for a mood , these verses , that follow upon the highly poetical description of an autumn day : '' And my deep heart within , Like a calm lake , reflects the golden scene , Distinct in all its glory , e ` en to where The distant hills loom up in the warm air , Melting in silvery haze . ''

		How sweet , how good It is to be reborn into this mood Of natural ending : to be satisfied With the world 's age , and ebb of its great tide .

		Too often do we fall from such content ;
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 Estranged from our own nature , wryed and bent , As saplings in the forest by the snow , Heavily fallen , and which never grow Erect again ; Life falls on us e ` en so !

		And , wrenched at heart too rudely , we become Like those whose spirits , fading on the gloom And bitterness of things , see naught to please Where others find a blessedness or ease ; Whom nothing satisfies : nor love , nor mirth ; Not clouds , and not the sun 's bright looking forth ; Not Life !

		forever sliding into change ; Not Death !

		for death 's unnatural and strange .

		Not with the stillness , and not with the stream , Are such content : they feed upon a Dream , And waking from it hunger ceaselessly ; Their heaven a desire , eternity Of vain desire . ''

		The list of poets that , by virtue of birth or long residence , may be claimed by
Chicago	LOCATION	is not a lengthy one , but it at least claims respectful consid - eration .

		It includes the names of
B. F. Taylor	PERSON	and
H. N. Powers	ORGANIZATION	, of Mr.
Block	PERSON	, Mr.
Horton	PERSON	, Mr.
Field	PERSON	, and Mr.
McGaffey	PERSON	, of Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	, Miss
Amanda Jones	PERSON	, and Miss Blanche Fearing .

		To this list the name of Mr.
Harry B. Smith	PERSON	must now be added , and his privately-printed collection of '' Lyrics and Sonnets '' takes a high place among the works of his fellow-singers .

		The first impres - sion made by this volume is of unusual range .

		The serious tone is dominant so much so that it would seem to preclude exercises in lighter vein yet when we near the end of the collection we come upon some vers de societe and a group of semi-humorous songs of a bibliophile .

		Perhaps the best of these '' bookish ballads '' is the ''
Editio Princeps	PERSON	, '' of which one stanza may be given . ''

		The contents of this work are found In new editions lately dated , Uncut , gilt tops , good type , well bound , And admirably illustrated .

		But connoisseurs give these no heed ; To own such things they 've no ambition ; For though they 're good enough to read , They are not like a first edition . ''

		We must find room , also , before turning to Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's more thoughtful verse , for one of the stanzas addressed '' To My Old Pipe -LRB- if I had one -RRB- . '' ''

		Old pipe , ' t is true thou hast seen better days , Thou ` rt shabby and much worn ; Thou art malodorous .

		My lady says Thou art not to be borne .

		And yet ' t is true that thou hast served me well Despite thy gruesome mien .

		No one , save I , thy master , e'er can tell How faithful thou hast been .

		-LRB- One little thing this sentiment debars I only smoke cigars . -RRB- ''

		The author , when serious , is very serious indeed , often falling into a vein of religious sentiment that recalls the accent of
Clough	PERSON	.

		That poet might easily have penned the following quatrain : '' 'T was Doubt that solved the riddles of the past , Slew Error 's faiths , red-handed and uncouth .

		This will perfect the souls of men at last : Men must be doubters ere they see the truth . ''

		The note is still graver in such a poem as '' The Fortunate Ones '' : '' Are not the dead God 's favorites after all ?

		Is death the goal ?

		At least they are at rest Whom the great mother lulls upon her breast To sleep in silence .

		Not for them the brawl And tumult that are life 's when life is best ; For where is living one , however blest , Into whose chalice bitter drops ne'er fall ?

		If the sad echo of an anguished cry That ever haunts the minds that darkly grope Speaks truth , if man clings to a shadowy hope , His Maker 's likeness only born to die , Still are the dead God 's favorites , mocked no more By a poor faith we cling to and adore Like helpless slaves of chance .

		At rest they lie . ''

		Among Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's sonnets , the most noteworthy are the group upon Egyptian themes and the `` Shake - speare . ''

		The latter has already done duty as a pre - face to the author 's comedy of the player-poet , and we reproduce it here as an example of his best work . ''

		soul of mine , thou farest in strange ways On thy mind - journey ; meadows sunlit bright Thou traversest where variant flowers delight And lure aside ; in grey mysterious haze Thou wand ` rest phantom-led thro ' many a maze ; Thou bravest rivers rolling with swift might , Lingerest on little hills of graceful height ; In stately woods thou dreamest happy days , Until a lonely mountain-top is won , Font of the streams and mother of the vales , Whose verdant slope all Elfland plays upon , On whose fair brow Truth 's star faints not nor pales , Whence in the noontide eagles seek the sun , Where in the moonlight sob the nightingales . ''

		The sestet of this sonnet , while not absolutely fault - less , is deserving of very high praise . ''

		A Lover 's Diary '' is a sequence of over a hun - dred sonnets , recording the various modulations of the lover 's mood .

		Such a work naturally challenges comparison with '' The House of Life '' and '' Son - nets from the Portuguese , '' and these works have but to be named to make it clear how far Mr.
Parker	PERSON	has fallen short from such achievement as they denote .

		In spite of the true and tender sen - timent that runs like a golden thread through the fabric of his weaving , and in spite of the happy phrases and exquisite single verses that occasionally reward the reader , the general level of this series of poems is bardly above the commonplace .

		In this case , as in so many others , facility seems to have been the successful foe of that concentration of feel - ing demanded by the sonnet form .

		We quote one of the best of the pieces : '' It is enough that in this burdened time The soul sees all its purposes aright .

		The rest what does it matter ?

		Soon the night Will come to whelm us , then the morning chime .

		What does it matter , if but in the way One hand clasps ours , one heart believes us true ; One understands the work we try to do , And strives through Love to teach us what to say ?

		Between me and the chilly outer air Which blows in from the world , there standeth one Who draws Love 's curtains closely everywhere , As God folds down the banners of the sun .

		Warm is the place about me , and above Where was the raven , I behold the dove . ''

		We have called these poems sonnets , although they depart -LRB- as the above example shows -RRB- from the or -
68	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, thodox form .

		But as long as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets go by that name , there will be warrant for the lib - erty we have taken .

		Mr.
McCulloch	PERSON	's '' The Quest of
Heracles	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Poems , '' includes classical idyls , sonnets , and a few miscellaneous pieces .

		The rhymed couplet and the terza rima are the forms chiefly favored in the longer poems , and are used with graceful pre - cision , although hardly with display of poetic en - ergy .

		The following sonnet is a fair sample of this writer 's work : ''
Fain	PERSON	would I journey from these barren lands Where I was born , unto the magic isles Of tropic seas , where
Winter	DATE	kindlier smiles Than doth the
Summer	DATE	of our northern strands .

		And I would wander on the golden sands Of tropic rivers , reaching miles on miles Thro ' orchid-bowers , where the sun beguiles Our hearts with scattered gifts from lavish hands .

		Then Homer to the Old World carries me In hollow ships across the crested main ; And Chaucer shows each April-haunted lane Of
England	LOCATION	.

		Spenser gives enchanted sea , His
summer	DATE	woods , and purple pageantry ,
While Dante	ORGANIZATION	guides me through the world of pain . '' ''

		When Hearts Are Trumps '' is a collection of trifles , by turn sentimental and jocose .

		They are lamentably lacking in finish , and not always in good taste . ''

		Why was it always my fate to endure ? ''

		will not do for the closing verse of a sonnet , and '' She 's accustomed to sitting on rocks in the glen ; She is also accustomed to sitting on men , '' will not do for the closing couplet of any kind of a jingle that is expected to be taken seriously .

		We are not sure that '' When You Are Rejected '' will do , either ; but we leave that question for our read - ers to decide .

		`` Do n't say , ' Good day , ' Then grab the door and slam it .

		Be quite Polite : Go out , and then say , ' it ! ' ''

		The neatest thing we have found in the volume is '' A Drop Too Much '' : '' I praised her hair , I praised her lips , She looked up with surprise ; I bowed to kiss her finger-tips , And then she dropped her eyes . ''

		I said love ruled the world , that 1 Adored her ; called her '
Nan	PERSON	. '

		She merely looked a little shy , And then she dropped her fan . ''

		I took the hint , and at her feet I knelt yes , quite absurd ; But oh , my fond heart wildly beat To hear her drop a word . ''

		I told her all : my talents few , My direful lack of pelf .

		-LRB- We all have erred . -RRB-

		She said '
Ahem	LOCATION	, ' And then dropped me myself . ''

		A word of praise should be given to the dainty dress given by the publishers to this and the two preceding volumes .

MOKTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Amid the multitude of books about A favorite book
Venice	LOCATION	, Life on the Lagoons , '' by about
Venice	LOCATION	. '

		. '

		Mr.
Horatio	PERSON	r .

		Brown , well deserves the new and fuller edition just given it by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It represents minute investiga - tion and a well-nigh complete acquaintance with the history and customs of that city of many vicissitudes .

		Every fact is verified by painstaking research , in museum and library , from architect and gondolier .

		Here is no mere '' afterglow '' of European travel , but all that long residence and daily familiarity with picturesque scenes can give to the scholar .

		The author 's faults are all on the side of diffuseness and breadth .

		We feel that with a threefold point of view the historical , the archaeological , and the artistic he is wittingly attempting the work of a
Lanciani	LOCATION	, a
Symonds	LOCATION	, and a Howells or
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	, all in one volume .

		We are even slightly an - noyed to find so able and conscientious a writer go - ing so widely afield .

		While he nobly proves his own versatility , he leaves the reader uncertain as to his real object .

		The title , '' Life on the Lagoons , '' is itself misleading .

		One recalls , at so poetic a title , the roseate hues and warmth of the '' pink '' city , and scarcely forgives the writer for the matter-of - fact and prosaic method of treatment apparent in the opening chapters especially .

		The two points open to criticism are alike due to the book 's com - prehensiveness .

		It is scarcely to be expected that a couple of dozen topics , ranging from banks and ferros to villottes , should be woven together into a consistent whole .

		And if such a collection of odd sketches is necessarily fragmentary , it is likely also to be deficient in that indefinable and peculiarly Venetian quality , atmosphere .

		The first paper we will not say chapter , the sketches are so evi - dently written with no aim at continuity is a pre - cise condensation of all Venetian history , which the author '' trusts may prove useful '' to visitors .

		The papers following , '' The Gondola , '' '' The Traghetti , '' '' A Gondolier 's Bank , '' '' Sails and Sail-making , '' reveal an almost technical accuracy , and from the very novelty of their separate treatment are inter - esting as well as '' useful . ''

		Perhaps the nearest approach to color is in the pages descriptive of All Souls ' Day and popular superstitions .

		Information , pressed down and running over , is occasionally en - livened by a gleam of quaint humor ; as when the author drolly says , '' Dreams are so important in the conduct of life , and it is so dangerous to lose one , that this belief may in part account for the univer - sal custom of sleeping with the outer shutters closed . ''

		The illustrations of the book are either too few or too many , according as it is viewed as a descriptive sketch-book or a collection of information .

		In the latter case , they do not illustrate as well as the dia - grams , though it would doubtless be considered a manifest absurdity to print a book about
Venice	LOCATION	, however learned or scholarly , without pictures of a gondola ,
San Giorgio	LOCATION	, and the bathers at
Lido	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 69 West Irish Folk-Tales .

		The two earlier volumes of '' The Camden Library '' -LRB-
Elliot Stock	ORGANIZATION	, Lon - don -RRB- dealt with the Antiquities and Curiosities of the Exchequer , and the Sculptured Signs of
London	LOCATION	.

		The third number contains a very good collection of `` West Irish Folk-Tales , '' by Will - iam Larminie .

		The field of Irish folk-lore is but little worked , and a large part of the work already done lacks definiteness and scientific value .

		Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	's work appears to be accurate and pains - taking .

		His stories at times approach those of Ger - many , at other times those of the
Highland Scotch	LOCATION	.

		He believes that they show influence of two or more ethnic streams presenting a curious mixture of the domesticity of the Teutonic and the wildness of the Gaelic races .

		This peculiarly wild character emotional , variable , explosive , is shown repeatedly in the stories .

		Very conspicuous in the style is that remarkable involution where subordinate and sub - subordinate matter is introduced into the narrative until one is almost in despair of ever again finding the `` thread of the story . ''

		Certain set passages re - cur in story after story , and certain stock incidents appear again and again .

		Thus , '' she smothered him with kisses and drowned him with tears : she dried him with the finest cloths and with silk , '' is a favorite passage .

		These '' runs '' are frequently in mysterious language , incomprehensible now and perhaps always meaningless .

		Besides comparisons pointed out by the author , others might be men - tioned .

		Thus , the incident of the hunter who kills a raven , whose red blood staining the white snow leads him to vow that he will never marry a woman '' whose head was not as black as the bird 's wing , and her skin as white as the snow and her cheeks as red as the blood , '' recurs in American Indian folk-lore .

		The decision of the girl-wife as to whether a foal belongs to the mare or the horse suggests that in

Angola	LOCATION	Tale of '' The Lawsuit of Leop - ard and Antelope . ''

		Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	urges the im - portance of writing down folk-lore in the Gaelic language , and gives specimens in Gaelic phonetically spelt .

		The new volume by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, en - titled ''
Verona	LOCATION	and Other Lectures , '' is published in this country by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In order to secure copyright under the American law , the type has been reset ; and we mention this fact mainly for the purpose of calling attention to the remarkable way in which the mechanical features of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's own edi - tions have been imitated .

		Typography , paper , and binding all follow so closely the books issuing from Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	's establishment that one has to look twice before realizing that he has to do with an American imitation .

		As long as the objection - able clause of our copyright law remains , we shall have to put up with imitations ; and thanks are due to any publisher who will copy so well a good En - glish edition .

		The difference between a good copy and a poor one is well illustrated by a comparison A new volume of Essays by Mr ,
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		of this volume with the volumes in which Professor Huxley 's '' Collected Essays '' are now issuing from the American press .

		The contents of this volume -LRB- which Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	edits -RRB- are five lectures dating from
1870	DATE	to
1885	DATE	.

		The first and most gen - erally interesting is a talk about ''
Verona	LOCATION	and Its Rivers . ''

		It touches not only upon the history and art of the beautiful city of the Adige , but also upon the importance of properly controlling the rivers of
Italy	LOCATION	, in avoidance of the havoc wrought by freshets and for increase of the fruitfulness of the soil .

		Of the other lectures , one is a sort of supple - ment to ''
Aratra Pentelici	PERSON	, '' and two were intended for a new volume of `` Our Fathers Have Told Us . ''

		The editor explains just how these latter two were to fit into the scheme of the work as originally planned .

		The remaining lecture , '' The Story of Arachne , '' is a brief address to students at Wool - wich , made in
1870	DATE	.

		If we are to have an extract , it may as well come from this lecture , and the clos - ing passage is now not without a certain timeliness .

		`` I have some workmen myself , and have had , for many years , under me .

		Heaven knows I am not independent of them ; and I do not think they either are , or wish to be , independent of me .

		We depend heartily , and always , they upon my word , and upon my desire for their welfare ; I , upon their work , and their pride in doing it well , and , I think , also , their desire tc do it well for me .

		Believe me , my friends , there is no such thing as independence till we die .

		In the grave we shall be independent to purpose , not till then .

		While we live , the de - fence and prosperity of our country depends less even on hearts of oak than on hearts of flesh ; on the patience which seeks improvement with hope but not with haste ; on the science which discerns what is lovely in character and honorable in act ; and on the Fine Art and tact of happy submission to the guidance of good men , and the laws of na - ture , and of heaven . ''

		Lights and Mr - J - B -
Yeate	ORGANIZATION	's `` A
Celtic Twi	ORGANIZATION	- shadows of a light '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a pretty book
Celtic Twilight	ORGANIZATION	.

		O f gome two hundred pages , contain - ing twenty brief tales and sketches written mostly for `` The National Observer . ''

		Most of the stories were told Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	by one
Paddy Flynn	PERSON	, a '' little bright-eyed old man who lived in a leaky and one - roomed cabin in the village of Ballisadore '' the most '' gentle , '' that is the most faery , place in
County Sligo	LOCATION	.

		So full was
Paddy	ORGANIZATION	's head of the lore of dhouls and fairies , water-horses , kelpies , house - ghosts , and the like local hobgoblins , that he was more than suspected of being a little uncanny him - self .

		It was whispered about that he had '' strange sights to keep him cheerful or to make him sad '' ; and he owned that he had once seen the banshee '' down there , '' as he said , '' by the water , batting the river with its hands . ''

		That
Paddy	ORGANIZATION	's vision on this occasion was artificially quickened seems prob - able .

		Like many of the '' finest pisanthry in the world , '' he had a liking for potheen ; and , indeed , 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, his death was brought about by the gift of a large bottle of it .

		The sight of so much liquor , says the author quaintly , '' filled him with a great enthusiasm , and he lived upon it for some days , and then died . ''

		Death kindly closed his eyes to the fact when the potheen was nearly exhausted .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	filled his note-book with

		Besides the folk-lore , there are some amus - ing character sketches notably '' The Last Glee - man , '' being the account of one
Michael Moran	PERSON	, a blind beggar and ballad-singer , and the admitted rector of his class in
Dublin	LOCATION	. ''

		He was not much to look at , with his coarse frieze coat with its cape and scalloped edge , his old corduroy trousers and great brogues , and his stout stick made fast to his wrist by a thong of leather ; and he would have been a woeful shock to the gleeman Maclonglinne could that friend of kings have beheld him in pro- phetic vision from the pillar stone at
Cork	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Yet
Michael	PERSON	was a true gleeman , being poet , jester , and newsman of the people .

		In the morning his wife or a neighbor would read the newspaper to him until interrupted with , '' That 'll do I have me medita - tions '' ; and he would sally forth duly inspired for the day 's store of jest and rhyme .

		We subjoin a specimen of his lighter improvisation : '' In
Egypt	LOCATION	's land contagious to the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	,
King Pharaoh	LOCATION	's daughter went to bathe in style .

		She tuk her dip , then walked unto the land ; To dry her royal pelt she ran along the strand .

		A bulrush tripped her , whereupon she saw A smiling babby in a wad o ' straw .

		She tuk it up , and said , with accents mild , ' Tare-an ' - agers , girls , which av yez owns the child ? ' ''

		As a metaphysician , says
Macaulay	PERSON	, '' he anticipated

California	LOCATION	from
1871	DATE	to
1873	DATE	, and after - wards represented that

		His political speeches are patriotic in tone , and discuss a great variety of local and national questions .

		Two of his lectures are entitled ''
Charles James Fox	PERSON	, '' and '' Morals and Politics . ''

		Some newspaper and mag - azine articles are also published .

		The book is issued by Messrs.

		The general aim of this system is to secure a harmonious and symmetrical de - velopment of the entire body .

		As a popular exposition of fundamental physical prin - ciples , the work will do well enough , but confidence in the author 's judgment is a little shaken by the way in which he toys with the vagaries of spiritualism and telepathy , and suggests that the ingenious speculations of the non-Euclidean geometers may be subject to ex - perimental confirmation .

		Mr.
Samuel Harden Church	PERSON	's `` Oliver Cromwell '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is an octavo of more than five hundred pages .

		The author claims to have taken a middle course be - tween

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
July S6 , 1894	DATE	.

		The chief event of the month in the literary world is of course the publication in the '' Century Magazine '' of the first instalment of the Poe-Griswold correspond - ence .

		The existence of these papers has been known to a number of people for many years , but all efforts to persuade the late Dr.
George H. Moore	PERSON	, their custodian , to allow them to be inspected , failed utterly .

		It was understood that Dr.
Moore	PERSON	, who was
Griswold	PERSON	's literary executor , intended to publish selections from them him - self , but if this were his intention , it was never fulfilled .

		Dr.
Moore	PERSON	having died ,
Griswold	PERSON	's son , Mr.
William M. Griswold	PERSON	, of
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, was appointed ad - ministrator of his father 's estate , and in this way was able to recover the papers .

		Nearly everybody who has written about
Poe	PERSON	since
Griswold	ORGANIZATION	's death has applied in vain to Dr.
Moore	PERSON	for their use .

		The instalment in the
August	DATE	number of the '' Century '' comprises a num - ber of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's own letters , and letters to him from
John P. Kennedy	PERSON	,
T. W. White	PERSON	, proprietor of the '' Southern Literary Messenger , ''
Nathaniel Beverly Tucker	PERSON	, au - thor of '' The Partisan Leader , ''
J. K. Paulding	PERSON	,
Charles Anthon	PERSON	, and
James E. Heath	PERSON	.

		The correspondence chiefly relates to the period of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's connection with the '' Messenger . ''

		An interest - ing feature is the picture given of publishing conditions in
New York	LOCATION	at that time .

		A
New York	LOCATION	firm having declined a volume of
Poe	PERSON	's '' Messenger '' tales in
1836	DATE	,
Paulding	LOCATION	, who acted as his agent , was constrained to write him that '' it would afford me much pleasure to have proposed the publication of your book to some one -LSB- other -RSB- respectable Bookseller of this city .

		But the truth is , there is only one other who publishes any - thing but School Books , religious works , and the like , THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, and with him I am not on terms that would make it agreeable to me to make any proposition of this nature , either in my own behalf or that of another . ''

		I presume the other firm referred to was that of
Messrs. Wiley & Putnam	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Poe	PERSON	correspondence is illustrated with selected drawings by Mr.
Sterner	PERSON	, made for the forth - coming complete edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's works to be published by
Messrs. Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another notable feature of the
August	DATE	'' Century '' is an article on '' Conversation in
France	LOCATION	'' by Mme.
Blanc Bentzon	PERSON	.

		In the
September	DATE	number there will be an interesting study of '' School Excursions in Ger - many , '' by Dr.
J. M. Rice	PERSON	, author of several important studies of schools in American cities , recently published in the '' Forum . ''

		Dr.
Rice	PERSON	visited
Germany	LOCATION	for the purpose of taking part in a typical excursion which is here described .

		It consisted of a tour of two weeks , on foot or by rail , through the country of the
Reforma	LOCATION	- tion , which had been the particular study of this party of school children for the preceding term .

		Students of pedagogy accompany these excursions and observe their effect upon the children .

		The thorough identification of localities is indicated by the fact that Luther 's hymn was sung by them in the room in which it was written .

		A new novel by ''
Maarteu Maartens	PERSON	'' will be printed serially in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Bazar '' during the first part of
1895	DATE	.

		The author , Mr.
J. M. W. van der Poorten Schwarz	PERSON	, has removed his residence from ''
Kasteel Lunenburgh	PERSON	, ''
Neerlangbrock	PERSON	, to the Chateau de Zuy - lestein , near
Leersum	LOCATION	, also in
Holland	LOCATION	.

		In a recent let - ter to an American friend , he expressed himself as much gratified by the tender of honorary membership in the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	lately made to him .

		He considered it '' a delicate and kindly compliment '' which gave him much encouragement .

		Mr.
van der Poorten Schwarz	PERSON	is just thirty-five years old , and not thirty - eight , as stated in various biographical articles .

		Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	is spending the
summer	DATE	at
Rye Beach	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, busily engaged on the third volume of his '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, from the Com - promise of
1850	DATE	, '' which the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	now expect to publish during the coming season . ''


George Mandeville	PERSON	's Husband , '' a novel just about to be published by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is de - cidedly reactionary in character in so far as it touches upon the woman question , and indeed it touches upon little else .

		Its author apparently has become disgusted with advanced views on this subject .

		The downtrodden husband of a '' woman of mind '' expresses himself in advice to their daughter as follows : '' ` Never breakfast in bed ,
Rosina	LOCATION	, unless you 're actually ill , ' he would often say ; ' it 's the first step on the downward path . ' '' '

		No , father . ' '' '

		Of course your mother is an exceptional woman .

		She may do things that would n't look well in an ordinary mor - tal . ' '' '

		Yes , father . ' '' '

		And never wear a dressing-gown out of your own room .

		Put on decent clothes as soon as you step out of your bath . ' '

		`` Yes , father . ' ''

		The author is a well-known English writer who has as - sumed a pseudonym .

		Preparations for holiday books go on apace .

		Messrs.
Lovell	PERSON	,
Coryell , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue this fall a handsome edition of '' The Last Days of
Pompeii	LOCATION	'' with views of the excavations , landscapes , and reproductions of fa - mous paintings .

		The same firm will also publish an edition de luxe of Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's '' Victorian Age of English Literature , '' with portraits of the principal writers considered .

		Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's articles now ap - pearing in the '' Century Magazine , '' which deal with '' The Reign of Queen
Anne	PERSON	, '' will be published as a holiday book with this title .

		The publishers have ex - erted themselves to insure a beautiful piece of book - making .

		The work in the wood engravings is not likely to be exceeded this year , if at all , as it seems as nearly perfect as possible .

		In '' The

United Kingdom	LOCATION	, Professor
Drummond	PERSON	's '' The Ascent of Man '' and Mrs.

		Out of the thirteen lists , seven are headed by the for - mer and five by the latter work .

		The Fe * libres are going to indulge in more elaborate fetes this year .

		They are to begin at

		It will consist of over eight hundred pages , copiously illustrated with drawings and maps made ex - pressly for the work .

		The English translation , edited by Professor Sayce , will be published by the
S. P. C. K	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is interesting to learn that
Lionardo da Vinci	PERSON	's `` Codice Atlantico , '' which contains 1,750 writings and drawings by this celebrated man , is at last to be pub - lished , presumably by private subscription , in 35 parts , each containing 40 heliotype plates of reproduction , to - gether with a double transcription of the text and notes .

		The entire work will be printed on special handmade paper .

		A new life of
Tasso	LOCATION	is being written for this occasion by Professor
Angelo Solerti	PERSON	, of
Bologna	LOCATION	.

		This book will embody the valuable matter contained in some 500 documents hitherto unpublished , and will be illustrated with pho - togravures of all the portraits of which copies can be obtained , besides other interesting memorials .

		Profes - sor Solerti is also preparing a new and critical edition of the minor poems of
Tasso	LOCATION	, of which two volumes have been already published .

		The
Toronto	LOCATION	'' Week '' has the following screed from an enraged correspondent : '' Sir Can you or any of your numerous readers inform me how it is that Amer - ican daily and weekly papers are allowed to be carried and called in our streets by newsboys ?

		It is most of - fensive to my ideas of the fitness of things to have the low-class papers of
Detroit	LOCATION	,
Buffalo	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	flouted in the streets of
Toronto	LOCATION	.

		It is bad enough to have our second-class booksellers ' shops slopping over with the trash that proceeds from the low American daily and weekly press , without having it stuck under our noses at every corner of the street . ''

		The '' Athenjeum '' furnishes the following note : '' That ' Hamlet ' has been more variously treated and ill treated than any other Shakespearean play we all know , but it will be news to our readers that the Ham - let-Problem as the Germans call it , is shortly to figure in the courts of law .

		The bone of contention is the pri - ority of a certain ingenious analysis of Hamlet 's char - acter .


Herr H. Tiirck	PERSON	, a well-known Shakespearean scholar , maintains that he propounded it first , whilst Professor
Kuno Fischer	PERSON	claims the priority of its excog - itation .

		In consequence of this literary squabble ,
Herr Tiirck	PERSON	has placed the ' Hamlet-Problem ' in the hands of a lawyer .

		It will occupy the law courts at
Munich	LOCATION	, Professor
Kuno Fischer	PERSON	's remarks having appeared in a Bavarian paper . ''

		The
George William Curtis Memorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	publish the following statement : '' The committee has unanimously voted to raise a fund of

		The details of these two fea - tures of the memorial will be determined and announced by the committee hereafter .

		The committee is now ready to receive subscriptions to the fund required , which subscriptions should be addressed to Mr.
William L. Trenholm	PERSON	, treasurer , No. 160 Broadway ,
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		WHY FICTION ALONE AS SERIALS ?

		Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, in a recent number of '' The Au - thor , '' raises an interesting question as to why matter for serial publication in periodicals should be limited to fiction , and suggests that '' editors do not as yet recog - nize the fact that an extremely attractive serial may be made of a subject not belonging to fiction at all .

		For instance , many volumes of poetry are run through va - rious magazines first .

		I would run them through one magazine only .

		Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's new volume of verse will be commenced in the
January	DATE	number of the '' New Year '' ; it will run through twelve months and will be published in volume form in
November	DATE	. '

		Would not such an announcement be attractive ?

		Or this : ` Pro- fessor
Dowden	PERSON	's new work on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is nearly completed .

		It consists of twelve chapters , and is to run through twelve numbers of the '' Cheapside '' magazine ; it will then be published in the autumn books of Messrs.
Bungay	PERSON	. '

		Does anyone pretend that the comparatively wide circulation of the magazine would not assist the author in disseminating his teaching and the publisher in afterwards distributing the book ? ''

		PROTECTION OF AUTHORS FROM GARBLED REPRINTS .

		Judge
Dallas	LOCATION	, of the
United States Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	, sit - ting in the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, recently made a decision of much importance to authors .

		It was occasioned by a garbled and incomplete report of Pro- fessor
Drummond	PERSON	's lecture on '' The Ascent of Man , '' published in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The question involved was not copyright , but the right of an English author to pro- tection against reprints that misrepresent the character of his works .

		We print the significant parts of Judge THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	,
Dallas	LOCATION	's decision : '' It appears that the defendant has published , and to a considerable extent has sold , a book purporting to contain certain Lectures delivered by the plaintiff , which in fact does not present those Lectures correctly , but with additions and omissions which essen - tially alter the productions of the author .

		This is sought to be justified by the averment that the lectures in ques - tion had not been copyrighted , and that their author had dedicated them to the public . ''

		The subject of copyright is not directly involved .

		The complainant does not base his claim to relief upon the statute , but upon his right , quite distinct from any conferred by copyright , to protection against having any literary matter published as his work which is not ac - tually his creation , and , incidentally , to prevent fraud upon purchasers .

		That such right exists is too well set - tled , upou reason and authority , to require demonstra - tion , and , although it is equally well established that an author may , by dedication of any product of his pen to the public , irrevocably abandon his title , yet in this case the fact relied on by the defendant to support his asser - tion of dedication wholly fails to vindicate the publica - tion complained of . ''

		The defendant 's book is founded on the matter which has appeared in the ' British Weekly , ' and if that mat - ter had been literally copied , and so as not to misrep - resent its character and extent , the plaintiff would be without remedy ; but the fatal weakness in the defend - ant 's position is , that , under color of editing the author 's work , he has represented a part of it as the whole , and even as to the portion published has materially departed from the reports which he sets up in justification .

		97 A YEAR OF
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		ii .

		Resuming the survey begun in our last is - sue of the year 's literary production upon the European continent , we will first turn to the
Commendatore Bonghi	ORGANIZATION	's report of Italian let - ters .

		The death of
Adolfo Bartoli	PERSON	, the liter - ary historian , appears to have been the most important event of the year .

		He '' was largely instrumental in introducing a method of crit - icism which , in more respects than one , was new to
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		He found many followers in his work , and the way is gradually being prepared , in the author 's view , '' for a full and elaborate history of Italian literature conceived upon a more comprehensive scale than anything that is yet in existence . ''

		Signer d'Annunzio 's last novel , '' II Trionfo della Morte , '' is the most important work of fiction mentioned . ''

		The triumph of death in this case is due to a lover who ends his career by killing his mistress and himself . ''

		Final judgment upon the work is thus rendered : '' The whole book seems to me false and exaggerated , and I must confess that I found the perusal of its five hundred pages an irksome task .

		Nevertheless there are fine passages in it , for Signer d'Annunzio possesses a real talent for description , and he occasionally strikes the note of passion with a ring of sincerity .

		The mor - ality of the book is anything but wholesome ; it shows the influence of Zola on every page . ''


Signora Serao	PERSON	, who is the favorite authoress with the novel-reading public , has published two volumes of tales and sketches .

		In poetry ,
Signor Carducci	PERSON	has published nothing , but his '' evolution '' has '' been made the subject of a discreetly successful book by a young man named Panzini . ''

		We are further told that '' bad poets , as usual , abound , although the newspapers tell a different tale .

		But news - papers , whether political or literary , as a rule merely reproduce in their criticisms the pub - lisher 's advertisements , which are , of course , extravagantly laudatory . ''

		None of the poets of the year '' is quite equal to a journey across the Alps , except perhaps
Alfredo Baccelli	PERSON	.

		... His style is refined , his language well chosen , and his subjects interesting .

		His book is called ' Vittime e Rebelli , ' and I should be inclined to rank it above any other contribution to the poetry of the year . ''

		In history , the writer calls for more art and less matter , com - plaining that we get nothing but documents and special researches . ''

		In this department of literature the book of the year was undoubt - edly the collected edition of the letters of Col - uccio Salutati , a celebrated philologist and statesman of the fourteenth century , brought out by the historical Institute . ''

		Finally , men - tion is made of the newly organized Society of French Studies in
Italy	LOCATION	, which , by encourag - ing a wider acquaintance with French litera - ture , will make things uncomfortable for the too obvious plagiarist and imitator .

		80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	,
Don Juan F. Riano	PERSON	gives much interest to the story of the literary year in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		That country is fortunate in the possession of acad - emies that are willing '' to undertake the pub - lication of costly works not likely to have a large circulation . ''

		The
Academy of History	ORGANIZATION	, for example , has superintended the issue of several important works , and the
Academia Espanola	LOCATION	has published '' La Filologia Castel - lana , '' by Count de la Vinaza , and the ''
Teatro Complete	ORGANIZATION	de Juan de la
Encino	LOCATION	, '' besides con - tinuing its monumental edition of
Lope de Vega	LOCATION	, and its '' Antologia de Poetas Hispano - Americanos . ''

		Columbus and the
Melilla	LOCATION	af - fair have been the most '' actual '' subjects of historical writing during the year .

		The most important contribution to the former is Senor Castelar 's '' Colon , '' while the latter has called forth many books and pamphlets .

		A work upon '' La Toma de Granada , '' by Senor Da - valos y Lerchundi , calls for the following in - teresting note : '' Ever since the capture of
Granada	LOCATION	on the 2d of
January , 1492	DATE	, the
Royal Maestranza	ORGANIZATION	has celebrated that event by meeting in the
Bibarambla	LOCATION	, and other squares in
Granada	LOCATION	, for the purpose of celebrating a mock tournament , jousting and tilting with canas .

		On the 2d of
January	DATE	last , which happened to be the quar - ter-centenary of the conquest of that city as well as that of the discovery of the New World , the master riders of
Granada	LOCATION	decided that , instead of holding the anti- quated tournament , a prize should be offered to the best composition in prose or verse recording the taking of
Granada	LOCATION	.

		This the above-mentioned writer has accom - plished in a creditable manner , at the same time giving the names and particulars of the titled nobility , prelates , and knights who appended their signatures to the ca - pitulation . ''

		Among works of a belletristic character , men - tion is made of '' Margaritas , '' a volume of poems by Senor Li meres ; '' Torquemada en la
Cruz	PERSON	, '' a novel by
Senor Perez Galdos	PERSON	; and '' Origin del Pensamiento '' and '' El
Maes	PERSON	- trante , '' novels by
Senor Palacio Valdes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two important dramas , the `` Mariana '' of
Senor Echegaray	PERSON	and the '' Dolores '' of Senor Felin y
Codina	LOCATION	, have been performed during the year , and have disputed for the dramatic prize of a thousand dollars . ''

		At last the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	by a majority of votes de - cided in favour of
Echegaray	LOCATION	, a decision which the dis - appointed party resented , a somewhat fierce polemic in the newspapers of
Madrid	LOCATION	being the consequence . ''

		The author concludes with these remarks upon the general literary situation : '' The demand for books is great and constant , and authors and publishers are making efforts to supply it , no matter how : the consequence is that all is in con - fusion , and anarchy prevails in every branch of litera - ture , some few still holding tenaciously to the old school with slight modifications , whilst others -LRB- and they are unluckily the greater number -RRB- follow no school and recognize no rule whatever .

		No wonder then if
Zola	ORGANIZATION	's novels and
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's lucubrations are the fashion of the day . ''

		Professor
S. O. Lambros	PERSON	writes of literary
Greece	LOCATION	, and tells as long a story as was to be expected of so small a country .

		He begins with a summary of '' Mycena3 and the
Mycen	PERSON	- aean Culture , '' by
Christos Tsuntas	PERSON	, the most important publication of the year .

		The mem - oirs of
Spyridon Pilikas	PERSON	and
Alexander Rhan	PERSON	- gabe are of much historical value .


Kleon Rhangabe	PERSON	, a son of the diplomatist just men - tioned , is the author of '' Poems of Sorrow , '' the most important verse of the year .

		Fiction is represented by '' Our
Athens	LOCATION	, '' a social novel by
Nicolas Spandonis	PERSON	; '' The Prime Minister , '' a political romance by
G. Vokos	PERSON	; and volumes of tales by
Constantine Passajiannis	PERSON	, Deme - trius Hatzopulos , and the late
Constantine Krystallis	PERSON	. ''

		Tobacco Juliet , '' a novel by
Zsigmond Justh	PERSON	, is the best Hungarian novel of the year , according to
Herr Leopold Katscher	PERSON	: '' In this book
Justh	PERSON	, who is at the head of the more distinguished Hungarian realists of our day , presents a picture , equally ideal and natural , of plain , simple coun - try life .

		Truth is here turned into fiction in a manner strongly resembling
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's , and it is not too much to say that the author has , by this latest work of his , reached the front rank of Hungarian fiction . ''

		A long list of other novels is given , but their authors are practically unknown outside of
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		The same remark may be made of the poets , of whom
Gybzb Dolmady	PERSON	, with his patriotic songs ,
Erno Erodi	PERSON	, with his monody on Kossuth , and
Jenb Heltai	PERSON	, with his Kipling - like lyrics , are singled out for honorable men - tion .

		The following remarks are of general interest : '' Of the many lives of Kossuth which have appeared the best is the one written by
Lajos Hentaller	PERSON	.

		Of course ,
Jdkai	PERSON	's jubilee -LRB- his seventieth birthday , which , by the way , was celebrated in the most enthusiastic manner throughout the country -RRB- has also called forth various biographical publications .

		The first ten vol - umes of the hundred-volume edition of this master 's novels -LRB- about two thousand copies of which at 201 .

		have been subscribed for -RRB- have just been issued . ''

		Gebauer 's '' Historical Grammar of the Bo - hemian Language '' is described by Mr.
V. Tille	PERSON	as '' the most important -LSB- Bohemian -RSB- pub - lication of the past twelve months . ''

		The first part only has appeared , but others will soon follow .

		Mr.
Tille	PERSON	gives most of his attention to belles-lettres , which '' are from year to year becoming more subject to the new ideas which have for some time stirred all European 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 literature , and are symptoms of a deep intellectual rev - olution .

		Their influence is most conspicuous in the pro- ductions of the younger generation . ''

		In poetry , there are volumes by Vrchlicky ,
Machar	PERSON	,
Dvorak	PERSON	, and others ; in fiction , many interesting things .

		Two novels are thus char - acterized : ''
V. Mristfk	PERSON	strives to describe in his novel '
Santa Lucia	LOCATION	' the struggle for existence and the impressions of a poor student in
Prague	LOCATION	.

		But the leading ideas grow misty , and the want of a skilful hand , which could bring order into the multitude of scenes and characters , is sorely felt .

		Much the same thing may be said with regard to
F. A. Simacek	PERSON	's ' Two Loves . '

		Life amongst the superior and inferior employes on country estates and in sugar manufactories is minutely and ably de - scribed ; still the leading idea of the whole , the new at - tachment of an official who had been engaged for many years to another girl , and the conflicts of his conscience , is touched upon only in its outward phases , reminding the reader of many old similar romantic types , and forming merely a frame for details of life well worked out . ''

		The following bit of information is particularly welcome : '' At last a few competent writers are beginning to bestow some pains upon literature for children .

		A for - eigner can hardly conceive with what trash Bohemian children nsed to be supplied by writers , male and fe - male , and how hopeless the search for a good chil - dren 's book was .

		Only quite lately an improvement has been noticeable , and last year two particularly nice books appeared an illustrated Bohemian history by
Dolensky	ORGANIZATION	, under the supervision of Professor
Rezek	PERSON	, of
Prague University	ORGANIZATION	, and ' Old Bohemian Historical Tales , ' by Jirdsek . ''

		Two or three noteworthy historical works , one play , one book of poems , several novels , and a considerable quantity of Kosciuszko lit - erature , are the leading features of Dr.
Adam Belcikowski	PERSON	's report of Polish letters .

		The poems are by
A. Asnyk	PERSON	, `` the most remarka - ble Polish poet of the day , at once a finished artist and a deep thinker . ''

		The play is
K. Zalewski	PERSON	's '' What Mean You by It ? ''

		having '' for its subject an ethical question , which the author answers in somewhat pessimistic fashion ,
viz.	LOCATION	, whether an honorable deed completed in obedience to the dictates of conscience is ap - preciated by the world or not . ''

		Of the works of fiction mentioned , five seem to be of excep - tional interest . ''

		Emancipation , '' by
B. Prus	PERSON	, deals with the '' woman question . '' ''

		Naphtha , '' by
Maciejowski	PERSON	, '' describes with uncommon energy and much spirit the life of the great contractors and the poor workmen in a
Gali	LOCATION	- cian petroleum bed . ''

		`` The Two Poles , '' by
E. Orzeszko	PERSON	, is a psychological romance of two young people who love one another , but who '' separate because they perceive that the dif - ference between their ideas and their views of the world is so great that they could find no happiness in living together . '' ''

		There Am I , '' by
A. Krechowiecki	PERSON	, is upon the theme '' that an artist can not attain to intellectual ripeness so long as he has not through suffering and higher feelings reached a moral equilibrium . ''

		Finally , the '' Mechesy '' of Gawalewicz , which has made '' a great stir , '' is thus described : '' The plot turns upon the marriage of a young lady belonging to the nobility with the son of a banker of Jewish extraction .

		The bride finds herself so strange and uncomfortable in her novel surroundings that she separates from her husband , although she sees and ac - knowledges his many merits .

		The dt/serted husband seeks in his turn to get rid of the stamp of his origin by developing a great activity as a patriot . ''

		The absence of
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	from the list of the year 's novelists is conspicuous .

		The latest of the nations to enter into the literary comity of
Europe	LOCATION	shall be the subject of the last of these summaries .

		M.
Paul Mil	PERSON	- youkov writes of Russian literature in the phil - osophical spirit , and his account is of much in - terest , although few important works are men - tioned .

		The most important , perhaps , is '' The Turning Point , '' by
Boborikin	PERSON	, a novel not yet completed , which reflects the successive phases of Russian thought during the past half-cen - tury .

		The great social discussion of the pres - ent in
Russia	LOCATION	is between the '' peasantists '' and the '' Marxists . '' ''

		While ' peasant ism ' puts its faith exclusively in the character and < spirit ' of the people , ' Marxism ' rests all its hopes on ' institutions ' ; while the former is inclined to regard the fundamental principles of national life as primordial and immutable , the latter believes in the necessity of social evolution ; and , lastly , while the for - mer limits its practical programme to social reforms by the people , the latter is ready to join in the bourgeois demand for political reforms for the people . ''

		This discussion is voiced in many current pub - lications .

		Among the many books named by the writer , only two others appear of sufficient interest to be mentioned here .

		One is
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Veselovsky	PERSON	's study of
Boccaccio	LOCATION	, and the other is Count Tolstoy 's '' The Kingdom of God is Within You . ''

		Veselovsky , we are told , '' is at once the greatest authority on the liter - ature of the Middle Ages and one of the most brilliant representatives of the comparative his - torical method in literature . ''

		Of Count Tol - stoy 's work , already put into English , a sum - mary is given , ending with the following sug - gestive statement : `` It is scarcely necessary on this occasion to add that the sphere of influence of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's ideas grows nar - rower every year . ''

		82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN	LOCATION	* For the collegiate year 1894-95 , the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	announces twenty-one courses in En - glish and rhetoric .

		Ten are courses in literature , historical or critical ; five are in linguistics ; and six are in rhetoric and composition .

		There is the usual division into courses which may and courses which must be taken by those who intend to grad - uate , but with us the requirements differ for the different degrees .

		Candidates for the engineering degrees , and for the degree of
Bachelor of Science	ORGANIZATION	in chemistry or biology , are let off with a single course in composition .

		Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Letters must take two courses in composition , besides one in literature and one in linguistics .

		All others are required to elect two courses in composition .

		The work is in charge of four men : a professor of English and rhetoric , who is head of the department ; a junior professor of English , an assistant professor of rhetoric , and an instructor in English composition .

		In addition to this , the regular force , there are two graduate stu - dents who devote a part of their time to teaching composition or reading essays .

		The number of students who elected courses in English the past year , not allowing for names counted twice , was
1198	DATE	.

		To this number should perhaps be added 110 applicants for work in composition for whom provision could not be made .

		The dis - tribution of the elections was as follows : In mod - ern literature , 225 ; in Old and Middle English literature , and linguistics , 252 ; in rhetoric and com - position , 721 .

		In considering the various courses in English , it will be convenient to follow the division I have used above ; that is , into modern literature , Old and Middle English , and linguistics , rhetoric , and com - position .

		The first is the province of Professor
Demmon	PERSON	, who is head of the department ; Profes - sor
Hempl	ORGANIZATION	is in charge of the second ; and the bur - den of the rhetoric and composition work falls upon * This article is the fourteenth of an extended series on the Teaching of English at

		the shoulders of the instructor -LRB- Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	-RRB- , the two assistants , and myself .

		In modern literature , the department offers a be - ginning course and three seminary courses , asso - ciating with the latter ancillary lectures in criticism and the history of the drama .

		The beginning course , in charge of Professor
Hempl	PERSON	, is a general intro - duction to the subject .

		It is a three-hour course , running through one semester .

		In this , a text-book is used to furnish a historical outline , and very brief quizzes are given upon it .

		Most of the time in class is taken up by the presentation of reports by some half-dozen members of the class to whom the lesson of the day had previously been assigned for special study in the
University	ORGANIZATION	library .

		The object of these reports is to bring the student into direct contact with the literature and to familiarize him somewhat with critical methods and the leading books on the subject .

		The seminary courses are conducted by Professor Demmon , and aim to give the student an intimate first-hand acquaintance with representative mas - terpieces .

		To secure admission to this advanced work is somewhat difficult , since at least five pre - scribed courses must precede , and there is some sift - ing even of those who are technically qualified .

		Professor Demmon offers a seminary in English literature , another in American literature , and a Shakespeare seminary .

		The programme of work is as follows : At the beginning of the semester , each member of the class is assigned a masterpiece and asked to prepare upon it a comprehensive biograph - ical and critical essay .

		He is also expected to present at some time during the semester a critique of an essay by a fellow-member .

		As soon as his task is assigned , he begins reading upon it in the seminary rooms con - nected with the library , with the assistance of refer - ences prepared by Professor Demmon .

		If he is a member of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	course , he has the oppor - tunity of using the
McMillan Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	collection of 3500 volumes .

		When the work is under way , each section of the seminary -LRB- a section containing about twelve students -RRB- meets every week in a two-hour ses - sion .

		The first hour is spent in listening to the essay and the critique , and the second hour in an extempor - aneous discussion of the work in hand .

		Each mem - ber is called upon in turn , and says what the spirit moves him to say .

		He makes report upon what he has read , or agrees or disagrees with the judgments of the essayist or the critic , or advances individual appreciations of the work .

		When all opinions have been aired and generally some little fencing takes place over nice points of criticism there is usually time for a summing-up of the arguments and a dis - cussion of a special question or two by the conduc - tor of the seminary .

		Both in the selection of master - pieces and the conduct of the classes , the aim is to supply the necessities rather than the luxuries of literature .

		For literary fads and vagaries there is neither time nor inclination .

		The student finds in the seminary courses the best that English and
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 American literature have to offer .

		If he goes no further , he has already travelled far ; if he con - tinues his studies after leaving the
University	ORGANIZATION	, he will know at least the chief landmarks of the coun - try he is to traverse .

		With reference to the work in Old and
Middle English	LOCATION	, Professor
Hempl	PERSON	has kindly written out for me the following statement : '' My work may generally be designated as lin - guistic ; but some of the undergraduate courses are necessarily only linguistic in a simple and practical way , and consider also the literary side of what is read .

		This is particularly true of the two courses in
Middle English	LOCATION	each twice a week for half a year , the second devoted mostly to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is also an elementary course in Old English , which , as well as the course in
Early Middle English	LOCATION	, is required of candidates for the degree of B.L. '' Advanced study of Old English is provided for in three courses , each half a year : Old English poetry twice a week ; phonology and morphology , three times a week ; syntax , twice a week . ''

		In historical English Grammar a general sur - vey is made of the subject , and the students are given some practice in methods of investigation by being required to trace in English literature the de - velopment of various idioms , especially such as are often impugned . ''

		In alternate years a course is offered in pres - ent-spoken English .

		The students have been set to study their own speech and that of those about them , and have gathered numerous facts of interest as to
American English	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the course has been more fruitful in opening their eyes to the real state of so-called ' standard English , ' and in removing prejudice and establishing a more reasonable basis of judgment in dealing with matters of speech-usage .

		It also appears that a quicker and clearer insight into general linguistic facts and principles may be obtained by such a study of one 's native speech -LRB- pro- vided various forms and stages of it be represented by members of the class -RRB- than can be had from a study of foreign languages .

		Alternating with this course from year to year is a course in general phonetics . ''

		Of the six courses which fall under the division '' Rhetoric and Composition , '' four , each for one semester , have for their main object the cultivation of good writing ; though one of the four , known as the
Science of Rhetoric	ORGANIZATION	, combines with a large amount of practice a small amount of instruction in theory .

		In addition to these , there are two , one for graduates and one for undergraduates , which deal with rhetoric in its scientific aspects .

		For the required Freshman work , there is provided this year a two-hour course in paragraph-writing under Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	and an assistant .

		As in other large uni - versities , this part of the work presents peculiar difficulties .

		The big classes are about as hetero - geneous as they well can be , most of the students writing crudely , some execrably , and only a few as well as could be wished .

		These differences call for differences of treatment , yet it is impossible with our present teaching force to give adequate atten - tion to individuals or to distinguish grades of pro- ficiency .

		The most that can be done is to put in a section by themselves the Engineering students , whose performances in prose are often at the out - set of a quite distressing character .

		The course in paragraph-writing is followed by a two-hour elective course in theme-writing under Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	; and this by a three-hour course , con - ducted by myself .

		The latter is required of all ex - cept the engineers and candidates for the degree of B.S. in chemistry and biology .

		It must be pre - ceded by a course in psychology or logic , and hence is usually taken in the second semester of the Soph - omore year or the first semester of the Junior year .

		An advanced course in composition completes the list of practical courses .

		For those who wish to sup - plement practice by theory , there is a course in the principles of prose style , and a graduate seminary course in which the evolution of rhetoric is traced from
Aristotle	LOCATION	to the present time .

		It will appear , I hope , from this outline , that the work in composition is intended , first and foremost , to be practical .

		The aim is not to inspire students to produce pure literature , if there be any such thing , or even to help them to acquire a beautiful style .

		If we can get them first to think straight - forwardly about subjects in which they are genu - inely interested , and then , after such fashion as na - ture has fitted them for , to express themselves clearly and connectedly , we have done about all we can hope to do .

		Perhaps the other things will then come of themselves .

		In trying to accomplish these ends , I have been accustomed in my own work to aim at three essentials : first , continuity and regu - larity of written exercises ; second , much writing , much criticism , and much consultation ; third , adapt - ation of method to the needs of the individual stu - dent .

		To secure the first , the student is made to write frequently and at regularly recurring periods , and is encouraged to write at set hours regardless of mood or inspiration .

		The second point I may be permitted to illustrate by saying that I have read and re-read this year something over 3000 essays , most of them written by a class of 216 students .

		The third essential seems to me the most important of the three .

		That the instructor should somehow lay hold of the student as an individual is , for successful composition work , simply indis - pensable .

		This was the secret of the older method of instruction , such as that of
Edward Channing	PERSON	, described by the Rev.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	in '' My College Days '' : '' You sat down in the recitation-room , and were called man by man , or boy by boy , in the order in which you came into the room ; you therefore heard his criticism on each of your predecessors .

		Why do you write with blue ink on blue paper ?

		When I was young , we wrote with black ink on white paper ; now you write with blue ink on blue paper . '

		<
Hale	PERSON	, you do not mean to say 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, that you think a Grub Street hack is the superior of
John Milton	PERSON	? ' ''

		I think all teachers of composition will feel that
Ned Channing	PERSON	's method was good , and will under - stand very well how it happened that
Hale	PERSON	and his seatmates '' came out with at least some mechanical knowledge of the mechanical method of handling the English language . ''

		But it must be borne in mind that in the larger universities the day of small and cosy classes is long past .

		Now the hungry gener - ations tread us down .

		We hardly learn the names and faces of our hundreds of students before they break ranks and go their ways , and then we must resume our Sisyphaean labors .

		Is there no way in which we can return to the
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	methods of those early days ?

		For my part , I think there is a way , and a very simple one : Increase the teach - ing force and the equipment to the point where the instructor can again meet his students as individ - uals , and can again have leisure for deliberate con - sultation and personal criticism .

		As Professor
Ge	ORGANIZATION	- nung has well said , the teaching of composition is properly laboratory work .

		If that is true , why should it not be placed on the same footing as other laboratory work as regards manning and equip - ment ?

		I confess that I now and then cast envious eyes upon our
Laboratory of Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	, with its ten instructors and its annual expenditure of ten thousand dollars , and try to imagine what might be done in a rhetorical laboratory with an equal force and a fraction of the expenditure .

		Nor is the com - parison absurd .

		The amount of business which needs to be done in order to secure dexterity in the use of language is not less than that which is needed to secure dexterity in the manipulation of chemicals .

		The student in composition needs as much personal attention as the student in chemistry .

		The teacher of composition , if he is to do his work without loss of time and energy , and if he is to secure the ben - efit which comes from constant variation in meth - ods of instruction , needs all the mechanical helps which he can devise .

		He needs , for example , con - veniences for the collection , the distribution , and the preservation of the written work .

		He needs a set of ''
Poole	PERSON	's Index , '' not in a far-off library , but at his elbow .

		He needs a card-catalogue , revised daily , with thousands of subjects of current interest espe - cially adapted to the uses of his class .

		He needs a mimeograph and a typewriter ; possibly he needs a compositor and a printing-press .

		Above all -LRB- and I do not mean to include these among the mechan - ical aids -RRB- he needs , not one or two , but a score , of bright , active , enthusiastic young assistants to share his arduous labors with him .

		.

		Under these Utopian conditions perhaps not wholly Utopian after all the teacher of composition could no longer pose as a martyr , and so might miss the sympathy he has been so long accustomed to ; but I believe that on the whole he would be a happier man , and I am cer - tain that in the end he would do a vast deal more of good in the world .

		In running over the list of courses offered , it will doubtless be noticed that the department does not announce many which are exclusively for graduate students .

		This must not be taken to imply , how - ever , that provision for such students is not made .

		As a fact , there is always a considerable body who are pursuing advanced work in English .

		Many go into undergraduate courses and there find what is suited to them .

		But for a large proportion special advanced courses are arranged , as they are needed , after consultation with the student .

		These are ob - viously too variable in character to be enumerated here -

		WALTER
PA	ORGANIZATION	TER .

		English prose could have suffered no heavier loss than that of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, who died suddenly at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	on the thirtieth of
July	DATE	.

		He was born in
London	LOCATION	on the fourth of
August , 1839	DATE	, and was thus within a few days of completing his fifty-fifth year .

		His life was that of the typical scholar , out - wardly uneventful .

		Educated at
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, he took his degree in
1862	DATE	, and was elected to a fellowship at Brasenose .

		Since then he has occupied various offices in that college .

		His works are as follows : `` The Renaissance '' -LRB- 1873 -RRB- , `` Ma - rius the Epicurean '' -LRB- 1885 -RRB- , a Imaginary Portraits '' -LRB- 1887 -RRB- , `` Appreciations '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , and `` Plato and Platonism '' -LRB- 1893 -RRB- .

		A series of articles on the French cathedrals , in course of publication in one of the English reviews , will probably add a sixth volume to the definitive edition of his works .

		`` Ma - rius the Epicurean '' was reviewed by the late
H. N. Powers	ORGANIZATION	in THE DIAL for
August , 1885	DATE	; '' Im - aginary Portraits '' in
September , 1887	DATE	; `` Appre - ciations '' by the Rev.
C. A. L. Richards	PERSON	in
June , 1890	DATE	; and ''
Plato	PERSON	and Platonism '' by Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	in
April , 1893	DATE	.

		The five volumes of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's works constitute one of the choicest treasures of English prose .

		Great as is their value considered merely as so much criticism of art , literature , and life , they have a still greater value as masterpieces of literary expression .

		It would hardly be too much to claim that since the deaths of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	, at least ,
Pater	PERSON	has been the greatest of English prose-writers , just as
Tennyson	PERSON	was for so many years the greatest of English poets . ''

		Marius the Epicurean '' is a classic if there ever was one , and , what is more , it bore so manifestly the sign and seal of artistic excellence that it won instant recognition as a classic from all competent critics .

		The four '' Imaginary Portraits '' of the volume that soon followed are akin to ''
Marius	PERSON	'' in their method and aim .

		In the two volumes of essays , art and literature receive attention about equally , and both of these great subjects are han - dled with equal mastery .

		The grace , the insight , the subtle discrimination , and the delicate art dis -

		THE DIAL 85 played in these collections are almost beyond praise .

		As for the '' Plato and Platonism , '' we can not do better than quote from our own pages the dictum of the foremost American Platonist , that '' it has the rare distinction of being right and just through - out , '' that '' it is the first true and correctly pro- portioned presentation of Platonism that has been given to the general reader .

Francis H. Underwood	PERSON	, born in
Enfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, on the twelfth of
January , 1825	DATE	, died at
Leith	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, on the seventh of
August	DATE	.

		He was edu - cated at
Amherst	LOCATION	, taught school for a while , and then practised law .

		He became literary adviser for the house of
Phillips	PERSON	and
Sampson	PERSON	, and was one of the founders of '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' being as - sociated with
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	in its editorship .

		From
1859	DATE	to 1870 he served as
Clerk of the Superior Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	.

		He was also a member of the
Boston	LOCATION	school board for thirteen years .

		He was one of the founders of the
St. Botolph	ORGANIZATION	's and
Papyrus Clubs	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since
1885	DATE	he has lived in
Europe	LOCATION	, with the ex - ception of the year 1892-93 .

		He succeeded Mr.
Harte	PERSON	at
Glasgow	LOCATION	as
United States Consul	LOCATION	, and was appointed to a similar post at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	-LRB-
Leith	PERSON	-RRB- only last year .

		He wrote biographies of Long - fellow ,
Whittier	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	PERSON	, and expected to com - plete this quartette of famous
New Englanders	LOCATION	by a biography of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	.

		These biographies are reminiscential rather than critical , and in this char - acter are of great value .

		His latest writings were `` The Poet and the Man '' -LRB- a second and still more intimate study of
Lowell	LOCATION	-RRB- , and the first volume of a projected series on '' The Builders of American Literature . ''

		During the period of his Scottish con - sulate , he lectured frequently upon subjects con - nected with American literature , and also contrib - uted to the English reviews .

		Other publications were a '' Handbook of English Literature , '' a '' Hand - book of American Literature , '' a series of musical stories called '' Cloud Pictures , '' and a novel called '' Lord of Himself . ''

		His most important book , pub - lished in
1892	DATE	, and reviewed in THE DIAL for Feb - ruary 1 ,
1893	DATE	, was '' Quabbin , the Story of a Small Town , with Outlooks upon Puritan Life . ''

		It would be difficult to set too high the interest -LRB- as well as the historical value -RRB- of this picture of a
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts town early in the century .

		We said of it upon its appearance : '' So careful and detailed an ex - hibit of a community , of its outer and inner life , has seldom been attempted , and never more suc - cessfully made .

		To the descendants of Pilgrims and Puritans the work is dedicated , and they , at least , can not read it without being thrilled to the inmost fibre by its sympathetic delineation of their ancestral past , for
New England	LOCATION	is Quabbin very much as Freiligrath declared
Germany	LOCATION	to be Ham - let . ''

		THE TEACHING OF LITERATURE , AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A certain amount taken for granted goes to the un - derstanding of any utterance ; and in the discussion of current topics in public prints a certain point of view , once assumed , is usually understood and respected .

		Mr.
W. H. Johnson	PERSON	of
Denison University	ORGANIZATION	, who objects to my distinctions and strictures directed to certain phases of the current discussion in THE DIAL on the teaching of literature , seems to me to disregard these obvious rules .

		The question under discussion is concerned with the organization of the teaching of literature in English in the higher institutions of learning in
America	LOCATION	.

		The dif - ficulties suggested by me occur to the mind , I think , solely in considering this particular question .

		In sec - ondary institutions , or for the independent and excep - tional teacher , they obviously have little weight .

		Now my intention was to state the difficulty somewhat para - doxically , and not without a feeling for the lurking irony of the logic of the argument .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	writes ad - mirably of the essential inseparableness of subject-mat - ter and form in matters of art , and we all applaud .

		But this is also elementary , while at the same time the gist of the real difficulty resides precisely in this point .

		How far , from the psychological or pedagogical point of view , does the teacher of literature need to go in the exposi - tion of the subject-matter of his text ?

		The extreme in one way , the extreme of license , is well exemplified in the condition of things a few years ago at the Uni - versity of
Indiana	LOCATION	, as revealed by Professor
Sampson	PERSON	's moving account in a recent number of THE DIAL .

		The reaction from the other extreme is voiced in the modern appeal for the teaching of '' mere literature '' again .

		It is perhaps well to understand the dangers on either side , as it is also well to attempt to define , to really define , what the teaching of literature in English from estab - lished chairs actually comprehends .

		Is it literary folk - lore and rudimentary monuments of speech in gen - eral ?

		is it the theory and history of criticism and the various sciences and tentative laws of literary aesthetics ?

		is it the old-fashioned literary history ?

		is it psychology and sociology studied in the documents which record the long imagination of the race ?

		is it a miscellaneous and emotional '' ethics '' ?

		is it solidly philology in the Ger - man sense ?

		What is it ?

		After all , perhaps it would not be a bad thing frankly to retain in every university one professorship at least of Things in General as In - terpreted in the Emotional and
Imaginative Records	ORGANIZATION	of the Race .

		I for one believe it would not be a bad thing , if the right occupant for the chair could always be found .

		Only , of course , there are other dangers , and the thing should be understood .

		The pupil , as pupil , I take it , has really no concern with these distinctions .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's metaphor from explosives is pretty , and one enjoys the sarcasm of it ; but has it anything to do with the case ?

		If our universities insist on specializing in every direc - tion , let it be done orderly and with understanding ; and if there is to be a department of Omuiana let it be rec - ognized as such .

		But from organizers and theorists , at one extreme or the other , let us save the real study of literature , namely , the actual and enthusiastic reading , after whatever method , of the great masterpieces , by the college student .

		A GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT .

		* The editor of these welcome volumes , much as he merits our gratitude for opening to us so much good literature , is hardly to be ranked among those who practice that eternal vigil - ance which is the price of accuracy .

		I have prepared a rather formidable list of misprints , wrong dates , misquotations , and other editorial oversights , and my list is not exhaustive .

		There is no room for these things here ; but my notes are at the service of the editor or the publisher .

		These beautiful volumes are uniform with the edition of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's Letters recently issued by the same publishers , beside which , both as to form and as to contents , they are in every way worthy to find a place on the bookshelf .

		There is something impressive in the very titles of the several papers and addresses here collected ; they inspire confidence in the Re - public by suggesting the moral foundations upon which alone free institutions can rest down , and by reminding us of the worth , the beauty , the dignity of the American character at its best .

		Curtis is gone , and we are sure of him .

		While he lived we seemed to discern in him , through the dust of party conflict and the fog of prejudice , the outlines of a singu - larly high and symmetrical manhood .

		Now that the fog is lifted and the dust laid , we per - ceive him to be of loftier height and more ideal proportions than we had thought .

		Himself the eulogist of so many approved American wor - thies of Sumner and
Phillips	PERSON	, of
Sedgwick	PERSON	and

George William Curtis	PERSON	was , in the words applied by
Edmund Burke	PERSON	to his son , '' born to be a public creature . ''

		wide and select reading ; he enjoyed opportu - nities unequalled , at least in
America	LOCATION	, for inti - macy with literary people ; and he knew how to profit by the advantages of leisurely travel .

		He received also a somewhat careful business training .

		He became known as the author of some dainty , almost euphuistic , novels , notes of travel , and satirical sketches of society .

		In all this there was no prophecy of the future politician and reformer .

		In
1853	DATE	Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	associated himself with
C. F. Briggs	PERSON	and
Parke Godwin	PERSON	in the editor - ship of '' Putnam 's Magazine , '' the most prom - ising literary periodical in
America	LOCATION	before the founding of '' The Atlantic Monthly '' ; and in
October , 1853	DATE	, he first took his seat in the `` Easy Chair '' of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly , '' the original occupant of which was
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	.

		Curtis was preeminently a man of poetic tastes , artistic temperament , and literary aptitudes ; and if any man of his times might reasonably have devoted himself exclusively to a career of letters , he was the man .

		But those were the darkest hours of the conflict against the extension of slavery , and
Curtis	PERSON	had in him something of the strain of
Milton	LOCATION	and of
Roger Williams	PERSON	.

		He could not soar '' in the high reason of his fancies , with his garland and sing - ing-robes about him , '' so long as that '' troubled sea of noises and hoarse disputes '' resounded in his ears .

		One of the most deeply-felt and touching passages in all
Curtis	PERSON	's orations is that in which he describes the coming of Wen - dell
Phillip	PERSON	's first and only client , on the mem - orable
October	DATE	afternoon in
1835	DATE	.

		`` As the jail-doors closed upon Garrison to save his life ,
Garrison	PERSON	and his cause had won their most power - ful and renowned ally .

		With the setting of that Octo - ber sun vanished forever the career of prosperous ease , the gratification of ordinary ambition , which the genius and the accomplishment of
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	had seemed to foretell .

		Yes , the long-awaited client had come at last .

		Scarred , scorned , and forsaken , that cowering and friendless client was wronged and degraded humanity .

		The great soul saw and understood '' -LRB- III. , 277 -RRB- .

		Twenty years later the same client interrupted
Curtis	PERSON	's fine dream of a career like that of
Irv	PERSON	- ing .

		He also understood and obeyed .

		From that moment , politics by which I understand the application of morality and reason to public affairs became the chief business of his life .

		He became a public creature .

		In the last of his memorial addresses , that upon
Lowell	PERSON	, he applauds the fine insight of his old friend ,
C. F. Briggs	PERSON	, in remarking '' that
Lowell	PERSON	was nat - urally a politician , and a politician like
Milton	PERSON	a man , that is to say , with an instinctive 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 grasp of the higher politics , of the duties and relations of the citizen to his country , and of those moral principles which are as essential to the welfare of states as oxygen to the breath of human life '' -LRB- III. , 374 -RRB- .

		It can hardly be disputed that
Briggs	PERSON	would have shown still finer insight in saying this of Curtis .

		For while the remark is eminently true of
Lowell	LOCATION	as a thinker and as a writer , he was of too impa - tient a temper to illustrate the duties of the citizen in his daily life , as did Curtis .

		In say - ing this I would not be understood as dispar - aging
Lowell	PERSON	, whose political service was equal to his great political sagacity .

		But
Curtis	PERSON	's sense of his own political duty prompted him to carry the knowledge of the higher politics into that lower politics which is called '' prac - tical . ''

		He became a political editor ; he at - tended the primary ; he was regularly a dele - gate to political conventions , state and national ; he was for many years Chairman of the Repub - lican Committee of his county ; he accepted the labors of the chairmanship of the first
Civil Service Commission	ORGANIZATION	, in which capacity he determined the lines along which that re - form has since proceeded ; and he was , from its inception in
1881	DATE	until his death in
1892	DATE	, the laborious President of the
National Civil	ORGANIZATION	-
Service Reform League	ORGANIZATION	.

		This may faintly suggest the enormous scope of his self-sacrific - ing political services .

		His public spirit led him to accept other offices , none of them , I think , offices of emolument , all of them offices of trust and honor , such as that of Regent of the
University of the State of New York	ORGANIZATION	, which he held for many years ; and that of President of the Metropolitan Museum .

		All these mul - tifarious duties he performed with pains and punctuality .

		It is scarcely necessary to add that he was never in the ordinary sense either an office-seeker or an office-holder .

		The contents of these three volumes group themselves readily into several great classes , which indicate the chief preoccupations of the author 's mind .

		The first class consists of those addresses delivered before , during , and after the war , the object of which was the awaken - ing of the conscience of the nation touching the monstrous injustice of slavery , and , later , the assurance of fair treatment , civilly and educa - tionally , to the freedman .

		The second class is made up of the addresses advocating woman suffrage , and defending the right of women to the same education as men .

		The third class is well characterized by the title of one of the addresses : '' The Spirit and Influence of the Higher Education . ''

		The fourth class com - prises all the reports and addresses relating to the Reform of the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fifth class consists of the historical and memorial addresses .

		The first three classes of addresses are contained in Volume I. , the fourth fills Vol - ume II. , and the fifth Volume III .

		The ora - tions upon Sumner and
Phillips	PERSON	, in the last volume , should be read in connection with the first six addresses of Volume I .

		The first address in
Volume I.	LOCATION	is
Curtis	PERSON	's answer to the appeal which the client of Wen - dell
Phillips	PERSON	had made in turn to him .

		It is an oration before the literary societies of
Wes	PERSON	- leyan
University	ORGANIZATION	, delivered in
August , 1856	DATE	, in the heat of the great Presidential campaign and of the struggle for the rescue of bleeding
Kansas	LOCATION	, and only ten weeks after the dastardly assault upon Sumner .

		In that hour there could be but one subject for Curtis : `` The Duty of the American Scholar to Politics and the Times . ''

		How severe the inward struggle had been be - tween the promptings of genius and the claims of duty , we do not yet know , probably we shall never know .

		But this oration shows de - cisively that genius had wheeled into line with duty .

		Speaking as a young man to young men , as a scholar to scholars , he throws all the noble ardor of his nature into this powerful appeal , and compels them to face squarely the grave question of the hour , rehearses the shameful history of American slavery , points out the momentous issues of the present struggle , and calls upon generous youth to obey the call of duty in the spirit of
John Milton	PERSON	and
Joseph Warren	PERSON	. ''

		Gentlemen , the scholar is the representative of thought among men , and his duty to society is the ef - fort to introduce thought and the sense of justice into human affairs .

		He was not made a scholar to satisfy the newspapers or the parish beadles , but to serve God and man .

		While other men pursue what is expedient and watch with alarm the flickering of the funds , he is to pursue the truth and watch the eternal law of jus - tice '' -LRB- I. , 14 -RRB- .

		Reprinted in the '' Weekly Tribune , '' this speech went to every farm-house in the
Northland	LOCATION	, and it had further circulation as a pamphlet .

		Later orations of Curtis are chaster in style , more classic in form , riper in political wisdom , more quotable , more what you will ; but none prob - ably was more effective in its time , none more historically noteworthy .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	does not go beyond the mark in saying : '' It helped to define the political ideals , and to confirm the political principles , of the educated youth of the land '' -LRB- I. , 2 -RRB- .

		88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, The next oration , entitled u Patriotism , '' was delivered in the following year at several col - leges , and was likewise widely circulated .

		Dur - ing the year which had intervened ,
Buchanan	PERSON	had become President and the Dred Scott de - cision had been rendered .

		Patriotism , he ar - gued , is simply fidelity to the American idea the sentiment of human liberty .

		In reply to the specious charge that the harborers of fugitive slaves were law-breakers , he had no difficulty in showing that laws are of two kinds , `` Those which concern us as citizens , and those which affect us as men . ''

		The former we obey , even when they are unjust , for '' in themselves they have no moral character or im - portance . ''

		The latter , when unjust , '' God and man require of you to disobey . ''

		As times were , such words as these were deeds .

		For such words Sumner had been struck down ; by deeds which were the logical outcome of such words ,
John Brown	PERSON	was soon to become the immortal Winkelreid of the anti-slavery cause .

		On the very day on which
John Brown	PERSON	was taken at
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry ,
Curtis	PERSON	delivered at
Plymouth	LOCATION	Church his address on '' The Pres - ent Aspect of the Slavery Question . ''

		Two months later , when
John Brown	PERSON	's soul had just begun its eternal march ,
Curtis	PERSON	repeated the address in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The whole power of the police force of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, aided by the armed friends of
Curtis	PERSON	, was scarcely sufficient to prevent him from being mobbed .

		As it was , paving stones and vitriol were hurled through the windows .

		Even in
December , 1860	DATE	, after the election of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, an engagement with
Curtis	PERSON	to deliver a lecture on Thackeray in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	had to be cancelled , on account of fear of mob violence .

		Such was the temper of the people of the
City of Brotherly Love	ORGANIZATION	at the very time of the investment of Fort Sum - ter !

		Small wonder that the Slave Power was arrogantly confident .

		During those years the constant habit of pub - lic speaking , conversance with public affairs , and no doubt also the stress and excitement of those trying times , had rapidly matured the mind and strengthened the style of Curtis .

		His logic becomes more cogent , his tone more states - manlike , his phrase more trenchant .

		There are terse , curt dicta that remind one of Burke : '' A wrong does not become a right by being vested '' -LRB- I. , 85 -RRB- .

		There is something of
Burke	PERSON	, too , in comparisons like the following : `` In great emergencies men always rise to cardinal principles , as , in sailing out of sight of land , the mariner looks up and steers by the sun and stars '' -LRB- I. , 103 -RRB- .

		But he takes care to make no sacrifice of matter for decorative effect .

		The soft light of his poetic genius , which shines in the memorial addresses , is converted , in the argumentative ones , into a lantern to light the road .

		No man is happier in showing up the specious arts by which the people are made to believe a lie .

		His kindly eye is keen to de - tect the weak points in the enemy 's armor , and his gentle hand is sure at the rapier-thrust .

		With what consummate art he expresses , as early as
1862	DATE	, the judgment of history upon
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	: '' The parties were in earnest .

		Yet he could not be in
earnest	LOCATION	, for he was only playing for the presidency . ' ''

		The mills of God ! ''

		there are no mills of God , ' he smiled and said ; and instantly he was caught up and politically ground to powder between the whirring millstones of liberty and slavery '' -LRB- I. , 117 -RRB- .

		There is a shrewd characterization thrown off with the quiet elegance native to the author of the '' Easy Chair . ''

		It would be easy to multiply indefinitely these illustrations , as it would be delightful to follow him through all the addresses of that time .

		They are '' thoughts that breathe and words that burn . ''

		But to go into such details would be far beyond the scope of this article .

		I have spoken particularly of the earlier addresses , because of their double interest in illustrating the great choice of
Curtis	PERSON	's life and in recall - ing a heroic period of our history .

		Some of the later addresses are doubtless intrinsically more valuable : they are more moderate in tone , chaster in style , solider in substance , fruitier in flavor , more weighted with experience , in short , they have the qualities that assure per - manence .

		Of the Memorial Addresses I will not speak , further than to say that they exhibit the sure - ness of touch , the intimacy of knowledge , the selection of matter , and selectness of phrase , which mark the classic .

		The addresses upon Sumner ,
Phillips	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	, and
Lowell	PERSON	would live , even were their quality less fine , because they are sketches of eminent men from the hand of an intimate friend .

		But they will be read for themselves and for
Curtis	PERSON	.

		To Gen - eral
Sedgwick	PERSON	he did not stand so near .

		There is no evidence that they had met ; but the ad - dress commemorative of him , though slighter , is of fascinating interest .

		The centennial ora - tions upon
Concord	LOCATION	fight and
Burgoyne	PERSON	's defeat will continue to have for Americans something more than the charm of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's essays upon
Clive	PERSON	and
Frederick	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL more vivid and inspiring battle-pictures ; and in Curtis the motive and end of it all are always present , the human heart-beat is heard above the roar of the guns , the human hope shines through the battle-smoke .

		There are two addresses which are more creditable to his courage in avowing and de - fending his convictions and to his chivalry in the advocacy of unpopular causes , than to his reputation as a statesmanlike leader of opinion .

		I refer to the pleas for woman suffrage .

		He makes very plain , indeed , the justice of admit - ting woman to '' the same position with men so far as property rights and remedies are con - cerned , '' and this necessarily includes the right to vote upon local concerns .

		It is unfortunate for this great and inevitable reform that so dis - tinguished and eloquent an advocate should have mixed it up with a larger question , and that he should have defended both with argu - ments that seem to be borrowed from the wo men .

		What the cause really needed was a man 's logic and a statesman 's moderation ; and here
Curtis	PERSON	missed a great opportunity .

		To begin with , he all along assumes , and even roundly asserts , that the fact that a thing is a novelty is '' a presumption in its favor '' -LRB- I. , 182 -RRB- .

		That does not remind one of Burke !

		To compel women to do military service would be a novelty ; but would
Curtis	PERSON	have admitted the presumption to be in its favor ?

		Then he constantly speaks of men and women as sep - arate social classes ; indeed , this grotesque use of the word class will be found , I believe , to carry nearly the whole weight of the argument .

		This would be delightfully feminine if it were not so misleading .

		A sense of the danger of class legislation prompted men to restore the ballot to the late rebel leaders .

		But the very men who performed this act of justice refuse the ballot to women .

		If , then , one class of men with the ballot is likely to be unjust to another class without it , '' how much truer is it that one sex as a class will be unjust to the other . '' ''

		Woman '' is some far-off object of oppression , like the negro or the Hindoo , to whom '' man '' will be more unjust than to his political enemies or to an alien race .

		But when we leave off speculating about the class '' wo - man '' and the class '' man , '' and look at men and women , we perceive that in actual life men and women , outside of
Amazonia	LOCATION	, are never separate classes , but that every social class in - cludes both sexes . '

		The woman 's cause is man 's : they rise or sink Together , dwarf 'd or godlike , bond or free . ''

		Had
Curtis	PERSON	read his
Burke	PERSON	to better purpose he would never have beclouded a political and social discussion by the introduction of meta - physical considerations , concerning which
Burke	PERSON	cried : '' I hate the very sound of them ! ''

		He would not have accused men , as he does by implication -LRB- I. , 219 -RRB- , of constant audacity , tyranny , and inhumanity toward women , i. e. , toward their mothers , sisters , sweethearts , wives , and daughters .

		He would hardly have imagined that he had conclusively refuted the theory of the virtual representation of women , by adverting to the illusory nature of that the - ory in the case of the British Colonies .

		Nor would he have asserted in the
New York	LOCATION	Con - stitutional Convention that the action of that Convention in withholding the ballot from women was an injustice as monstrous , an incon - sistency as gross , as would be the disfranchise - ment of the county of
Richmond	LOCATION	, from which Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	was a delegate .

		Finally , he would certainly have been more guarded in assuming , as he repeatedly does , that the ballot is one of the natural political rights of women , not see - ing that by such an assumption he begs the whole question .

		The most ardent follower of
Rousseau	PERSON	would scarcely deny that a natural political right , if such a thing there be , must be something good both for the individual and for the community .

		I do not say that the partici - pation of shop-girls in the quadrennial scramble for office , and the voting of ballet-dancers '' in blocks of five , '' would not be a good thing : I merely point out that
Curtis	PERSON	begs the question .

		In the discussion of this grave question Cur - tis loses his usual sense and balance .

		This is very likely not his fault ; there seems to be a certain fallacious glamour , a something more than natural , in the atmosphere of this agita - tion , '' airs from heaven or blasts from hell , '' that bereave people of their senses , and impel them to indulge in '' wild and whirling words . ''

		Under the platform of the woman-suffrage con - vention , as under the platform at
Elsinore	LOCATION	, there lurks a ghost that cries '' Swear ! ''

		to him who shrinks from complicity with the over - strained declarations of the place .

		The contents of the second volume , consist - ing entirely of addresses and reports on the re - form of the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, are of a far more serious and statesmanlike character .

		This vol - ume is at present most timely .

		One hazards little in asserting that there is no other book comparable to it for doctrine and discipline in right political action at the present time .

		In the anti-slavery addresses we are dealing with 90 -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, one who is in the formative stage of early man - hood .

		Working under the guidance of great and inspiring leaders , Garrison ,
Phillips	LOCATION	,
Sumner	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Beecher	PERSON	, he plants himself impregnably upon the rock of fundamental morality .

		It was really a simple question , as questions of duty always are ; he clearly saw the solution ; and he could bring to bear upon his hearers all his mental equipment , all his spiritual elevation , all the force of ardent con - viction .

		In the woman-suffrage addresses he is doing what he believes to be his duty ; he is honestly taking his oath in obedience to the mandate of the ghost .

		In the commemorative addresses he is more purely reminiscential , de - scriptive , and decorative .

		He is following his genius in pronouncing the fitting word upon a great public occasion , in recounting the life and services of some one of the great men he had known , in celebrating the Puritan char - acter , or , what is almost equivalent , in recall - ing the great words and deeds of the founders of American liberty .

		But after the settlement of the issues of the Civil War ,
Curtis	PERSON	finds himself suddenly confronted by a public evil scarcely less insidious and gigantic than negro slavery .

		His old masters have fallen away : he himself is no longer distinctively a young man ; he is surrounded by generous youth , awake to the danger , eager for the struggle , and needing only a leader .

		Almost from the first the chief advocate of Civil-Service Reform , he lived to be its chief agent ; and , in order to be both , he had to become the political philos - opher of the Reform .

		It is in the last capac - ity that this volume presents him to us .

		The first of these addresses was delivered as long ago as
1869	DATE	; the last , entitled '' Party and Patronage , '' was read -LRB- but not by the author -RRB- at the meeting of the
National Civil-Service Reform League	ORGANIZATION	in
1892	DATE	, only four months be - fore his death .

		He had been occupied with the subject for a quarter of a century .

		When his name first became identified with the Re - form , it had been advocated in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by one member , Mr.
Jenckes	PERSON	, and before the pub - lic by two weekly papers , '' The Nation , '' ed - ited by Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	, and ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' edited by Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	. ''

		To the general pub - lic it was necessary to explain what the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	was , how it was recruited , what the abuses were , and why and how they were to be remedied '' -LRB- II. , 173 -RRB- .

		Our politics had reached a stage when , in his own vigorous phrase , '' Servility to party takes the place of individual independence of action '' -LRB- II. , 492 -RRB- .

		Curtis was in every way admirably fitted for the leadership that fell to him .

		The breadth of his historical reading , and especially his ac - curate studies in American history , enabled him to see the reform of the enormous evils re - sulting from the spoils system , a system grow - ing out of the unconstitutional diversion of patronage from the President to the members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to be '' but another successive step in the development of liberty under law '' -LRB- II. , 488 -RRB- .

		The great oratorical and persuasive powers of
Curtis	PERSON	, his skill in winning the good - will of his audience before introducing the moral consideration , made him the
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	of this movement .

		His patience , his firmness , his humor , his urbanity , his knowledge of pol - itics , were all brought into play .

		But what gave his advocacy of the cause most weight was the well-known loftiness of his character .

		For example , in the address at the unveiling of the statue of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Curtis	PERSON	, referring to the air of American patriotism about the hallowed spot , says : '' To breathe it , charged with such memories , is to be inspired with the loftiest human purpose , to be strengthened for the no - blest endeavor '' -LRB- III. , 183 -RRB- .

		When
Curtis	PERSON	speaks thus , those acquainted with his life know that this is not mere sentiment with him ; but that he is himself fired with this inspiration and energized with this strength .

		Like the anti-slavery movement , this reform is essen - tially a moral one , and it was indispensable that it should find a leader without fear and without reproach .

		Curtis 's chief effective - ness and value as a public teacher are due to the high ground he takes , to his magnanim - ity to opponents , to the fairness of his argu - ments , to the public confidence in his absolute truthfulness , and to the fact that he never makes appeal to the selfishness of men .

		Per - haps young Americans will owe more , in the long run , to his steady opposition to the blind , partisanship against which
Washington	LOCATION	warned us , than to any of his specific public services .

		Himself a party man , he was strong enough to make himself -LRB- to borrow his own words con - cerning the true function of the press -RRB- preem - inently '' the voice of the patriotic intelligence and public spirit which , even while accepting a party name , rejects a party collar '' -LRB- I. , 311 -RRB- .

		From the year
1880	DATE	until the year of his death ,
Curtis	PERSON	prepared thirteen addresses upon Civil-Service Reform , all but the first two of which were given as Presidential addresses at the successive annual meetings of the
National Civil-Service Reform League	ORGANIZATION	.

		These , in their
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL way , are of unequalled interest , embodying as they do a history of the progress of the Re - form from year to year , sober criticisms of the conduct of presidents and public officials , and a whole arsenal of arguments and illustrations making for the reform .

		Literary style and finish are here , of course , distinctly subordin - ated to substance and matter ; and yet there are perhaps no more signal illustrations than some of these addresses of the strength and chastity of Curtis 's later style .

		Among his other titles to honorable remembrance is the respect he always exhibited for the English language .

		In a time when the relaxation of moral standards seemed to mirror itself in the vulgarity of newspaper diction ,
Curtis	PERSON	kept his tongue , like his heart and conduct , pure and undefiled .

		The example of taste and high breeding he sets in this particular should not be without its influence .

		Curtis will have a place in our literature on the one hand with the elegant essayists , on the other with those orators who have been great public characters .

		Kant is said to have des - pised oratory as too rhetorical , too much af - fected by feeling , too much the art of making the worse appear the better reason .

		But what would he have said of the orator who employed his gracious gift always in the service of jus - tice and humanity ; who , in a time of bitter partisanship , never flattered an unworthy pre - judice ; and who never flinched , for clamor and calumny , from championing an unpopular cause ?

		Such a man has his function no less than the philosopher who coldly analyzes the final principles of things .

		Such a man has his place beside the statesman and the hero ; and when we enumerate the men who have rendered eminent public service , the noble leader in the Civil-Service Reform will be named along with
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	, with
Samuel Adams	PERSON	, with
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	, and with
Charles Sumner	PERSON	.

		THE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF SOCIALISM .

		* The distinctive feature of Dr.
Ely	PERSON	's new work on Socialism lies in bringing together for the first time within the same covers both the fair - est and most appreciative treatment of the strength of socialism and of its weaknesses .

		In the emphasis laid upon practicable and much - * SOCIALISM .

		An Examination of its
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, its Strength , and its Weakness ; with Suggestions for Social Reform .

		By
Richard T. Ely	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		needed social reforms , and the discrimination between the sphere of state and of private , of monopolistic and of competitive business , this work is likely to prove the most useful of all works on the subject .

		Professor
Ely	PERSON	most clearly shows how he and other social reformers can stand side by side with the socialists in the treatment of monop - olies of situation , such as gas , street and steam railways , the electric light , telephone and tele - graph , and in factory legislation in its widest meaning , without holding at all with the social - ists as to the desirability or practicability of collective management of most manufacturing and commercial enterprises .

		Never before has so strong a sympathizer with most of the truly noble socialist ideals criticised so keenly the methods proposed for their realization or the over-confidence in human nature revealed by their authors .

		Recognizing the value of social - ism in its arousing of the social conscience and the exposure of existing abuses , Professor
Ely	PERSON	admits that if the present tendency to the forma - tion of trusts shall continue until each industry is monopolized , then public management may have to come ; but he wisely holds that we can - not yet be sure that the trust idea will go so far .

		A fuller treatment of this subject , however , might well have been given ; and the classifica - tion of such industrial types as artificial mon - opolies , instead of as monopolies of large capi - tal , which , so far as they go , are as natural as any other , might be criticised .

		Our author speaks of the '' hesitation and timidity '' which is apt to attend collective ac - tion , though elsewhere he holds that this is less important in monopolies of situation than the advantages in such of public operation .

		The most serious objections to socialism he finds in '' the tendencies to revolutionary dissatisfaction which it would be likely to carry with it ; the difficulties in the way of the organization of several important fac - tors of production under socialism , notably agriculture ; difficulties in the way of determining any standard of distributive justice that would be generally acceptable , and at the same time would enlist the whole-hearted services of the most gifted and talented members of the community ; and , finally , the danger that the re - quirements of these persons engaged in higher pur - suits would be underestimated , and the importance of those occupations which contribute most to the advance - ment of civilization should fail to secure adequate ap - preciation . ''

		His dissent from the tenets of socialism is also shown in his belief that the wastes which he fully admits in the true competitive field of in - dustry are '' counterbalanced by the gains aris - ing from competition , such as alertness and the 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, free exercise of one 's powers by active efforts to meet wants as they arise . ''

		Occupying so conservative a position , it is noteworthy how vigorously our author cham - pions social reforms in the line of factory and sanitary legislation , public ownership of what I call monopolies of situation , and the recogni - tion of our duty to serve the humanity about us and our state and city with our wealth and talents .

		He truly holds that the longer we delay these moderate and really conservative reforms , the farther will we have to go along untried and uncertain paths in order to meet the fast rising discontent of the masses .

		A few years ago , when the reviewer enjoyed the privilege of listening to Professor
Ely	PERSON	's first courses of lectures in
America	LOCATION	, many , as now , called him a radical and a socialist ; but he then said , what this book confirms , that the time would come when , if his suggestions for social reform in the interest of true conserva - tism were not heeded , the mass of men would be driven past him into such radical views as would make his seem conservative .

		Such a result has already come ; for although the au - thor now holds substantially the economic posi - tion he did then , many , on reading the second and third parts of the present noteworthy book , will be surprised to find how conservative Pro- fessor Ely now appears , beside the rising tide of socialistic thought about us .

		To those who , like the reviewer , are agnostics as to our remote social future , but prefer steady and peaceful evolution toward a greater equality of oppor - tunity for all for the development of individ - uality and manhood , rather than a damming of the current until destruction must attend its ultimate and inevitable sweep onward , the les - sons of Professor
Ely	PERSON	's chapters on social re - form seem well worth heeding .

		ing as was that of
Richard Coeur	PERSON	de Leon among the
Saracens	LOCATION	.

		The story of the life of Sir
Harry Parkes	PERSON	has been interestingly told by
Stanley Lane-Poole	PERSON	, who treats of his ca - reer in
China	LOCATION	and
Siam	LOCATION	, and
Frederick V. Dickins	PERSON	, who treats of that in
Japan	LOCATION	and Ko - rea .

		This composite biography reads like a novel ; but on disputed points of policy it is a work of special pleading , the conclusions of which must not be too freely accepted .

		Though the schooling of
Harry Parkes	PERSON	, on account of the straitened circumstances of the family , was limited , `` his education really opened on the decks of men-of-war , in the council-chambers of plenipotentiaries , and on the field of battle , '' where he gained a wide knowledge of men and of affairs .

		His first ap - pearance on the stage of action in the Orient was in
1842	DATE	at
Nanking	LOCATION	.

		To this place Im - perial Commissioners of
China	LOCATION	'' had at last condescended to come , '' impelled by fear of a British army and men-of-war , `` with full powers from the Son of Heaven to treat for peace '' with those '' outer barbarians . '' ''

		In the midst of this pomp and pageantry of court and war , a slim fair-haired boy with eager young face and vivid blue eyes was formally presented to the Im - perial Commissioners .

		It was thus that
Harry Parkes	PERSON	at the age of fourteen took his place in a great histor - ical scene .

		From this day for more than forty years there were few events in the history of British rela - tions with the Far East in which he did not play a con - spicuous part ; till the lad who carried ' chops ' and dis - patches for Sir
Henry Pottinger	PERSON	at
Nanking	LOCATION	in
1842	DATE	ended his busy and eventful life in
1885	DATE	, in the high sta - tion of
Her Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's Minister to the Court of Peking . ''

		As Interpreter at
Amoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Foochow	ORGANIZATION	,
Shanghai	LOCATION	, and
Canton	LOCATION	,
Parkes	PERSON	showed '' ability , tact , and ready fluency in the language . ''

		He early be - came convinced that '' all mandarins are like eels , '' and that the only way of dealing with these delusive officials was by means of '' firm persistence . ''

		In
1855	DATE	, as Secretary to Sir
John Bowring	PERSON	, who was sent to
Bangkok	LOCATION	to nego - tiate a treaty with the
King of Siam	ORGANIZATION	, he was entrusted with the duty of carrying home the documents for the Queen 's ratification .

		When he returned to
China	LOCATION	, he was made Acting Consul at
Canton	LOCATION	; and afterwards , when that city was captured by the British , he , facile princeps of a commission of three , was '' prac - tically Governor '' of the place .

		In
1860	DATE	, as an interpreter for
Lord Elgin	ORGANIZATION	, he accompanied that commander on the march to Peking .

		In this duty whether in dealing with the Chinese coolies , or in capturing `` almost single-handed '' the Peh-tang fort , or in negotiating with the

		THE DIAL 93 wily and slippery officials , he displayed his characteristic energy , courage , and cleverness .

		But even
Harry Parkes	PERSON	was once duped by horrible treachery .

		In a pretended negotiation for peace , he and a few companions , though under the protection of a flag of truce , were seized and conducted in triumph to Peking .

		Cruel treatment in prison for twenty-one days seemed only the prelude of certain death .

		The order for their execution was actually issued by the Chinese Emperor ; but a friendly manda - rin '' succeeded in getting the captives out of Peking by order of the
Prince of Kung	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- Peace Commissioner -RSB- barely a quarter of an hour before the Emperor 's messenger arrived . ''

		Six - teen days after the release , a
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	for the first time took up its quarters in the city of Peking .

		In
1862	DATE	Parkes attained the unique distinc - tion of being made a K.C.B. at the early age of thirty-four ; and in
1865	DATE	he was appointed Minister to
Japan	LOCATION	.

		His career in
Japan	LOCATION	ex - tended over eighteen years -LRB- 1865-1883 -RRB- , and covered the '' Eestoration , '' or '' Eevolution , '' of
1868	DATE	, with its subsequent marvellous trans - formations in social and political affairs .

		One writer has said that '' the history of Sir
Harry	PERSON	's career in
Japan	LOCATION	was the history of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		His policy in this country , as well as in
China	LOCATION	, has been the cause of much criticism , both fav - orable and unfavorable , which , to a great ex - tent , has been tinged by national predilections and rivalries .

		His biographer speaks of the Yedo Court as '' terrorized by the American envoy ,
Townsend Harris	PERSON	, into compliance with his demands , '' and adds : '' It is not too much to say that to
Harris	PERSON	's ill-advised and selfish policy were due many of the troubles that at - tended the emergence of
Japan	LOCATION	from her long isolation . ''

		Americans , on the other hand , de - fending with spirit their own representatives , have been unsparing in their denunciations of the '' British , brutish , '' domineering policy self - ishly employed against
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and other Asiatic nations .

		An Englishman , Professor
Basil Hall Chamberlain	PERSON	, writes : '' Sir
Harry	PERSON	was always a stanch supporter of his country 's commercial interests , and a believer in the ' gun-boat policy ' of his master ,
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	.

		His outspoken threats and occasional fits of passion earned for him the dread and dislike of the Japanese during his sojourn in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		But no sooner had he quitted
Tokyo	LOCATION	than they began to acknowledge that his high - handed policy had been founded in reason . ''

		A high Japanese official once remarked : '' Sir
Harry Parkes	PERSON	was the only foreigner in
Japan	LOCATION	whom we could not twist round our little finger . ''

		And the Rev.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, in '' The Mikado 's Empire , '' gives this apprecia - tive American judgment : '' It was the English Minister , Sir
Harry Parkes	PERSON	, who first risked his life to find the truth ; stripped the Sho - gun of his fictitious title of ' Majesty ' ; asked for at home , obtained , and presented credentials to the Mi - kado , the Sovereign of
Japan	LOCATION	; recognized the new Na - tional
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and thus laid the foundation of true diplomacy in
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		But it is at least certain that , however much Sir
Harry	PERSON	may have accomplished in obtaining the imperial signature to the treaties , and in assisting indirectly and recognizing the unifi - cation of the government , he and subsequent British Ministers to
Japan	LOCATION	have doggedly pre - vented the revision of those same treaties , which still hold
Japan	LOCATION	, in spite of her forty years of wonderful progress , in an unreasona - ble thraldom .

		In
1883	DATE	`` the great British Minister in Ja - pan '' received promotion to the position of Minister to
China	LOCATION	, and returned to the scene of his early achievements .

		In Peking , into which he had once been carried prisoner in a cart , and where he had languished in the com - mon jail , he was received with honor at the
Imperial Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		The principal event of his term in this office was the negotiation of a treaty with
Korea	LOCATION	, to which country also he became Minister .

		The new positions entailed unceasing routine labor , not only for the sub - ordinates , but also for the chief , who , though he had often accused himself of '' indolence '' and '' apathy , '' was a hard worker , always '' opera inter talia primus '' Early in
1885	DATE	a fever seized him ; and in
April	DATE	of that year death came , less from fever than from over - work , to the distinguished diplomat whose en - tire service had been in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		He has since been honored with a marble bust in
St. Paul 's Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and in
Shanghai	LOCATION	with a marble statue , '' the first public statue in the metropolis of
European China	LOCATION	. ''

		Apart from the biographical interest , the great value of these two volumes , and espe - cially of that part relating to
Japan	LOCATION	, is in the search-lights thrown upon contemporaneous his - tory in the Orient .

		In fact , the private cor - respondence of Sir
Harry	PERSON	during his life in
Japan	LOCATION	was so scanty that Mr.
Dickins	PERSON	was compelled to be less biographical than histor - ical , and to give the results of his own obser - vations and studies .

		We may not yet be ready to accept all his inferences ; but we are forced , by the vigor of his arguments , to give careful 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, consideration to the disputed points .

		It rather startles us , for instance , to read this icono - clastic statement : '' The so-called Restoration of
1868	DATE	has been com - pletely misunderstood by most recent writers on
Japan	LOCATION	; it was no Restoration , but a Revolution , that gave the Mikado a power he had never previously possessed . ''

		And , in connection with the ante-Revolution outbreaks , or '' Revolutionary Preludes , '' as Dr.
Murray	PERSON	aptly calls them in '' The Story of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Dickins	PERSON	upholds a theory which investigation tends more and more to establish : that '' there never was any intelligent opposi - tion to foreign intercourse on the part of the Japanese '' ; and that the joi , or anti-foreign , spirit of
Satsuma	LOCATION	,
Choshiu	LOCATION	,
Tosa	PERSON	, and even
Mito	ORGANIZATION	, was only a popular slogan with which to stir up the clans in hostility against the Sho - gun .

		It is a curious coincidence that at the present time a similar spirit of hostility to for - eigners is revived by the radical opposition to the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus '' history repeats it - self , '' even in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		And while the present seems a critical period in the history of that country , and constitutional government and representative institutions are there undergoing a severe test , there is occasion not merely for anxiety , but also for hope .

		As Mr.
Dickins	PERSON	has well expressed it , '' There is a silent strength underlying the sound and fury of Japanese pol - itics which will enable the country to weather much worse storms than any that threaten it . ''

		It may be confidently predicted that during the coming years
Japan	LOCATION	will continue in a rapid course of progress , and that the twentieth cen - tury will see yet more wonderful transforma - tions and developments in civilization than those watched with great interest by Sir
Harry Parkes	PERSON	.

WILSON CLEMENT	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Town Life in The attempt of a brave woman to the fifteenth carry on worthily any great work entrusted to her by her husband when he lays it down at death 's inexorable summons can hardly fail to command our respectful sympathy and interest .

		Still more should this be the case when the woman is the widow of such a man as the late
John Richard Green	PERSON	, and the great work is a study of life in the English towns of the fif - teenth century .

		When the possibility of such a thing as American cities was not so much as dreamt of , and while the English royalty and nobility were exterminating each other in the Wars of the Roses , the commoners of the English towns were learn - ing lessons of self-government , and engaging for the sake of commercial and municipal liberties in obscure and tedious struggles , which , though hith - erto overlooked by historians , are far more impor - tant factors in the growth of the nation than the tragic fate of the houses of
York	LOCATION	and
Lancaster	LOCATION	.

		In the first volume of '' Town Life in the Fifteenth Century '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mrs.
Green	PERSON	treats of the industrial and commercial revolutions of the fif - teenth century , of the townspeople and their com - mon life , and of their struggles with the king , the feudal lord , or the church , for enfranchisement and for independent government .

		In her second vol - ume , the author treats of subjects more abstruse and more open to discussion , such as the relation of in - ternal traffic to free trade and protection , the gen - eral organization of labor , the position of the guild towards the hired worker , the attitude of the mu - nicipality to the industrial system , and of the cap - italist to the town councillor .

		Mrs.
Green	PERSON	thinks she has found an explanation for the position of the '' communitas '' side by side with the '' cives , '' and rejects the theory of an early triumph and rapid decay of democratic government , while she attrib - utes great importance to the growth of the common council .

		Even if one does not agree with the au - thor 's conclusions , or even accept all of her data as unimpeachable , one must acknowledge that her ar - duous labors in a comparatively new field have not been in vain , and that her book will incite the se - rious student of municipal history to new efforts in the search for truth .

		Perhaps there never was a time when it was so important for Americans to make a thorough study of all the problems of mu - nicipal government and of all the various solutions that have been proposed .

		Pleasing The perusal of
Florence A. Merriam	PERSON	's pictures of a '' My Summer in a Mormon Village '' Mormon village .

		-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- leads to the conclusion that the advantages of
Utah	LOCATION	as a summer resort -LRB- and not in a matrimonial way only -RRB- are yet unap - preciated .

		Miss
Merriam	ORGANIZATION	assures us that the cli - mate , which is that of the dry elevated region be - tween the Rockies and the
Sierra Nevada	LOCATION	known as '' The
Great Basin	LOCATION	, '' is unsurpassed .


Utah	LOCATION	and
Arizona	LOCATION	, having this basin climate , are , she thinks , the natural sanitariums of the continent , far excel - ling the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	,
Florida	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	, in elevation , dry ness , and recuperative effect .

		Cer - tainly it would be hard to picture anything pleas - anter than
Miss Merriam	LOCATION	's particular '' Mormon village , '' a typical one , it seems , belonging to a line of closely connected settlements in the valley be - tween the
Wasatch	LOCATION	and the
Great Lake	LOCATION	.

		Hilly streets bordered with fragrant locusts under which run mountain brooks -LRB- in lieu of prosaic gutters -RRB- , cool low stone houses set well back in shrubby yards , vine-clad piazzas , delightful old overgrown orchards with their shady lanes and slow-ripening fruit , form an ensemble charming to the fancy these sweltering days .

		One is not surprised to learn that '' children
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 were everywhere , '' and that each house , the hum - blest , had its baby .

		One local patriarch , an ex - bishop boasted no less than sixty-three of these little olive branches .

		The author was gratified one day by a sight of this notable anti-Malthusian as he stood in the garden , gravely wagging his gray beard in the shrubbery , and looking , we should fancy , un - commonly like an elderly Satyr .

		Altogether Miss
Merriam	PERSON	's picture of the Latter-Day Saints is more favorable than that usually drawn ; and she seems to have seen nothing of the woe-begone men , listless bedraggled women , and squalid children , described by most pilgrims to Mormondom .

		The book is brightly written , with plenty of local color and char - acter sketching , and with some discussion of the doctrine and present practice of the '' Saints . ''

		There is a pretty frontispiece illustration .

		Literary and Social Silhouettes .

		Mr.
H. H. Boyesen	PERSON	's '' Literary and Social Silhouettes '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- are brief essays , which , to the number of a dozen or more , fill a most companionable pocket volume .

		The social element of the book is found mainly in the studies of German and American women , and the capital paper on `` Philistinism . ''

		Lit - erature gets more attention than society , however , and is illustrated by such sketches as '' The Hero in Fiction , '' `` America in European Literature , '' and '' Some Stray Notes on
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	. ''

		In '' My Lost Self '' we have an account of the im - pressions of a long-exiled Norwegian upon a visit to his native land .

		Mr.
Boyesen	PERSON	records the curious fact that he found himself taken for a foreigner by his fellow-countrymen , and that his Norwegian had taken upon itself an English accent .

		We are bound to speak well of the essay on `` Amer - ican Literary Criticism , '' for does it not describe THE DIAL as '' distinguished for its broad-minded impartiality and scholarship '' ?

		The gentle satirical vein that streaks many of these papers gives them flavor and zest , even when it verges upon cynicism .

		The author makes mild sport of himself no less than of others , as appears in a few sentences devoted to his own novels : '' I marvel , in retrospect , that a humane , kind-hearted man -LRB- as I believe I am -RRB- could have heaped up so much gratuitous misery .

		... A fiendish ingenuity assisted me in inventing distressing situations , from which there seemed no issue possible except death by frost or fire , or a long self-imposed martyrdom of sorrow and suffering . ''

		Jewish influence in American discovery .

		There seems to be no end of the changes to be rung upon the theme of
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	.

		We had thought that the flood of '' Columbian literature '' had fairly subsided at last ; but it seems not .

		In a compact volume of some 200 pages , entitled ''
Chris	PERSON	- topher Columbus '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , Dr.
M. Kayser	PERSON	- ling re-tells the story from a novel and not uninter - esting standpoint .

		The question of Jewish partici - pation in
Columbus	LOCATION	's discoveries has already been propounded , but it has never before been fully dis - cussed .

		It is to this question , primarily , that Dr.
Kayserling	PERSON	devotes the present volume , basing his narrative upon recent exploration of Spanish ar - chives and libraries .

		He tells the story of the serv - ices rendered to
Columbus	LOCATION	by wealthy Jews , sketches the dramatic history of the Marranos or '' secret Jews , '' and makes it pretty clear throughout that the race had a good deal to do with things maritime in the palmy days of the Spanish and the
Portu	LOCATION	- guese navies .

		We own that -LRB- despite the Phoenicians -RRB- a Jewish sailor has hitherto appeared to us in the light of a roc or a hippogriff the rarest kind of a rara avis , in fact , and almost contra naturam .

		Imagination balks at the notion of a son of Abra - ham bestriding a yard-arm , or having anything whatever to do with a ship except , indeed , in the way of a bottomry bond .

		But now comes Dr.
Kay	PERSON	- serling and shows that with
Columbus	LOCATION	's armada there were '' several men of Jewish stock , '' including the fleet-physician ; and he even offers some evidence that the man who first shouted '' Land ho ! ''

		-LRB- or its Spanish equivalent -RRB- from the deck of the '' Pinta '' was an '' `
Ebrew Jew	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Doctor 's narrative is readable , and , in its way , informing ; and it is smoothly translated by Professor
Charles Gross	PERSON	of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The documents embodied in the text are printed in extenso in the Appendix , and form an element of considerable interest .

		Recollections Mr - J - K -
Fowler	PERSON	's '' Recollections of English of Old Country Life '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- country life .

		reminds one not a little of that cap - ital book `` The Memories ` of Dean Hole . ''

		The laugh is not quite so merry or the manner so taking as that of the incomparable Dean ; but the book is full of good stories and curious odds and ends from the memory of a typical English country gentleman '' one of the olden time , '' we fancy .

		Of course the '' sporting parson '' figures pretty largely in Mr.
Fowler	PERSON	's jottings .

		There is a good story of one notable shoot of this variety a rector in the north , whose horsemanship justly made him the dulce de - cits of his rough-riding
Yorkshire	LOCATION	parishioners . ''

		His rectory-house , '' says the author , '' was on a hill about a mile distant from the church , which was also on a hill , with a valley between them .

		The rector often rode to church , sometimes across country , putting his horse up at one of the farmers ' stables near the church , and the parishioners assembled in the church - yard , waiting for his advent , would watch his pro- gress from the rectory with keen relish , expressing themselves enthusiastically as one fence after the other was safely negotiated .

		One of them would say , ' He 's safely over the single ' ; another , ' Now he 's at the double ' ; ' Yes , he 's all right ' ; ' What '11 he do at the rails ? '' '

		He 's well over ' ; and the last thing he jumped was the churchyard wall , sav - ing his time by three minutes . ''

		Mr.
Fowler	PERSON	ranges at random over topics social , political , sporting , and agricultural , and his book is informing as well as amusing .

		There are several illustrations , including a portrait .

		The welcome series of pamphlets issued by the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and known as the '' Religion of Science '' library , appear bi-monthly .

		The issue for
July	DATE	is divided into two '' half-numbers , '' one of which is a new edition of
M. Alfred Binet	PERSON	's important studies '' On Double Consciousness , '' and the other a reprint of sundry articles from '' The Open Court , '' upon the gen - eral subject of '' The Nature of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' all by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, the learned editor of '' The Open Court '' and '' The Monist . ''

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	touches nothing that he does not adorn , and his historical monograph upon '' St. Andrews '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- gives an unexpected charm to the dusty an - nals of the old Scotch university town . ''

		Very many per - sons yearly visit St.
Andrews	PERSON	, '' the author observes , and some of these , he adds , '' may care to know more of that venerable town than can be learned from assiduous application to golf . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	himself shows unex - pected and praiseworthy restraint in putting next to nothing about golf into these pages .

		The town of Wal - lace and
Bruce	PERSON	and the
Black Douglas	ORGANIZATION	is certainly not devoid of picturesque and romantic interest , and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's account , enforced by Mr.
T. Hodge	PERSON	's tasteful pictures , is likely to make the future annual influx of
summer	DATE	visitors larger than ever .

		Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	has just published '' A System of Lucid Shorthand '' -LRB- Apple ton -RRB- , devised fifty years ago by his father ,
William George Spencer	PERSON	, and left in man - uscript up to the present time .

		The present publica - tion results , Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	tells us , '' from the conviction , long since formed and still unshaken , that the
Lucid Shorthand	ORGANIZATION	ought to replace ordinary writing . ''

		He claims for it great brevity , and greater legibility than belongs to ordinary longhand .

		The book is a very thin one , and the system correspondingly simple .

		It ought not to take long for anyone to master the system suf - ficiently to determine whether he is likely to find it practically useful . ''

		The Study of the Biology of Ferns by the Collodion Method '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
George F. Atkinson	PERSON	, is a text-book for advanced students of biology , beauti - fully printed , and illustrated from original drawings .

		Mr.
F. O. Bowers	PERSON	's '' Practical Botany for Beginners '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is also a laboratory manual for students , de - scribing a variety of typical plant-forms , and packed with practical instructions .

		The '' Introduction to Elementary Practical Biology '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- of Mr.
Charles Wright Dodge	PERSON	is designed for high-school and college students , is a larger book than either of the preceding , and in - cludes both plant and animal types .

		We ought also to mention in this connection Mr.
Charles H. Clark	PERSON	's ad - mirable treatise on '' Practical Methods in Microscopy '' -LRB-
Heath	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The multiplication of such text-books as these marks a highly significant advance in our methods of science teaching .

		Two more volumes -LRB- making seven in all -RRB- of the `` Temple '' Shakespeare have been published -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- . ''

		Love 's
Labour	ORGANIZATION	's Lost '' has for its frontispiece a pretty etching of
Anne Hathaway	PERSON	's cottage , while '' Much Ado about Nothing '' gives us a similar view of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	at

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
August 12 , 1894	DATE	.

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish in about three weeks '' A New and Complete Concordance , or Verbal Index , to Words , Phrases , and Passages in the Dra - matic Works of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with a Supplementary Concordance to the Poems , '' by
John Bartlett	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, Fellow of the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Sciences .

		It is difficult to express the imposing character of this work in a few words , more especially in view of its hav - ing been accomplished by one person .

		The
Concord	LOCATION	- ance is a large quarto volume , containing almost two thousand pages , closely though plainly set in small type .

		As an exhibition of patient industry and scholarship it probably has not been exceeded in this country .

		Mr.
John Bartlett	PERSON	is of course known the world over by his '' Familiar Quotations , '' of which the ninth revised edi - tion , representing many thousands of copies sold , was published in
1891	DATE	.

		There has been no figure more fa - miliar than his in
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, for half a century .

		He was born in
Plymouth	LOCATION	in
1820	DATE	, removing to Cam - bridge and entering the publishing business about
1836	DATE	.

		He succeeded to the management of his firm in
1849	DATE	, and held this position for ten years .

		Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	served in the
U. S. Navy	ORGANIZATION	during the Civil War , and afterwards became connected with the firm of
Messrs. Little	ORGANIZATION	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, reaching the senior partnership in
1878	DATE	.

		He took up his work on the Concordance shortly after the publication of the '' Globe '' edition of Shakespeare in
1875	DATE	, the first cheap complete edition of the dramatist .

		He has steadily worked on it during most of the daylight hours ever since .

		The appearance of the revised edition of the `` Globe ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, still published by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, in
1891	DATE	, necessitated a certain amount of additional work .

		This was finished , and the Concordance is now ready to be placed upon the market .

		It will be sold regularly through the book - sellers , these publishers not being engaged in the sub - scription business , and not , I understand , believing in that method of sale .

		Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	says in his Introduc - tion : `` Apart from the merit of presenting the latest and most approved text , now the standard with scholars and critics , the plan of this Concordance to the Dra - matic Works of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is more comprehensive than that of any which has preceded it , in that it aims to give passages of some length for the most part inde - pendent of the context . ''

		The work , he adds , is made more nearly complete by the inclusion of select exam - ples of certain auxiliary verbs , of various adjectives in common use , and of pronouns , prepositions , interjections , and conjunctions .

		The first volume of Mr.
John Codman Ropes	PERSON	's '' Story of the Civil War '' is now passing through the Knicker - bocker Press , and will be published at the end of Sep - tember by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		This work will deal less with accounts of battles and sensational episodes generally than has been the case with some of its predecessors , and will treat of the conflict in a more critical and judicial spirit than has been usual . ''

		The Story of the Civil War '' has been in preparation for Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons for several years , and the author has supplied his publishers with a regularly printed vol - ume instead of the usual manuscript , it being his custom to put his work in type and have it printed , before hand - ing it over for publication , in order that he may see it in print and that absolute accuracy may be secured .

		Mr.
Moncure D. Con	PERSON	way is making a brief visit to

		THE DIAL the

		He is passing a month or two on the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	coast , and after a brief rest will complete his editorial labors on '' The Writings of
Thomas Paine	PERSON	, '' the third and fourth volumes of which will be published by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons during the coming season .

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	will continue his discourses at
South Place Chapel	LOCATION
next winter	DATE	, it now being twenty - one years since he first became connected with the or - ganization which meets there .

		That band of young Arcadians , the
Rhymers ' Club	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, to whom several references have been made in this correspondence , has just published through
Messrs. Elkins & Lane	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	, and Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, '' The Second Book of the Rhymers ' Club . ''

		I have never seen the first book of the
Rhymers ' Club	ORGANIZATION	, if such there be .

		The present volume is composed of poems presumably written for the meetings of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are signed by Messrs.
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	, Ed - win
J. Ellis	PERSON	,
G. A. Greene	PERSON	,

W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, who make up this company of troubadors .

		The names of
Richard LeGallienne	PERSON	,
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, and
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	, ''
Rhys the Rhymer	PERSON	, '' as his friends playfully call him , are best known to American ears , but doubtless we shall know more of all of them ere long .

		Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	has been contributing some inter - esting comments on life in the
United States	LOCATION	to the '' In - dependent , '' of this city .

		He will revisit this country in the
fall	DATE	, being now hard at work on a new novel at his
Harpenden	LOCATION	home .

		I remember that we were dis - cussing present tendencies of fiction
last winter	DATE	, and that I referred to various expeditions to different parts of the world on the part of novelists in search of fresh material .

		The question arose as to whether the liter - ary results of these tours had been commensurate with the expectations of those who made them .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	replied by saying that if a novelist goes forth for re - portorial purposes and writes immediately after he has visited a country , it seemed to him that he would write pretty largely as a tourist .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	believed that a man could not write as well of a thing when he was very close to it , as when he has obtained distance and perspective of memory .

		He himself had travelled a great deal , but he had never kept a diary regularly , and he always believed that the things which were really worth remembering printed themselves upon the mem - ory and upon the eye , and that in due time they would come up and fall into their proper places in one 's work .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	did think that the most unfortunate thing for any author to undertake is to go '' fiction-stalking . ''

		Now that the '' Athenaeum '' has declared that the last volume of stories by our most promising young writer has the '' common defects in American stories of feebleness in motive and unsatisfactoriuess in the con - clusion , '' it would seem to be a good time to consider a few of the reasons for the overshadowing of our home novelists by the rising school of British romancers , and this I shall try to do in another letter .

Allen	PERSON	, with many illustrations , is to be published this fall by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Euphorion '' is the title of a new '' Zeitschrift fiir Literaturgeschichte , '' published at
Bamberg	LOCATION	.

		It is in - tended to embrace the whole field of literary research THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, from the close of the middle ages to the present time , and will comprise essays of a general character , special studies , important contributions in the form of letters , diaries , archival documents , texts , criticisms , and biblio - graphical communications .

		Although chiefly German , the periodical will be somewhat international in char - acter , and will include brief reports on American , En - glish , Russian , Hungarian , and other foreigh literatures .

		LECONTE DE
LISLE	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	writes of the late
Leconte	PERSON	de
Lisle	LOCATION	in these terms : `` Never was a poet more actually or more fundamentally a scholar ; and his poetry both gains and loses , but certainly becomes what it is , through this scholarship , which was not merely concerned with
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, but with the East as well a scholar - ship not only of texts , but of the very spirit of antiquity .

		That tragic calmness which was his favorite attitude towards life and fate ; that haughty dissatisfaction with the ugliness and triviality of the present , the pettiness and unreason of humanity ; that exclusive worship of immoral beauty ; that single longing after the annihilat - ing repose of Nirvana , was it not the all-embracing pessimism -LRB- if we like to call it , for convenience , by such a name -RRB- which is the wisdom of the
East	LOCATION	, modi - fied , certainly , by a temperament which had none of the true
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	serenity ?

		In spite of his theory of im - passibility ,
Leconte de Lisle	ORGANIZATION	has expressed only himself , whether through the mouth of
Cain	PERSON	or of
Hypatia	LOCATION	; and in the man , as I just knew him , I seemed to see all the qualities of his work ; in the rigid , impressive head , the tenacity of the cold eyes , the ideality of the forehead , the singularly unsensuous lips , a certain primness , even , in the severity , the sarcasm , of the mouth .

		Passion in
Leconte de Lisle	LOCATION	is only an intellectual passion ; emo - tion is never less than epical ; the self which he expresses through so many immobile masks is almost never a realizable human being , who has lived and loved .

		Thus it is , not merely that all this splendid writing , so fine as literature in the abstract , can never touch the multi - tude , but that for the critic of literature also there is a sense of something lacking .

		Never was fine work in verse so absolutely the negation of
Milton	LOCATION	's three re - quirements , that poetry should be simple , sensuous , and passionate . ''

		A PROPHET OF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION .

		We make the following extract from one of the let - ters of
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	in the
August	DATE	issue of '' The At - lantic Monthly . ''

		Among the many '' prophetic voices '' concerning
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	, we know of none quite so clear and sure as this .

		`` During my studies for the last six or eight months a thought which was at first vague has slowly crystal - lized into a purpose , of quite decisive aim .

		The lec - tures which I was invited to deliver
last winter	DATE	before a private class met with such an enthusiastic reception as to set me thinking very seriously of the evident de - light with which grown people found themselves receiv - ing systematic instruction in a definite study .

		This again put me upon reviewing the whole business of
Lec	ORGANIZATION	- turing , which has risen to such proportions in our country , but which , every one must feel , has now reached its climax and must soon give way like all things to something better .

		The fault of the lecture system as at present conducted a fault which must finally prove fatal to it is that it is too fragmentary , and presents too fragmentary a mass indigesta moles of facts be - fore the hearers .

		Now if , instead of such a series as that of the popular Star Course -LRB- for instance -RRB- in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, a scheme of lectures should be arranged which would amount to the systematic presentation of a given subject , then the audience would receive a substantial benefit , and would carry away some genuine possession at the end of the course .

		The subject thus systematically presented might be either scientific -LRB- as
Botany	LOCATION	, for ex - ample , or Biology popularized , and the like -RRB- , or domes - tic -LRB- as detailed in the accompanying printed extract under the ' Household ' School -RRB- , or artistic , or literary . ''

		This stage of the investigation put me to thinking of schools for grown people .

		Men and women leave college nowadays just at the time when they are really prepared to study with effect .

		There is indeed a vague notion of this abroad ; but it remains vague .

		Any in - telligent grown man or woman readily admits that it would be well indeed , many whom I have met sin - cerely desire to pursue some regular course of thought ; but there is no guidance , no organized means of any sort , by which people engaged in ordinary avocations can accomplish such an aim . ''

		Here , then , seems to be , first , a universal admission of the usefulness of organized intellectual pursuit for business people ; secondly , an underlying desire for it by many of the people themselves ; and thirdly , an ex - isting institution -LRB- the lecture system -RRB- which , if the idea were once started , would quickly adapt itself to the new conditions . ''

		In short , the present miscellaneous lecture courses ought to die and be borne again as Schools for Grown People . ''

		Cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		After a comparatively long period of silence the author of '' The Deemster '' and '' The Scapegoat '' reappears hefore the public with a romance which is pronounced by critics his strongest work .

		In `` The Manxman '' Mr. .

		Caine returns to the field in which he won his first success .

		To this novel he has devoted the best powers of his active brain , and it embodies the most vivid pictures which his splendid imagination had drawn .

		It is a romance which seizes upon and enthralls the reader by its tremendous power , intense vitality , and succession of dramatic effects .

		In a time when so much fiction is written with the finger-tip in dilettante fashion , it is like a sudden awakening to meet with a romance so deep in its analysis , so intense in feeling , and so irresistible in its hold upon the reader 's imagination and intellect .

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	himself is understood to regard `` The Manxman '' as his strongest work , and the great success of his other books promises a remarkable career for this .

		As a promoter of good spirits , a contributor to the gayety of nations , Miss

		Everybody laughed over her '' Adoption '' of her farm .

		Her * ' Abandonment '' is , if possible , more vivacious and entertaining , and in view of the large sales of her former book , the new story of her extraordinary visitors , her agricultural misadventures , and the reasons for her flitting , seems certain to prove one of the most popular books of the season .

		But experience on the platform and in private conversation has shown me that something may be done to smooth the way for untrained feet ... If the

		130 THE FREEDOM OF TEACHING .

		The trial for heresy has become of late years so common an incident in theological circles that a new case , unless marked by distinctive features of a sensational character , would now attract little or no attention outside of the church organization directly concerned .

		We have also been provided with the amusing spec - tacle , particularly in the South , of professors in sectarian institutions of learning brought to book for their failure to teach an astronomy or a geology or a biology in accordance with certain theological tenets based upon a strictly literal interpretation of the Scriptures .

		But it has been reserved for the
University of Wis	ORGANIZATION	- consin to offer the first example , to our knowl - edge , of a trial for heresy in which theology has no part .

		To hale a public teacher of science before an investigating committee , for the pur - pose of examining his opinions and pronounc - ing upon their orthodoxy from a purely scien - tific standpoint , is a procedure so novel , and , we may add , so startling , that one may well pause to consider its significance , and the pos - sible consequences of an extension of the prin - ciple thus involved .

		Before discussing the subject , it may be well to recapitulate the facts .

		Some weeks ago , the
Wisconsin State	ORGANIZATION	Superintendent of Public In - struction , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, published in a
New York	LOCATION	journal a communication upon the subject of Professor
Ely	PERSON	, Director of the
School of Eco	ORGANIZATION	- nomics at
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		This communication , which was headed '' The Col - lege Anarchist , '' charged Professor
Ely	PERSON	with the justification of strikes and the practice of boycotts .

		He was reported to have entertained and consulted with a walking-delegate , abetted a strike in a printing-office at
Madison	LOCATION	, threat - ened to withdraw his custom unless it were made a union office , and to have said in con - versation that union men should be employed in preference to non-union men , that only cranks had conscientious scruples against joining un - ions .

		His books , assumed to represent his teach - ings , were described as containing '' utopian , impracticable , -LSB- and -RSB- pernicious doctrines , '' and as furnishing '' a seeming moral justification of attacks upon life and property . ''

		104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Allowing for the obvious animus of this com - munication , the charges made do not seem to have been very formidable .

		To entertain a walking-delegate may be questionable as a mat - ter of taste , but hardly comes in the category of heinous social offences .

		And we do not know that a man is to be condemned outright for wishing to have his printing done in a union office .

		As for the other charges , it may be said that there are strikes and strikes , that second - hand reports of conversation are vague and readily colorable , and that the perniciousness of Professor
Ely	PERSON	's doctrines , which , as Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself admits , '' only the careful stu - dent will discover , '' is obviously not to be made the subject of an off-hand pronouncement .

		But Professor
Ely	PERSON	's accuser , by virtue of his posi - tion at the head of the
State Department of Public Instruction	ORGANIZATION	, making him ex officio a mem - ber of the
Board of Eegents of the State Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , could not well be ignored ; and , in consequence of his charges , a committee of in - vestigation was appointed , before which Pro- fessor
Ely	PERSON	and his accuser were summoned .

		The '' trial '' was set for the twentieth of Au - gust .

		As a preliminary , the committee had laid down the general principle that the inves - tigation should not go outside the personal charges made against Professor
Ely	PERSON	, and his actual teachings as an instructor in the Uni - versity .

		When the committee met for its in - vestigation , Superintendent
Wells	PERSON	failed to appear , but was represented by a lengthy com - munication , of which the substance was that his opinion of Professor
Ely	PERSON	's teachings was based mainly upon Professor
Ely	PERSON	's books , and that to rule those books out of the investiga - tion was to deprive the accuser of the only available means of substantiating his charges , as far as these related to the university teach - ing of the
Professor of Economics	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the meanwhile , Professor
Ely	PERSON	had made public de - nial of the personal charges , accompanying the denial with this stinging comment : '' The man who makes these charges against me is well known to his neighbors as a politician of the meaner sort , who , too small to appreciate the most important trust ever committed to him , betrayed it in his insensate love of notoriety . ''

		This denial Professor
Ely	PERSON	repeated before the committee ; and Superintendent
Wells	PERSON	, in an - other communication , admitted that he was unable to produce evidence in support of the charges reflecting upon Professor
Ely	PERSON	's char - acter as a citizen .

		With this episode , and some further elaboration of the controversial amen - ities already illustrated , the proceedings prac - tically collapsed ; and at last accounts Super - intendent Wells was studying Professor
Ely	PERSON	's books for the purpose of making out his case on the score of economic heterodoxy .

		Since trials for heresy are almost the order of the day , it was perhaps hardly natural to expect that they would remain confined to the domain of theology .

		If they are to seek other territories and other victims , there is no doubt that political science offers a promising field for the heresy-hunter .

		The irritant quality of political discussion is well known , and its ca - pacity for inflaming the passions is hardly ex - ceeded by that of theological controversy itself .

		Political or economic principles are often at - tacked and defended in a spirit of partisan bit - terness which might prove instructive to the polemics of Catholicism and Protestantism , and from which
Arians	PERSON	and Athanasians might have taken useful hints .

		Hence we are not surprised that a professor of political science should at last have been brought to book in the good old theological fashion , although it is of course deeply to be regretted that any field of science should suffer invasion from the spirit of intol - erance , that any attempt should be made to im - pose opinions upon men whose only aim in life is to form rational opinions of their own and to help others in the hard struggle for truth .

		We are not particularly concerned to defend Professor
Ely	PERSON	's economic views .

		There is not a little justice in the charge that his books are '' innocent of clear-cut thought . ''

		He is a fa - cile writer , and an exceptionally diffuse one .

		His phraseology is often vague and bewilder - ing , if not actually misleading .

		In reading his books , one gets the impression that the most permanent facts of political science have some - how gone into solution , and that there is little prospect of a new crystallization .

		These char - acteristics are shared with many other writers of the so-called '' new school '' of economics , but they are unusually prominent in Professor
Ely	PERSON	's writings .

		Nor do we doubt that his doc - trines have a general socialistic trend , however ingeniously he may narrow the definition of socialism for the purpose of escaping its stigma , or urge that there are far more radical socialists than himself .

		We do not believe that true so - cial progress is always to be sought along the lines that he suggests , or that the principles of '' orthodox '' economic science are by any means as badly discredited as he insinuates .

		But all this is beside the real question at is - sue .

		That question is nothing less than whether
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105 university teaching shall be fettered or free .

		The great principle of Lehrfreiheit is involved in this episode of the trial of Professor
Ely	PERSON	, and no one who has Yi realizing sense of the vast importance of defending that principle from attack can take long in judging of this partic - ular case .

		We do not hesitate to characterize as an outrage the arraignment of Professor
Ely	PERSON	before a committee charged with investi - gating the soundness of his scientific teaching .

		It is an indignity which he is justified in resent - ing , and which every teacher in the
United States	LOCATION	should resent with him .

		He was ap - pointed to his present position on account of his scholarly reputation .

		That reputation has not sensibly altered in quality during his pres - ent incumbency , while it has noticeably grown with his widened opportunities .

		Those respon - sible for his appointment presumably had their eyes open , and knew what his reputation was .

		The position of a teacher of Professor
Ely	PERSON	's experience should be practically unassailable , and he should be absolutely free to do his own work in his own way .

		The time for examina - tion and investigation is before appointments are made , or during what may be called the years of apprenticeship , the first two or three years of work , in which a man and those re - sponsible for him find out whether he has hit his vocation or missed it .

		That the beginner should be appointed from year to year , and upon probation , is both natural and necessary ; that the man who has once won his professional spurs should be subject to any such chances is monstrous .

		Only for some offence of the gross - est sort , only for something far more serious than the worst that has ever been alleged against Professor
Ely	PERSON	, would any board of ed - ucational trustees be justified in questioning the tenure of a duly appointed teacher of expe - rience and reputation .

		For what is the alternative , the fatal ad - mission once made that teaching is to be con - trolled by boards of regents and superintend - ents of education ?

		There is but one possible answer to this question .

		Official history , offi - cial science , and official philosophy will take the place of a teaching based upon untram - melled research and the unbiased pursuit of truth .

		Such a course can only spell inefficiency , hypocrisy , stagnation . ''

		Der Wahrheit ist die Atmosphare der Freiheit unentbehrlich , '' says
Schopenhauer	PERSON	in his vigorous onslaught upon the official philosophy prevalent among the Ger - man universities in his time .

		Peculiarly in our own country , with a democracy that has not yet learned the natural limitations of all de - mocracies , that still childishly assumes the voice of the people to be the voice of God even in matters only to be judged of by the trained intellect , is such a warning needed .

		The au - thorities of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, how - ever excellent their intentions , and however worthy their official zeal , have set , in this trial of a public teacher of science , an example of the most unfortunate character , an example only too likely to be followed elsewhere , and which , in assailing the principle of
Lehrfrei	LOCATION	- heit , assails intellectual advancement itself in one of its most fundamental conditions .

		ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
NEBRASKA	LOCATION	* The study of English as rhetoric and composition , and as English literature and philology , is com - pletely differentiated in the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	.

		Writing is taught on the theory that constant tech - nical practice is necessary , but practice in the de - velopment and adjustment of meaning in the mind as well as in appropriate and effective statement .

		In other words , not facility with the media , of ex - pression , not automatism in phrasing merely , but organic , completed communication , in both matter and manner , is the aim of the study .

		As contribu - tive to this end , work in oral composition or public speaking not required , but elected very generally by the students at some period in their course is arranged for and emphasized by the department head .

		Of thirteen hundred students in attendance last year , almost the entire number , excepting spe - cials , and including nearly eight hundred young men and women in college courses , were under rhetorical instruction of some kind .

		One professor , two instruct - ors , and one assistant are exclusively responsible for this work .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, as the
Department of English	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Department of English Literature	ORGANIZATION	, on the other hand , confines itself to instruction in literature proper , including both the earlier as well as the latest forms of development , with recognition of linguistic relations and differ - ences between .

		The work begins in the second year of residence , with Anglo-Saxon and Early English .

		In this study there are four exercises a week through - out the year .

		The class is drilled daily from the start in writing forms , until , after reading fifteen or twenty pages of prose , and practically mastering the verb-groups and inflections , it is ready to begin poetry .

		The most imaginative parts of the '' Genesis '' and the '' Exodus '' are then used as an introduction , and by the middle of
December	DATE	'' Bedwulf '' is begun .

		This poem is studied almost wholly as literature , and by the end of
March	DATE	has been read to the extent of
2000	DATE	lines or over .

		By making the study literary and not philologic , there is no difficulty in keeping up the enthusiasm of the class , and for three years only one student has been dropped from the roll on account of inability to carry the work .

		From
April	DATE	to the end of the year the class reads Middle En - glish , generally in
Morris	PERSON	's '' Specimens , '' with such illustration and appropriation of historical prin - ciples as can be gained by two months ' companion study of
Lounsbury	PERSON	's '' History . ''

		By this year 's work the student gets a general idea of the development of the literature and language to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, as also a clear appreciation of the fundamental forms and modes of sentiment in Teutonic poetry .

		The study of Anglo-Saxon and Early English is prescribed in but two of the eight groups of under - graduate work .

		It is followed by a general survey of English literary development from Chaucer to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, three exercises a week through two sem - esters .

		This subject is taken by nearly all the stu - dents at some point in the course , being required in six out of the eight groups .

		Here students from the Anglo-Saxon studies of the year preceding , as also from the classical and the philosophical courses , are put at work along with men from the industrial sections , from the scientific , the agricultural , and the electrical engineering groups of study .

		Of the hundred and twenty members of a given class thus made up , more than two-thirds are without literary traditions or taste or training , or interest in pure literature of any sort .

		The theory of the work done with this class is simply that students in college have generally not yet taste for the best literature , or prepared capacity to appropriate its aesthetic meaning , but must have both aroused or enabled in them at the outset .

		To do this a month is de - voted to inductive exercises in discriminating poetic or emotional terms and phrases from prosaic , and in interpreting metres , figures , and force .

		It is steadfastly believed that the study of literature as literature is impossible to minds insensible to the inner differences between prose and poetry , and blank to aesthetic challenge or suggestion .

		More - over , experience with the work has not proved the existence of minds so blank or insensible as not to yield , along with others of better traditions or training , to the influence of such first culture , or less completely and readily than they .

		Students from the so-called classical or literary groups do not prove superior , either in aptness or preparation , after the opening and quickening of the sensibili - ties , to those from the technical courses of study .

		Last year a
University Browning Club	ORGANIZATION	, conceived and planned wholly from among pupils under in - struction , was organized and put in operation upon a permanent basis .

		But the young men and wo - men projecting it and having it in charge were from the scientific rather than the literary side of the class in question .

		Indeed , the success of all later courses in the department is found to be largely dependent upon the interest aroused in the first month 's study .

		The attention of teachers yet troubled about getting their classes interested in literature is invited to the re - sults from this manner of opening the year .

		It must not be imagined that the work here done has been in any way the result of expert teaching , for the tutor in charge is but a recent graduate , not yet strong in handling college classes .

		It is demon - strated that , with perfected instruction , out of a hundred average students fit to carry work above secondary grades , practically and positively a full hundred appreciative and even enthusiastic readers of best literature may be made .

		When a class has learned to read literature as literature , with true aesthetic discernment of its spiritual quality , it will go forward of its own momentum .

		When it is all agog , even to the last member , over '' Lycidas '' or the '' Adonais , '' teaching becomes merely guidance , sug - gestion , is no longer dogmatic exposition or author - ity .

		It is neither just nor necessary to allow col - lege credit for reading vernacular masterpieces , just as for Sophocles or Terence , even should consider - able attention be given to the notes .

		The mere reading should be taken for granted , as also , when enabled and attained , the higher experiences from the reading .

		Credit should not be entered upon the books of a college for such higher expe - riences , but only for knowledge gained or culture won at first hand .

		But on the strength of interest aroused beforehand the college pupil may be led to do work that will make him a life-long interpreter of aesthetic literature , or at least save him from skepticism concerning its pretensions .

		The work of this general survey , when fairly begun , consists in class study of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		There is accompanying study of biographies and general literary history , including evolution of new princi - ples , with systematic library readings , and prepara - tion of notes , in a hundred representative authors .

		No further work in this department is prescribed .

		There are elective courses in advanced Anglo-Saxon and philology ,
Browning	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, in conjunc - tion with systematic criticism ,
American Litera	ORGANIZATION	- ture , Old Testament poetry , and theory of literary teaching .

		THE DIAL pies of everyday interpretation , in second-year work of a more advanced and systematic character , and finally in third-year seminary interpretation and re - search .

		There is also seminary work through two semesters in the development of literature , given last year in the evolution and history of character hints in poetry and fiction , and of certain other fundamen - tal modes of imagination .

		In all there are twenty - two semester courses offered by the department , with an enrollment last year of something over three hundred and fifty names .

		The work is car - ried by one professor , one tutor , and an assistant .

		The energy of the department has been largely de - voted for some years to the effort of securing the same definiteness and sureness of results in litera - ture for all minds as have been reached in other subjects .

		Such success as has been attained has been emulated among the high schools of our
State	ORGANIZATION	, and to a degree worthy at least of mention here .

		Several of the accredited schools have begun , at their own instance , to do the preliminary work of the survey class , and so well as to establish their ability to fit for college work in literature just as in
Greek	LOCATION	, mathematics , and the sciences .

		In fact , they have demonstrated that the proper place to open the mind to the inspiration of literature is in the secondary schools , and not the college .

		Some fifteen teachers of English in our fifty-five accredited academies and high schools will do the preliminary work of our survey course this year , and will do it essentially as well as we .

		It is our intention to recog - nize the quality of the work by admitting their pu - pils to immediate instruction in literature , by the de - vice of an advanced division , upon entrance .

		`` O Master of imperial lays !

		Crowned in the fulness of thy days ; One heart that owned thy gracious spell Thy reverend mien remembers well ; '' For mine it was , ere fell the snow Upon this head of long ago , My modest wreath to intertwine With richer offerings at thy shrine . ''

		A guest upon that day of days , How leapt my heart to hymn thy praise !

		Yea , from that hour my spirit wore A high content unknown before . ''

		So read Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	, with clear musical voice , from the low platform in the
Bryant	PERSON	maple grove at
Cummington	LOCATION	, while the many invited guests beside her , and the assembled thousands in front , hung breath - lessly upon her words .

		Of all that vast company , per - haps five thousand in number , I do not think that more than one -LRB- Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	-RRB- was present on the occa - sion , thirty years before , to which she made this allu - sion in her poem .

		It was the
Bryant Festival	ORGANIZATION	at the
Century Club	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	to which she referred , held in honor of the poet 's seventieth birthday , and at which
George Bancroft	PERSON	presided as president of the club , and
Emerson	PERSON	and Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	were the principal invited guests .

		That distinguished company also included Bay - ard
Taylor	PERSON	,
George H. Boker	PERSON	,
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	,
Thomas Buchanan	PERSON	Read ,
Christopher P. Cranch	PERSON	, Rich - ard
H. Dana , Jr.	PERSON	,
William M. Evarts	PERSON	, and
Richard Henry Stoddard	PERSON	, all of whom read poems or made speeches , besides the brilliant galaxy of artists for which the

Brown	PERSON	.

		The volume containing the exercises of that occasion is before me as I write , and among the numerous por - traits shown is a photograph of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	in
1864	DATE	.

		Time has indeed whitened her hair and deepened the lines of her face , but the firm , thoughtful brow and poetic mouth are unchanged .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's first appearance in the morning at Cum - mington , and the singing of her '' Battle Hymn of the Republic '' by the company , had been the occasion of a spontaneous burst of applause not equalled during the day ; but her reading of her poem in the afternoon was marked by a quieter , if more intense , demonstration .

		It was somewhat by accident that the writer found himself among the invited guests of the
Bryant Cen	ORGANIZATION	- tenary at
Cummington	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, on
August 16	DATE	, held in honor of the one hundredth anniversary of the poet 's birth at that place .

		How to describe the many events of the journey there and of the day itself , in one short letter , is somewhat puzzling .

		While the programme of exercises was carried out with complete success , and while the speakers were distinguished and their re - marks worthy of the occasion , yet it was what might be called the accessories of the celebration which most impressed one visitor .

		When I saw an announcement last
spring	DATE	that the centenary of
Bryant	PERSON	's birth -LRB-
November 3 , 1794	DATE	-RRB- was to be celebrated next
November	DATE	at
Great Barrington	LOCATION	, Berkshire county ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, I was somewhat surprised , for
Bryant	PERSON	was born in
Cummington	LOCATION	, in
Hampshire	LOCATION	county , and only practiced law for a few years at Great Bar - rington , soon giving up the profession and leaving the place through disgust at being non-suited because of some technical neglect of a case on his part .

		Then
last month	DATE	the announcement was made that the day of birth would be anticipated for the better convenience of those who were to be present , and that the celebration would be held at
Cummington	LOCATION	.

		I then realized , what was probably the fact , that the
Cummington	LOCATION	people did not intend to be robbed of their town 's distinction as the birthplace of the poet .

		Their committee , under the leadership of
Wesley Guruey	PERSON	,
Lorenzo H. Tower	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Henrietta S. Nahmer	PERSON	, the secretary , took active steps to ensure a successful affair .

		Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	presided .

		He was introduced by Mr.
Tower	PERSON	, who is librarian of the library founded by Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	at Cum - mington , and who made an address to which I shall again refer .

		Mr.
Godwin	PERSON	spoke , and was followed by
Edwin R. Brown	PERSON	, of
Elmwood	LOCATION	, 111. , a native of Cum - mington , selected for this reason and because of his per - sonal friendship with
John Howard Bryant	PERSON	, only sur - viving brother of
William Cullen	PERSON	, and himself a poet , also a resident of
Elmwood	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	delivered the memorial address , a scholarly production , which held the close attention of the audience for over an hour .

		Mr.
John Howard Bryant	PERSON	, who carries his eighty-seven 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, years with a nervous yet delicate vigor , read '' A Mon - ody '' on the death of his brother .

		Then came the sing - ing of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's '' Battle Hymn , '' and an intermis - sion for refreshments .

		In the afternoon , besides Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's poem , there were addresses by
John Bigelow	PERSON	,
Charles Dudley War	PERSON	- ner ,
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, Rev.
John W. Chadwick	PERSON	, and President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	of
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Con - troller
James H. Eckels	PERSON	was also called on for a speech , and Mr.
John Howard Bryant	PERSON	recited another poem , '' At Eighty-Seven . ''

		Cummington lies on the crest and at the foot of a hill in western
Hampshire	LOCATION	county , which is itself surrounded by an amphitheatre of similar hills .

		The nearest rail - way station on the east is distant some thirteen miles , and stations on the west and north are distant twenty miles .

		It is the centre of what are called the '' hill towns '' of Hampshire county , a region quite distinct from the
Berkshire	LOCATION	district made famous by the mem - ory of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Herman Melville	PERSON	, and Miss Sedg - wick .

		To reach
Cummington	LOCATION	from any direction , you must go over a hill ,
Goshen	LOCATION	hill on the east , from
Northampton	LOCATION	, where Cable lives , or Lightning Bug hill on the north , from
Ashfield	LOCATION	, where
Curtis	PERSON	spent his sum - mers for so many years , and where
Charles Eliot Nor	PERSON	- ton now has his summer abode .

		The
Bryant	PERSON	houses are near the top of
Cummington	LOCATION	hill , the old homestead where the poet was brought up being two or three hun - dred feet below the other house , and it was near the homestead that the exercises were held .

		A relative of the
Bryant	PERSON	family and myself took an early start on the '' electric '' from
Northampton	LOCATION	to the stage terminus , the afternoon before the celebration , and it was well for us that we did so .

		We established ourselves in the stage a full half-hour before the horses were attached , and found , to our surprise , that more than twice the people it would carry were waiting to take it as it was driven out .

		Most of these people were obliged to seek private conveyances or wait over until the next morning .

		Then followed a dreary three hours ' pull up
Goshen	LOCATION	hill , two horses having to do the work of four .

		We arrived at
Cummington	LOCATION	in time to take supper and to attend a children 's concert at the village church .

		There was a local orchestra of four or five pieces , and a chorus , both of which also took part in the exercises next day ; and there were recitations from
Bryant	PERSON	's poems and compositions by the children , all under the management of a tireless young lady resident .

		Looking at the children , as they were grouped in the front pews , I was struck by the preponderance of pure
New England	LOCATION	types , such a collection of which I had not seen in twenty years , or before familiar districts in
New England	LOCATION	were invaded by foreign immigration .

		So I was not surprised next day to learn from Mr. Tower 's admirable address that '' the town is still one of pure
New England	LOCATION	stock , and out of two hundred voters only three are not of American birth .

		... It is still a farming community , as it was a hundred years ago , and the farmers win a scanty living from rebellious soil . ''

		To me , this children 's concert , with its manifes - tation of the pure native stock , was the most interest - ing feature of the
Bryant Centenary	ORGANIZATION	.

		Something of the same showing was evident next day , at the exercises .

		Many driving parties came over from the now fashionable towns of Berkshire , but the society people were practically lost in the mass of village peo - ple , numbers of whom had driven thirty or forty miles and camped out over night on the way .

		And such '' old , old , old , old ladies , '' and men , too , as there were among them , with deep lines of toil and narrow living cut into their faces .

		There were fashions a great deal older than those of the revived
1830	DATE	type , and there were hats worn by some old men which no words of mine could describe .

		Squalling babies were occasionally in evidence , and people on the outskirts of the crowd could have heard but little of the speakers ' remarks , although they stood through the proceedings with eyes glued on the more distinguished , and even on the less distin - guished , occupants of the platform .

		Among the former , in addition to the speakers , were Miss
Julia S. Bryant	PERSON	, the daughter of
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	, and many mem - bers of the
Bryant	PERSON	family ,
Miss Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Kate Upson Clark	PERSON	.

		A feature of the celebration was the singing of the bard-like
John W. Hutchinson	PERSON	, the last of the
Hutchinson	PERSON	family , who stirred the au - dience with his rendering of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's hymn and with some of his old-time songs .

		The residents of
Cummington	LOCATION	covered themselves with credit in all their arrangements for the Centenary .

		The disposition of the platform and seats rising up the slope of a small elevation in the grove , the plain but bountiful collation for the two hundred guests of the committee , and the convenience for stabling probably five times the number of horses ever collected in the town before , were perfect in every respect .

		All but the special guests of the committee brought their provisions with them , and the sight of several thousand people picnicking in the grove was something to be remem - bered .

		After the exercises I walked along '' the rivu - let '' -LRB- the subject of
Bryant	PERSON	's poem of that name -RRB- which runs by the old homestead , and down the hill to the monument which marks the sight of his birthplace .

		Looking about the wide amphitheatre of hills which stretch away on every side , in the evening glow of a perfect
summer	DATE	's day , it was not difficult to guess the inspiration of '' Thanatopsis . ''

		THE DIAL 109 THE TRIAL OF PROFESSOR ELY .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Madison ,
Wis.	LOCATION	,
August 25 , 1894	DATE	.

		The
Wisconsin State	ORGANIZATION	Superintendent of Public In - struction , Mr.
O. E. Wells	PERSON	, has done for Professor
R. T. Ely	PERSON	, of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	, a like service to that which Professor
Patton	PERSON	rendered Professor Swing .

		Whatever Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's intention may have been , the only result can be to intrench more strongly than ever the man he has attacked , while at the same time giving him an instant national prominence which could in the usual course of things come only as the long result of time and labor .

		Professor
Ely	PERSON	has the great advantage of being the first sociological heretic to be brought to book ; the first of a long line to come if we are to be - lieve the charges and insinuations which have been lately going the rounds , that the increasing boldness of radi - cal socialism , and even of anarchy itself , is in a large measure due to encouragement in high places .

		He will have the further satisfaction of not being obliged to pose as a sociological martyr also ; for to be a religious martyr is not half bad in these latter days , while to be suspected of favoring strikes and anarchy butters no professor 's parsnips .

		Professor
Ely	PERSON	has very likely felt that his affliction , though it endure but for a moment , is more chastening than providential ; yet he may well congratulate him - self that
Providence	LOCATION	chose such a very feeble rod of chastisement as Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		No man could teach and write so much as Professor
Ely	PERSON	without laying himself open to skilful attack at some unguarded point ; but Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has succeeded simply in furnishing in his own per - son another brilliant illustration of the madness which goes before the destruction of the gods .

		In '' The Nation '' of
New York	LOCATION	, of
July 12	DATE	, when the public excitement over the railroad strike was at its height , there appeared a letter signed
O. E. Wells	PERSON	, and bearing the somewhat startling heading '' The College Anarchist . ''

		The letter was a column in length , but the gist of it is as follows : First , `` that there is a sort of moral justification for the attack on life and prop - erty based on a theory which comes from the colleges , lecture-rooms , and latterly from the churches , and is supported by the teaching and practice of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	. ''

		Secondly , Professor
Ely	PERSON	entertained , and was in frequent consultation with , a certain '' walk - ing-delegate '' during a strike which occurred in
Madi	PERSON	- son in the beginning of the present year .

		Third , Pro- fessor
Ely	PERSON	threatened to take his printing from a certain firm unless they employed union men .

		Fourth , Pro- fessor
Ely	PERSON	declared that '' a dirty , dissipated , unmar - ried , unreliable , and unskilled tramp , if a union man , should be employed in preference to an industrious , skil - ful , trustworthy , non-union man who is the head of a family . ''

		Fifth , '' Only a careful student will discover the Utopian , impracticable , or pernicious doctrines -LSB- of Professor
Ely	PERSON	's books -RSB- , but their general acceptance will furnish a seeming moral justification for attacks on life and property such as the country is already becoming so familiar with . ''

		To the Regents of the
Wisconsin State University	ORGANIZATION	all this was '' mighty interesting reading , '' especially as the newspapers all over the country were soon in full cry .

		It was '' important if true , '' and it did not take the
Honorable Board	ORGANIZATION	long to appoint a committee of three , which should summon accuser and accused to ap - pear in their
august	DATE	presence and elucidate things .

		After two postponements , all parties concerned were finally gotten together in the Law Building of the
University	ORGANIZATION	on the
evening	TIME	of
August 21	DATE	, each of the opposing par - ties being represented by a lawyer .

		After considerable preliminary sparring between the lawyers , it became evident that the policy of the plaintiff was one of delay and of readiness to back out on any decent pretext .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, having accomplished his object in spreading his accusations broadcast , seemed not to be greatly inter - ested in the investigation .

		The defence filed an em - phatic denial of each and every charge contained in the accusations , in order .

		Then appeared the weakness of the plaintiff 's case .

		Although the letter begins by first attacking Professor
Ely	PERSON	's teachings , then his personal acts , and finally his writings , the lawyer for Mr.
Wells	PERSON	made every possible effort to ignore all the first part and confine the inquiry to the last count only ; namely , the writings .

		At last they were forced to confess that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	could not possibly testify anything about the teaching , because he had never heard a single lecture by Professor
Ely	PERSON	, and had not even read the only one of the Professor 's books which is prescribed as part of the university course .

		Thus the first and most impor - tant part of the attack fell flat .

		Much against the wish of the plaintiff , the charges referring to Professor
Ely	PERSON	's personal acts was next , taken up ; and the reason of the reluctance became man - ifest as soon as the testimony of witnesses was taken .

		Every charge under the third and fourth counts was flatly contradicted , and showed conclusively that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	had either carelessly or maliciously taken mere street gossip as a basis of his very serious public accusa - tions , without taking the trouble to ascertain the truth .

		The proceedings were enlivened by several sharp ver - bal scrimmages between the two lawyers and the com - mittee , to the great delight of the audience .

		At this point , and at the desire of the plaintiff , an ad - journment of three days was interposed to give him time to recover breath , and to collect all the damning ex - tracts which he could find in Professor
Ely	PERSON	's works .

		Thus far the investigation had been a farce ; but now we were promised something very serious .

		The second hearing was attended by a still larger audience , includ - ing many ladies ; but Mr.
Wells	PERSON	was not in it .

		He had had enough .

		Under such circumstances it would probably have oc - curred to a fair-minded man that a great wrong had been done Professor
Ely	PERSON	, and that the least reparation possible was a full retraction and ample apology .

		But Mr.
Wells	PERSON	thought otherwise .

		He regarded it as a fit - ting opportunity to send another long letter to the com - mittee , in which he refused to be present at the inves - tigation any further , on the plea of having been so advised by friends because of some applause that had occurred at the opening of the trial , and because of '' restrictions '' imposed by the committee .

		He reiterated several of his exploded charges , in the face of the fact that they had been disproved , and then proceeded to consider the main point ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the socialistic character of Professor
Ely	PERSON	's writings .

		The latter part of the letter was therefore the total residuum of this formidable at - tack which had called forth so much comment from the press .

		It was chiefly an exposition of the impression produced by their perusal upon the mind of the reader ; i. e. , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's mind .

		He found this to be very bad .

		He endeavored to support his impressions by a few quo - tations , which , isolated from their connection , might easily assume to a willing eye the outlines of a cloven 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, foot .

		It is hardly necessary to say that almost any - thing could be deduced from any author by this ex - tremely naive method of exegesis ; but when the quota - tions were afterward read by the defence in their proper connection , the disingenuousness of the method became apparent .

		That was the end of
Wells	LOCATION	.

		The defence now had the easy and pleasant task of repelling his last feeble attacks , by quotations from Professor
Ely	PERSON	's works , by the oral testimony of his former students now teachers in other institutions , and by many written assurances of high regard which had been received from prominent men .

		Against the '' impressions '' which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's mind received from a perusal of Professor
Ely	PERSON	's works were opposed the scholarly criticisms and endorsements of President
Adams	PERSON	of
Wisconsin University	ORGANIZATION	, President
Andrews of Brown	PERSON	, Professor Small of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	, editor of '' Review of Reviews , '' Mr.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	,
Federal Commissioner	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		All this cloud of witnesses , while admitting differences of opinion in matters of detail , united in em - phatically endorsing Professor
Ely	PERSON	, and in repelling all insinuations that there was in his teachings , writings , or personal influence anything leaning toward or pro- vocative of anarchy in the slightest degree .

		On the con - trary , he has always deprecated strikes and boycotts as resulting in more harm than good to the cause of Labor .

		Finally , Professor
Ely	PERSON	, being sworn , testified that to his knowledge he had never even seen the walking-dele - gate whom he was accused of entertaining , nor had he consulted with any walking-delegate whatsoever .

		The committee is to make its formal report to the
Board of Regents	ORGANIZATION	, whose next meeting comes on the eighteenth of
September	DATE	; but there can be little doubt what that report will be .

		THE PROPOSED SOCIETY OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I confess I have less confidence than Professor Gay - ley seems to have in the study of the literature of sav - age tribes as affecting present canons of criticism .

		Literature , as we know it and are interested in it , is es - sentially a product of culture .

		What primarily concerns us is the literature of the Aryan peoples , and among them the literature which has been tinctured by , if it is not a product of , the civilizations of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Among the latter I include the Scandinavian , and of course the oldest English .

		Among non-Aryan peoples , the Hebrews have profoundly influenced all modern Oc - cidental literature ; and among non-European civiliza - tions belonging to the Aryan branch , we may fairly in - clude the Hindoos , as represented by
Sanskrit	ORGANIZATION	, and to some extent by more modern literature .

		If to these we add the Finnish Kalevala , and a few folk-songs which may lie beyond the Aryan pale , we have a corpus which , in my opinion , it would be well to master first , before prosecuting too far our researches into the drama of the Papuans , or the epic of
Dahomey	LOCATION	.

		There may well be societies of comparative literature , I grant ; but I conceive that our most pressing need in this country at present is to understand the English literature , and those most nearly allied to it , and that this object may be more directly subserved than by devoting too large a portion of our leisure to the literature of the
South Sea	LOCATION	islands .

		THE
NEW YORK	LOCATION	`` NATION '' AND ITS `` COLLEGE ANARCHIST . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Now that the charge against Professor
Ely	PERSON	has been * exploded and proved to have come from a breechless cannon , hurting most the meddlesome one who foolishly or recklessly touched it off , one beholding the vanishing smoke-cloud may well ask how it is that so much smudge and racket should have come about so needlessly .

		The responsibility for the accusation and trial of Dr.
Ely	PERSON	must be divided , it seems , between Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, the Su - perintendent of
Public Instruction of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and `` The Nation '' of
New York	LOCATION	; the one having written the letter containing the charges , and the other having printed it with the title of '' The College Anarchist '' and endorsed and followed it up editorially .

		Surely such charges and such an epithet could be justified , if at all , only by the most ample and unequivocal evi - dence of their truthfulness .

		The word `` anarchist , '' as applied to a college professor , is about the most in - jurious that could be chosen ; hardly less damaging , at the present time , than the term ex-murderer or horse - thief .

		It is worse , really , than to call a lawyer a shys - ter , a physician a quack , or a clergyman a mountebank .

		These have the world before them ; if a public stigma is placed upon their name in one place , they can go to another region and begin anew .

		But a college profes - sor has at best but few openings , and a reproach or doubt clinging to him in
one quarter	DATE	is pretty certain to follow him elsewhere and effectually check his career .

		These considerations show how serious was the moral , , and presumably the legal , responsibility assumed in call - ing Professor Ely '' The College Anarchist , '' and will cause the public , particularly members of Dr.
Ely	PERSON	's profession , to look with interest for whatever of repara - tion may be accorded him .

		Even though he may have gained rather than lost by the unjust attack upon him , the principle involved is the same as in the case of those who might be equally innocent yet not so strong or able to defend themselves so successfully .

		Words are dan - gerous things , and the injury they may do is often irre - parable .

		The word `` anarchist '' is coming to be used a little too freely in modern economic discussion , re - minding one unpleasantly of the religious '' heretic '' or the political '' suspect '' of not so very long ago .

		We have had , perhaps , almost too much of the '' College Anarchist , '' the '' Anarchist Governor , '' the '' Anarchist Preacher , '' etc. .

		Sinister epithets are no better argu - ments than brickbats are .

		They ill become a dignified and influential journal , least of all one whose mission in part is to raise the standard of journalistic ethics .

		Such are not the examples of amenity and justice by which the manners and morals of journalism are to be im - proved -

		THE DIAL Eije MORE XAPOL , EONIC PICTURES .

		* Neither the flight of time nor the growing urgency of current questions seems to abate public curiosity concerning
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		In view of the multiplicity of books on the Emperor and of the temptations held out for the
last half century	DATE	to write them , it is rather remark - able that one of the fullest , freshest , and , in point of narrative , most trustworthy accounts , the `` Memoirs of the Baron de Meneval , '' should appear at this late day .

		Few readers , certainly , are likely to accept the writer 's exaggerated estimate of his hero ; none , on the other hand , will question the exceptional worth of his evi - dence as to facts . ''

		An honorable and a truth - ful man whose lips were never stained with a lie '' as
M. Thiers	PERSON	testified in the French Par - liament Meneval was for years -LRB- 1802-15 -RRB-
Napoleon	PERSON	's private secretary , his close friend , and a member of his household .

		He knew the Emperor as few were privileged to know him ; and it is a fact to be weighed that although custom accorded Meneval the valet 's prover - bially fatal degree of intimacy ,
Napoleon	PERSON	re - mained in his eyes a hero to the end . ''

		Faith - ful to his master till the grave , '' observes his editor , '' he sought always and everywhere , with a complete conviction and the most absolute good faith , to defend the memory of this great man . ''

		Unhappily for the defender , the changed standards of a later day have wrought disas - trously with the Emperor 's title to greatness .

		The Alexanders and Tamerlanes , men whose genius for destruction filled the rude ideal of their contemporaries and made the soil they touched a Golgotha , no longer engross history ; and the glory of the victor of
Marengo	LOCATION	and Austerlitz is happily paling before that of the Colberts and Turgots , real patriots whose goal was the solid prosperity of their countrymen .

		In view of the actual verdict of time , there is a strain of pathos in
Meneval	LOCATION	's prediction that this '' common arbitrator '' would justify his estimate of his master .

		empt from low passions , endowed with every kind of courage , constantly occupied with the care of ameliorat - ing the condition of humanity , and finally moved by the noble ambition to have desired to make of
France	LOCATION	the - most glorious and the most prosperous of nations ; am - bition too great , perhaps , in a worn-out society , for the 1 rejuvenation of which time as well as the constancy of fortune were lacking to him . ''

		Meneval might well have given his memoir Chancellor
Pasquier	PERSON	's sub-title , `` A History of My Time , '' the book being really a continuous historical narrative , interspersed with pen pic - tures and anecdotes of
Napoleon	PERSON	and his en - tourage .

		The stories of the Emperor serve mostly to illustrate his private character , rather than to depict him as the soldier and the ruler ; and here nothing is related of which the writer was not '' an eye-witness or the direct deposi - tary . ''

		Familiar historical facts are passed over or but briefly touched upon , save when the writer is able to furnish fresh light , or where his version differs materially from the one ac - cepted .

		The tragic story , for instance , of the Due d'Enghien is graphically re-told with some considerable additions as to
Napoleon	PERSON	's per - sonal share and degree of culpability in the matter .

		Meneval was a fairly good hand at a portrait .

		His characterizations of leading per - sonages
Talleyrand	LOCATION	,
Fouche	PERSON	,
Murat	LOCATION	,
Moreau	PERSON	, the members of the
Bonaparte	PERSON	family , Mme. de Stael , Mme. de Recamier , and many others are clear and pithy ; and a propos of these portraits we may cite in passing blunt
Marshall Lannes	PERSON	's summary , approvingly quoted by the author , of the wily Bishop of Autun : '' He used to say of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	's impassiveness that if he were to receive a kick in his seat of honor his face would not betray the event , and summed him up in this saying , which is perhaps strictly true , if expressed in somewhat too military language : ' It 's a lot of mud in a silk stocking . ' ''

		Opening with a brief retrospect of his early life , Meneval passes on to the date of his en - trance -LRB-
April , 1802	DATE	-RRB- into
Napoleon	PERSON	's Cabinet , as the actual , though at first not the titular , suc - cessor of Bourrienne , who was already in dis - favor .

		Meneval was present at the latter 's final dismissal which was certainly abrupt enough : `` The Consul said to him in a severe tone of voice : ' Give any papers and keys which you have of mine to Me ` neval , and withdraw .

		And never let me see you again . '

		After these few words he went back to the council , slamming the door violently behind him . ''

		Meneval 's opinion of his predecessor 's cele - brated memoirs deserves attention : '' I do not think that
Bourrienne	PERSON	was the author of the memoirs published under his name .

		I met him , in
1825	DATE	, in
Paris	LOCATION	, and he told me that he had been asked to write against the Emperor : ' In spite of all the wrong he did 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, me , ' he added , ' I could never make up my mind to do so .

		My hand would wither rather . '

		... His entire cooperation in this book consisted in some stray incom - plete notes which were worked out by certain profes - sional writers .

		These writers , whose names are men - tioned , had to make up for the insufficiency of these notes by their own researches , and with the help of ma - terials supplied by the publisher . ''

		Meneval ascribes
Bourrienne	ORGANIZATION	's consent to the use of his name to the enfeeblement of his fac - ulties , and to the financial straits which made him at the time accessible to the temptations of the publisher .

		Allowing , however , all pos - sible weight to the writer 's candor and oppor - tunities , his limitation of Bourrienne 's collab - oration to '' some stray incomplete notes '' seems too patent an understatement to need disproof .

		Meneval 's first impressions of Napoleon were most favorable : '' He spoke of my studies and of Palissot -LSB- the satir - ist and in the writer 's youth the doyen of French litter - ateurs -RSB- with a kindness and a simplicity which put me entirely at my ease , and showed me how gentle and simple this man , who bore on his forehead and in his eyes the mark of such imposing superiority , was in his private life . ''

		The portrait of the
First Consul	ORGANIZATION	as the writer then saw him is thus traced : ''
Napoleon	PERSON	was at that time moderately stout .

		* He was of middle height -LRB- about five feet two inches -RRB- , and well built , though the bust was rather long .

		His head was big and the skull largely developed .

		His neck was short and his shoulders broad .

		The size of his chest bespoke a robust constitution , less robust , however , than his mind .

		His legs were well shaped , his foot was small and well formed .

		His hand , and he was rather proud of it , was delicate and plump , with tapering fingers .

		His forehead was high and broad , his eyes grey , penetrating , and wonderfully mobile ; his nose was straight and well shaped .

		His teeth were fairly good , the mouth perfectly modelled , the upper lip slightly drawn down toward the corner of the mouth , and the chin slightly prominent .

		His skin was smooth and his complexion pale , but of a pal - lor which denoted a good circulation of the blood .

		His very fine chestnut hair , which , until the time of the ex - pedition to
Egypt	LOCATION	, he had worn long , cut square and covering his ears , was clipped short .

		The shape of his face and the ensemble of his features were remarkably regular .

		In one word , his head and his bust were in no way inferior in nobility and dignity to the most beauti - ful bust which antiquity has bequeathed to us .

		... When in a good humor , or when anxious to please , his expression was sweet and caressing , and his face was lighted up by a most beautiful smile .

		Amongst famil - iars his laugh was loud and mocking ... My portrait of Napoleon would be incomplete did I not mention the hat , without trimming or lace , which was ornamented by a little tri-color cockade , fastened with a black silk cord , and the grey surtout which covered the simple uniform of colonel of his guard .

		This hat and this surtout , which became historical with him , shone in the * A lady who saw him in

		midst of the coats covered with gold and silver embroid - ery which were worn by his generals and the officers of his household . ''

		This simplicity of dress was really a matter of choice and not of affectation as is sometimes charged .

		Meneval relates that , pending the arrival of
Marie Louise	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	, the Emperor yielded to the entreaties of the princess
Pauline	PERSON	, an acknowledged authority in matters of taste , and ordered a magnificent suit , loaded with lace and embroidery , to grace the coming event .

		The finery , however , was worn but once , and was then laid aside for the plain habit of or - dinary days .

		Readers fond of the minuter espials of biog - raphy will not find Meneval 's narrative want - ing .

		There are many curious details as to the Emperor 's domestic life and his personal hab - its .

		Of that virtue which is '' next to godli - ness '' we learn that he had his full share : '' He took frequent baths .

		He used to brush his arms and his broad chest himself .

		His valet finished by rub - bing him very vigorously on the back and shoulders .

		He formerly used to be shaved , but for a long time , that is to say since
1803	DATE	, he had shaved himself after he had changed his valet .

		A small mirror was held before him , and turned as required .

		He then used to wash himself with a great quantity of water in a silver basin , which from its size might have been taken for a vat .

		A sponge dipped in eau de cologne was passed over his hair , and the rest of the bottle was poured over his shoulders .

		... His allowance for dress had at first been fixed at 60,000 francs ; he reduced this amount to 20,000 francs , all included .

		He was fond of saying that with an in - come of 12,000 francs , and a horse , he should have all he wanted . ''

		Like
M. Levy	PERSON	,
Meneval	ORGANIZATION	is at some pains to show that
Napoleon	PERSON	possessed as he probably did a fair share of the domestic virtues , be - ing an affectionate husband and father , and the best of sons and brothers .

		Among his many engaging pictures of the Emperor 's home life there is one that seems especially attractive and characteristic .

		Ever bent on the game or the reality of war ,
Napoleon	PERSON	had some little manoeuvre-pieces made bits of wood of dif - ferent lengths and colors , representing regi - ments and divisions with which he would try new military evolutions and combinations , set - ting them up on the floor to gain a larger field for the mimic campaign .

		Sometimes his son , the little King of
Rome	LOCATION	, would surprise him occupied with these pieces and working out be - forehand one of those brilliant coups which so often turned the scale in favor of the French arms . ''

		The child , lying on the floor at his side , pleased with the color and the form of these manoeuvre pieces which reminded him of his toys would at each instant
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 touch them with his hand and disturb the order of bat - tle at a decisive moment just when the enemy was about to be beaten .

		But so great was
Napoleon	PERSON	's presence of mind , and his affection for his son , that he did not allow himself to be disturbed by the disorder into which the child had thrown his strategical combinations , and con - tented himself , without manifesting any impatience , with putting the pieces back into their right order .

		His pa - tience and kindness for his child were inexhaustible . ''

		In this connection
Meneval	ORGANIZATION	tells a touching story of the
Empress Josephine	ORGANIZATION	.

		She had begged as a favor to have the King of
Rome	LOCATION	taken to her , and
Napoleon	PERSON	yielded , despite the jealous opposition of
Marie Louise	PERSON	, who feared the ascendancy which a woman who had once been so loved by her husband might still retain over him .

		Describing the meeting , Men - eval says : '' The excellent Princess could not restrain her tears at the sight of a child who recalled such painful memories and the privation of a happiness which Heaven had refused to her .

		She embraced him with transports .

		She seemed to take pleasure in the illusion produced by the thought that she was lavishing her caresses on her own child .

		She never wearied of admiring his strength and beauty , and could not detach herself from him . ''

		For this wronged woman
Meneval	PERSON	has nothing but kindness , though he faintly approves , on political grounds , of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's resolution to put her aside .

		He was an eye-witness of the painful scene immediately following the cere - mony that , as he says , '' unloosened the bonds of a union which , had Josephine been fruitful , would have lasted as long as their lives '' : '' The Emperor re-entered his study , sad and silent , and let himself fall on the sofa where he usually sat , in complete depression .

		He remained there some mo - ments , his head leaning on his hand , and when he rose his face was distorted .

		Orders for the departure to Trianon had been given in advance .

		When it was an - nounced that the carriages were ready ,
Napoleon	PERSON	took his hat and said , ' Me `` neval , come with me ! '

		I followed him up the little winding staircase which communicated between his study and the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	's apartment .

		Jose - phine was alone , and seemed wrapped in the most pain - ful reflection .

		The noise we made in entering attracted her attention , and springing up she threw herself on the Emperor 's neck , sobbing and crying .

		He pressed her to his breast , kissing her over and over again , but in the excess of her emotion she had fainted .

		I ran to the bell and summoned help .

		The Emperor , wishing to avoid the sight of a grief which he was unable to as - suage , placed the Empress in my arms as soon as he saw she was coming back to consciousness , ordered me not to leave her , and withdrew rapidly by the drawing - rooms of the ground floor , at the door of which his car - riage was waiting .

		After the Emperor 's disappearance , women who entered laid her on a couch and did what was necessary for her recovery .

		In her confusion she took my hands and earnestly prayed me to tell the Em - peror not to forget her , and to assure him of an affec - tion which would survive any and every event .

		It seemed to be difficult for her to allow me to depart , as if my departure would break the last tie by which she was connected with
Napoleon	PERSON	. ''

		Josephine , says
Meneval	PERSON	, `` had an irresist - ible attraction . '' ''

		She was not a woman of regular beauty -LRB- she had that grace which is more beautiful than beauty 's self , as our good La
Fontaine	PERSON	used to say -RRB- ; she had the soft abandon , the supple and elegant movements , the graceful negligence , of Creole women .

		Her temper was always even .

		Good and kind , she was affable and in - dulgent to everybody without exception of persons .

		She was not a woman of superior intellect , but her exquisite politeness , her great familiarity with society and court life and their innocent artifices , always taught her at a moment 's notice what to say and do . ''

		Lacking the subtler charms of the wife she supplanted ,
Marie Louise	PERSON	had in full measure the attractions inseparable from youth and health .

		The author sketches her as she ap - peared to him on her arrival in
France	LOCATION	: ''
Marie Louise	PERSON	, then in the splendor of her youth , had a bust of perfect regularity .

		The bodice of her dress was longer than used to be worn at the time , which added to her natural dignity , and contrasted very well with the ugly , short bodices of our ladies .

		Her face was flushed with the journey and by her nervous - ness .

		Pale chestnut hair , silky and - abundant , framed a fresh full face , over which eyes , full of sweetness , spread a charming expression .

		Her lips , which were rather thick , recalled the type of the Austrian ruling family , just as a slight convexity of the nose is the char - acteristic of the
House of Bourbon	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Meneval 's post was no sinecure .

		The Em - peror 's prodigious activity grew with the ob - stacles put in his way , and taxed the strength of his secretary to the utmost .

		Night and day he was bound to the wheel of that restless , ever - scheming , and , in its final conceptions , vaguely - defined ambition .

		Says Meneval : '' It often happened that I would hand him some doc - ument to sign in the evening . '

		I will not sign it now , ' he would say , ' be here to-night at one o'clock , or at four in the
morning	TIME	; we will work together . '

		On these oc - casions I would have myself waked some minutes before the appointed hour .

		As , in coming down stairs , I used to pass in front of the door of his apartment , I used to enter to ask if he had been waked .

		The invariable answer was , ` He has just rung for Constant , ' and at the same moment he used to make his appearance , dressed in his white dressing-gown , with a
Madras	LOCATION	handkerchief round his head .

		When , by chance , he had got to the study before me , I used to find him walking up and down with his hands behind his back , or helping him - self from his snuff-box , less from taste than from pre - occupation , for he only used to smell at his pinches , and his handkerchiefs were never soiled with the snuff .

		His ideas developed as he dictated , with an abundance and a clearness which showed that his attention was firmly riveted to the subject with which he was dealing ; they sprang from his head as Minerva sprang , fully armed , from the head of
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	...
Napoleon	PERSON	used to explain the clearness of his mind , and his faculty of being able at will to prolong his work to extreme limits , by saying that the various subjects were arranged in 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, his head , as though in a cupboard .

		< When I want to interrupt one piece of work , ' he said , ' I close the drawer in which it is , and open another .

		The two pieces of business never get mixed up together , and never trouble or tire me .

		When I want to rest , I close up all the drawers , and then I am ready to go off to sleep . ' ''

		We should be sorry if the foregoing extracts , selected chiefly for their graphic quality and separableness from the context , should convey the impression that the book before us is a mosaic of chit-chat and haphazard portraiture .

		We recall no memoir of the Napoleonic period which is less open to the charge of '' scrappi - ness '' and triviality .

		Meneval was a serious , retiring , * even a melancholy man many de - grees removed from the mere court quidnunc .

		His bias in
Napoleon	LOCATION	's favor was pronounced ; but , allowing for this , his political and personal reflections are calm and penetrating , and they are the ripened fruit of his later years .

		We have alluded to his version of the d'Enghien tragedy one of the darkest stains on
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's career .

		The pith of the matter , as com - monly understood , and the defense offered by Meneval , can be briefly stated .

		In 1803-4 ,
Bonaparte	PERSON	, justly alarmed and enraged by the royalist plots against his life , resolved to deal his enemies a blow that should effectually check such enterprises for the future .

		The blow de - cided on was the execution of one of the royal - ist princes , and the victim selected was the Due d'Enghein , the last of the Condes , a known leader of the emigres , and a supposed sharer in the murderous attempt of Cadoudal and
Pichegru	ORGANIZATION	.

		That the arrest of d'Enghien , then living at
Ettenheim	LOCATION	, in
Baden	LOCATION	, would involve a flagrant breach of the law of nations , gave no pause to the imperious will of the
First Con	ORGANIZATION	- sul .

		On the night of
March 15 , 1804	DATE	, d'En - ghien was seized at Ettenheim by French gen - darmes , haled over the frontier to
Strasburg	PERSON	and thence to the castle of
Vincennes	LOCATION	, where he was tried by court martial , found guilty , sentenced , and put to death , all during the night of
March 20	DATE	, and the early morning of
March 21	DATE	.

		His request to see the First Con - sul might possibly have been granted by his judges ; but
Savary	PERSON	, a devoted tool of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon , who had been put in charge of the platoon detailed for the execution , roughly interposed in the debate , and led his prisoner away to the castle-moat , where he was shot , with a summary barbarity worthy of the days of the Terror .

		* In a note on
Fleury de Chaboulon	ORGANIZATION	's Memoirs ,
Napoleon	PERSON	says : '' Mineral and
Fain	PERSON	lived in such a retired way that there were chamberlains who , after four years ' service in the palace , had never seen them . ''

		Broadly viewed , the murder -LRB- or , to use the common euphemism , the execution -RRB- of d'En - ghien seems the only logical outcome of the affair from the beginning .

		The extraordinary preliminary step ; the trial before a tribunal certain as Meneval admits to convict ; the selection of
Savary	PERSON	and his obvious conviction of his duty ; the swiftness and secrecy of the entire proceedings all point to the fact that the unfortunate Prince was doomed from the first , and that
Napoleon	PERSON	was his judge .

		It is admitted that had d'Enghien been taken on French soil , or in battle , his sentence , while severe , would have been legal .

		Taken as he was on the soil of a country with which
France	LOCATION	was on the friendliest terms , it was murder .

		Meneval 's chief defense of his master is that , expecting a final request from his prisoner for an audience , he meant to exercise clemency .

		He knew that conviction was certain ; but he took measures not , as is generally held , to prevent but to assure the Prince 's request for an interview reaching him .

		These meas - ures , according to Meneval , were thwarted by the following singular -LRB- we are inclined to add , suspicious -RRB- incident , the facts of which , how - ever , whatever our interpretation of them may be , the relator 's character for veracity does not permit us to doubt .

		Pending d'Enghien 's trial ,
Napoleon	PERSON	ordered his
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, Maret , to write in his name to the
Councillor of State	ORGANIZATION	, Real , directing the latter '' to go to
Vincennes	LOCATION	, and to personally examine the Due d'Enghien , and then to come and report the result of this examination to him ,
Napoleon	PERSON	. ''

		The fateful letter reached Real 's house at ten o'clock on the evening of the trial : but Real , suffering from unusual fatigue , had gone to bed , after having peremptorily '' forbidden his valet to wake him before five in the
morning	TIME	, no matter what message might be sent to him '' The next morning M. Real received the letter , dressed with all speed , and hastened to
Vincennes	LOCATION	too late . ''

		On the way he met Col.
Savary	PERSON	, who informed him that the Due d'Enghien 's execution had taken place . ''

		Meneval , with other panegyrists of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon , failed to see or was loth to admit that his hero , like
Bacon	PERSON	and
Marlborough	LOCATION	, strongly ex - emplified the truth that great mental gifts by no means imply corresponding moral ones .


Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's character was strangely inconsistent , and even intellectually it presents contradictions .

		His marvellous genius for appreciating and shaping special facts and situations was coupled with the feeblest incoherence of general policy ;
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 and his dreams of the future , where we can di - vine them , were so vague , fantastic , and gran - diose as almost to warrant the doubt sometimes cast upon his sanity during his later years .

		What was
Napoleon	PERSON	's final goal the consum - mation he had in view and toward which he strove and planned ?

		Has anyone yet answered the question explicitly ?

		Could
Napoleon	PERSON	him - self have answered it ?

		The good
Meneval	ORGANIZATION	's response , touching the '' ameliorating the con - dition of humanity , '' and other benign
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic aims , seems , in the light of recorded deeds , scarcely satisfactory .

		Nor can we ad - mit that the crimes of a man who sacrificed to his own ends , with appalling indifference , the lives , liberties , and happiness of scores of thou - sands , are in the faintest degree redeemed by his half-dozen putative bourgeois virtues .

		It remains to add that the publishers of this important work have given it the setting it de - serves ; and we venture to say the edition will bear comparison with the concurring French and English ones .

		The good work of the trans - lator , Mr.
Robt	PERSON	.


H. Sherard	PERSON	, calls for a word of praise .

		E. G. J. PROBLEMS OF AMERICAN LAW REFORM .

		* Judge
Dillon	PERSON	's entertaining and suggestive book on '' The Laws and Jurisprudence of En - gland and
America	LOCATION	'' has many great excel - lences , though it is not without some striking defects of style .

		It is a revision of a series of lectures to the law students of Yale Uni - versity on '' Our Law in its old and in its new home
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It deals with the sources and development of our law , and with its qualities and tendencies as now admin - istered .

		Although the form of cursory oral lec - tures is preserved , yet Judge
Dillon	PERSON	evidently kept in his eye several other sorts of men , among whom , plainly , were the lawyers , the guild of professors and learned men , the court - room audience to whom he for many years talked as judge , and the greater audience of the plain people to whom he was wont to speak on the
Fourth of July	DATE	.

		The book is technical without being obscure , learned in a somewhat general way , concrete and practical ; and throughout it is inflated by a florid eloquence and an ampli - tude of quotation and literary allusion in which the author delights , and from which he can not always restrain himself .

		Judge
Dillon	PERSON	has evi - * THE LAWS AND JURISPRUDENCE OF ENGLAND AND
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		By
John F. Dillon	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	: Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		dently modelled his style after Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	; and his learning is of the stucco and decorative order , rather than of the solid and structural .

		In the early part of the work he seeks to in - terest his students by excursions into the an - tiquities of the law , the ancient degrees and ceremonies of the English lawyers , descriptions of
Westminster Hall	ORGANIZATION	and of the
Inns of Court	ORGANIZATION	, and the like .

		He then didactically explains the development of the judicial system of the
United States	LOCATION	, the adoption of our written con - stitutions , with their rationale , limitations , and guarantees .

		In the last five lectures he takes up his real theme , the development of our law by the au - thority of judicial precedent ; or , in other words , the rule that a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction , in a question of law directly involved in the case before it , is -LRB- until overruled by the same or a superior court -RRB- binding , not only in that case , but in all sub - sequent cases in which that question is involved .

		To this doctrine we owe the accumulation of some eight thousand volumes of the best law in the world .

		And Judge
Dillon	PERSON	concedes that if these eight thousand volumes -LRB- together with sundry other thousand volumes of statutes and text-books -RRB- were only all studied by our lawyers and legislators , they would scarcely need to take a step in the dark .

		But our author rec - ognizes that the legislatures have never done this to any great extent ; that even the judges are now beginning to lose something of the stu - dious habits which aimed to keep these books in mind ; and that as the courts and report-fac - tories go on turning out precedents at the rate of upwards of a hundred volumes a year , even the lawyers most patient of men are likely to be overwhelmed , and lose their studious habits ere long .

		Judge
Dillon	PERSON	therefore maintains that the time has come for a systematic restatement of the body of our statutory and case law .

		Judge
Dillon	PERSON	is by nature a progressive man and a reformer ; he is at the same time a lover of learning and a diplomat .

		Even forty years of experience in the legal profession , twenty of which have been passed at the bar and twenty upon the bench , have not sufficed to extinguish his native tendencies .

		They have , however , developed in him to an unusual degree the conviction that the reformation of the law is best to be accomplished by conserving the fruits of our legal development , and by securing , first of all , an adequate re-statement of the law as it exists to-day , omitting all that has been re - pealed or overruled , and all that has become 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, obsolete .

		He is therefore among the most prac - tical of law reformers .

		Many years ago
Tocque	ORGANIZATION	- ville pointed out that the effect of a lawyer 's experience is to render him conservative , and that in
America	LOCATION	the legal profession constitutes both the real aristocracy and the bulwark of the state .

		These ideas are strikingly illustrated in the conservative and patriotic tone of Judge
Dillon	PERSON	's addresses , and the moderate and care - ful limits within which he advocates legal re - forms .

		In his argument for a re-statement of the law , he avoids the breakers upon which most schemes of law reform have already gone down .

		He sums up his views in the following words : '' There inevitably comes a stage in the legal history of every people when its laws become ' so voluminous and vast ' that an authoritative and systematic re-com - pilation or re-statement of them is necessary , to the end that they may be accessible , and of -LRB- to use , in default of a better ,
Bentham	PERSON	's uncouth but expressive word -RRB- cognoscible bulk , if not to those who are governed by them , at least to those whose business it is to advise con - cerning them , and to those whose duty it is to administer and apply them . ''

		-LRB- P. 269 . -RRB-

		This , indeed , is the real lesson of Judge
Dil	PERSON	- lon 's book .

		At the same time he does not fall into the common error of the advocates of a code , that of recommending the remodelling of our law after the Roman or civil code .

		He in - sists that his purpose is '' To delineate the characteristics and to exhibit the ex - cellences of our legal system as it now exists , with a view to show that for the people subject to its rule it is , with all its faults , better than any Roman or any other alien system .

		It is an argument , intended to be so earnestly and strongly put as to amount to a protest , against the Conlinentalization of our law .

		I have a profound con - viction of the superiority of our system of law , at least for our people ; but I know that this estimate is not so fully and firmly held by the body of lawyers and law teachers as I think it ought to be .

		I have therefore thought it a fitting , if not needful , aim to inspire on the part of the profession a more thorough appreciation of it . ''

		What Judge
Dillon	PERSON	favors is the re-statement and gradual codification of our law , in a code which should be the natural outgrowth and ex - pression of our law as it is ; i. e. , it should be truly an American code , and not an imitation of any
Continental	ORGANIZATION	code .

		The special points of superiority of the com - mon law over the civil law , namely , the decis - ion and settlement of the law only upon ques - tions actually arising and duly argued and de - liberated , the jury system , the careful develop - ment of the law of evidence , the supreme value of the American system of written constitutions setting definite limits to the departments of
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and the independence of the ju - diciary in maintaining the limits set by the Con - stitution , are set forth in a way to re-con - vince both the practical man and the student of institutions .

		Students of the latter class are apt to find their most abundant materials and the most learned and scholarly treatment of them in the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	systems , and are apt to overlook the substantial and permanent ad - vances made at home .

		Judge
Dillon	PERSON	thinks , and shows , that this is simply another case of the far-away field which looks green , compared with the brown and rusty look of the field at our feet .

		Yet none the less does he perceive the defects in our laws , both of system and of administration .

		Indicating some of these de - fects , he says : '' Most of our appellate courts are crowded with causes , and the effect upon the judges is that they too often feel it to be an ever-pressing , paramount , all-absorbing duty to clear the docket .

		This mistakenly becomes the chief object to be attained , the primary instead of a quite subordinate consideration .

		In the accomplishment of this end , the judges are as impatient of delay as was the wedding-guest in the Rime of the
Ancient Mariner	ORGANIZATION	.

		Added to this , a majority of the appellate judges gen - erally reside elsewhere than at the capital or place where the courts are held , and the desire is constantly felt to bring a laborious session to an end as speedily as possible , in order that they may rejoin their families and do their work in the fatigue-dress of their libraries , rather than under the necessary restraints of the term .

		They begrudge the time necessary for full argument at the bar .

		They dislike to hear counsel at length .

		They pre - fer to receive briefs .

		As a result , two practices have grown up too generally throughout the country , which have , as I think , done more to impair the value of judicial judgments and opinions than perhaps all other causes combined .

		The first is that the submission of causes upon printed briefs is favored , and oral arguments at the bar are discouraged , and the time allowed therefore is usually inadequate .

		On this subject I hold very strong opinions ; but also hold that no opinion can be too strong .

		As a means of enabling the court to understand the exact case brought thither for its judgment , as a means of eliciting the very truth of the matter both of law and fact , there is no substitute for oral argument .

		None ! ''

		The other practice among some , I fear many , of our appellate courts which injuriously affects our case-law is the practice of assigning the record of causes submitted on printed arguments to one of the judges to look into and write an opinion , without a previous examination of the record and arguments by the judges in consultation .

		This course ought to be forbidden , peremptorily forbidden , by statute .

		What is the most difficult function of an ap - pellate court ?

		It is , as I think , after the record is fully opened and the argument understood , to determine pre - cisely upon what point or points the judgment of the case ought to rest .

		This most delicate and important of all judicial duties ought always to be performed by the judges in full conference before the record is deliv - ered to one of their number to write the opinion of the court ; which , when written , should be confined to the
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11T precise grounds thus pre-determined .

		In respect to oral arguments , the time allowed therefore , the willing - ness to hear counsel , and full conferences among the judges in the presence of each other prior to decision or assigning the record to a judge to write the opinion ,
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	is a model for every appellate tribunal in the country . ''

		A stronger argument for the consolidation of our
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	could not be desired .

		We wish that this book might be in the hands of all our judges , and especially in the hands and hearts of the present Commissioners for the Revision of the

		THE MENTAL GROWTH OF MANKIND .

		* Mr.
John S. Hittell	PERSON	has presented in four handsome and impressive volumes his '' His - tory of the
Mental Growth of Mankind	ORGANIZATION	in An - cient Times . ''

		The idea underlying this work is excellent .

		To successfully develop it would be the achievement of genius .

		To say that the author fails is not severe criticism , for most men would fail .

		The scope of the work is out - lined in a series of introductory questions oc - cupying several pages .

		These questions are suggestive , and the final ones are : '' Has the Celt any natural fitness for free government ?

		Is he superior to the
Teuton	LOCATION	in delicacy of sen - timent ?

		Are the nations of
Southern Europe	LOCATION	superior to those of the North in artistic genius ?

		Are those of the North superior in mental and physical energy ? ''

		Having propounded these and many other queries , our author says : '' To these questions , which have never been an - swered satisfactorily , I shall offer replies , which , however weak they may be in many points , will yet , I hope , contribute a little to the stock of historical truth . ''

		One naturally feels some surprise when he fails to find any of these final questions answered .

		The author coins words when he needs them .

		To this we have no objection , but we do wish he would not give new meanings to old words .

		He discusses the three culture stages ,
Savag	PERSON	- ism , Barbarism , Civilization ; but he uses the terms in his own way .

		The four volumes treat of Savagism ,
Heathen Barbarism	ORGANIZATION	,
Judea	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	and
Early Christianity	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume on Savagism is in - teresting , but does not Tylor cover the same ground as well , or better ?

		Some chapters are * A HISTORY OF THE MENTAL GROWTH OF MANKIND IN ANCIENT TIMES .

		weak .

		The discussion regarding the
Primi	PERSON	- tive Family is particularly unsatisfactory .

		Has Hittell really read Bachofen ?

		In his appen - dix we read : ''
Bachofen	PERSON	, who was the first to call attention to the subject , has but little to interest readers who are familiar with later writers , such as
Lubbock	LOCATION	and
Lippert	PERSON	. ''

		If our author has read Bachofen , he deserves notice for having performed a feat which few have done .

		But he certainly has not read Starcke .

		Nowhere has he made a citation from the great
Dane	PERSON	's work , certainly the most important of the many discussions in this subject .

		In this connection it is curious to read : '' Other works worthy of attention are
Lubbock	LOCATION	's ' Origin of Civilization , ' which gives a good summary of
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's ideas ,
Starcke	ORGANIZATION	's ' Primitive Family , * and
Lippert	PERSON	's '
Kulturgeschichte	PERSON	' and ' Ges - chichte der Familie . ' ''

		There is no apparent realization on our author 's part of the fact that
Starcke	PERSON	is the exponent of ideas somewhat un - like his own or of the authors cited .

		The Aztecs are discussed in Volume II. , upon `` Heathen Barbarism . ''

		Morgan 's `` An - cient Society '' is quoted , but his other writings are apparently unknown , and the romantic views of past and unscientific writers are usually pre - sented .

		Bandelier , unquestionably the most cautious and critical authority upon the Aztecs , is neither cited nor mentioned .

		The value of the discussion is at once evident .

		Were we to spend time in picking out here and there the small slips and careless argu - ments of the four volumes , we should justly be accused of trifling .

		The author intends to be judicial and fair , but is dogmatic both in thought and expression .

		His partiality for the Greeks is marked ; his dislike of the Romans is equally plain .

		The very word Christianity is a chal - lenge to him .

		Committed to evolution , filled with admiration for Kulturgeschichte , optim - istic in all human affairs ,
Hittell	PERSON	is delightedly conscious that the present is better than any past , that our race is better than all other races , that life is improving , and that the future is a time for still higher achievement .

		We have criticised : we might criticise still more ; but we admire the earnestness shown r the extensive reading displayed , and the sug - gestiveness of the work .

		To find out what con - tribution each culture stage and each great nation has made to the sum total of human progress , is surpassingly important .

		This work is an honest effort , fairly successful , to do this .

		As such we welcome it .

Sept. 1	DATE	, ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES NEWLY STATED .

		* Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's '' Principles of Political Economy , '' his preface tells us , has grown up out of the class-room use of Mill , and from the need of recasting Mill 's statements in the light of modern conditions and established modifications of the clas - sical theory .

		This fact has determined the order and general content , and , in a highly complimentary sense , the work is an annotated Mill .

		Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	, however , is by no means a mere editor .

		The point of view and the essential positions are those of
Adam Smith	PERSON	; and of the economy of
Adam Smith	PERSON	, Mill is justly taken as the classic expounder .

		But Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	is himself a trained and vigorous thinker , and his treatment is fresh and dis - passionate .

		Although frankly conservative , he has restated the English economy in full view of the criticisms of the '' younger generation of economists , '' to whom he is inclined to concede not a little .

		Com - pared with
Marshall	PERSON	, the book is avowedly reaction - ary ; but it is also less original and less vital .

		Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's excellent judgment is shown , to cite examples , in his brief exposition of methods -LRB- pp. 18-20 -RRB- , in his analysis of labor -LRB- pp.
75-86	DATE	, the treatment of moral activities excepted -RRB- , in his criticisms of Mill 's propositions regarding capital -LRB- pp. 98 sqq . -RRB-

		, and in his exposition of the law of population and criticism upon Mill 's deductions from
Malthus	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 164 , 169 , 175 sqq . -RRB-

		.

		His conserva - tism on minor points is exemplified by his attitude toward the attempt to establish small farms in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- 146 , 149 -RRB- , and by his condemnation of judicial rents as applied to
Ireland	LOCATION	-LRB- 316 , 317 -RRB- .

		Pro- fessor
Nicholson	PERSON	's exposition of
Value	ORGANIZATION	is reserved for the second volume ; but the discussion is antici - pated by a heated criticism of the notion that util - ity can be measured by price .

		For the Austrian nomenclature the author has bare tolerance , although he intimates that the `` extreme limits of popular phraseology and comprehension '' have long been .

		passed -LRB- 7 -RRB- .

		In the matter of definition , Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	reaffirms , with some asperity , the rigid boundaries of the classical school .

		He acknowledges , indeed , the influence of religion , art , morality , and other forces , upon the nature and causes of the wealth - of nations , concedes that wealth must be considered with reference to human wants , and admits that there can be no complete isolation of economic phe - nomena ; but '' The economist regards man as a being who pro- duces , distributes , exchanges , and consumes wealth , and * PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY .

		considers him as a member of society , one of the ob - jects of which is to deal with wealth '' -LRB- 13 -RRB- . ''

		The econ - omist fixes his attention on wealth , and only considers other social factors as far as they appreciably affect wealth ; as in every other science minor causes are neg - lected ... Political economy classifies and explains certain social facts , and discovers their laws and re - lations , just as the natural sciences deal with phenom - ena of a different order .

		Thus , starting with private property and freedom of competition as existing facts , we may discover certain laws of rent , profit , and wages ; but whether this distribution of the nation 's wealth is morally just or unjust , is relegated , together with the question wherein justice consists , to ethics '' -LRB- 14 -RRB- .

		Political economy may consider the influence and powers of governments , trades unions , and other groups and authorities , in altering this hypothetical distribution ; it may point out the objects govern - ments have had in mind in this regard and the dif - ficulties in the way of attainment ; it may consider possible reforms , etc. '' Discussions on Socialism and similar topics have a didactic value in that they make clear by way of contrast the meaning of pres - ent institutions and methods . ''

		So far as mere definition is concerned , there seems to be little difference among economists .

		Even the most wayward of the '' younger generation '' recognize the value of isolation and separation for purposes of analysis .

		But Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's cautions against passing from the economic to the ethical must be taken in view of his definition of sociology as an '' aspiration , '' and his evident sat - isfaction -LRB- ethically speaking -RRB- with the existing or - der of things .

		Obviously , if ethics are to be rig - orously excluded from economics , there can be no pertinence in the question , '' What scheme of dis - tribution is economically best ? ''

		Yet Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	would create a sort of economic ethic , and answer , as
Adam Smith	PERSON	did , That which en - forces the greatest possible production of wealth .

		And , in general , if the author will not discuss the ought , he contrives to let us know what he thinks of other people 's oughts .

		He may not say whether the '' greatest happiness '' theory is ethically correct or not , but if he were to doff the economic and put on the ethical ermine he would point out that `` max - imum freedom '' is at least as attractive as '' great - est happiness . '' ''

		For my own part I should not care to regard equal - ity of distribution , even if it could be shown to be both practical and also productive of maximum happiness , as the ultimate goal of human progress .

		Human ener - gies , activities , and ambitions are not to be satisfied with a dead level of placid content ... Even on the ver - bal question , I submit that the distribution which ad - mits of the greatest liberty may be more properly de - scribed as economic than that which aims at greatest utility '' -LRB- 233 -RRB- .

		But political economy is a positive science , and has to try to discover the real causes which have been and still are at work , as regards the distribution of wealth , and deduce the consequences . ''

		We have to explain the nature and effects of the .1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 institution of private property , and describe and account for various species of income .

		Rents , wages , and profits are as definite facts as any treated of in the physical sciences . ''

		Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's analysis of private property , and of freedom of competition and contract , is not especially profound or luminous , but it explains how , in his view , ethical , biological , and other con - siderations , are so foreign to economic discussion .

		The possibility of change in the methods of pro- duction , distribution , consumption , the possibility of doing away with poverty , for example , is what makes economics so fascinating to the '' younger generation . ''

		To Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	things are practically unalterable , or at least change so slowly and imperceptibly as not to interfere with the pos - itive nature of the science .

		He does not merely start with private property and free competition .

		The permanence of competition and private prop - erty , the persistence of the virtue of selfishness , the adequacy of existing methods of distribution these are the facts which make an appeal to ethics so fu - tile .

		Mill had held to a sharp distinction between the laws of Production and those of Distribution , the former partaking of the character of physical laws , the latter being a matter of human institution only , and subject to radical change even .

		This dis - tinction Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	vigorously combats .

		As to the progressive betterment of society through the gradual evolution of the altruistic motives , he announces his disagreement with Professor Mar - shall , and holds with
Stuart	PERSON	that '' were public spirit , instead of private utility , to become the
spring	DATE	of action in the individuals of a well-governed state , I apprehend it would spoil all '' -LRB- 86 -RRB- . ''

		For my own part , in the main , I follow the older writers in thinking that the great majority of people will do most good to the public by minding their own business '' -LRB- 85 -RRB- . ''

		Common-sense morality , altogether apart from the sanctions of positive law , suffices with the great mass of a nation to enforce the fulfilment of what are pro- nounced to be the ordinary obligations of social life ; but from the point of view of common sense , a man who does any work for a less price than his services will command is considered either an enthusiast , or a fool , and if he has others dependent upon him , the condemnation is more severe .

		The minister of religion and the min - ister of politics , the teacher , the physician , the lawyer , the author , and the artist , one and all if we take the average type need the spur of self-interest to surmount the or - dinary drudgery of their calling .

		Being ordinary men and not brutes , they are on various occasions moved by other impulses , just as a few of their extraordinary fel - lows are constantly so moved .

		When , however ,
Chris	PERSON	- - tianity itself , dispassionately regarded by the economist , finds its earthly support in earthly rewards and honors , how can it be expected or maintained that a substitute for self-interest can be found for the ordinary business of life ?

		The appeal to history is still more decisive , as showing that the main-spring of economic progress has been economic interest '' -LRB- 81 , 82 -RRB- .

		Even the abolition of slavery has been due , not to philanthropy and Christian -LRB- altruistic -RRB- principles , but to economic interest : '' It was the discovery , not that Christ had proclaimed the equality of men , but that freedom and rewards were more efficient than slavery and punishments in calling forth the energies of labor . ''

		So profit-sharing and other forms of cooperation are justified by the increased efficiency of labor .

		In the concluding chapter , on Economic Utopias , the aims of modern socialism are condemned , and its success heralded as the death-blow to individual liberty , self-reliance , independence , and enterprise .

		And this condemnation , in due measure , is visited upon all efforts which tend to break down the prin - ciple of competition or to substitute the altruistic for the economic motive .

		It is only fair , however , to note Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's conservatism : '' I do not mean to assert that governments and so - cieties have no industrial functions , nor did
Adam Smith	PERSON	nor any of the great economists who have lauded the benefits of freedom and exposed the weakness of gov - ernments .

		But it is desirable to emphasize most that which is most apt to be forgotten , and in these days no one is likely to forget that the state and trades-unions and cooperative societies have power for good '' -LRB- 432 -RRB- .

		Professor Commons 's treatise on '' The Distribu - tion of Wealth '' is not easy reading .

		It bristles with the new nomenclature , and its analysis is in - tricate and exhaustive , and not always helped out by the mathematical figures and formulae .

		Thus , the diagram on page 147 , where one side of a paral - lelogram represents one do.se of capital and labor , the opposite side the quantity of product produced by the marginal dose , and the base the total num - ber of doses , seems to strain geometry quite to the breaking point .

		These , however , are accidental features , partly due to the difficulty of the subject and partly to the unsettled condition of economic terminology .

		For the work itself is one of the best re - sults of the American renaissance in pure economics .

		It is thorough in investigation and modest but straight - forward in deduction .

		It nowhere departs from the rigid character of a scientific treatise , yet it has none of the painful exclusiveness with which Pro- fessor
Nicholson	PERSON	finds it necessary to hedge about the term economic .

		Professor Commons does not seem to be aware that ethical considerations are uneconomic .

		There is no appeal to sentiment , no squinting Utopia-ward , but a profounder analysis of the nature of social and legal rights , and a clearer interpretation of the tendencies of modern civiliza - tion .

		After a preliminary discussion of
Value	ORGANIZATION	, setting forth the Austrian theory , and a brief analysis of Cost and Price , the subjects taken up in detail are .

		The Factors in Distribution ,
Diminishing Returns	ORGANIZATION	and Rent , and
Diminishing Returns	ORGANIZATION	and
Distribu	PERSON	- tion .

		Land is defined as that which furnishes room and situation , the Ricardian conception of the '' orig - inal and indestructible powers of the soil '' being re - jected . ''

		Not land , but capital , embodies the forces , energies , and material of nature '' -LRB- 29 -RRB- . ''

		Soil is capital , and its 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, returns are governed by the same law as that which governs returns from machinery '' -LRB- 137 -RRB- .

		Personal abilities and business privileges are not to be classed as capital . ''

		Capital , strictly defined , apart from individual abil - ities , has become the dominating instrument in the pro- duction of wealth .

		... It is the ownership of capital rather than the possession of abilities that has impor - tant bearings on the social problems of wages , interest , and profits '' -LRB- 44 -RRB- .

		The law of diminishing returns is shown to be uni - versal , applying to manufactures not less than to agriculture .

		The law of rent is extended to in - clude the monopoly privileges of patents , copyrights , trade-marks , franchises , and good-will , but not cap - ital -LRB- 157 , 161 -RRB- .

		The familiar no-rent agricultural land of the '' older generation of economists '' dis - appears , and with
Adam Smith	PERSON	we again include rent in expenses of production -LRB- 221 -RRB- .

		President
Walker	PERSON	's theory of the laborer as the '' residual claimant '' is effectually disposed of , and monopoly privileges fall heir to the coveted position .

		One of the clearest pieces of analysis in the book is that of the law of wages , and of the relative influence of the standard of living and of the laborer 's con - trol over the supply of labor in determining wages -LRB- 174-181 -RRB- .

		The most interesting discussion , because most closely touching current social problems , is that which deals with Law and Rights .

		The discussion is based on the theory of the sovereignty of the government : `` the all-powerful factor in the distribution ef wealth is the sovereignty of the government '' a theory which Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	virtually denies .

		All rights considered by political economy of persons and of property are legal rights . ''

		Government creates , defines , and enforces these rights . '' ''

		The place of law in political economy is a subject which has received from English economists no atten - tion at all commensurate with its far-reaching impor - tance ... The English economists have taken the laws of private property for granted , assuming that they are fixed and immutable in the nature of things , and therefore needed no investigation .

		But such laws are changeable they differ for different peoples and places , and they have profound influence upon the pro- duction and distribution of wealth '' -LRB- 59 -RRB- . ''

		There are in society two lines of economic activity , the voluntary activity of individuals and associations , and the com - pulsory activity of governments .

		The first is the field of free competition and self interest ; the one hitherto solely treated by the English economists .

		The second is the field of coercion , of force '' -LRB- 61 -RRB- . ''

		Private self-interest is too powerful , or too ignorant , or too immoral to promote the common good without compulsion .

		The common wants of society justice , roads , military defence , etc can be supplied only by compulsory contributions from individuals , and compul - sory administration of government '' -LRB- 61 -RRB- .

		Personal rights are life , liberty , employment , and marriage .

		The right to life is primary and funda - mental , and this means not merely the right to protection against violence but to a share of the so - cial product equal to the minimum of subsistence . ''

		And this is what the
State	ORGANIZATION	has done in two ways , through slavery and poor relief ; the first for the slave and serf , the second for the freeman '' -LRB- 66 -RRB- .

		It is rather startling to have the right to employ - ment defined not merely as a legal right , but as one in effect already recognized by the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it is only a more intelligent and higher application of the right to live .

		Professor Commons insists upon the personal rights of freedom of movement and freedom of industry .

		And '' freedom of contract is the essential right of freedom in industry . ''

		But '' The skilled , the intelligent , the educated , the gifted , laborers , those in whom intellectual and moral qualities predominate , are benefited by the freedom of contract ; for the unskilled , the unorganized , the redundant labor - ers , those whose marginal utility is low , freedom of contract offers no help '' -LRB- 75 -RRB- .

		`` Though the slave was compelled to work , he never suffered from that terrible evil of the modern laborer , lack of work .

		With the coming of freedom , the laborer was divorced from his means of livelihood , and now that all available land has become private property , and all capital is private prop - erty , the propertyless man is a dependent when work is plenty , and a vagabond when work is slack '' -LRB- 79 -RRB- . ''

		The right to work , for every man that is willing , is the next great human right to be defined and enforced by law '' -LRB- 80 -RRB- . ''

		The right to employment is simply a new applica - tion , under modern conditions , of the old right to free - dom of industry .

		Free industry meant essentially the right to free access to nature for the production and ac - quisition of wealth ... But to-day freedom of indus - try is no boon except to the wealthy capitalist ... The great mass of the people must remain wage-and - salary-receivers .

		Consequently , the only way in which these people can get access to nature for production is through the recognition of the right to employment '' -LRB- 80 , 81 -RRB- .

		The first recognition of this right is that `` wages , hours of labor , conditions of work , are to be adju - dicated by the courts . ''

		But this solves only the easier half of the problem . ''

		The most difficult part for solution is that involuntary idleness which attacks both employer and employee , and closes fac - tories as a result of industrial crises and depres - sions . ''

		Professor Commons does not flinch from the legitimate conclusion the right of the unem - ployed to have work furnished by the government .

		A thousand hands will be held up in horror , but when the heavens have fallen it will be found that Professor Commons has advanced the whole ques - tion to a higher plane of discussion than it has hith - erto occupied .

		He has no cheap and ready expe - dients for working out so difficult a problem ; but he has forecast , as Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	has so brilliantly done , the line of social and economic evolution for the coming century .

		Mr.
Grover Pease Osborne	PERSON	's book , '' Principles of Economics , '' is strictly unacademic .

		The author is widely read , he is an intelligent and acute ob - server , and his maxims and deductions are mainly sound and wholesome .

		Yet he professes to be ad - dressing an audience nine out of ten of whom re -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 gard political economy as the '' science of free-trade or protection '' !

		Such an audience could not be supposed to be familiar with modern economic rea - soning , nor capable of much sustained economic anal - ysis , and the author has strictly humored his audi - ence .

		He has departed somewhat from the ordin - ary terms of political economy , which enables him , among other things , to escape from the rigid limit - ations of accurate definition .

		The difficult question of
Value	ORGANIZATION	is reduced to simplicity by making a new term of utility , which is straightway confused with value-in-use . ''

		Capital '' is the most misleading term in political economy , and so we have a discus - sion of the '' Economical Use of Produced Wealth . ''

		The necessity of the constant employment of labor is enforced , but labor-unions and strikes are classed together as causes of idleness , and cooperation is mildly recommended .

		If we can regard Mr.
Os	PERSON	- borne 's book , not as an independent exposition of economic principles , but as a commentary on some standard treatise , we shall do most justice to the wealth of fresh illustration and the suggestiveness of many of the positions advanced .

		from humanistic culture , and adds to the universal appeal of romantic charm a special appeal to those who can appreciate the subtle qualities that elevate mere fiction into literature .

		Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	, at his best , illustrates this happy combination of attributes ; as does also Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, in a certain degree .

		Even the slight discursive element in Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	's book adds to its attractiveness , for it derives from the best literary tradition .

		We do not seriously object to the irrelevant pages of Fielding or the rambling method of
Thackeray	PERSON	, because we feel ourselves in the presence of a master , and the rich - ness of the mind excuses the waywardness of its out - pourings .

		It is something of this feeling that makes us unwilling to miss the least significant of Mr.
Dunn	PERSON	's pages , for , if they do not always contribute to advance the story , they always provide something good in itself .

		It must not be imagined from the above that our author 's digressions are very numer - ous , very long , or very far-fetched .

		They clearly do not produce the effect of padding , and that is enough to justify them .

		We quote one of them as a good specimen of the author 's easy style . ''

		In the present refined and philanthropic age pugil - istic encounters are justly reprobated , and a minute de - scription of one would not be tolerated except in the pure pages of a Transatlantic newspaper .

		And , as a former Mayor of

		Nowadays , personal hostilities being out of vogue a cheering indication of social progress people blacken each others ' characters instead of each others ' eyes , an easy process , involving no bleeding except that of the pockets ; and we may hopefully look forward to the time when parliamentary language , in the present revised signification of the term , will de - mand neither pistolary nor epistolary amends .

		The as - certained fact that hard names break no bones is one of the most brilliant discoveries of this enlightened age . ''

		The following pretty conceit is one of the many pas - sages that remind us of Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's manner : '' Bell then accompanied Sibylla to her carriage , and the two young ladies exchanged kisses a part of fem - inine ritual rarely omitted , however tepid may be the affection lodged within feminine bosoms .

		For a kiss is a species of counterpart , ranging over the diapason of feeling , from the insipidity of the octave and the coun - terfeit harmony of the fourth to the melting sweetness of the third , which only the mating of male and female lips may compass . ''

		The scene of '' Red Cap and Blue Jacket '' is first laid -LRB- for a brief prologue only -RRB- in one of the
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	, and the time is late in the eighteenth century .

		The scene then shifts to a village in
Scot	LOCATION	- land , whence sundry of the characters are trans - ported to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		They reach the French capital in the midst of the Terror , and the Revolutionary episodes that follow make the most exciting part of the book .

		The character of
Andrew Prosser	PERSON	, the Scotch pedagogue , who finds that revolution in practice is very different from what it has appeared 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, in theory , and who discovers that even the tyranny of the Hanoverians may have its good points , is one of the best things that have been done in fiction for many a day .

		The faults of the book are slight a touch of the melodramatic here and there , and a reticence in the prologue that seems to have been designed for the express purpose of perplexing the reader -LRB- which is always bad art -RRB- , and which mis - leads him completely until he is well along in the story .

		Mr.
Forster	PERSON	's `` Major Joshua '' is essentially a study of two types of character that of the su - premely selfish man for whom the book is named , and that of the woman who has never been taught the meaning of love , and whose awakening to its power may be likened to the freeing of a spring freshet in some mountain valley .

		Both types are considerably exaggerated , and no abnormal condi - tions of training or environment would make them quite probable ; but the author has made them seem as real as possible , and has carried out his design consistently and forcibly .

		Aside from these two studies , the interest of the story is slight ; but a far duller book would be redeemed by two or three such episodes as that , for example , in which the Major finds consolation for his rejection in an un - usually good dinner , and in which the satisfied gour - met comes to think unregretfully of the disappoint - ment of the suitor .

		Mrs.
Peard	PERSON	is too experienced a writer of novels to produce a poor story , and one may take up '' The Interloper '' confident of entertainment and a mod - erate degree of excitement .

		Besides these qualities , he will find much nice discrimination of character , and a pleasant equable manner of narration .

		The story is French , and a criminal trial furnishes it with a climax .

		The closing chapters , however , are the least satisfactory , and the real charm of the book is to be sought in its picture of the intimate life of a Tourangian chateau .

		Heredity is the main theme of '' A Valiant Ig - norance , '' the latest work of the talented grand - daughter of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		Although this hobby has been ridden nearly to death of late , particularly by the women , it can not be denied that the conse - quences of an inherited predisposition to criminal - ity are powerfully presented in the book before us .

		Incidentally , we may remark that the grotesquely inaccurate attribution of '' nastiness '' to the writings of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	does not come with the best of grace from a writer whose strength is , after all , but a re - flection from that master of dramatic analysis .

		Aside from its treatment of the central idea , which is so relentlessly worked out as to be rather impressive , the book is neither interesting nor exactly whole - some .

		Most of the characters are fairly repulsive , and those that are not , with a single exception , must be described as unsympathetic .

		The writer has tipped her pen with wormwood , and her work is not a fair transcript of life , not even of the artificial and empty life of
London	LOCATION	society .

		It is pieced out to conventional dimensions by the trivial episodes and the drawing-room chatter to which too many of our novelists have recourse .

		We all remember the thrill of gratitude with which Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	's first stories of
India	LOCATION	were received , and the eagerness with which we awaited further transcripts of that mysterious life which he alone seemed to have the power to inter - pret in terms at once intelligible to the heart and the intellect .

		For it was not merely a sensation that they supplied ; it was rather the revelation of a hitherto dumb civilization .

		No one before him had made us so vividly to realize the almost unfath - omable gulf between oriental and occidental modes of thought , or the fact that life in the far East is in some respects more complex than that which is our own inheritance .

		The facts have been so hope - lessly distorted by missionaries and other biased or superficial observers that the Hindoo , in our popu - lar consciousness , is roughly lumped with idolatrous barbarians in general , with bushmen and South Sea islanders .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	did not a little to adjust our ethnological perspective , and richly deserved our thanks for the instruction .

		We are inclined to think that the instruction is bettered by the work of a newer writer , the woman who gave us first '' Miss Stuart 's Legacy , '' then a volume of tales `` From the Five Rivers , '' and who now gives us a stronger book than either of those .

		Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	has an eye for the picturesqueness of Indian life and a sense of its psychological differentiations .

		She knows also the Anglo-Indian and his ways , and never for - gets that in spite of his imperious grasp and firm guidance he remains a purely extraneous element in the civilization of British
India	LOCATION	. ''

		The
Potter	PERSON	's Thumb '' is a very remarkable book .

		The narra - tive is not as lucid or as symmetrically put together as it ought to be -LRB- although in this respect it offers a marked improvement upon '' Miss Stuart 's Leg - acy '' -RRB- , but it displays an insight unsurpassed by the best of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's work , and a rich careful color - ing that makes that writer 's brilliant impressionism seem relatively ineffective .

		Artistically , the best feature of the work is to be found in its use of the symbolism suggested by the title .

		It is one of the oldest figures in literature this similitude between the shaping of the potter 's clay and the making of man from the dust of the earth and one of the most beautiful .

		We are constantly reminded , in reading the story , of such well-remembered lines as the Tentmaker 's '' What I did the Hand then of the Potter shake ? ''

		or of
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Of the same lump -LRB- as it is said -RRB- For honour and dishonour made , Two sister vessels , '' and haunted by other suggestions of the sort , more vaguely evoked .

		Yet this symbolism is not ob - truded , or made too much of in any literal way .

		In writing '' The Ebb-Tide , '' Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, with the collaboration of Mr.
Osbourne	PERSON	, has once more 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 proved the possibility of getting along without the feminine element , of making a story so interesting that the reader forgets , until he rubs his eyes in amazement after perusal , that love has not appeared or even been suggested as a motive .

		Instead of a '' hankering after some person of the opposite sex , '' to borrow a phrase of which Mr.
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	once made unhappy use , `` The Ebb-Tide '' gives us hankerings after gold and revenge .

		It is a South Sea story , like `` The Wrecker , '' and its characters are a precious trio of disreputables , driven , as a last resort , to piracy and the attempted murder of the fourth character , an eccentric fanatic who fishes for pearls upon an isolated atoll .

		This fourth char - acter does not seem to us well realized , but the three others are admirably delineated with their respect - ive and skilfully differentiated weaknesses and in - iquities .

		One does not often find in the pages of a book men as thoroughly alive as the vicious and vulgar cockney , the passionate and besotted sea - captain , and the decayed gentleman whose better impulses usually turn out to be nothing more than velleities all three united in the vagrant estate of the beach-comber , for the purposes of this ingenious and highly entertaining fiction .

		Miss
Elfrida Bell	ORGANIZATION	is a young woman with aspi - rations , born to the uncongenial conditions that ob - tain in rural
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		She breaks her birth 's invi - dious bar , and goes to
Paris	LOCATION	, where she becomes an art student in a famous atelier , and acquires eman - cipated views and a lofty scorn of plodding
Philis	LOCATION	- tine humanity .

		Art does not smile upon her , and so she turns to literature , removing her abode to
London	LOCATION	.

		She develops an enormous capacity for pose , gleefully rejects a number of devoted admirers , alienates her best friends , and finally , in a fit of pique , puts an end to her useless existence .

		The delineator of her career , Mrs.
Everard Cotes	PERSON	, calls her `` A Daughter of To-day , '' an ascription not to be admitted as truthful in any general or typical sense .

		Such characters are doubtless to be found among the by-products of so unsettled and feverish a civilization as just now happens to be ours , but they are in no sense characteristic of its deeper aims and energies .

		The author does violence , too , in more than one instance , to the probabilities of even such a study of morbid development .

		But she has told the story with a certain crisp animation , re - lieved by humorous touches ; and these qualities make it interesting in episodes , if not attractive as a whole .

		Miss Murfree is a novelist wise enough to limit production in the interests of patient and careful workmanship ; and she has her reward .

		While there is nothing new in '' His Vanished Star , '' there is complete mastery of the old material , and a suffi - cient differentiation of incident to nullify any pos - sible charge of mere self-repetition .

		Here , as in earlier books , she succeeds in so charging with poetic energy the description of natural phenomena as to maintain the high position won by her ten or twelve years ago .

		Nothing better of the sort is to be found in contemporary American literature .

		Nor does her sympathy with the rough
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountaineers whom she knows so well fail in any respect ; the picturesqueness of their primitive society and the rude pathos of their sequestered lives appeal to us as powerfully as they did when '' In the
Tennessee Mountains	LOCATION	'' was published .

		The almost impass - able gulf between such people and those produced by our bookish and sophisticated civilization is made startlingly clear , and at the same time a sort of sympathetic bridge is provided by means of which we may after a fashion mingle in feeling and thought with these untaught dwellers in the mountain fast - nesses .

		We have noticed a few false notes in the style of this novel such , for example , as the fre - quent use of the word '' stellular '' where '' stellar '' would have done as well , or better ; or the conceit embodied in the description of dynamite as a '' co - gent compound , '' and the propriety of the inci - dent that gives the book its name may be questioned , since no new star or nova brilliant enough to attract general attention has been recorded for many years ; but these are trifling matters to set against the posi - tive achievement of the book in characterization , con - struction , and literary form . ''


Claudia Hyde	PERSON	'' is a love story of the sweet , wholesome , old-fashioned type , refreshing as an ozone-laden sea-breeze that purifies the air from malarious exhalations .

		Such a book , welcome at any time , is doubly so in an age when the art of fic - tion has fallen so largely into the hands of sensa - tionalists , when morbid tales of the '' Dodo '' and `` Yellow Aster '' and '' Heavenly Twins '' sort `` have the cry , '' and when popular success seems to await the most slovenly compositions , provided only they overstep the modesty of nature , scoff at the conven - tionalities , and ignore the fine reticence which is the last and best achievement of literary art . ''

		Clau - dia Hyde '' tells of the wooing of a Virginian gentle - woman by an English gentleman , makes of the tale a sweetness long drawn out , sustains the interest by many a subtle touch , and leaves the reader with a sense that somehow love has been once more set upon ; her rightful pedestal , after having been temporarily cast down by lewd fellows of the baser sort .

		The book has no ambitious aim , it struggles with no problem , it has no moral except the everlasting one of the purifying and exalting influence of a noble passion ; it is simply a piece of satisfactory work - manship , embodying a lofty ideal of character , ap - pealing to , and calculated to strengthen , the deeper and better parts of our nature .

		A group of translations from the Russian claims some attention , and will be made the subject of our closing remarks .

		It is with peculiar satisfaction that we greet the promise of a new translation of Tourgue ` nieff , undertaken by Mrs.
Constance Gar	PERSON	- nett .

		It is to be made directly from the Russian , and will include the six longer novels , with intro - ductions by '' Stepniak . '' ''

		Rudin , '' which has just 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, appeared , reads well in the new version , and the author of the Introduction calls it '' as near an ap - proach to the elegance and poetry of the original as I have ever come across . ''

		We have compared it with the anonymous English translation that ap - peared in '' Every
Saturday	DATE	'' more than twenty years ago , and the comparison is to the advantage of the newer version .

		Still , there are phrases in the earlier that do not appear in the later transla - tion , which is a suspicious circumstance .

		The eth - ics of translation demand scrupulous accuracy in nearly all cases , and certainly in the case of the su - preme masterpieces of literary art .

		It is an offence beyond forgiveness to omit a phrase or even a word of Tourgue ` nieff without some note explanatory of the circumstances .

		The Introduction does not over - state the case of Tourgue ` nieff in saying that '' as an artist , as master of the combination of details into a harmonious whole , as an architect of imaginative work , he surpasses all the prose writers of his coun - try , and has but few equals among the great novel - ists of other lands . ''

		We are sorry to find the ab - surd spelling '' Turgenev '' given new currency by this edition .

		It is also unsatisfactory to learn that only translations of the longer novels are contem - plated .

		What we need in English , even more than those , is an absolutely complete translation of the shorter tales and sketches .

		At present , those who want to read '' Assja , '' '' Spring Floods , '' '' Punin and
Baburin	PERSON	, '' '' First Love , '' '' The Song of Tri - umphant Love , '' '' A
Lear	PERSON	of the Steppe , '' and all the others , must pick them up here and there .

		Even ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' that marvellous example of psychological insight , that piece of art absolutely without flaw , is only to be found in English in the magazines a poor translation appearing in '' The Galaxy '' many years ago , a better one in '' The Fortnightly Re - view , '' for last
July	DATE	.

		The work whose performance , in the case of Tourgue ` nieff , seems so desirable , has just been done for Poushkin by Mr.
T. Keane	PERSON	, whose translation of the '' Prose tales '' of that writer fills a stout and handsomely-printed volume .

		The longest and most important of these tales , '' The Captain 's Daughter , '' has often been translated ; the others are less fa - miliar .

		Of these others there are eight , some of them mere sketches , but one , '' Doubrovsky , '' almost equal in length and interest to `` The Captain 's Daughter . ''

		One can not help contrasting the purely romantic art of Poushkin with the finished realism of Tourgue ` nieff , and it is not easy to realize that the two men were hardly more than one generation apart .

		Dostoieffski is in some respects closely akin to Tourgue ` nieff , a relation made particularly apparent by '' Poor Folk , '' which Miss
Lena Milman	PERSON	has now for the first time put into English .

		In this delicate piece of work , with its simple story and its poignant pathos , we hardly recognize the Dostoieffski of '' Crime and Punishment . ''

		It was the author 's first tale , written at the age of twenty-three .

		When the critic
Bielinski	PERSON	had read the manuscript of this story , he is reported to have exclaimed to the trem - bling author : '' Do you comprehend , young man , all the truth that you have described ?

		No !

		at your age , that is quite impossible .

		This is a revelation of art , an inspiration , a gift from on high . ''

		The enthusiasm was fairly justified by the work .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	, who writes an introduction for the present translation , makes this interesting comment : '' ' Poor Folk ' challenges comparison with Tour - -LRB- gue ` nieff .

		I mean that we ask ourselves if it is as perfect as Tourgue ` nieff ; that it is not goes without saying .

		For is not Tourgue ` nieff the greatest artist that has existed since antiquity ?

		The form is not so pure , the divination is not so subtle , the touch is heavier .

		When we turn to
Balzac	LOCATION	we see that it has not the eagle flight of his genius .

		The subject is not grasped and torn with such fierce talons .

		Bal - zac is to Tourgue ` nieff what
Michel Angelo	PERSON	is to a great Greek sculptor , more complete and less per - fect .

		Dostoieffski , in this story , may be not in - aptly compared to one of the Florentine sculptors ,
Delia Robbia	PERSON	, for instance .

		A certain coarseness of texture alone seems to me to separate it from work of the very highest class . ''

		The
Vicomte de Vogue 1	ORGANIZATION	says of '' Poor Folk '' : '' Into this tender pro- duction
Dostoieffski	PERSON	has poured his own nature , all his sensibility , his longing for sympathy and devo - tion , his bitter conception of life , his savage , piti - able pride . ''

		We do not need to further commend a work that has elicited , from critics so widely sep - arated in time and place , such substantially unani - mous tributes of praise .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		After having brought to a successful Howells and James market the more kindly flowers of as Comedy writers ... J his proper imagining , the man-or-let - ters of to-day is very apt to turn some little atten - tion to the cultivation of blue roses .

		They grew well in
England	LOCATION	once , these wonders , though 't was a good while ago .

		In the
fifty years from Lilly	DATE	to
Shirley	PERSON	the Drama seemed a most natural product .

		But nowadays the case is very different : everyone tries his hand , although , unfortunately , no one suc - ceeds any too well .

		Tennyson ,
Browning	PERSON	, Swin - burne ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and who not , have produced inter - esting specimens ; but while each new plant has gen - erally a certain charm , none of them are very hardy .

		There are not a few varieties , the modern classic , the strictly closet drama , the historical play , the society comedy .

		Some are pretty for a season ; some can be pressed , and so keep a pale beauty for a longer time ; but none show signs of any great vitality .

		Among other workers in these flowery fields are Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		As for the former , without attempting any very great things , he has certainly made a delightful success in a little

		THE DIAL 125 species peculiarly his own .

		His farces , which have been appearing in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' during the last ten years , are now coming out in the
Harper	PERSON	's '' Black and White Series . '' ''

		Five O'Clock Tea '' and '' The Mousetrap '' are hardly the best of these fantasies , but still they are characteristically good , and it will doubtless be a pleasure to many to see them .

		Whatever else may be said , it will be allowed that the action is usually amusing and ingenious , that the characters are remarkably consistent and natural , and that the farces read as well as they act and vice versa .

		Somewhat more ambitious than these charming miniatures is the recent departure of Mr.
James	PERSON	. ''

		Theatricals '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- contains two of four comedies which , as we learn from a note , were written for representation under peculiar cir - cumstances which never came to fulfilment .

		Not unnaturally , then , the reader starts at a great dis - advantage ; and to begin anything by Mr.
James	PERSON	with a handicap gives one but a sorry chance .

		One must be content , however , as the author cheerfully remarks , to get such comfort as one can , namely , in this case , a good deal of amusement from the dialogue , joined with a wonder if , supposing the comedies had been presented , one could have fol - lowed the action and got any idea of the characters .

		It is not hard to give a notion of these plays of Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		Imagine any of his stories with everything but the conversation cut out , and you will have something not unlike .

		To read them is rather more like an exacting game than one relishes at this time of the year ; indeed , it may almost be won - dered if the game will be worth the candle at any season .

		The dialogue has the usual ultra-delicate flavor , the action -LRB- where one discovers it from the enigmatic utterances -RRB- is usually preposterous , and as to the characters , so far as one ventures to infer , they are extraordinarily conventional and colorless .

		In a word , the plays have an interest , of course ; but Mr.
James	PERSON	's other work has so much more that one can hardly fancy that they will ever be great favorites . ''

		An Unhistorical Pastoral ; A Ro - mantic Farce ' Bruce > A Chronicle Play ;
Smith	ORGANIZATION	, A Tragic Farce ; and Scaramouch in
Naxos	LOCATION	, '' this on the title-page , with a frontispiece by
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	, is but an om - inous welcome to the reader of Mr.
John David	PERSON	- son 's '' Plays '' -LRB-
Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		And yet when one turns beyond it is not as bad as one might fear .

		Our author , it is true , would seem to be one of the modern band of younger poets , and his work has many marks of end o ' the century affectation .

		But still , here and there , and in some of the plays not infrequently , come snatches of very lovely verse notes of that same fresh and pure quality that , it often seems , was last heard in
England	LOCATION	in the plays and poems of the Elizabethans .

		That strange de - licious atmosphere that one knows so well , one feels again at times in Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's plays ; and it is a pleasure to find the strain in work that is done to - day .

		It is a curious minglement , the preciosities of our own time and the natural birdlike utterance of three hundred years ago .

		One is tempted to ask which is the natural
Davidson	PERSON	a decadent who has caught the trick of Elizabethan utterance , or an Elizabethan who has come too late .

		Whichever he be , he has written some exquisite poetry , which may to great advantage be looked to , although in some cases the poetry is in hiding , like a bunch of violets growing behind a lumber-pile .

		For , unfortunately , this happy figured speech of our older poets degen - erates with fearful ease into the most tedious and prolix verbiage ; and Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	has not always been able to distinguish in his own work between one and the other .

		It must be confessed that there are many arid tracts in his kingdom .

		And another point worth mentioning is that , as one reader might say , our author has a strange sense of humor ; or , as another might say , no sense of humor at all .

		In a writer of farces -LRB- among other things -RRB- this is hardly to the advantage of the reader .

		Some of Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's humors are not merely stupid , they are simply marvellous , and remind us again , but by no means so pleasantly , of the Elizabethans , of interpolated comic scenes .

		One must certainly pick and choose with Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	: if one pick rightly , one has an excellent reward ; if wrongly , one is much bored . ''

		An Unhistorical Pastoral '' and ''
Scara	PERSON	- mouch in Naxos '' contain most frequently passages of fine quality , and the reader will do well to take them first .

		The volume is one of those nice speci - mens of book-making produced by
Elkin Matthews	PERSON	and
John Lane	PERSON	of

		The Jewi h discussion of the Question '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is very much in Jewish Question , earnest , his pages are commendably free from the acrimony usually imported into the discussion .

		The tone of the book throughout is so - ber and liberal , and the author takes up the cudgels for the
Chosen People	ORGANIZATION	with a breadth of view and a candor as to the flaws in his own case worthy the imitation of those who disagree with him .

		Oddly enough , he opens with a denial that there is a Jew - ish Question at all that is , a definite one capable of exact statement .

		Now it seems to us that there is and has been from time immemorial a Jewish Question , and that the Jew himself , with his extra - ordinary fealty to the spirit of archaic tribal law and tradition , is primarily responsible for it .

		The observation of
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, who speaks of the Jews as hostile to all races but their own -LRB- adversus omnes olios hostile odium -RRB- , measurably holds good to-day ; as does that of
Spinoza	LOCATION	, who says that the racial solidarity of the Jews , despite their disorganized or dispersed condition , '' is not to be wondered at when we consider how they separate themselves from all other nationalities in a way to bring upon them - selves the hatred of all . ''

		Racial exclusiveness , an arrogated racial superiority , lies at the root of the 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Jewish Question and keeps it alive .

		So long as the Jew , broadly speaking , maintains in his daily deal - ings one code for the
Gentile	PERSON	and another for his brethren ; so long as he refuses to blend socially with the people about him , making it a point of duty to remain essentially a stranger within the gates that shelter him , so long will there be a Jewish Question .

		It is easily shown that the Question loses definiteness precisely in proportion as the Jew , shak - ing off the superstition of his fathers , fuses with the people around him and becomes something more than a quasi-citizen with a quasi-patriotism .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	there is no Jewish Question or there is at most only an inchoate one .

		To impute anti- Semitism to
Gentile	LOCATION	jealousy is sheer nonsense : It is not the finer superiorities of the Jew that rouse the ire of the
Gentile	PERSON	, nor is it the Spinozas , the
Mendels	PERSON	- sohns , the
Heines	LOCATION	, or even the Rothschilds , that are responsible for the existence of the Jew-baiter .

		The true glory of
Israel	LOCATION	, the inspired thoughts and winged words of her poets and sages , is a part of the com - mon glory of humanity ; and humanity does not grudge the splendor of the flame that makes its own light the brighter .

		In the volume before us the writer discusses severally the '' Mission of the Jews , '' their status during and influence upon the Middle Ages , '' Hebraic Societies , '' '' Money and the Jews , '' and he closes with a review of
M. Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	's notable work , ''
Israel	LOCATION	chez les Nations . ''

		The book shows learning and acumen , and should not be neglected .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	seems to have a penchant for strange titles .

		In a re - cent issue of THE DIAL was reviewed his '' Ban and Arriere Ban , '' a sheaf of fugitive rhymes ; and now comes a volume of prose quaintly entitled '' Cock Lane and Common Sense '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		The book is not , what the reader may guess it to be , a belated version of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's ghost - hunt though some space is given to that venerable tale .

		It is largely a compilation of the -LRB- to some minds -RRB- fascinating order of narratives known as `` ghost stories '' though to secure a place in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's anthology the story must be , not a piece of acknowledged fiction , but an attested `` occurrence , '' and a matter of actual belief on the part of the wit - nesses .

		Besides the stories proper , spirit rappings , hypnotic phenomena , magic , demoniac affections , sec - ond sight , and other pleasantly '' creepy '' matters , are discussed , with learning and acumen , and , we need scarcely add , with some humor .

		Humor , how - ever , this time by no means supplies the dominant note .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is , or seems to be , thoroughly in earnest the scientific , slightly skeptical , curious investigator .

		Struck by the constant , wide-spread , and well-attested recurrence of the abnormal phe - nomena in question , and believing that the explana - tions hitherto offered are often absurd , seldom plaus - ible , and never scientifically conclusive , he urges that here is a subject worthy not of the cheap ridi - cule often bestowed on it but of serious and impar - tial investigation .

		While `` Common Sense '' figures in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's title , he freely disclaims in his pre - face any bias in favor of that boastful and overrated quality . ''

		Common sense , '' he sharply observes , '' bullied several generations till they were positively afraid to attest their own unusual experiences . ''

		He might have added that common sense , having discredited itself often enough by deriding
Coper	PERSON	- nicus , spurning
Columbus	LOCATION	, scouting
Watt	PERSON	,
Steven	PERSON	- son , and
Fulton	LOCATION	, refuting
Berkeley	LOCATION	by grinning and kicking posts , etc. , ought now to be convinced of its fallibility in matters out of its range ; in short , that it ought by this time to have gained common sense enough to confine itself to common speculations .

		As to the objectivity -LRB- to risk a contradiction in terms -RRB- of the phenomena he cites , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	re - mains a sturdy skeptic up to his closing pages , where he faintly admits that while `` the undesigned co - incidences of testimony represent a great deal of smoke , '' `` proverbial wisdom suggests a presump - tion in favor of a few sparks of fire . ''

		We suspect that the '' fire '' will always , on investigation , turn out to be of a subjective and hallucinatory nature , and that the spectral noumena will continue , as heretofore , to elude the clutches of the keenest spook-hunter .

		It was a time of spiritual ferment , and the dissent - ers and the Anythingarians of all shades and de - grees of nonconformity who flocked to the fold of the liberal American shepherd soon had to build for him the
Parliament Court Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, in Artillery Lane ; and there the South Place Society was organized ,
February 14 , 1793	DATE	.

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	gives a rather full account of Winchester and of his more impor - tant successors notably
William Johnson Fox	PERSON	, a
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 really eminent man .

		Fox was a member of Par - liament , a fearless though a distinguishing radical , a noted Anti-Corn-Law leader , the founder , with Mill and Dr.
Brabant	PERSON	, of `` The Westminster Re - view , '' and the close friend of the chief English literati of the day . ''

		He gave , '' says the author , '' the first welcome to the Martineaus ; and he first recognized the genius of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and over
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Browning	PERSON	's youthful work cried Eureka ! ''


Carlyle	PERSON	said of him that '' his eloquence was like opening a window through
London	LOCATION	fog into the blue sky '' adding , however , '' I went away feeling that Fox had been summoning these people to sit in judgment on matters of which they were no judges at all . ''

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	was himself for twenty-one years the incumbent at
South Place Chapel	LOCATION	; and his account of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	, based on four discourses given by him in
1893	DATE	, may be taken to be as accu - rate as it is lively and sympathetic .

		There are a number of portraits , together with an interesting copy in facsimile of the first draft of
Sarah Flower Adams	PERSON	's fine hymn , '' Nearer , my God , to Thee . ''

		Dumas ^ s
Napoleon Romances	ORGANIZATION	.

		Under the general title of '' The Na - poleon Romances , ''
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have added six vol - umes to their neat library edition of the romances of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	.

		The works translated for this set of volumes are '' Les Blancs et les Bleus , '' '' Les Compagnons de Jdhu , '' '' Les Louves de Machecoul , '' and '' Les Freres Corses . ''

		These works make a tolerably connected series , and there is no doubt that a reader may get from them an exceed - ingly vivid , as well as a fairly accurate , impression of the Napoleonic period of French history .

		In saying this , we do not need to take the author as seriously as he took himself , in these words , for ex - ample : '' We shall soon have covered an immense period with our stories : between the ' Countess of
Salisbury	PERSON	' and the ' Count of
Monte Cristo	ORGANIZATION	' lie five centuries and a half ; and we are bold enough to think that concerning those five centuries and a half we have taught
France	LOCATION	more history than any historian . ''

		The present translation is in most re - spects satisfactory .

		We note , however , that in many instances proper geographical names appear in their French spelling , as Sagonte for Saguntum ,
Cannes	LOCATION	for Cannae , Perouse for
Perugia	LOCATION	, and Genes for
Genoa	LOCATION	.

		These are curious lapses for anyone suf - ficiently familiar with French to translate at all .

		The '' Letters Addressed to a Col - Early letters j Fri d d th years
1840	DATE	- ofMr.Ruskin .

		- , o ^ i HT T i - r > i - i 1845 , by Mr.
John Ruskm	PERSON	, are pub - lished in this country by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, although the imprint of the book is that of Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	, the author 's own -LRB- we might almost say pri - vate -RRB- English publisher .

		As a contribution to our knowledge of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's intellectual development , these letters are of course interesting , for they show us at how early a stage certain principles of criticism had become a fixed part of his creed .

		They are also interesting as showing that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's ac - tivities when just out of college were quite as mul - tifarious as they were in later years .

		Absolutely , the letters have slight value , for they merely give crude expression to some of .

		the ideas that later found much more adequate presentation .

		They in - clude an essay on the question '' Was there death before
Adam	PERSON	fell , in other parts of creation ? ''

		which recalls the disputations of the schoolmen .

		That sort of thing , at least , Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	outgrew , and definitely , before he was much older .

		His en - thusiasm for
Turner	ORGANIZATION	appears more than once , as when , speaking of a book concerning which his opinion had been asked , he says : '' I have not seen the book you speak of , but if it praises Turner un - qualifiedly you may trust to it . ''

		The whole of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's Turnerian creed is in the following pas - sage : `` He is the epitome of all art , the concentra - tion of all power ; there is nothing that ever artist was celebrated for that he can not do better than the most celebrated .

		He seems to have seen every - thing , remembered everything , spiritualized every - thing in the visible world ; there is nothing he has not done , nothing he dares not do ; when he dies , there will be more of nature and her mysteries for - gotten in one sob , than will be learned again by the eyes of a generation . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Three reading-books for primary schools attest the growing desire to provide children with a better sort of pabulum than they have been accustomed to . ''

		Fairy Tales for Little Readers '' -LRB-
Lovell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Sarah D. Burke	PERSON	, gives simple paraphrases of five familiar nursery classics .

		Miss
Sarah E. Wiltse	PERSON	's selection of ''
Grimm	PERSON	's Fairy Tales '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- includes '' stories illustrating kind - ness to animals and the unity of life in a variety of con - ditions . ''

		A more ambitious undertaking is that of Miss
Mary E. Burt	PERSON	, whose '' Stories from Plato and Other Classic Writers '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- are taken from
Hesiod	LOCATION	,
Homer	LOCATION	,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Pliny	LOCATION	, and others , and retold in the simplest of language .

		These stories have stood the test of repeated use by the author , and are particularly to be commended to kindergarten and primary school teachers .

		The '' Elementary Algebra '' written by Mr.
Charles Smith	PERSON	and revised by Mr.
Irving Stringham	PERSON	-LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is designed to render less abrupt '' the transi - tion from the traditional algebra of many of our sec - ondary schools to the reconstructed algebra of the best American colleges . ''

		The book constitutes '' a rounded course in what may be called the newer elementary al - gebra , and includes the subject-matter specified by nearly all American colleges as the requirement for ad - mission . ''

		A book of far more elementary mathemat - ics is Miss
Florence N. Sloane	PERSON	's '' Practical Lessons in Fractions '' -LRB-
Heath	LOCATION	-RRB- , following the inductive method , and accompanied by `` fraction cards , '' a device of the writer , used with marked success in her own teaching .

		The first volume of Mr.
James Hamilton Wylie	PERSON	's '' History of
England	LOCATION	under Henry the Fourth '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- was published ten years ago .

		It has just been reissued , iu connection with a second volume , which now 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, first sees the light .

		A third volume , completing the work , is promised for next year .

		The volumes already published show that the labor involved in the work has been of great magnitude , and the result is in accord - ance with the methods of the best modern scholarship .

		The chronicle is too thickly crammed with notes to be easily readable , but the author 's style , when it takes the form of plain narrative , has an honest directness that is at least engaging .

		Mrs.
Lois G. Hufford	PERSON	's '' Essays and Letters Selected from the Writings of
John Ruskin	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- is intended for use as a reading-book in secondary schools .

		It in - cludes the two '' Sesame and Lilies '' lectures , '' Unto this Last , '' six letters from ''
Fors Clavigera	PERSON	, '' and a part of `` The Queen of the Air . ''

		It is supplied with notes and introductory matter , the latter appreciative and judicious in the main .

		While we know of no liv - ing writing of prose better fitted for school reading than Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, and while we are in hearty sympathy with the general purpose of this book , we can not regard as wise the inclusion of such matter as the chapters on what Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	-LRB- but no one else -RRB- fancies to be polit - ical economy .

		High school students are too young to discriminate between the ethical wheat and chaff of '' Unto this Last , '' and loose thinking upon economic questions is about the last thing that should find encour - agement in these days .

		One of the most substantial contributions to knowl - edge that have resulted from the
Chicago	LOCATION	Congresses of
1893	DATE	is the handsome volume -LRB-
Schulte	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which con - tains the '' Memoirs of the
International Congress of Anthropology	ORGANIZATION	, '' edited by Mr.
C. Staniland Wake	PERSON	.

		The papers are classified under physical anthropology , ar - chaeology , ethnology , folk-lore , religions , and linguistics .

		Two supplementary papers are printed in the German language .

		Among the authors are Messrs.
Franz Boas	PERSON	,
Carl Lumholtz	PERSON	,
W. H. Holmes	PERSON	,
D. G. Brinton	PERSON	,
Alice C. Fletcher	PERSON	,
J. C. Fillmore	PERSON	,
Stephen D. Peet	PERSON	,
Cyrus Adler	PERSON	, and
M. Jastrow	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Mrs.
Nuttall	PERSON	's paper on '' The Mexican Calendar System '' is to appear as a separate monograph , and is consequently not here included . ''

		A Gauntlet '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is the title given by Mr.
Osman Edwards	PERSON	to his translation of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's '' En Hanske . ''

		It is curious that the social dramas of this great writer should have remained so long untranslated , in view of the vogue of the similar productions of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		Both writers are at their best in their earlier and more poetical works , but the pictures of society to which their later years have been devoted constitute the most striking dramatic manifestation of the present day .

		Between the two it is hard to choose , but in this newer field
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	is at least the equal of his famous contemporary , while a comparison of their ear - lier work shows him to be distinctly the greater artist .

		The subject of '' En Hanske '' has become somewhat in - sistent in recent literature , and it is well to remember that the discussion was practically started by the pub - lication of this drama .

		Mr.
R. D. Cortina	PERSON	publishes a series of paper-cov - ered texts for students of the Spanish language .

		This '' Serie de Cortina '' now includes '' Despuds de la Llu - via el Sol , '' a prose comedy in one act by an unnamed writter ; `` El Indiano , '' a prose comedy in three acts adopted from
Garcia	LOCATION	de la Vega ; and '' Amparo , '' a story from Seiior Enrigue Pe ` rez Escrich .

		The latter two publications give the Spanish text with the English translation , a page of the one facing a page of the other .

		Mr.
Cortina	PERSON	has supplied all these texts with notes .

		-LSB- LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		Mr.
Thomas J. Wise	PERSON	has just begun publication , in the pages of '' The Athenaeum , '' of his '' Bibliography of the Works of
Robert Browning	PERSON	. ''

		It will afterwards be extended , and issued in parts to subscribers .

		Mr.
Shad	PERSON	well , of
Oriel College	ORGANIZATION	, will select from Wal - ter Pater 's papers such matter as he thinks it advisable to publish .

		It is also proposed that several of Pater 's friends prepare a memorial volume from their remin - iscences .

		The
Prussian Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	has granted to Professors
Zeller	PERSON	and Diels
$ 2,000	MONEY	for continuing the publication of the writings of the commentators of Aris - totle .

		Professor
Zeller	PERSON	took leave of his classes at
the University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	on
August 2	DATE	with a speech in which he said that his health had always been so good that in his 110 semesters he had never missed his lectures for a single week .

		Messrs.
Charles L. W	PERSON	T ebster
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	will at once pub - lish ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	's '' new book ,
John Bull & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' which deals with '' the great colonial branches of the firm ,
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, and South Af - rica . ''

		If we may judge of the whole book from the Australian chapter , which we read the other day in '' La Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' the author has abated nothing of the wit , the shrewdness , and the lively intelligence charac - teristic of his earlier writings .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons will publish early this month a collection of the poems of Mr.
Francis How	PERSON	- ard
Williams	ORGANIZATION	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, author of the novel '' At - man , or Documents in a Strange Case , '' several lyric dramas , and of a remarkable story entitled `` Boscosel , '' published in `` The Septameron '' in
1888	DATE	.

		Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iams 's volume of verse will be called '' The Flute - Player , and Other Poems , '' and while containing a few pieces which have already appeared in the magazines , will be chiefly composed of unpublished poems from this poet 's portfolio .

		The public library at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	,
Cal.	LOCATION	, recently pur - chased a number of French books , including the works of
M. Jean Richepin	PERSON	.

		A local clergyman of the Meth - odist persuasion got wind of the affair , and delivered a sermon attacking the librarian -LRB- a woman , by the way -RRB- , and containing this fervent supplication : '' O Lord , vouchsafe Thy saving grace to the librarian of the
Los Angeles City Library	LOCATION	and cleanse her of all sin and make her a woman worthy of her office . ''

		The librarian has promptly brought suit for damages against the of - fending preacher .

		SCOTT AT THE CLOSE OF HIS CENTURY .

		Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	thus writes of
Scott	PERSON	in his preface to the new edition of the latter 's poems : '' In looking back over
this century	DATE	, which is now so near its close , there is none among its conspicuous fig - ures of pleasanter aspect than that of
Scott	LOCATION	; and of all the men who have lived during its course there is not one who has contributed more largely to the pleasure of its successive generations .

		This is a great eulogy ; no man could desire a better .

		To amuse men ration - ally , to give them wholesome entertainment , is to do them a great service ; and to do this through a lifetime more successfully than any one else , is to be worthy of lasting gratitude .

		This is what
Scott	PERSON	did for our fath - ers , and has done for many of us , and will continue to do for many of our children .

		At this moment , more than sixty years after the last of his novels was written ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 129 two popular editions of them are in course of publica - tion ; while his poems , ninety years after the ' Lay of the Last Minstrel ' was first published , are still the de - light of youthful readers , and still charm readers of all ages by the interest of their animated narrative , the ease of the versification , and the manliness of their spirit ... Let us be grateful for such a gift .

		There is space even on the narrow shelves of the immortals for books such as his .

		Shakespeare ,
Milton	LOCATION	, Words - worth may rest on a higher shelf , but
Scott	PERSON	will be nearer at hand for the multitude of readers , and his vol - umes will require more frequent re-binding . ''

		WALTER PATER .

		-LRB-
July 30 , 1894	DATE	. -RRB-

		The freshness of the light , its secrecy , Spices , or honey from sweet-smelling bower , The harmony of time , love 's trembling hour Struck on thee with a new felicity .

		Standing , a child , by a red hawthorn-tree , Its perishing , small petals ' flame had power To fill with masses of soft , ruddy flower A certain roadside in thy memory : And haply when the tragic clouds of night Were slowly wrapping round thee , in the cold Of which men always die , a sense renewed Of the things sweet to touch and breath and sight , That thou didst touch and breathe and see of old , Stole on thee with the warmth of gratitude .


Michael Field	PERSON	in '' The Academy . ''

		A MODERN BIBLIOPHILE 'S LIBRARY .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	tells us in one of his books that if fortune made him the possessor of one volume of ex - cessive value , he should hasten to part with it .

		And yet in Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's library are many books of '' exces - sive value , '' which , in '' their redolent crushed
Levant	PERSON	, '' no ''
Bonanza King	PERSON	, with millions in his bank , '' could restore if lost or destroyed .

		From a list originally started for insurance purposes , Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	was encour - aged by the solicitation of friends to make a catalogue of his collection which should serve a double purpose . ''

		The silliest people who collect books might be consid - ered benefactors to their species if they only would cat - alogue their collections , '' said Mr.
Falconer Madan	PERSON	to Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	; and his catalogue is really a benefaction for all book-lovers .

		Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	provides it with this cheerful Epilogue : '' I doubt your painful Pedants who Can read a Dictionary through ; But he must he a dismal dog Who can ' t enjoy this Catalogue ! ''

		It is not given to many collectors of books to number so many poets and men of letters among his friends as does Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	; hence few collections embrace so many volumes calculated to excite the greed of the biblio - maniac .

		There is a matchless set of
Edward FitzGer	PERSON	- ald 's books , those privately-printed Dramas of Calderon , '' freely translated , '' the first '' Rubaiyat , '' and the rest , nearly all of which are presentation copies , and some of which are enriched with the translator 's notes in au - tograph .

		There is also a notable collection of ''
Restora	PERSON	- tion Dramatists , '' in which department Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's li - brary has '' no rival , public or private '' ; and another special department , rich in such books as Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	's '' The Defence of Guenevere '' -LRB- 1858 -RRB- '' rub - bishy minor verse , '' Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	pere called it the mere enumeration of a few items of which might make a bibliomaniac green with envy .

		If '' an affecting and chronic want of pounds '' has precluded Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	from purchasing '' the white elephants of bibliography , '' the same distressful condition has not stood in the way of his forming valuable friendships . '' '

		Book against book . ' '

		Agreed , ' I said : But ' t was the trick of Diomed !

		And yet , in Fairy-land , I 'm told , Dead leaves as these will turn to gold .

		Take them , Sir Alchemist , and see !

		Nothing transmutes like sympathy . ''

		Thus does Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	inscribe a copy of his '' At the Sign of the Lyre , '' To
E. W. G.	PERSON	'' And many another tome in Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's library bears poetical inscriptions from his '' Neighbor of the near domain , '' and from many another friend , inscriptions that are destined never to see the light outside the pages of this catalogue .

		Many of these inscriptions are reproduced in facsimile .

		A facsimile of a letter from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, acknowl - edging the authorship of his Rugby prize poem , ''
Alaric	PERSON	at
Rome	LOCATION	'' ; and another of
Tennyson	PERSON	's poem , `` The Throstle , '' possess a melancholy interest .

		And so does the volume of Rossetti '' Relics , '' which comprehends among other items a set of pages from '' The Germ , '' containing the story of '' Hand and Soul , '' with frequent corrections in
Rossetti	PERSON	's handwriting ; a corrected proof of the Sonnet on the Mulberry Tree planted by Shake - speare and felled by the Rev.
E. Gastrell	PERSON	, '' deaf drudge , to whom no length of ears Sufficed to catch the music of the spheres ! ''

		and the first draft of the '' Czar Alexander II . ''

		sonnet , the text of which differs in almost every line from that first published in '' Ballads and Sonnets , '' and which may therefore be quoted here : `` From him did forty thousand Serfs , endow 'd Each with six feet of death-claim 'd soil , receive Rich lifelong freeborn land , whereon to sheave Their country 's harvest .

		Who to-day aloud
Demand of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	their Father 's blood , sore bow 'd With tears and thrilled with wrath ; and burn to achieve On every guilty head without reprieve All torment by his edicts disallow 'd .

		He stayed the knout 's red-ravening fangs ; and first Of Russian traitors his own murderers go White to the tomb .

		While he , laid foully low With limbs red-lopp 'd , with blood-clogg 'd brain which nursed
The Nation	ORGANIZATION	's charter , from fell Nihil flown No Nought finds now , a witness at God 's Throne . ''

		Nearly all the introuvables of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	are in this precious collection , many with brief inscriptions by their author ; also a complete set of those by Mr.
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, booklets that are almost un - known beyond the circle of his literary friends , and would bring their weight in five-pound notes if offered for sale .

		These were printed by the author 's stepson , Mr.
S. L. Osbourne	PERSON	, and are as limited in the number of their pages as in the number of copies printed .

		One of the booklets is entitled '' Not I , and Other Poems '' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , and the last poem , reprinted from the catalogue , with apologies to Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, states that '' The pamphlet here presented Was planned and printed by A printer unindented , A bard whom all decry . ''

		The author and the printer , With various kinds of skill , Concocted it in
Winter	DATE	At
Davos	LOCATION	on the Hill . ''

		They burned the nightly taper ; But now the work is ripe .

		Observe the costly paper , Remark the perfect type . ''

		169 BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON .

		Several pages of the present issue of THE DIAL are devoted to a classified list of publish - ers ' announcements for the coming fall .

		In com - menting upon the similar lists of six months and
a year ago	DATE	, we expressed our surprise and grati - fication at the fact that the publishing trade should have been so little affected by the de - pression so general during the past year in commercial circles .

		The list of announcements published by us last
spring	DATE	was even longer than any previous showing made at that season of the year .

		It is of course true , as we then re - marked , that the publishing trade , as far as its announcements are concerned , is slow to exhibit the effects of a diminished demand .

		The pub - lications of any given season are well under way six months before the public hears of them , and many of them are arranged for a year or more in advance .

		Some shrinkage might therefore reasonably have been expected in the list for the coming season , and it is a matter of peculiar gratification to us to note the fact that not only is there no such falling-off , but that the list shows a marked increase over any published in a previous year .

		A close examination , more - over , discloses more than the usual number of very important and expensive works , with at least the usual number of books of unques - tionable and serious interest .

		If the effect of a period of commercial depression is to thus stimulate to unwonted exertions the trade of the publisher , it can not be regarded as an evil wholly unmixed .

		That such is to a certain ex - tent the case , appears quite clear when the mind 's eye scans the shelves that a bookish imagination will at once fill with the volumes now promised for early issue .

		Of all the books now announced , the great - est interest probably attaches to the long prom - ised and impatiently awaited letters of Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	, which have been edited by Mr.
G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	.

		This book will occupy a place in the literature of the year similar to that occupied last year by the letters of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	.

		As next in interest , we may mention Mr.
Samuel T. Pickard	PERSON	's authorized biography of
Whittier	LOCATION	, which will also include many of the poet 's letters .

		Several other '' lives and letters '' are promised , among them 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	,
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, by his daughter ;
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	, by the Rev.
D. D. Addison ; Erasmus	PERSON	, by Mr.
J. A. Froude	PERSON	; and the late Dean of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's , by an editor unnamed .

		Biographies whose titles make no special mention of letters are Mr.
Edward Gary	PERSON	's
George William Curtis	PERSON	, Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	's
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, and Mr.
E. S. Purcell	PERSON	's
Cardinal Manning	ORGANIZATION	, prom - ised for last year , but unavoidably delayed .

		On the other hand , letters without biographies are promised for Thoreau by Mr.
F. B. San	PERSON	- born , for
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	by Mrs.
Mabel Loomis Todd	PERSON	, and for General
Sherman	PERSON	and his brother , Senator
John Sherman	PERSON	.

		Literary history and criticism are to be enriched by Mr.
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	's ''
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' Mr.
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	's '' Essays and Stud - ies , '' Mr.
O. F. Emerson	PERSON	's `` History of the English Language , '' Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	's '' Childhood in Literature and Art , '' Miss
Vida E. Scudder	PERSON	's '' The Life of the Spirit in Mod - ern English Poets , '' Mr.
W. E. Simonds	PERSON	's `` An Introduction to the Study of English Fiction , '' Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	's '' Corrected Impres - sions , '' and a translation of
M. Jusserand	PERSON	's new study of English life and literature in the times of
Langland	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Selden L. Whitcomb	PERSON	's '' Chronological Outlines of American Litera - ture '' we expect to find a very useful work .

		In poetry and fiction , it has been our expe - rience that announcements are fragmentary , and that many of the best books of every sea - ' son come almost unheralded .

		The poetry already promised includes new volumes by Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	and Miss Thomas ; Mr.
Lee-Hamil	PERSON	- ton 's `` Sonnets of the Wingless Hours '' ; a reis - sue , with additions , of Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's poems ; and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's '' Victorian Anthology , '' which is sure to take place immediately among the standard works of its class .

		The most im - portant books of fiction in sight are '' Trilby , '' by Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	; '' The Ealstons , '' by Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	; ''
Highland Cousins	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Black	PERSON	; '' The Vagabonds , '' by Mrs.
Margaret L. Woods	PERSON	; '' The Chase of
St. Castin	LOCATION	, and Other Tales , '' by Mrs.
M. H. Catherwood	PERSON	; `` Philip and His Wife , '' by Mrs.
Margaret Deland	PERSON	; ''
Coeur d'Alene	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mrs.
M. H. Foote	PERSON	; '' Tales of the Punjaub , '' by Mrs.
F. A. Steel	PERSON	; '' A Bachelor Maid , '' by Mrs.
Bur	PERSON	- ton
Harrison	PERSON	; '' When All the Woods are
Green	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
S. Wier Mitchell	PERSON	; '' Eound the Red Lamp , '' by Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	; '' A Flash of
Summer	DATE	, '' by Mrs.
W. K. Clifford	PERSON	; and a new volume of short stories from the Polish of
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	.

		A few important historical works must find mention .

		We are to have a history of the
United States	LOCATION	by President
E. Benjamin	PERSON	An - drews , and a history of the Civil War by Mr.
John C. Ropes	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, in his '' The Founding of the Trans -
Alleghany Commonwealths	ORGANIZATION	, '' will make another excursion into his favorite field of investigation .

		A vol - ume of historical essays by Mr.
Frederic Har	PERSON	- rison will be awaited with interest , as will also Professor von Hoist 's lectures on '' The French Revolution tested by the Career of
Mira	PERSON	- beau , '' and two posthumous volumes by Profes - sor
Freeman	PERSON	, one upon ``
Western Europe	LOCATION	in the Fifth Century , '' the other a last instalment of the colossal but fragmentary history of
Sicily	LOCATION	.

		A translation , in six volumes , of
Herr Duncker	PERSON	's '' Geschichte des Alterthums , '' is one of the most ambitious of enterprises in the department of historical publication .

		Even more ambitious is the promised facsimile re - print , in no less than fifty-four volumes , of '' Les Relations des Jesuites , '' that important source of the raw material of American history .

		The most attractive announcement in class - ical study is the volume of lectures on Latin poetry , delivered upon the Turnbull founda - tion by Professor
R. Y. Tyrrell	PERSON	.

		A certain adventitious interest of course attaches to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's new translation of
Horace	PERSON	, also promised for early publication .

		Mr.
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	will have a book on '' The Educa - tion of the Greek People . ''

		Since we are upon the subject of education , we may men - tion Professor
Paulsen	PERSON	's history of the Ger - man universities , and call attention to the unusual activity of the producers of educa - tional treatises , manuals , and texts .

		These are so numerous , and of so high a character , that selection would be invidious .

		But our readers will be interested to learn that THE DIAL 'S papers upon the teaching of English in the American universities are to be edited for publication in book form .

		Of the hundreds of announcements in other departments , our space forbids the selection of more than a very few titles .

		Two great works of reference , Mr.
John Bartlett	PERSON	's Shake - spearian Concordance and '' The Century Cyclopaedia of Names , '' can not go unnoticed .

		Among illustrated holiday books , Mr.
Karoly	PERSON	's ''
Raphael	PERSON	's Madonnas and Other Great Pic - tures , '' and
Walpole	LOCATION	's '' Memoirs of the Reign of
George III.	PERSON	, '' assume special prominence .

		Two new editions of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	are also promised . ''

		The Art of the American Wood -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 145 Engraver , '' by Mr.
P. G. Hamerton	PERSON	, with forty signed artists ' proofs on
India	LOCATION	paper , is a sumptuous work that will be eagerly awaited .

		The new edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, in ten volumes , to be edited by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	and Professor Wood - berry , will supply a long-felt want .

		Among books of travel , Messrs.
Allen	PERSON	and
Sachtleben	PERSON	's `` Across
Asia	LOCATION	on a Bicycle , '' Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's '' Glimpses of
Unfamiliar Japan	LOCATION	, '' and Mrs. Bishop 's '' The Hawaiian Archipelago '' promise rich entertainment for those who like to visit foreign parts without leaving home .

		Finally , we will mention `` The Religions of Ja - pan , '' by the Rev.
W. E. Griffis	PERSON	; and a new translation , with many plates , of the Egyptian `` Book of the Dead , '' for which we are to thank the industrious scholarship of Dr.
Charles H. S. Davis	PERSON	.

		And with these random selections we think we have sustained our preliminary con - tention that the list of announcements for the season is even richer than the list of its prede - cessors in its promise of entertainment , instruc - tion , and helpfulness .

		`` TELL US A STORY ! ''

		Kant was not the first to mark out
Time	ORGANIZATION	and Space as categorical imperatives in man 's sense-perception of the external world .

		Carlyle was not the first to see that Time and Space are for our eyes the garments of spir - itual mysteries .

		Lessing was not the first to write a sharp division between the Arts of these two lords of our imagination , shutting up Sculpture to the
Beauty of Color	ORGANIZATION	and Form , which Space can give us without Time ; allowing to Poetry the
Beauty of Movement	ORGANIZATION	and Suc - cessive Moments .

		These masters of analysis we anticipated when we were infants .

		We found out that our cradle stood in a nursery , and the nursery in a house , and the house in a yard ; that things happened and were over , and to-days rolled into yesterdays .

		We felt the mystery of
Time and Space	ORGANIZATION	, when we so loved the little girl in
Grandma	LOCATION	's stories , who lived over in
England	LOCATION	, and was really ''
Mamma	PERSON	, when she was a little girl . ''

		We saw that there was one Beauty of Rest and another of Motion , when the horse in the park statuary did not quite satisfy us , because he never put his other two feet down , like that other most fascinating horse that '' brought the good news from
Ghent	LOCATION	to
Aix	LOCATION	'' : '' I sprang to the stirrup , and
Joris	PERSON	, and he ; I galloped ,
Dirck	PERSON	galloped , we galloped all three ; ' Good speed ! '

		cried the watch , as the gatebolts withdrew ; ' Speed ! '

		echoed the wall , to us galloping through ; Behind shut the postern , the lights sank to rest , And into the midnight we galloped abreast . ''

		That was the start .

		And the finish ! ''

		Then I cast loose my buff coat , each holster let fall , Shook off both my jackboots , let go belt and all , Stood up in the stirrups , leaned , patted his ear , Called my Roland his pet-name , my horse without peer ; Clapped my hands , laughed and sang , any noise , bad or good , Till at length into
Aix Eoland	LOCATION	galloped and stood ! ''

		But clear as is this distinction between the statue and the poem felt by a child , analyzed by a Lessing , must it be absolute ?

		Must a picture be all repose , and a story all movement ?

		Must a picture never suggest a , story , and a story never stay for a picture ?

		These are the burning questions that divide Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	from Mr.
J. G. Brown	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	from Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	, in a paper in a recent num - ber of '' The Century '' on Painting at the World 's Fair , says that the wish for narrative even in a picture makes the difference between the Teutonic and the Latin races .

		The Italians and French , he claims , can observe directly .

		The Germans and English must get at Form and Color by the medium of Thought .

		Pictures , to please them , must tell a story .

		If among them comes a man that can paint a '' field of waving grain with a blue sky over it , '' '' he is afraid to let it stand as a harmony of blue and gold .

		He puts it to the title of ' the happy autumn fields , And thinking of the days that are no more . ' ''

		Is n't it just the reverse of this that people are com - plaining of , in Mr.
Howells	PERSON	?

		If the '' harmony in blue and gold '' was really a picture , but was made to sug - gest a story to please people that prefer poetry to paint - ing , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's '' Rise of
Silas Lapham	PERSON	, '' though given out as a story , is really a series of sketches of certain types in the city of
Boston	LOCATION	, made to please people that prefer analysis , which is literary sketching , to a narra - tive of events .

		There are plenty of artists that lose faith in the pub - lic ever seeing the picture they saw from the day they chose the subject to the day of the finished painting .

		There are plenty of delicious jokes about the artists ' wives selling these pictures to romantic old gentlemen by nam - ing them '' His Mistake '' or '' It Might Have Been . ''

		But has the story-teller a like temptation to pass off his wares as belonging to another art ?

		If most people prefer narrative to picturesqueness , has he not a clear path to a fairly gained audience ?

		Right here comes in the difference that tells .

		The number of men and women that have had a little train - ing in the technique of story-writing is to the number of those that have had similar training in painting as a hundred to one .

		Almost all our schools , in their liter - ary departments , give the more advanced students hints of the methods by which this or that '' touch '' may be given .

		It is much easier to teach how to describe than how to narrate ; for description is a critical , artificial process , compared with narration , which must be spon - taneous , the knack of it not easily to be imparted .

		So it is that in an advanced civilization , there are enough writers and readers trained to methods of liter - ary picturesqueness to keep our best magazines full of `` stories '' which are really pictures ; while the masses of the people , secretly or openly , flee to second-rate periodicals with stories that have no '' style '' at all , but that have the action that belongs to a story .

		And the few far-sighted and honest critics , revolting against the cheap dialect-and-other methods of word-painting , are lamenting the days of good Sir
Walter	PERSON	, and are loud in praise of the rare stories like '' Trilby . ''

		Well !

		In a year or two , according to the Persian proverb , '' this , too , shall pass . ''

		And when the maga - zines shall have published their present supply of genre sketches , they will be found responding to the growing clamor of the children at bedtime , and the children of a larger growth , '' Tell us a STORY ! ''


JESSIE MACMILLAN ANDERSON	PERSON	.

		146 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
PENNSYLVANIA	LOCATION	.

		* There is a well-known story in the ''
Autobiogra	PERSON	- phy of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, '' in which the author informs us how he anticipated the advice of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	for the acquisition of '' an English style , familiar , but not coarse , and elegant , but not osten - tatious , '' by giving '' his days and nights to the study of Addison . ''

		With so sagacious a recogni - tion of the value of English as a part of practical education from the founder of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, it is not surprising that English has from colonial times held a position of recognized importance at the
University	ORGANIZATION	; although it is only within the
last decade and a half	DATE	that that position has been defined , with its relations to the other courses of the curriculum .

		The
Department of English	ORGANIZATION	at
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, as at present constituted , is concerned with four subjects : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Composition , -LRB- 2 -RRB- English Literature , -LRB- 3 -RRB- English Language and Philology , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- Forensics .

		Of these , -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- are con - fined to undergraduates , the others extend to grad - uate courses .

		Whether for good or bad , we make comparatively little of Forensics , beyond care exer - cised incidentally in reading aloud and in opportu - nities offered for declamation by students of the lower classes .

		Elective and voluntary courses in speaking and debate follow in junior year ; but the chief practice of our students in these subjects is derived from the exercises of their literary socie - ties .

		There is an opinion prevalent at the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity that it is perhaps well that '' elocution '' be not too professionally taught ; but that the character of the individual should be developed in his utter - ance rather than overwhelmed with the oratorical mannerisms to which special teaching sometimes leads .

		est way to facility of expression in writing is con - stant practice , and a practice unaffected and free from false conceptions of the purpose of such prac - tice .

		With this in view , every Freshman in the
University	ORGANIZATION	writes two or three themes a week ; Sophomores and Juniors , except those hopelessly given over to technology , at least one a week ; whilst in Senior year the subject except as indi - rectly represented in the papers of the '' semina - ries '' or study-classes in literature remains op - tional .

		All of this work is carefully superintended by the instructors in charge ; every composition is read occasionally before the class or a section of it , corrected , annotated , if need be handed back to be rewritten , the faults explained with the prin - ciples involved , the personality of the writer stud - ied as far as possible , his abilities trained and directed .

		In the assignment of themes there is an endeavor to avoid subjects which can be read up and crammed for the occasion , although the stu - dent is kept in continual touch with good English style by required collateral reading .

		The study of Rhetoric is developed out of the reading and com - position work ; and , although systematized by ref - erence to a text-book , is not studied as a thing apart from daily practice .

		And now as to the study of English literature , which we confine , except for a brief estimate of the historical values of other products , entirely to the range of what is known as '' the literature of pow - er . ''

		English literature forms a part of the require - ment for entrance to college , and is involved in the reading and instruction of Freshman year , although there subsidiary to the more immediate claims of the drill in composition .

		In Sophomore year the special study of literature begins , continuing until graduation in periods from two to five and six hours a week according to the course elected .

		I omit any enumeration of courses , as this may be readily gleaned by the curious from the catalogues and bulletins of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In our method of work we endeavor to follow some such course as this : Our first task is to teach the student to observe literary phenomena ; to have him read , never more , however , than he can ab - sorb ; to let him prove by written and oral exercise that he has read , and also to demand from the first that he formulate in words his impressions of his reading .

		These impressions are crude to a degree , and bear to his mature work precisely the relation which the antics he performs in the gymnasium bear to applied physical activity .

		But we esteem it no small thing to have trained a boy to think on something for himself .

		The authors chosen for these earlier exercises are those least distantly re - moved from the student 's modes of daily thought .

		They are modern , and writers in prose ; as the problem is greatly simplified by the elimination of a strange or unusual medium , and the allowances which must be made for historic environment .

		When the student has begun to note literary 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 phenomena with some degree of ease , we direct his attention to the relation subsisting between the va - rious phenomena noted , still demanding that he increase his data by constant reading of literature and frequent exercises such as those noted above .

		We are now prepared for that orderly exposition of the relation of literary phenomena which we call the history of Literature .

		This history should proceed , as far as possible , from the more familiar to the less familiar ; and for this reason we arrange the courses in the history of more recent periods to precede such periods as that of Chaucer or of Shake - speare .

		We aim to have such courses deepen the impression of the student by a minuter attention to the relations of things , by seeking out the begin - nings of various modes of literary thought and tracing their development in the light of contempo - rary conditions .

		Nor is this all .

		We require the student to keep himself in daily touch with the writings of those authors that form the subject - matter of the lectures , and to submit the results of his reading in frequent '' seminary meetings '' for correction and general discussion among his fel - lows .

		Thus we arrive at the beginning of Senior year with that training in the perception of the qualities and relations of literary products , and that general knowledge of the course of their de - velopment , which alone can render the study of organic and aesthetic detail practicable .

		In Senior year the whole subject is approached again from these points of view in the study of poetics , the his - tory of criticism and aesthetics , the '' seminary '' or literary workshop , continuing as in previous years .

		We insist that all talk about theories , aesthetic , philosophical , or other , which the student may not investigate for himself by actual reference to the authors in question , be banished from our work .

		In conclusion of the undergraduate work in En - glish literature , we feel that the study holds a pe - culiar position from its capabilities in developing the taste and artistic discernment , its liberalizing influence in broadening the student 's views of life and man , its enormous weight against utilitarian - ism , and its power in giving us , when properly taught , the very essence of the now all but de - throned humanities .

		The Philology of English holds a recognized and important place in the undergraduate courses of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, although we have not seen the necessity of making the sight reading of '' Beowulf '' a requirement for entrance to col - lege , as some of our radical friends would have it .

		The reading and philological study of Old and Middle English , especially Chaucer , is offered to undergraduates in the form of elective courses ex - tending through Junior and Senior year , whilst a brief practical course in the history of the English language is a required study for all Freshmen .

		Neither in Literature nor in Philology do we set undergraduates to what is sometimes called in the English of catalogues `` original research , '' prefer - ring to devote these years to the laying of such foundation stones as we may , rather than to the amateurish collection of unimportant literary data or the perfunctory compilation of unnecessary in - dices .

		The graduate courses in English of the Univer - sity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	are confined to Literature and Philology .

		Under the latter is included not only the Philology of English but the intensive study of literary products of Old and Middle English , con - ducted by means of lecture and seminary , with carefully superintended original investigation on the part of the student .

		In literature too , while the subject is treated in lectures and by discussion from the historical as well as the organic and aes - thetic point of view , it is the duty of each student pursuing English as his major subject to determine upon some definite literary period , movement , or writer , for special study and investigation , and later to choose some theme within the range of this special field for his thesis .

		The graduate theses in English , as in all other departments of the Univer - sity , must be submitted to the Faculty of Philoso - phy , and upon acceptance published .

		THE STUDY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE STUDENT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The readers of THE DIAL have been interested dur - ing the past few months in the series of articles on the Teaching of English in our large Universities .

		These have given the standpoint of the teacher .

		But that of the student may be of no less interest .

		And as I am just completing my student life in that department , after the regular preparatory , college , and graduate work , I wish to present a few thoughts from this other side .

		The favored methods , scientific or other , of secondary schools do not invariably bear fruit in a thorough cul - ture .

		But wide reading in good books , not necessarily classics , is absolutely indispensable in forming a good taste for reading , and for exciting an interest in the study of literature ; it is a sub-conscious preparation for the conscious activity of the matured mind .

		I say sub - conscious advisedly ; for the young student has a direct interest in the good and beautiful in what he is reading , and is influenced , whether he knows it or not , by his in - terest ; but once urge him to give conscious articulation to his opinions , and to dissect his sentiments , and the charm of his reading is decreased .

		Then his primitive interest must be supplanted by something further .

		The later process of studying the isolated fact is good in its time ; but if premature , it causes the student to regard his study of literature as a de-naturalizing , unbeautifying process , and he will look in later years with a horrified remembrance on the classics that suffered such a pro- cess at the hands of his teachers .

		I wish to speak of an objection to the study of liter - ature , which , as it meets every student , must be met by the teacher .

		As the student enters his second or third year in college he is confronted by lines of elective study .

		He is called on , to a certain extent , to shape the growth of his own mind .

		He is eager to make the best of his college course ; he wishes to choose wisely , that he may make the most of himself .

		Nine students out of ten in this situation say to themselves on first thought : '' I can study literature for myself after leaving college ; I must not let work that can be accomplished then stand in the way of what must be done now or not at all ; the study of literature would be delightful , but it would require a good deal of time , and under the circumstances would be an indulgence . ''

		This , I repeat , is the thought of many students at the critical moment of their college lives .

		I must take for granted that many readers of THE DIAL have already answered this objection for themselves .

		Yet it is an objection that the teacher must carefully answer to those who enter at all on his elect - ive work , not with an ex-cathedra answer , but the silent , satisfactory answer of skilfully conducted work .

		As the Latin and Greek classics were made the instru - ments of culture by the instructors of English youth during the past centuries , so our English classics , with less intervention of the merely technical , can be made the instruments of culture for the American youth .

		These English classics were , primarily , the education of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	; and they must be the education of the
American Chaucers	ORGANIZATION	and Miltons and Wordsworths who will yet come .

		Let the teacher convince the student of this , as every good teacher of literature does , and he will have the choicest students of the college in his elect - ive courses .

		The student , in consequence , makes certain require - ments of his teacher in this department .

		He expects a living , cultured personality , not a fact-hopper warranted to grind and sift a certain quantum of knowledge in a given period of recitation hours .

		The life in the teacher which adds real zest to the study is helpful in any line ; personal enthusiasm can modify even a prop - osition in
Euclid	LOCATION	, though the fact that the '' sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles '' may be demonstrated by an automaton .

		But to the successful teaching of literature , such life is absolutely indispens - able ; for the study of literature is more directly a study of life in its wide relations , and life only can interpret life .

		The teacher needs natural and manly sentiments and thoughts , not technical apparatus ; and these can find origin only in the essential character .

		The student also has his opinions as to what the teach - er 's purpose with a student should be .

		It is an almost universal trait of young minds to rebel against being reduced to a means .

		They are still idealists in life ; nothing presents itself to them as more worthful than their own life and its prospects .

		Hence , while they are willing to do almost any amount of work for their own growth , they are very slow to make of themselves stones for the temple of learning .

		They are still possessed by the thought that a whole is greater than its parts that the individual life is greater than learning ; they are still in what some lament as a state of primitive egoism .

		The successful teacher must adapt himself to this state of the young mind .

		He must bring some real contribu - tion to that self-treasured life ; he must make the stu - dent feel that he considers that life worth working for , and must shape his methods and choice of masterpieces to that end .

		And to do this , the student must be made to feel that he is a man , or at least has the promise of manhood ; that his natural sentiments are right in gen - eral , and need training and direction , rather than nox - ious weeds to be extirpated and replaced by flowers transplanted from the teacher 's mind .

		Thus the pur - suit of his own ambition and his natural interest in good reading will lead him on to the most serious efforts for a literary education .

		Facts leave us , faculties never .

		No student who has reached the junior year doubts this .

		He has forgotten the tables for compound numbers , he is unable to name the figures of speech .

		But he knows that he himself , his essential manhood , in its intellectual and moral as well as its physical self , has been developing thews , has gained power to grapple with problems of much more importance .

		He even goes at times to the dangerous extreme of nonchalance for fact .

		In his studies , includ - ing his study of literature , he will appreciate an effort on the part of the teacher to form proper tastes and develop powers of doing within him .

		He will travel laboriously through disjointed facts of literary history and literary origins with an inward protest ; but he will eagerly labor for the literary taste which he sees can interpret whatever literature is presented to it ; for he is really anxious to get that invaluable secret of which Mr.
Edward Dowden	PERSON	speaks the interpretation of one good book , and by it the power over many .

		Hence he will be ready to study that in literature which has essential worth , but will be less moved by historical , technical , or other adventitious interest .

		He will wel - come his Shakespeare , but care little for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's antecedents .

		He will care less for origins than for life .

		And so the great treasure for which his teacher will ever be held in grateful remembrance will be the sound

		A WORD UNFITLY SPOKEN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Many of your readers besides the personal friends of Professor
Ely	PERSON	must have read with satisfaction the let - ter in your issue of
Sept. 1	DATE	, headed `` The
New York	LOCATION	' Nation ' and Its ' College Anarchist . ' ''

		The writer is clearly very much in earnest , and he does his theme jus - tice so far as he chooses to go .

		He omits , however , to note a material point upon which he as well as others who have canvassed the matter might well have en - larged in the interests of sanity and precision in current economic discussion .

		It is surely high time that news - papers which assume to instruct people and even to speak ex cathedra on social questions should themselves grasp such elementary facts as that '' socialist '' and '' anarchist '' are not interchangeable terms of political philosophy .

		To urge this is certainly not to stickle for any metaphysical nicety of definition .

		Whatever social - ism may mean , it does not mean anti-socialism ; and to style a man of Dr.
Ely	PERSON	's views an '' anarchist '' is to be - tray a looseness of thinking and a vagueness of element - ary conceptions not very consistent with special preten - sions to accuracy .

		No friend of '' The Nation '' will willingly admit that , in the case in point , it stooped to the methods of '' The Rowdy Journal , '' and called Pro- fessor Ely '' anarchist , '' instead of socialist , simply be - cause the former term is the more abusive and vitriolic of the two .

		We prefer to ascribe the use of the unfor - tunate epithet to passing inadvertence rather than de - liberate scurrility .

		Inadvertence , however , in a journal of standing , may prove to be a serious matter to the victim of it .

		One does not expect much in the way of technical precision from the ordinary newspaper , which is admittedly made , like the razors in the ballad , '' to sell . ''

		Neither its readers nor its victims take its epi - thets in other than a very Pickwickian sense ; but when a journal like '' The Nation '' styles this or that teacher or preacher an '' anarchist , '' the public justly assumes that it means to characterize and not merely to abuse him in short , that it means what it says .

		For instance , when the good people of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	learned through its columns that the Director of the
School of Economics	ORGANIZATION	in their
State University	ORGANIZATION	was , presumably , moulding the young gentlemen in his charge into embryo Mosts and
Bakounines	LOCATION	, they promptly proceeded to investigate him .

		Probably the next cry of '' Wolf ! ''

		from the same quar - ter will receive less attention .

		To lump socialists and anarchists together , as is sometimes done , on the ground that both schools are dissatisfied with existing civil ar - rangements , seems a poor quibble .

		The classification simply makes a socialist , or an anarchist , or both , of every man of us whom nature has favored with the nor - mal capacity for thinking and feeling .

		Even the hardiest exponent of newspaper '' cocksureness '' would hesitate to rank , say , Professor Huxley with the `` dangerous classes '' ; yet we find him saying : `` Even the best of modern civilizations appears to me to exhibit a condi - tion of mankind which neither embodies any worthy ideal nor even possesses the merit of stability .

		I do not hesitate to express the opinion , that , if there is no hope of improvement of the condition of the greater part of the human family .

		... I should hail the ad - vent of some kindly comet , which would sweep the whole affair away , as a desirable consummation . ''

		If there be anything in the writings of even our '' College Anarch - ist '' savoring more strongly of the gospel of discontent than this , I have failed to see it .

		`` THE FREEDOM OF TEACHING . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The editorial in your last issue discussing the recent heresy trial in our
State University	ORGANIZATION	, and incidentally the freedom of teaching , meets my cordial approval in the main .

		I can not agree , however , that it is an '' out - rage '' to question the teaching of any person employed by the
State	ORGANIZATION	in a proper case .

		Indeed , I believe it to be the paramount duty of the board of management of every educational institution to know that no instruc - tion is given subversive to the power which employs it .

		To decline to do this , the governing body would , in my judgment , be recreant to the important trust reposed in it .

		I do not wish to be understood that there should be any attempt at dictation on the part of governing boards .

		No teacher worthy the name would tolerate that .

		But I insist that teachers of whatever experience should not `` be practically unassailable , '' and should not '' be absolutely free to do their own work in their own way . ''

		In other words , I hold that teachers , like all the rest of the great army of the employed , should be al - ways accountable to some authority or power greater than they , yet freely granting to them the largest lati - tude and freedom in matters of detail and routine .

		I hold that in matters in which the
State	ORGANIZATION	is concerned ,
the State	ORGANIZATION	, through its appropriate officers , ought to be , as a matter of right , consulted .

		So in the sense here indicated there should be a supervisory power and con - trol somewhere , not to interfere with '' untrammelled research and the unbiased pursuit of truth , '' but to make impossible the instruction and advocacy of the wild and untried theories , systems , and notions of mere partisans , whose erudition is not above suspicion .

		We want the fullest freedom of teaching .

		But let that teaching be always subject to the scrutiny of the power which em - ploys it , not for the purpose of unreasonably placing ; the brakes on intellectual progress , not to hamper meth - ods of teaching , not to prevent the right of personal in - vestigation of any question , but because there should be accountability to some authority .

		I feel certain that in this position I am sustained by many members of the teaching profession .

		Such interference , we contended , would only be justified by an '' offense of the grossest sort . ''

SUNBEAM	ORGANIZATION	FROM THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY .

		*
M. Paul Sabatier	PERSON	's Life of St.
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	'' is not an easy volume to review .

		The author confesses that it was hard to write .

		The translator would perhaps acknowledge that it was hard to put into English .

		If Gallic measure and precision seemed unsuited to the expression of expansive Italian emotion , perhaps certain delicate shades of French sentiment were difficult to transfer into their English equivalents .

		Some question of rival editions is said to have hurried the translator 's pace and allowed small opportunity of revis - ion .

		We have not the original at hand , but there must be something wrong on page 445 , where several most legendary authorities are said to '' sin only by excessive critical scru - ples . ''

		The context suggests that for '' sin only '' we should read '' hardly err . ''

		A single such lapse may be forgiven in so long a labor .

		Mrs.
Houghton	PERSON	's English is in the main clear and simple , telling the story without compelling attention to the fact that it is a translation .


M. Sabatier	PERSON	is not a novice in the art of bi - ography .

		His masterly volume upon St.
Paul	PERSON	, a few years since , prepared a welcome in ad - vance for any of its author 's subsequent writ - ing .

		There is a wide gap between the first century and the thirteenth , between the Apos - tle to the Gentiles and the founder of the Fran - ciscans ; but each period and each character unfolds its secrets under one method of labo - rious investigation , sound judgment , and sym - pathetic vision .

		The author looks out of his own eyes and suffers no mists of tradition to befog him .

		Yet he is no iconoclast .

		He rev - erences the essential humanity of his heroes .

		They may be shadowed by the hood of the monk or transfigured by the halo of saint or apostle , but they are still men , to be helped down from their pedestals and restored to life and motion .

		It is not strange if they seem cramped at first , and if they limp a little .


M. Sabatier	PERSON	is less clear and logical in his narrative than we could desire .

		It is not always easy to see how far he is leading us .

		Perhaps his position makes him cautious and induces him partially to veil his results .

		ing among mediaeval chronicles , he has blunted the edge of his French instinct for form and order , or perhaps he has approximated too closely to the nature of his subject .

		St.
Francis	PERSON	was a great heart rather than a logical intelli - gence .

		He had the '' vision '' rather than the '' faculty '' divine .

		Shall we say that his bi - ographer seems rather to feel him than pre - cisely to comprehend or clearly interpret him ?

		After all ,
M. Sabatier	PERSON	can not be expected to be altogether of the
thirteenth century	DATE	.

		His book attracts and vexes you .

		You love the writer and are out of patience with him through alternate pages and paragraphs .

		He inserts a parenthetic moral or rhapsody in the midst of a dispassionate examination of contemporary authorities .

		You are not in the mood for it and resent the abrupt transition .


M. Sabatier	PERSON	has critically dealt with his am - ple materials .

		He tells us that few lives in history are so abundantly provided with docu - ments as that of St.
Francis	PERSON	.

		They consist of his well authenticated writings ; of contempo - rary or early memoirs ; of numerous papers of Cardinal
Ugolini	PERSON	-LRB- afterwards Gregory IX . -RRB-

		, the man who , '' without perhaps excepting St.
Francis	PERSON	, most profoundly fashioned the Fran - ciscan institutions '' ; of pontifical bulls relating to the order during the critical years of its in - fancy ; of chronicles penned by its first asso - ciates , including that volume of fairy tales , the
Fioretti	PERSON	, in which we behold things not as they were but as they seemed to that imaginative and childlike generation ; and of other records by those not connected with the order , but brought within the range of its founder 's magic influence , writings which still '' vibrate with enthusiasm , '' while often '' absolutely fantastic '' as to the details which they relate .

		The first life of St.
Francis	PERSON	, by
Thomas of Celano	PERSON	, is a party pamphlet , to be entitled '' The Legend of Gregory IX . ''

		It was written soon after the death of its subject , in the midst of an eager struggle between those members of the Franciscan order who wanted only what St.
Francis	PERSON	had wanted , and those who were bent on remoulding his work into closer har - mony with the ecclesiasticism of the period .

		At least five years before his death the
Papacy	LOCATION	had prevailed ; the laic and popular elements of the work had been suppressed ;
Francis	PERSON	had been gently set aside from any practical con - trol of affairs , and transfigured into a remote glory as saint and founder .

		Twenty years later
Thomas of Celano	PERSON	, becoming better in - formed of the meaning of the struggle , wrote
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 a revised and corrected biography , in which , however , the strife of factions still occupies the foreground , '' history becomes the vehicle of a thesis , and instead of a poem we have a cleverly constructed catalogue . ''

		The memoir of the '' Three Companions , '' the near associates of the founder through the formative period of the order , is very precious , and though in its present condition but a mu - tilated fragment , is still '' the finest piece of Franciscan literature . ''

		The legends of the
Fioretti	PERSON	convey the spirit of the saint , and '' while charming as literature , are not value - less as history . ''

		You smile at the incidents and inhale with gratitude the atmosphere .

		Such things never happened , perchance , yet the coloring is vivid and true .

		Better than any cool daylight is the light that never was on sea or land .

		It was in
1260	DATE	, a generation after the death of St.
Francis	PERSON	, that
St. Bonaventura	LOCATION	, in the supposed interest of his order , prepared a new biography .

		It was voluminous but lifeless , a compilation with a purpose , meant to steer a safe middle course between '' the Scylla of Yes and the Charybdis of No , '' and so satisfy at once the Zealots of the old Rule and the Liberal Constructionists who had explained it away into something quite different from the intention of St.
Francis	PERSON	.

		This biography was declared the one authorized version , and all other lives were ordered to be destroyed as unofficial and conflicting .

		From these varied sources , with many sidelights from other quar - ters ,
M. Sabatier	PERSON	has constructed his picture .

		It is a portrait by an impressionist of a winning and simple and wise-hearted lover of mankind .

		That was his distinction .

		The hero of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's tragedy of ''
John Woodvil	PERSON	'' describes himself as '' in some sort a general lover . ''

		Being asked to specify '' What is it you love '' ?

		he answers '' Simply all things that live , From the crook 'd worm to man 's imperial form And God-resembling likeness .

		The poor fly That makes short holiday in the sun-beam And dies by some child 's hand .

		The feeble bird , With little wings , yet greatly venturous In the upper sky .

		The fish in the other element That knows no touch of eloquence . ''

		That was St.
Francis	PERSON	.

		He loved simply all things that live .

		They were his brothers , his sisters , from the insects , the birds , the fishes , to the wolf of the Appenines or the hardly less predatory inhabitant of the Umbrian plain .

		Nay , to him sun , moon , and stars were of the one great family , and He that made them was loved no less simply and naturally than they .

		And just here the life of
Francis	PERSON	becomes ob - scure , and to men of colder frame and less child - like spirit , scarcely intelligible .

		What gush - ing nonsense all that talk about his brother , the sun those sermons to the birds and the fishes , the rabbits and the wolves !

		It is com - paratively easy to guess at the processes of a large intellect , but who can trace and measure the pulse-beats of a great throbbing heart ?

		Even in his lifetime those nearest to him mis - conceived and misinterpreted him .

		They were dull as the disciples about our Lord .

		They meant to echo him , but lost the key and changed the tone .

		They refracted his white light even in transmitting and reflecting it .

		He , a spir - itual troubadour , '' God 's juggler , '' gay as a min - strel , soaring and singing as a lark , went , '' in a rapture of love , from cottage to cottage , from castle to castle , preaching absolute poverty , '' absolute freedom from wordly care , nothing for self , everything for others ; and the sweet dar - ing strain charmed the ear and touched the soul , but perplexed the timid judgment . ''

		That buoyant enthusiasm , that boundless idealism , could not last . ''

		The order was open to every - one ; and everyone , after the manner of men , fashioned it in his own likeness and wore his rue with a difference .

		For the unsystematic mind of St.
Francis	PERSON	had been averse to any elaborate organization .

		He , and those drawn to him in spirit , undertook the simplest follow - ing of Jesus , the reproduction of that holy life under the changed conditions of their time .

		It was a monastic age , and the pallor of the clois - ter touched even the healthiest cheek .

		It was an ascetic age , and it was hard to escape its influence and not despise and maltreat the body in the interest of the soul .

		It was an eccle - siastical age , and it was hard to see that the laity were indeed the Church , and the clergy but its working officials .

		It was a dogmatic age , and men lived under a pressure of author - ity that cramped all independent thinking .

		But in spite of his time , not by virtue of an extra - ordinary intellect but of a great heart , hardly conscious of his departure from the mood of his period ,
Francis	PERSON	went out for himself into a large liberty , and sought to enfranchise others .

		His Rule was little more than a brief extract from the words of Jesus in the
Gospels	LOCATION	.

		Catch that spirit , he seemed to say , and all the rest will follow .

		It was enough indeed for him , and for those who stood nearest him .

		But pres - ently the dense environment encroached upon this first childlike simplicity .

		The mood and fashion of the age stole over it .

		The little un - 152 THE DIAL worldly group of brothers were speedily com - pacted into a drilled group of mendicants .

		The Rule , which the worn saint with his dying breath conjured the brethren never to change by gloss or comment , soon was authoritatively interpreted into more definite conclusions , and subtly explained away , with wire-drawn dis - tinctions between the founder 's counsels and his commands , '' until poverty , as St.
Francis	PERSON	understood it , became a memory . ''

		Men '' for - got the freshness , the Italian gayety , the sunny poetry '' of his conception .

		Admiring , rever - ing , canonizing him , they thought to give body and force to his somewhat vague and ineffect - ive dreams .

		They magnified and distorted the image of their saint .

		They lost sight of what he was , and praised him for what he was not and never sought to be .

		They made dull prose out of all his poetry .

		The institution grew as the impulse which originated it dwindled .

		There was a new order in the
Roman Church	ORGANIZATION	, a new saint on the Roman Calendar ; but the fine dream of St.
Francis	PERSON	had been dissipated .

		It had fled to the limbo of dreams that were dreamed too soon , of fond ideals of which the world was still unworthy .

		Meanwhile , the peo - ple , with their unsophisticated hearts , cherished the memory of the dreamer , loved this '' gen - eral lover , '' and so came dimly to know him , to love and know him as the chiefs of his order never loved or knew .

		The popular imagina - tion of
Italy	LOCATION	retains his image , while grave his - torians , biased by preconceptions , unfamiliar with childlike genius touched with heavenly radiance , have fumbled over their records and missed the meaning of such gracious , guileless sainthood .


M. Sabatier	PERSON	, by sheer sympathy of spirit , has caught the clue , and put it into his reader 's hands .

		If its windings seem some - times obscure and labyrinthine , it is yet well worth their following .

		For character of this large-hearted sort is rare .

		The pilgrims that are minstrels , the saints that can laugh and sing , the indiscriminate lovers of God and man and every living thing in earth and heaven , are a scant company a precious possession of the race , not to be forgotten through the ages .

		The mitred bishops and the hooded doctors pass , and the dust settles upon their footprints .

		But Love , the buoyant , wayward , blundering child , goes singing on his way , and is immor - tal .

		St.
Francis	PERSON	, in an age '' when men had all the vices except triviality and all the virtues save moderation , '' when Nature was a realm of magic , and all imaginations were peopled with visions of heaven and hell , was '' not born with nimbus and aureole . ''

		He could say with the chief Captain , '' With a great sum obtained I this freedom . ''

		At his own grave cost he en - tered upon his mission .

		He was a man of the people , yet at home with the privileged classes .

		He was loyal to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, which he persisted in beholding in its evangelical ideal , while im - patient with the actual faltering reality .

		He was a poet-prophet , no mere founder of an or - der .

		He claimed from the Papacy the privi - lege of owning nothing , which proved to be more than the
Roman Curia	ORGANIZATION	could grant .

		The poverty he sought and sang was not a disabil - ity but a power , the bird 's careless freedom on its bough , the flower 's fragrant joy in the sunshine .

		The religion of the time could con - ceive of no such glad liberty .

		Such , however , was the unripeness of the time that his work was wrested from his hands and warped from his purpose .

		He proceeded far enough to learn something of the amount of labor involved in such a work , and thus to appreciate the ex - tent of this labor when performed by another .

		THE DIAL 153 Mr.
J. N. Larned	PERSON	's '' History for Ready Ref - erence and Topical Reading '' is sufficient to discover that they represent years of patient labor and exhaustive study .

		That Mr.
Lamed	PERSON	is President of the
American Library Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion and Superintendent of the
Buffalo Public Library	ORGANIZATION	implies that he has had unsurpassed facilities for carrying out to a satisfactory con - clusion his conception of a cyclopedia and index of history .

		The work is not a mere dic - tionary of dates .

		It recognizes history as em - bracing far more than chronology or narratives of events .

		In its preparation the entire field of historical literature has been laid under con - tribution .

		The articles are composed of ex - tracts from recognized historical experts , to whom due credit is given .

		References are freely given by which the study of the various topics can be still further extended .

		Abund - ant opportunity is found to judge of the edit - or 's discriminating judgment and critical skill in an examination of the following important articles in the first two volumes , ranging from twenty to two hundred pages in length : Amer - ica ; American Aborigines ;
Athens	LOCATION	;
Austria	LOCATION	; Balkan and Danubian States ;
Barbary States	LOCATION	;
Canada	LOCATION	;
China	LOCATION	; Christianity -LRB- down to the tenth century -RRB- ; Education ;
Egypt	LOCATION	;
England	LOCATION	;
Florence	LOCATION	;
France	LOCATION	; and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The editor 's only original contribution to either of these vol - umes is a historical review of
Europe	LOCATION	, covering seventy-four pages .

		This is sufficient , how - ever , to illustrate his ability to handle lucidly a complex subject .

		It is difficult to give in brief space a clear idea of the comprehensiveness of the work .

		But it is partially indicated by the fact that , the above-named important papers being set aside , each volume contains about eight hundred sub - jects fully treated , though in length varying from a single paragraph to several pages ; and about twenty-four hundred titles introduced as cross references .

		Biographical and geograph - ical names are thus treated .

		The wide scope of the work is further indicated by its treat - ment of such subjects as Education -LRB- an im - portant review of the history of education brought down to include the
University Ex	ORGANIZATION	- tension movement -RRB- ,
Electrical Discovery	ORGANIZATION	, Fac - tory Legislation , Debt Legislation , and
Civil Service Reform	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	; by its giving , in extenso , the constitutions of thir - teen existing nations , as well as cross references to at least ten others ; and by explaining many terms of historical significance -LRB- e.g. '' Bossism , '' ''
Sherman	PERSON	's Bummers , '' '' Contraband , '' and '' Creole '' -RRB- , for whose origin and meaning fu - ture generations will undoubtedly inquire .

		Ap - parently the editor is more willing to incur the fault of including too much than too little .

		The two volumes now ready are to be fol - lowed by three others at intervals of about three months .

		The paging is continuous throughout the volumes .

		The work has reached page 1564 .

		The maps , supplied by
Alan C. Reiley	PERSON	, are new and valuable .

		RECENT STUDIES IN SOCIOLOGY .

		* The table of contents of the '' Introduction to the Study of Society , '' by Professors Small and
Vin	PERSON	- cent , is , to a student of sociology , a most appetiz - ing menu .

		Here we find discussed , in pure and strong English , the origin and scope of sociology , the natural history of society , social anatomy , phy - siology , pathology , and psychology .

		By Descriptive Sociology the authors mean '' the organization of all the positive knowledge of man and of society fur - nished by the sciences and sub-sciences now desig - nated or included under the titles Biology , Anthropol - ogy , Psychology , Ethnology , Demography ,
History	ORGANIZATION	, Political and
Economic Science	ORGANIZATION	, and Ethics . ''

		By
Statical Sociology	ORGANIZATION	is meant '' a qualitative and ap - proximate account of the society which ought to be .

		Social Statics is , in brief , social ethics . ''

		It is de - clared that a distinction should be made , in the interest of clearness of thought and of practical efficiency , between
Statical and Dynamic Sociology	ORGANIZATION	.

		This last '' proceeds to investigate means of employ - ing all the available forces of society in the interest of the largest human welfare . ''

		The present vol - ume does not attempt to go beyond Descriptive So - ciology .

		It is a '' laboratory guide '' for sociological observation and investigation .

		154 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, of facts to each other .

		The reading of Book One will require the closest attention of trained students .

		In Book Two , '' The Natural History of a Society , '' we have an account of the growth of a city from the time a single settler took his homestead on the prairie , through the stages of village and town and the transition stage , to the hour when a highly com - plex commercial centre conies into existence .

		Every statement is illustrated by concrete examples .

		The effort is made to hold attention to social reality , just as in a physical or biological laboratory the teacher seeks to keep the student 's eyes fastened upon the matter of investigation .

		In the later Books the au - thors return to exposition of social doctrine .

		With - out slavish imitation of
Schaffle	LOCATION	, we have here the essential elements of his exposition for the first time in intelligible English ; but there is original treat - ment with local illustrations .

		In this work we have the pioneer text-book for college classes and begin - ners in sociology .

		It does not claim to offer con - tributions to the science , and yet so clear an expo - sition of so complicated a subject may legitimately be regarded as an actual addition to the discussion .

		The chapter on the scope of sociology will provoke a debate which will promote the settlement of the vexed question of the place of sociology in the cir - cle of the sciences and in a course of study .

		The romance of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, '' A Traveler from Altruria , '' belongs in the same general category with Plato 's '' Republic , '' More 's `` Utopia , ''
Campanella	PERSON	's '' City of the Sun , '' and
Bellamy	PERSON	's '' Looking Back - ward . ''

		Every man creates for himself a picture of a future perfect society in his imagination , but once in many years some poetic mind embodies the vision in a description .

		No harm is done , so long as the dream is not seriously regarded as a working programme to be carried out in details .

		Fortunately these visions are contradictory , and one illusion cor - rects another .

		This prophetic spirit , hovering over those who toil along the dusty way of pain-bought progress , cheers the pilgrims and keeps up heart - courage for the journey and the strife .

		This seems to be the social function of those who write novels and romances .

		The humiliating contrast between our own ideals and conduct awakens the conscience and sets us upon immediate correction of obvious evils .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's Altrurian traveller leaves us angry at his rebukes , but reflecting on our deeds .

		Not in vain has he visited this green earth ; not in cruelty and wrath has he rudely shocked our apathetic complacency .

		In Mr.
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	's '' Social Evolution '' we have a work whose popular form , earnest spirit , and bristling paradox insure a wide reading .

		Buckle taught that the intellectual factor is dominant in social progress , and that morality is stationary .

		Draper represented that religion , as embodied in the Church , was the foe of advance .

		Marx and many other socialists look to materiah ` stic and economic interests for their revolutionary forces .

		Here is a writer who regards the intellectual factor as a sub - ordinate element , religion as the mainspring .

		But the teachers of religion must beware of the Greeks who bring such gifts , for religion is not '' rational , '' it is distinctly `` irrational . ''

		The doctrine is so startling that it must be stated in the author 's own words -LRB- pp. 185-186 -RRB- : '' The most essential conclusions to which we have been led ... are as follows .

		First , that the process of social development which has been taking place , and which is still in progress in our Western civilization , is not the product of the intellect , but that the motive force behind it has had its seat and origin in that fund of al - truistic feeling with which our civilization has become equipped .

		Second , that this altruistic development , and the deepening and softening of character which has ac - companied it , are the direct and peculiar product of the religious system on which our civilization is founded .

		Third , that to science the significance of the resulting process of social evolution , in which all the people are being slowly brought into the rivalry of existence on equal conditions , consists in the single fact that this rivalry has tended to be thereby raised to the highest degree of efficiency as a cause of progress it has ever attained .

		The peoples affected by the process have been thereby worked up to a state of social efficiency which has given them preponderating advantages in the strug - gle for existence with other sections of the race ... The intellect continues to be a most important factor in enabling the system to which the individual belongs to maintain its place in the rivalry of life ; but it is no longer the prime factor . ''

		These positions will not be read without strong protests .

		The author emphasizes the radical and inevitable conflict between social and individual interests .

		But the other side of social progress is slightly treated : the increase in numbers and sat - isfactions in society as it exists ; the improved con - dition even of paupers and criminals ; and the fact that all this advance is due to that social order which gives security to the weak .

		It is not altogether '' irrational '' for the strong and rich to serve the commonwealth , since in its prosperity alone they are prosperous .

		And as for the weakest members of society , they owe existence itself to this progress .

		Other questions naturally arise .

		Will society con - tinue to obey an '' irrational '' impulse ?

		If the sanction of an order can not be found in human life itself , whence can it originate ?

		Is it a wise use of language to call that alone '' rational '' conduct which secures the immediate individual satisfaction ?

		Was the death of Socrates '' irrational '' ?

		Was the hero - ism of those who fell at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	insane ?

		Can there be a permanent conflict between reason and conscience , intellect and altruism ?

		Many such prob - lems and paradoxes will present themselves to the reader of this interesting and suggestive book .

		Mr.
Charles Booth	PERSON	gives the world another mon - umental study of the depressed classes , in a work entitled '' The Aged Poor in
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	. ''

		The object of this book is '' to make more possible and profitable a study of the six hundred and forty - eight separate lessons in administration which the conduct of the
Poor Law Unions of England	ORGANIZATION	and
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 155 Wales affords . ''

		We have here something more than a careful and complete description of facts .

		The method of collecting the material is very instructive .

		The causal relations between the facts of depend - ence in old age and the domestic , economic , educa - tional and ecclesiastical conditions are distinctly brought out .

		The various results of the diverse methods of administration are disclosed and tabu - lated .

		The book is more than a political study , more than an economic study ; it is a social study .

		The entire social system , so far as it bears on the prob - lem of the aged poor , is analyzed , and its working explained by reference to fundamental and univer - sal social forces .

		It is a truly sociological method , fruitful and comprehensive .

		Mr.
Booth	PERSON	is a busi - ness man who has the outlook of the man of science .

		He gives means and time to the pursuit of social inquiries .

		We stand in need of such men in this country .

		If our
National Conference of Charities	ORGANIZATION	and Corrections could secure the services of such a man its lame and imperfect inquiries into the facts of out-door relief could in a few years be set for - ward to satisfactory condition .

		A few illustrations of results may be set down .

		Taking a census of a single day in
1892	DATE	: '' While only 5 per cent , of the population are paupers , taking all ages together , and not half of that proportion taking the active years of life alone , the rate is about 10 per cent , between 60 and 65 , 20 per cent , between 65 and 70 , 30 per cent , between 70 and 75 , and not much less than
40 per cent	MONEY	, over 75 . ''

		These figures would be confirmed by the similar inquiry of Dr.
Victor Bohmert	PERSON	in seventy-seven Ger - man cities .

		To see the full force of such statistics we must separate the < k working classes '' from others , and then we find that amongst these and small traders `` the rate of pauperism for all over 65 is not less than 40 to
45 per cent	MONEY	. ''

		That means that nearly half the working people of
England	LOCATION	must look forward to public support if they reach old age .

		It is such facts as these which demand some better method of providing for the last years of life than any hitherto discovered .

		Professor Giddings , whose transfer to the chair of Sociology in
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	marks distinct progress in the new study , gives us , in his work on `` The Theory of Sociology , '' a brief sketch of `` the theoretical positions that will be more fully described and defended in a work on the Principles of Sociol - ogy , which is now well advanced towards comple - tion . ''

		This treatise , which embodies the substance of previous publications , discusses the sociological idea , the promise , problems , and method of sociology .

		It is of exceeding interest to all students who are seeking to define the field of sociological investiga - tion .

		In '' Random Roamings , '' by the Rev.
Augustus Jessopp	PERSON	, we have the leisurely description of a culti - vated Anglican clergyman who finds time to inves - tigate the archaeology , history , and contemporary conditions of rural
England	LOCATION	.

		The aristocratic clergy - man 's point of view is by no means concealed in the chapters on `` A Scheme for Clergy Pensions '' and '' Something about Village Almshouses . ''

		He feels like patronizing the poor , and is not sanguine about free schools . ''

		The English Peasant , '' by Mr.
Richard Heath	PERSON	, is a book of a different kind , written by a man with the descriptive powers of an artist and the sympa - thies of a modern layman , deeply religious but not sectarian .

		The author has travelled on foot over much of
England	LOCATION	, and delivers the testimony of an eye-witness .

		He can appreciate the value of free schools , of agricultural trades-unions , of voluntary efforts of church and chapel , of kindly patronage of rich squires , and of the narrow and fanatical , but morally earnest , denominational preachers .

		The able Secretary of the English Labor Com - mission gives the public in a volume of 277 pages a complete survey of contemporary schemes , Brit - ish and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	, for caring for the unemployed .

		The services of trades unions , labor bureaus , news - papers , labor colonies , municipal agencies , and many associations , are here described and their relative values weighed .

		The book should be read by those who will this winter have to face the problems of want in our cities .

		Professor
John R. Commons	PERSON	has collected several papers on the relation of the church to social re - forms into a neat volume , which he entitles '' Social Reform and the Church . ''

		He urges that the mighty emotional forces of religion should be utilized for the amelioration of human life on this planet .


Pau	LOCATION	- perism , politics , temperance movements , municipal monopolies , and proportional representation are dis - cussed from this standpoint .

		The '' Handbook of Sociological Information '' prepared by the
City Vigilance League of New York	ORGANIZATION	will furnish a convenient list of books and articles , and accounts of typical beneficent institutions in the metropolis .

		In preparing the bibliography , the edit - ors have sought the assistance of specialists in many lines of investigation and experience .

		It is not in - tended to be a complete bibliography , but a selected list for immediate use of busy social leaders .

		The works here noticed are typical of the various methods by which the study of society is to be ad - vanced .

		We need the broad study of fundamental principles revealed in historical investigation , the minute study of contemporary facts in a limited field , and even the inspiring ideals of romance .

		It is important to determine the limits of each special social science , and the theory of the relation of science to art .

		It is also essential to progress that all the conscious and unconscious experiments of so - ciety be investigated and their results revealed .

		This investigation may yield a fragmentary product and yet be conducted by a scientific method .

		It is some - times objected to sociology that its ability to direct social action falls far short of completeness .

		But this is true of each special social science , even of 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, those whose simple character made an earlier de - velopment possible .

		Sociological literature shows the effort to consider all the facts of all classes , an attempt at coordination of all factors in thought and in practical action .

		Most of the works here exam - ined are '' sociological '' only so far as they supply fragments of raw material for scientific treatment .

		EXTREMES OF FAITH .

		* Mr.
Knox Little	PERSON	's treatise on Sacerdotalism is a book chiefly fitted to interest those in the Church of
England	LOCATION	who are striving to maintain and re - store its current beliefs and usages , and those who would subject them to the modification of advanc - ing thought .

		The controversy lies in a single Church between a conservative and a radical or reformatory tendency .

		The interest of the book , outside of this narrow relation , is in leading the liberal mind to a more cheerful recognition of the great variety of ways in which a true spiritual development is open to men .

		The book is very positive and exact in its belief , and yet one feels that this force of assertion and precision of method simply express the idiosyn - crasies of a certain class of minds idiosyncrasies which we do well to respect , and well to disregard .

		The author is a warm advocate of sacerdotalism .

		`` I , my dear friend , as you know , am a sacerdotalist from head to heel .

		It is difficult for me to under - stand how a Christian can be anything else '' -LRB- page 2 -RRB- .

		Some of the points included in sacerdotalism are given in the preface : '' There are objective truths which must never be forgotten the fact of the vis - ible church , the truth of a spiritual succession of the ministry , the necessary office of bishops , the real functions of the priesthood , the effectual force of sacraments , the practical value of the penitential system '' -LRB- p. x. -RRB- .

		The book is made up of four let - ters on Confession and Absolution ; Fasting , Com - munion and Eucharistic Worship ; the Real Pres - ence and the Eucharistic Sacrifice ; the
Apostolic Ministry	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the volume is drawn out by the pres - ence in the Church of
England	LOCATION	of a strong tendency to regard these beliefs as outworn , it is necessarily controversial .

		This contention is but a small por - tion of that universal conflict which lies between the * SACERDOTALISM .

		old and the new .

		The more coherent and consist - ent temper may be found with those who maintain the old , but the more profoundly penetrative and constructive thought is with those who see and seek the new .

		The reader will find in the volume an earnest and comparatively compact statement of the attitude of those who cling to the old , walk in it , and live by it .

		The defense is essentially that of the more conservative branch of the Tractarians , that the Thirty-nine Articles are directed against the abuses , not the uses , of the earlier forms of belief .

		There is a very striking contrast between the attitude of mind indicated in this volume , and that which gave rise to the one on '' The Meaning and the Method of Life . ''

		The author of ''
Sacerdotal	PERSON	- ism '' adheres tenaciously many would say ser - vilely to the positions in faith which have long been held .

		The author of `` The Meaning and Method of Life '' goes forth quite by himself , and in a path in which very few are likely to follow him .

		A discrepancy so wide as this seems to re - flect discredit on human faculties .

		Reason is not nearly so dominant oftentimes least dominant , when thought to be most dominant in the action of mind as the forms of discussion seem to imply .

		We fling and catch the ball in groups , but each group has its own ball and its own game .

		`` The Meaning and the Method of Life '' is a book not easily read , nor will it reward most minds for the labor .

		The author regards matter as eternal and of infinite extension .

		It makes no revelation of any supreme intelligence .

		Life , personified as a single energetic and intelligent agent , is in contention with these physical conditions , and slowly subjects them to itself .

		This often baffled but steadily conquer - ing intelligence is God , whose struggles and vic - tories we share . ''

		The God we see daily at work all over the globe is primarily and essentially Life '' -LRB- p. 15 -RRB- .

		The difficulties and ills and blessings of the world lie along the pathway of this slow evolu - tion of life .

		Here is found the promise of victory .

		These ideas are capable in their treatment of much poetry and pathos , and these the author liberally bestows on them .

		His convictions are as positive as if half the human race stood by his side .

		Many of the principles by whose aid he so boldly inter - prets the world are sound , but he grades the facts to them rather than ascends and descends by means of them , and winds in and out in fellowship with the infinitely variable things about him .

		The third volume in our list , '' The Question of Unity , '' is made up of an expression of opinion by leading men , chiefly in the Presbyterian ,
Congre	ORGANIZATION	- gational , Episcopal , and Baptist churches , concern - ing
Christian Unity	ORGANIZATION	.

		These opinions were called out by a paper of Dr.
Shield	PERSON	on the Historic Epis - copate a discussion of a possible unity of churches on the basis of the Chicago-Lambeth Articles .

		The writers agree quite generally , both as to the great desirability , and also as to the present impossibility , of
Church Unity	ORGANIZATION	.

		The trouble would seem to be
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 that the notion of
Church Unity	ORGANIZATION	, secured on the basis of a creed narrowed and sifted in its terms , is embarrassed by precisely the same difficulty which has given rise to existing divisions to-wit , attach - ing too much relative importance to the intellectual formulae of faith .

		A unity restored by a new form - ula , a unity resting on a formula , is of very secondary moment .

		The intellectual discussions and dissen - sions of the past have played a part in the devel - opment of Christian thought .

		They can not be wiped out .

		Farther consideration is as likely to extend and deepen divisions as to efface them .

		The evil does not lie in these discrepancies of thought , but in the false position given to them .

		Unity is before the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, not behind it .

		It is to be found in its action , in the objects it pursues , and not in its speculations .

		Of the papers in this volume , Dr.
Ecob	PERSON	's seems to us the most faithful and just .

		He discards a unity of creeds , and counsels a unity of effort .

		Those who urge a formal unity in faith , will find that they are simply reviving old conflicts ; blowing the ashes off the burning embers .

		Our fourth volume is '' An Historical Sketch of the Unitarian Movement . ''

		Unitarianism stands , and has stood from its origin , quite as much for a movement as for a faith .

		It has not so much ex - pressed a new type of faith , of belief , as a disposi - tion to secure a new liberty changeable and per - sonal terms in belief .

		It has at no time been able to restrain its own movement , and settle down in firm outlines of faith .

		Many would regard this in - capacity to say anything final , as its weakness ; others , more justly , would accept it as its chief ex - cellence .

		This characteristic of free movement gives to its history wide affiliations and a less definite outline .

		The work before us is a comprehensive and concise tracing of that movement of which mod - ern Unitarianism is the most distinct expression .

		Wherever the correction of reason begins to find its way freely in Christian faith , elements allied to Unitarianism make their appearance .

		The history is thoroughly interesting , and the more so in its later portions as dealing with events with which the author has been personally familiar .

		It will give pleasure and instruction to all who look on this gain of thoughtfulness in religion as truly regenerative . ''

		The Apostolic Age '' is the product of liberal , earnest , thoughtful scholarship .

		After a brief dis - cussion of the Resurrection and the first collective action of the Church , it dwells chiefly on the Apos - tle
Paul	PERSON	, his calling , his theology , and the churches founded by him .

		As the work emanates from a very independent and therefore self-confident mind , it needs to be read with something like the same breadth of view and freedom of interpretation .

		Studied in this temper , it is well fitted to give clear - ness , accuracy , and mastery to our apprehension of the apostolic age .

		As we cease to accept an author - itative and conventional rendering of the Biblical narrative whose wise study must give us almost exclusively our knowledge of the facts in the early history of the Church we must put in its place the mutual correction of many considerations , and the reciprocal outlook of diverse minds .

		If we fail of this , we shall find ourselves substituting for the somewhat blind consensus of the Church the impres - sions which happen to have come uppermost in a single person .

		The volume is not so much argu - mentative as presentative , and is liable , in its posi - tive and confident movement , which has the advan - tage of directness and simplicity , to sweep along unduly those of less scope of knowledge .

		As a thoughtful book , it calls for a thoughtful handling .

		The style is somewhat obscure .

		The author of '' The Natural History of the
Chris	PERSON	- tion Religion '' expresses his purpose and method very distinctly : '' In few words , let it here be said , summarily , that the negative or < destructive ' criticism which we propose to direct against orthodox
Christianity	ORGANIZATION	is based on the anti- supernatural view of the divine government , and that our positive but undogmatic construction of
Christianity	ORGANIZATION	is based on the teaching of Jesus .

		In this section , we shall seek to define and to defend the anti-supernatural view , and to draw the inferences in regard to dogma which seem to flow from it .

		In several of the follow - ing sections we shall seek to show that the doctrine of Jesus is the doctrine of the absolute religion , or of that form of religion which answers to the religious idea ; and , also , that the path by which
Jesus	PERSON	was led to his great discovery was by the way of historical de - velopment .

		In the remaining sections , we shall en - deavor to trace the steps by which the dogma in its ca - nonical form grew up out of the doctrine and the life of Jesus '' -LRB- p. 19 -RRB- .

		This purpose is pursued very fully .

		There is noth - ing to object either to the intention or spirit of the work .

		The labor is undertaken in behalf of truth as the author conceives it , and is carried forward in an earnest , and also , so far as the conditions of the effort will allow , in a constructive temper .

		It is by no means made up of simply destructive criticism .

		Those who share the author 's disbelief in the super - natural will be likely to find in the book much that will strengthen them .

		It proceeds on the ground , not only that miracles do not , but that they can not , happen .

		It is sustained throughout by the assump - tion that the instruction of science is complete and final on this point .

		So strong an a priori position h priori in reference to most of the grounds and proofs of faith must necessarily close the mind to the considerations which sustain the supernatural .

		If science , with explicit proof , precludes the super - natural , there is an end .

		There is much antecedent work which needs to be well done before this book can fairly enter on its undertaking .

		We need to know what we mean by science , the breadth of the ground covered by it , the nature and force of its affirmations touching the natural and supernatural .

		We need to know exactly what we mean by the su - pernatural , and the relation of the miracle to it .

		The connection of the miracle , in the form in which we either accept it or reject it , with the physical and spiritual mechanism of the world , must also be dis - 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, tinctly put .

		If we assume it to be an arbitrary ab-extra act , we have thrown it out in advance .

		What we mean by philosophy as contrasted with science , and what it has to say as to the ultimate terms of the universe , must also be present with us .

		These inquiries , which are preliminary to most of what the author has written , will , we believe , en - tirely turn his position , and leave it untenable .

		A strictly and exclusively natural world is unmanage - able to thought .

		Reason , in its own supernatural relations , must be saved in order that the world , as a product of thought , may remain to us .

		Fatalism is a gulf in which all things finally go down .

		Ideas involved in the above points are treated briefly in the second chapter .

		As they are , however , so fun - damental as to determine the value of most that is to follow , they demand a much more searching pre - sentation .

		The governing power of the universe must so it seems to us be at once natural and supernatural .

		The two elements must hold each other in equal , even , constant interpoise .

		The au - thor destroys the truly greater notion by swinging the world forcefully over to the side of physical law ; as if the physical world could stand by itself , or hold in itself its own tendencies .

		The author 's contention is chiefly successful as directed against a crass notion of the supernatural .

		The work is able , candid , and instructive ; one that calls out much assent and dissent .

		These books collectively indicate how wide are the yet unexplored fields of spiritual thought , and the very diverse conclusions , therefore , which must still crown our quests .

		We are very slow to accept our wealth as wealth , and tear it into fragments in our analysis of it .

		JoHN BASCOM > BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Macpherson While the Ossian problem has proved and the Ossianic much knottier than the
Rowley	PERSON	prob - lem , competent critics , on both sides of the Tay , have pretty generally put down '' Os - sian ''
Macpherson	PERSON	as an impostor .

		Some of them , zealous for the honor of literature , have even re - gretted that Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's oak twig , '' six feet long , with a knob as big as an orange , '' was not put to its intended use .

		The case , however , is admittedly one in which there is still , to quote
Sancho Panza	PERSON	, '' a great deal to be said on both sides . ''

		We do not ourselves believe that
Macpherson	PERSON	was all impostor , and that his work was , as his harsher critics allege , a mere patchwork of plagiarisms and forgeries .

		The first Ossianic fragments , the ones shown by
Macpherson	PERSON	to Douglas '' Home in
1759	DATE	, and pub - lished in
1760	DATE	, were probably actual translations from Gaelic originals of considerable antiquity ; and it was in all likelihood the prodigious and unex - pected vogue of these early pieces , backed by the patriotic importunities of the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	literati , that started the ambitious tutor on his career of de - ception .

		While
Macpherson	PERSON	in his longer poems flagrantly abused the poet 's and the translator 's license , inserting long passages of his own , supply - ing chasms , and omitting and shortening incidents , there can now be little doubt that even these poems have a basis , however frail , of genuineness .

		Later researches notably those of the
Highland Society	ORGANIZATION	's committee in
1805	DATE	, and of Dr.
Waddell	PERSON	in
1875	DATE	tend to show that the '' epic '' -LRB- '' foolishly so called , ' * as Gray properly said -RRB- of '' Fingal '' consists largely of fragments and episodes for which there were au - thentic originals .


Macpherson	PERSON	's ascription , how - ever , of his originals to a Gaelic bard of the third century seems , aside from its antecedent incredibil - ity , fairly thrown out of court by the verdict of the best Gaelic scholars , that the language of Ossian is a modern and mutilated form of Erse that did not exist five hundred years ago .

		Caledonian faith , however , where Caledonian honor is concerned , is strong ; and it may be that there are still , as even Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	admits , '' some persons north of the Tay who indulge the pleasing supposition that Fingal fought and
Ossian	PERSON	sang . ''

		It has remained for Mr.
Bailey Saunders	PERSON	, the author of a comely volume entitled `` The Life and Letters of
James Macpherson	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to give a full biographical account of the translator -LRB- or fabricator , if the reader please -RRB- of the '' misty songs of Ullin , '' and to review the whole controversy in a really critical and liberal spirit .

		The facts of
Macpherson	ORGANIZATION	's life , hitherto vaguely known , really form , or should form , an im - portant factor in the dispute ; for , as Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	justly observes , the question of authenticity largely turns on his actual proceedings , and his personal character and attainments .

		In the present volume , which is in itself an altogether charming piece of biography , the reader will find an exhaustive account of
Macpherson	PERSON	, and of the controversy of which he was the central figure .

		A number of extracts from the Ossianic poems are given , and there is a fine portrait , after
Romney	PERSON	, of
Macpherson	ORGANIZATION	.

		A help to the ^ e ta ^ e pl easure i n calling attention student of to Professor
William Henry Hud	PERSON	-
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		son > s com p ac t Introduction to the Philosophy of Herbert Spencer '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The need of a simplified outline-map of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's complex system has often occurred to us , and Pro- fessor
Hudson	PERSON	is the first , we think , to meet it sat - isfactorily .

		No better book could be placed in the hands of the tyro about to face the difficulties of the
Synthetic Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, nor can we point to one more likely to prevent him turning back disheart - ened before his unsentimental journey is fairly be - gun .

		Professor
Hudson	PERSON	has not attempted an ex - haustive or a critical exposition ; still less does he hold out to the student any illusory hopes that his book is a royal road that does away with the need of a first-hand study of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	himself , or even renders such first-hand study a light and easy task .

		Still , he modestly claims , '' something may be done to smooth the way for untrained and un -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 wary feet , '' and to make the approach to the Syn - thetic Philosophy `` less thorny and toilsome than it would otherwise be . ''

		The beginner may be helped to a general conception of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's ground - idea , and to a knowledge of its genetic history ; and he may be shown its relation to current intellectual tendencies , and its influence upon current practical problems .

		It is fair to say that Professor Hudson , unlike too many expositors , performs rather more than he promises .

		Possessed of a clear and agree - able style , he has succeeded admirably , where feas - ible , in smoothing the asperities , without losing the sense , of the Derby philosopher 's rather alarming phrase and terminology ; and he has added , more - over , a good deal in the way of citation and orig - inal comment and illustration , that will commend his book to more advanced Spencerians .

		Of the lighter citations , it is worth while to note in passing
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's pregnant witticism on the world - famous formula of evolution a point where , in the matter of style at least , Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	may fairly claim to have out-Kanted
Kant	PERSON	himself .

		`` The universe , '' observed Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, '' must have heaved a sigh of relief when this explanation of her pro- cesses was given to an astonished world through the cerebration of a distinguished thinker . ''

		Perhaps Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, like some others , thinks the reduction of the phenomena of the universe to a single dy - namic principle more satisfactory as a proof of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's powers of generalization than as a solu - tion qua solution .

		Professor Hudson discusses in separate chapters ''
Spencer	PERSON	's Earlier Work , '' '' The Synthetic Philosophy , '' `` The Spencerian Sociology '' -LRB- considered chiefly in its logical connection with the general scheme -RRB- , `` The Ethical System , '' and '' The Religious Aspects of the Synthetic Philos - ophy . ''

		A chronological list of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's works is appended , and there is a biographical sketch that should prove specially welcome to American readers .

		Few in their generation have added SSSSl more to '' the world ' s stock of harm - less pleasures '' than those cheery inseparables , Messrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	and
Sullivan	PERSON	; and we are glad to find their lives and performances so well chronicled in Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald	PERSON	's '' The
Gilbert	PERSON	and
Sullivan	PERSON	Operas '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book is not too big , and it gives what most readers will ask of it .

		Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	has collected about every - thing worth knowing of the Savoy operas , authors , and players , and his book is a pretty and acceptable souvenir of the days when `` Patience '' and `` Pin - afore '' were sung , quoted , whistled , and barrel - organed from unique popularity into relative dis - use .

		A separate chapter is given to the history and analysis of each opera , and criticism , musical and dramatic , is duly mingled with quotation and stage gossip and anecdote .

		Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	's abili - ties as a dramatic writer are well known .

		He clearly explains the rationale of the Gilbertian play , and pays a just tribute to the genuine quality of Mr.
Sul	PERSON	- livan 's music really good music in its way , crisp , More numbers of the Book of the Fair .

		spontaneous , wholesome , and seldom savoring of the '' Varieties '' and the Cafe Chantant .

		It is amus - ing to learn that the early bent of the composer of '' Little Buttercup '' was strongly in the direction of oratorio .

		There are many illustrations , most of them portraits of well-known Savoy Thespians in favorite roles . ''

		The Book of the Fair '' -LRB-
Bancroft Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which we have more than once had occasion to commend , is making rapid progress .

		Parts twelve to sixteen , inclusive , are now issued , leaving but nine more to complete the work .

		The first of these five parts concludes the description of the Agricultural , Horticultural , and Forestry exhibits , and starts the chapter on '' Mines , Mining , and Metallurgy . ''

		This subject is con - cluded in the second part , and the Fisheries Build - ing is taken up .

		Some of the plates well illustrate the characteristic and genial decoration of that charming structure .

		In the third of these parts comes the
Transportation Building	ORGANIZATION	, with its loco - motives , palace cars , and other objects of interest .

		A fine plate of the Viking Ship occurs in this con - nection .

		The
Columbus Caravels	ORGANIZATION	, the
U. S. Battle	PERSON	- ship , and the
Moving Sidewalk	ORGANIZATION	also find illustration here .

		The subject of
Transportation	ORGANIZATION	is thus carried through the fourth part and into the fifth , where it finally gives place to `` The Live Stock Department . ''

		Many fine portraits of horses , sheep , and cattle ac - company this chapter .

		Anthropology is next taken up , and there the tale ends for the present .

		The plates that go with these chapters are , we need hardly repeat , exceptionally fine examples of pho - tographic process , and the selection of subjects is admirably judicious and comprehensive .

		We shall await with interest the concluding instalments of this praiseworthy publication .

		The changing seasons , the birds , the flowers , the trees , sea and shore , are themes which never fail to inspire the pen of the true nature-lover .

		A dainty little volume of short papers on such themes , by Miss
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	, comes with the title '' The Friendship of Nature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The writer has a sympathetic eye and touch for every face that nature wears in her
New England	LOCATION	home .

		Begin - ning with '' A
New England May-Day	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' When Orchards Bloom , '' these graceful sketches reflect the changing aspects of the blooming and the wan - ing year , and convince us that the author , though writing prose , is a true poet in the Emersonian sense , namely , in the power to see the miraculous in the common .

		From the same publishers comes another delightful book with nature for a theme , but with considerable of the human interest added , '' The Garden that I Love , '' by Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	.

		Poet , story-teller , and gentle humorist , as Mr.
Austin	PERSON	has frequently shown himself to be , he shines in all three characters in this volume .

		A brother and a sister in an old English country-house , with their guests the '' Poet , '' who recites dainty verses , and 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, '' Lamia , '' a brilliant young woman with a rich con - tralto voice , who sings them are the personages in this setting of '' The Garden , '' where from
May to November	DATE	all is light and bloom and fragrance .

		The charm of the text is increased by the illustra - tions , .

		which are many and choice . ''

		Select Specimens of the Great French Writers in the 17th > 18th > and 19th Centuries , '' edited by
M. G. E. Fasnacht	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is one of the best French reading-books with which we are acquainted .

		It has the great merit of being large enough to pre - sent extracts of considerable length , and to allow the teacher wide latitude in its use .

		The selections are all from the '' Great Writers who tower head and shoulders above their contemporaries . ''

		With each writer appears a selection of '' appreciations '' from the best French critics , and the whole is pre - ceded by a historical sketch of French literature , abridged from MM .

		Vinet and Faguet .

		There are nearly six hundred pages of rather small type .

		A much smaller reading-book , intended for beginners , is Mr.
A. N. Van Daell	PERSON	's '' Introduction to French Authors '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		It includes simple pieces in prose and verse from nineteenth century writers , a resume of French history , based upon a book by
M. Lavisse	PERSON	, and a sketch of the government of the pres - ent Republic .

		There is also a vocabulary , so that the book may be used before the dictionary pur - chasing stage has been reached .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Dr.
John T. Prince	PERSON	is the author of a new system of '' Arithmetic by Grades '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , which is differentiated into a '' Teachers ' Manual '' and eight booklets for the uses of the pupil , corresponding to the accepted grading of lower school work .

		The special features of the sys - tem , besides the above differentiation , are a careful gradation of work , frequent reviews , a great amount and variety of oral work and problems , and the practi - cal character of most of the examples .

		The books for the seventh and eighth grades introduce a small amount of elementary work in algebra and geometry , a partic - ularly praiseworthy feature of the series . ''

		A
Laboratory Manual of Physics and Applied Elec	ORGANIZATION	- tricity , '' edited by Professor
Edward L. Nichols	PERSON	, is to consist of two volumes , the first of which is now pub - lished -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The sub-title of this instalment is a '' Junior Course in General Physics , '' and it is the work of Messrs.
Ernest Merritt	PERSON	and
Frederick J. Rogers	PERSON	.

		All the persons named are teachers at
Cornell Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		This first volume , intended for beginners -LRB- in the college sense -RRB- gives explicit directions for work , to - gether with demonstrations and occasional elementary statements of principles .

		The forthcoming volume will take more for granted .

		The use of this work presup - poses some knowledge of physical principles , as well as of analytical geometry and the calculus . ''

		The Memoirs of
Edmund Ludlow	PERSON	, Lieutenant-Gen - eral of the Horse in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Commonwealth of
England	LOCATION	, 1625-1672 , '' edited by Mr.
C. H. Firth	PERSON	, comes to us in two volumes , with the beautiful typography of the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Ludlow 's '' Memoirs '' were first published in 1698-9 .

		The title - page of the original edition pretends that the work was printed at
Vevay	LOCATION	, in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, but this pretence is disproved by contemporary evidence .

		They have been several times reprinted in
1721	DATE	,
1751	DATE	,
1771	DATE	, and
1807	DATE	. ''

		The justification of the present edition lies in the fact that it is the first to restore a number of passages sup - pressed by
Ludlow	ORGANIZATION	's editor , and the first containing crit - ical and explanatory notes , and adding the letters of Ludlow . ''

		ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL , BOOKS .

		Following our annual custom , we give herewith a list of the books that are announced for publication in this country during the present season .

		The publishers have responded freely and promptly to our requests for information , and probably few if any important omis - sions will be found .

		The avalanche of material has been sifted and the list of titles classified and arranged with the greatest care ; and though errors in such work are of course inevitable , it is believed that these are in - significant , and due to meagre or misleading informa - tion .

		The books in the list are presumably all new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

		The fulness and comparative ex - cellence of the list are matters for general congratula - tion , and some comments upon its more interesting fea - tures may be found in the leading editorial article of this issue .

		THE DIAL 167 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
September 8 , 1894	DATE	.

		The publication , by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of a new and handsome edition of Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	's amus - ing impressions of American life , first issued in
1832	DATE	, recalls to mind her friendship with an American lady , the writer 's ever-youthful grandmother , the late Mrs.
Elizabeth C. Kinuey	PERSON	.

		Their acquaintance began at
Florence	LOCATION	in the early fifties , whither Mrs.
Kinney	PERSON	re - moved with her husband at the expiration of his term as American minister at Victor
Emmanuel	PERSON	's court .

		There they found the Brownings , the Trollopes ,
Hiram Powers	PERSON	, and a number of other literary and artistic celebrities then resident in
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Kinney	PERSON	, in addition to her more formal literary work , preserved a record of her Florentine experiences in a journal , por - tions of which are incorporated in her as yet unpub - lished autobiography .

		Various anecdotes , descriptions , and characterizations of the group are given which can - not see the light these many years .

		There is , however , a lively little passage concerning Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	and her '' Domestic Manners of the Americans '' which will bear present quotation . ''

		` Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	, ' says ray journal , ` is another of these off-hand writers ; but certainly , in spite of this , a remarka - ble one .

		having published one hundred volumes .

		What are they ?

		Novels , and they sell !

		In her first book of travels she served up us Americans with piquant sauce ; but we for - give her ; for , as her speculations in the West fell to naught , so did the froth of her ill-humor evaporate .

		Besides , she now -LSB- in 1 855 -RSB- affects Americans greatly , as she does cards and other amusements : she finds tongues in green-ones , sermons in grave-ones , and good in every one , f. e. , good subjects for pen portraits .

		The old lady lives freely , and has free means to live on , thanks to her wits , or her industry . '

		At the date I wrote that , Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	was an unbeliever in the
Chris	PERSON	- tian religion , and indeed in any future state ; had been all her life a materialist .

		Soon after , as she was nearing 80 , her mind became uneasy on religious subjects , and she became convinced of a soul through the doing and teachings of the so-called Spiritualist ,
Daniel Home	PERSON	. ''

		Almost everyone will now agree with Prof.
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	, the editor of this edition of Mrs.
Trol	PERSON	- lope 's book , that it was written with an honest purpose , and not of malice aforethought , and that its unfavora - ble survey of our conditions at that time was largely due to the fact that most of the period of her residence here was passed in '' a little , raw , backwoods settlement , the
Ultima Thule	LOCATION	of civilization , among men who drank whiskey , chewed tobacco , and kept their hats on in her parlor , and among women who entered her house unin - vited , and who habitually spoke of her as ' the English old woman . ' ''

		And yet , her extensive literary labors were all performed after this period .

		The death of Mrs.
Edward L. Youmans	PERSON	, a '' figure of the past '' in our own literary circles , has passed almost without comment here .

		She had been spending the
summer	DATE	as usual at
Ridgefield	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, and died there on
August 29	DATE	, after a short illness .

		Some of those who attended her funeral at that place were Prof.
John Fiske	PERSON	, Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	, Mr.
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	, and Dr.
Henry M. Field	PERSON	of the '' Evangelist . ''

		Among her more intimate friends may be included Dr.
Titus Munson Coau	PERSON	, who first met her in his boyhood , when she was the wife of Chief Justice
William L. Lee	PERSON	, of the
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	, to which place she sailed , after an extremely romantic courtship , in
1849	DATE	, and was there married , Mr , Lee having preceded her .

		Dr.
Coan	PERSON	tells me that she was a favorite in the small but refined and cultivated circle -LRB- if American and English society at
Honolulu	LOCATION	, attracting all who knew her by her great social charm and personal vivacity .

		On the death of Judge
Lee	PERSON	, she returned to
New York	LOCATION	in
1857	DATE	, and a few years afterward married the late Pro- fessor
Youmans	PERSON	.

		As already mentioned in this cor - respondence , Professor and Mrs.
Youmans	PERSON	were for many years prominent in
New York	LOCATION	literary circles , and their home in the old
Haight	PERSON	house was the resort of the group of which Mrs.
Anne Lynch Botta	PERSON	was a central figure .

		Since her husband 's death , in
1887	DATE	, Mrs.
Youmans	PERSON	has taken an active part in the affairs of the
XlXth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, a social-literary organiza - tion for men and women .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	ten years ago was , I fear , a byword among
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	writers as a city practi - cally destitute of literary impulse and production .

		Mr.
Boker	PERSON	, Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Davis	PERSON	were then , as two of them are now , active contributors to American schol - arship and literature ; but there seemed to be no pros - pect of any succession .

		It was about this time that a small band of literary enthusiasts , most of them en - gaged in material occupations , began to assemble and encourage each other in efforts to overcome the exist - ing inertia .

		Among them were the late
Charles Henry Liiders	PERSON	and
John A. Henry	PERSON	,
S. Decatur Smith	PERSON	, Jr. ,
Francis Howard Williams	PERSON	,
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	, and two or three others .

		The first fruits of this literary comradeship were two thin little volumes of verse , '' A Duet in Lyrics , '' by Messrs.
Morris	PERSON	and
Henry	PERSON	, and '' Hallo , My Fancy ! ''

		by Messrs.
Liiders	PERSON	and
Smith	PERSON	.

		Later on , these gentlemen formed themselves into the
Pegasus Club	ORGANIZATION	, of which I have written in a former let - ter .

		Gradually the impulse extended itself , and besides those mentioned , Miss Repplier , Mr.
R. H. Davis	PERSON	, and Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	have won new laurels for the city which was really the birthplace of American letters .

		The text of this little sermon on literary
Philadelphia	LOCATION	is based on the advance sheets of Mr.
Harrison S. Morris	PERSON	's forthcoming volume , ''
Madonna	PERSON	and Other Poems , '' to be published by the
J. B. Lippincott	PERSON	Company next month .

		This is the first collective edition of his poems , and con - tains those which he wishes to preserve in permanent form .

		There are reminiscences of
Keats	PERSON	and
Lowell	LOCATION	in some of the poems , but they strike original notes in the main , and the volume is marked by a sustained eleva - tion of tone somewhat unusual in first books of poetry .

		The title piece , ''
Madonna	PERSON	, '' which readers of the '' Cen - tury Magazine '' will remember , a fine mediaeval ballad entitled `` A Garden Quest , '' `` To a Comrade '' -LRB-
John A. Henry	PERSON	-RRB- , '' Winds and Leaves , '' and sonnets to Homer ,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, and
Thoreau	PERSON	, may be marked for spe - cial notice .

		There is also a section of landscape verse , in which Mr.
Morris	PERSON	excels .

		It is announced that Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	, hav - ing acquired a fine piece of property near
Hanover	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, his wife 's birthplace , will shortly erect upon it '' a magnificent
summer	DATE	residence '' commanding an ex - cellent view of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	river for miles .

		He will hereafter spend his summers in this ideal retreat , which is some fifty miles north of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's home at Brat - tleboro ' , and on the opposite side of the river .

		It is due west of
Lake \ Vinnipeseogee	LOCATION	, and is a short distance from the Shaker village at
Lebanon	LOCATION	.

		I have observed that Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has always asserted his American citizenship , in spite of his foreign birth and residence .

		The place of his birth can not well be changed , but he evidently intends to become a resident of his country in fact as well as in theory .

		168 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		The '' Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	'' has secured as serials the new novels of MM .

		Daudet ,
Bourget	PERSON	, and
Hale	PERSON	` vy .

		Their respective titles are ''
Quinze Ans de Mariage	PERSON	, '' '' Une Idylle Tragique , '' and '' Deux Jeunes Filles . ''

		We are glad to learn that Judge Gayarre '' , the ven - erable historian of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, who has been seriously ill during the
summer	DATE	, is now restored to his usual health .

		Judge
Gayarre	PERSON	* will be ninety years old on the fifth of next
January	DATE	.

		THE DIAL 'S articles on the Teaching of English in American Colleges and Universities have aroused a hope - ful degree of interest in this important subject , and this will be continued by the publication of the articles in book form , by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	, who has nearly completed his new edition of '' Pike 's Expedition , '' has just returned from a canoe trip of over four hundred miles to the sources of the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	.

		He reports finding many im - portant facts and interesting items that will be added to his extensive notes .

		We have been awaiting with much interest the arrival in this country of three distinguished English men of letters , Dean Hole , Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, and the Rev. Stop - ford
Brooke	PERSON	, who have all been announced for lectures during the autumn .

		We now learn that Dr.
Brooke	PERSON	has been compelled by illness to postpone his visit .

		The other two , however , may be expected at an early date , and will appear under the management of the vet - eran Major Pond .

		Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	will be entertained soon after his arrival by the
Twentieth Century Club of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago .

		In response to frequent inquiries we wish to say that the volume of '' Proceedings of the International Con - gress of Education of the World 's Columbian Exposi - tion '' may be purchased from Dr.
N. A. Calkins	PERSON	, 124 East Eightieth street ,
New York	LOCATION	, for two dollars and
fifty cents	MONEY	.

		We may also mention the fact that the fa - mous '' Report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	of Ten '' has been re - published on behalf of the
National Educational Asso	ORGANIZATION	- tion by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, 808 Broadway ,
New York	LOCATION	, from whom it may be had for the nominal price of
thirty cents	MONEY	.


Thomas Dunn English	PERSON	, M.D , LL.D. , the author of the once popular song `` Ben Bolt '' -LRB- interest in which has recently been revived by Du
Maurier	PERSON	's story of '' Trilby '' -RRB- still lives in
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, and is now com - pleting his second term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Ben Bolt '' was written in
1843	DATE	.

		At the request of many friends , the poet 's daughter ,
Miss Alice English	PERSON	has collected and edited , for publication by private subscription , about 240 of his poems .

		The volume will be entitled '' The Select Poems of Dr.
Thomas Dunn	PERSON	English , '' and will not include the '' Battle Lyrics '' published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	several years since .

		The encouraging prospects of the book trade , shown in the unexpectedly profuse announcements of Fall books in this issue of THE DIAL , are confirmed by a
New York	LOCATION	publisher , Mr.
J. Selwin Tait	PERSON	, who summed up the situation in a recent interview : `` I think that pub - lishers generally feel that , accident aside , they have be - gun a period of prosperity which will last them through the century .

		The period of depression through which we have passed has not been an unmixed evil for the publishing business , since it has resulted in the clearing out of enormous stocks of standard publications held by bankrupt concerns , the result of the reckless manufac - ture of previous years . ''

		The '' Athenaeum '' states that the slab that is to cover the grave of
Robert Browning	PERSON	in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	is almost completed , and will be sent to
England	LOCATION	quite shortly from
Venice	LOCATION	.

		Owing to the limitations of the allotted space , it was not easy for Mr.
Barrett Brown	PERSON	- ing to decide upon a design .

		The gravestone will be of Oriental porphyry , of which the poet was particularly fond .

		It was difficult to find a piece sufficiently large , but finally Mr.
R. B. Browning	PERSON	met with one at
Rome	LOCATION	.

		It has been put into a frame of
Siena	LOCATION	marble , and the whole , though rich , is of the greatest simplicity , and in accordance with what would have been the poet 's taste .

		The inscription will consist of only the name and date of birth , with an English rose at the head and a Flor - entine lily below .

		Mrs.
Augusta Webster	PERSON	, the news of whose death was cabled on the sixth of this month , occupied an hon - orable position among the minor Victorian poets .

		A daughter of Admiral
Davies	PERSON	, and born about
1840	DATE	, she made her first appearance in literature under the nom de guerre of ''
Cecil Home	PERSON	, '' publishing two or three novels .

		Her first volume of poems was the '' Dra - matic Studies '' of
1865	DATE	, which appeared in her own name .

		Other volumes of verse were '' A Woman Sold and Other Poems '' -LRB- 1866 -RRB- , `` Portraits '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- , `` The Auspicious Day '' -LRB- 1872 -RRB- , `` Disguises '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , and translations of the '' Prometheus Bound '' of ^ Eschylus and the '' Medea '' of Euripides .

		A volume of selec - tions from her poems appeared last year .

		The Comte de
Paris	LOCATION	, who died in exile in
London	LOCATION	on the eighth of
September	DATE	at the age of fifty-six , belongs rather to politics than to letters , yet Americans should not be forgetful of the fact that he served in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac as an aide-de-camp of
McClellan	PERSON	, and that his '' History of the Civil War in
America	LOCATION	'' is one of the most substantial and meritorious accounts of that great subject that have yet been written .

		The eighth of this month also brought the sad news that Professor
Helmholtz	PERSON	had succumbed to a second stroke of paralysis , just as he was fairly recovering from the first stroke of some weeks ago .

		Baron Her - mann
Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz	PERSON	, to give him his full title , was born at
Potsdam	LOCATION	,
August 31 , 1821	DATE	, and had thus completed his seventy-third year .

		He studied medicine at
Berlin	LOCATION	, and took his degree in
1842	DATE	.

		His dissertation upon the nervous system of the Invertebrata was followed in
1843	DATE	by a memoir on Pu - trefaction , and that by a series of physiological papers .

		In
1847	DATE	he read before a learned society of
Berlin	LOCATION	his epoch-making paper on ''
The Conservation of Force	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In
1848	DATE	he was made an assistant in the Anatomical Museum of
Berlin	LOCATION	, and in
1849	DATE	, Professor
Extraordi	PERSON	- nary of Physiology in the
University of Konigsberg	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1851	DATE	he invented the ophthalmoscope , and began his investigations in electrodynamics .

		His promotion to a regular professorship in the
University	ORGANIZATION	followed in
1852	DATE	, and his inaugural address , upon the subject of sensations and their physical basis , outlined the doc - trines which were to be further developed in his great works upon Light and Sound .

		In
1855	DATE	he became a professor at
Bonn	LOCATION	, and in
1858	DATE	at
Heidelberg	LOCATION	.

		This latter year also gave the world his great memoir on Vortices .

		The treatise on
Physiological Optics	ORGANIZATION	was published in sections between
1856	DATE	and
1866	DATE	, while
1862	DATE	was the date of the equally important '' Tonemp - findungen . ''

		In
1871	DATE	he went back to
Berlin	LOCATION	, this
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 time as Professor of Physics .

		His
last quarter-century	DATE	was one of untiring activity , and witnessed the produc - tion of memoirs too numerous to be here specified .

		His visit to
America	LOCATION
last year	DATE	, and his participation in the
Electrical Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION	, are events fresh in the memory .

		His name is the greatest in nineteenth - century physical investigation ; one of the greatest , also , in mathematics and physiology .

		Another German scholar ,
Heinrich Karl Brugsch	PERSON	, died on the tenth of the month .

		He was born in
1827	DATE	in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		His interest in Egyptology , which remained almost undivided throughout his life , began when he was a student of twenty at the gymnasium .

		He first visited
Egypt	LOCATION	in
1853	DATE	.

		The following year he became Keeper of the Egyptian Museum at
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		After - wards he became a professor at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, and in
1869	DATE	went to
Egypt	LOCATION	and succeeded
M. Mariette	PERSON	as custodian of the Boulak collections .

		His works include a widely - read '' History of
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' and numerous contributious to Egyptian philology , archaeology , and literature .

		In ' Major
Joshua	PERSON	' Mr.
Francis Forster	PERSON	has brought before us one of the most curious and interesting , though certainly not one of the most admirable , characters in recent fiction ... One can scarcely be - lieve that such an excellent story as ' Major
Joshua	PERSON	' is a first effort . ''

		Dundee Advertiser . ''

		Major
Joshua Robinson	PERSON	is a new character in literature ... He can hardly be called the hero of
Francis Forster	PERSON	's new novel , since he is not of the stuff of which heroes are made ; but the author makes him the prominent figure in a very delightful story . ''

		Boston Advertiser . ''

		It is more interesting than nine-tenths of the novels now written , since it deals with unusual but not unnatural people , and analyzes their motives and emotions in a remarkably clever way ... Mr.
Forster	PERSON	has written a book which people will think about . ''

		The ridicule heaped on this novelty in periodical literature seems to have been earned by its originality ... There is a wide variety in the literary contents of the ' Yellow Book ' ; and there seems to be no disposition on the part of the editors to fall back on stereotyped forms of verse and fiction . ''

$ 1.50	MONEY	. ''

		A wonderfully strong study of character ; a powerful analysis of those elements which go to make up the strength and weakness of a man , which are at fierce warfare within the same breast ; contending against each other , as it were , the one to raise him to fame and power , the other to drag him down to degradation and shame .

		Never in the whole range of literature have we seen the struggle between these forces for supremacy over the man more powerfully , more realistically , delineated , than Mr.
Caine	PERSON	pictures it . ''

		Boston Home Journal . ''

		To get a book like this a good thick volume , compactly printed , the language close-grained and nervous and possessed of real style , the characters firmly drawn and striking , a distinct motive to the story and yet with hardly a page in it all where the author finds room or need to lay aside his mask and philosophize face to face with his reader to come upon a book like this recalls the days of the immortals .

		There have been other phenomena of the same kind in recent years , to be sure , but not a great many . ''

		205 THE ART OF THE SHORT STORY .

		Although the arts of design , color , and tone have long been reduced to something like a scientific system of underlying principles and methods of procedure , and while schools for the inculcation of these principles and methods have long held a secure place among educa - tional institutions of the higher sort , the va - rious forms of the literary art have hitherto kept out of the hands of the schoolmaster , and their pursuit has been left to such eager and confident aspirants as have had the courage to clear paths for themselves .

		Literary art is , of course , made a subject of study in every school and college of the land , but rather as provid - ing a means of aesthetic gratification than as opening the way to a professional career in lit - erature .

		It is admitted that exercises in verse and prose composition are common enough in educational programmes ; but this is a very different thing from the deliberate attempt to master some form of the literary art for the purpose of finding in its pursuit the work of a lifetime .

		Even the French , who might nat - urally be expected to take the lead in such a matter , and who have their special schools and their Prix de
Rome	LOCATION	in painting and sculpture , in architecture and music , have never thought of stimulating poets and novelists except by approving of them , by the bestowal of a meta - phorical crown , when they are already arrives .

		The reason why literary art is thus left to shift for itself the Cinderella of the sister - hood is not far to seek .

		The conviction is very widespread that literature is too elusive to be made the subject of instruction , that the most successful of poets or novelists could by no possibility impart to anyone else his secret , or even a respectable share of it .

		Possibly there may be added to this the other convic - tion that there is far too much scribbling in the world as things are , and that he would be no friend of mankind who should seek to en - courage still greater numbers to a reckless ex - penditure of ink and a wanton defacement of good white paper .

		There are some people , however , so consti - tuted as to be uninfluenced by the fact that a thing is generally accounted impracticable , pro- 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, vided they themselves see the way to its accom - plishment .

		Of such is the anonymous author of a treatise upon '' The Art of Short Story Writing , '' now modestly put forth through the
Riverside Literary Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, not published in any regular form , but issued in facsimile of the type-written manuscript , and limited to a very small number of copies .

		This curious pro- duction professes to be '' a practical course of instruction after the French method of Mau - passant . ''

		The author clearly believes that the art of this particular form of literature with which he is concerned , at least , is capable of being imparted to persons of fair talent and education , and he sets about his task with a confidence that proves fairly contagious while one is reading his pages , although doubts may afterwards intrude .

		After some introductory remarks about the scientific method in fiction , the author begins the systematic treatment of his subject by a classification of short stories .

		There are five species : the tale , the fable , the study , the dra - matic artifice , and the complete drama .

		The tale deals with adventure or incident , and is illustrated by Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The fable is a tale with a direct moral , and
Hawthorne	PERSON	was preeminent in its composition .

		The study is illustrated admirably by
Miss Wilkins	PERSON	, and the dramatic artifice by Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	.

		The complete drama '' combines all the elements found in the other kinds of stories into a single effective story .

		It tells a tale , it has a moral , although one usually more remote than the allegory , it has a study of character , and it usually suggests some problem of life , or has some clever turn , or unexpected episode , or climax . ''

		This , the most consummate type of the art of the short story , is illustrated by Maupassant .

		After setting forth this acute and reasonably exhaustive classification , the author gives some sensible general directions about methods and materials , and then pro- ceeds to an analysis of the thirteen stories by Maupassant accessible to English readers in the volume entitled '' The Odd Number . ''

		From this time on , these stories are used by the au - thor to point his morals , and to illustrate the rules which he lays down for the guidance of those to whom the book makes a practical ap - peal .

		We should be as far as possible from doing justice to the writer of this book if we gave the impression that he represented the art of story - writing as one easy of attainment .

		It is no course of '' Novel - Writing in Six Lessons , '' no '' Meisterschaf t '' system that he offers us , no level path to the height that he points out . ''

		The writer must understand the life he writes about to the very roots .

		He must have a deep and vivid knowledge of the principles of psy - chology , of the actions and reactions of human feeling in short he must know practically all there is to know about the life in which the inci - dent occurs . '' ''

		If one does not know something worth knowing about life , something of value or suggestiveness , something new and meaning - ful , he has no material out of which to create a soul . ''

		Such are the statements made over and over again , until , whatever other ideas the novice may get from these pages , he is sure to get a deepened sense of the old truth that art is long .

		Possibly the principle is carried to an unnecessary , as it certainly is to a discourag - ing , extent , in such a passage as the following : '' Every writer ought to formulate for himself more or less completely a philosophy of life .

		He should arrange his thought about the uni - verse into a system , so that he will feel clear as to what God is , what love is , what the mean - ing of life is , what is to be looked into and known and what is to be left untouched by the human mind . ''

		Doubtless the great story tell - ers have done all this , but it can hardly be claimed for many others who have yet had a large measure of success .

		But such precepts are wholesome , even if they are forbidding , for they apprise the writer that he can not set his ideals too high .

		Of the greatest importance , also , is the closing reminder that the most dil - igent study of rules and principles must have for its ultimate aim the relegation of those very rules and principles to the domain of the sub - conscious . ''

		While one is actually writing a story , rules are the most fatal thing to have in mind .

		Self - consciousness during the actual feat of writing a story is the most dangerous thing in the world ; but there is no surer way of escaping it than by submitting first to a rig - orous course of self-conscious preparation . ''

		The strictures we are inclined to make upon the system set forth in this book are few in number and of no great importance .

		We think the writer goes too far when he says that '' the subject of literature is almost solely the emo - tional side of life . ''

		It is doubtless true that to be successful , '' you must coin your heart 's blood into the universal coin of the realm of heart , '' but why not also coin your ripest thought -LRB- with its proper emotional associa - tions -RRB- into the mintage of the intellectual prov - ince ?

		The suggestion that a good story should -LSB-
1894	DATE	.

		THE DIAL 185 have an unexpected end is not a principle of the highest art , even in the short story .

		Rather should the inevitableness of the end be fore - shadowed from the beginning .

		This is , to our mind , one of the ultimate differences between art and artifice .

		We must also question the de - sirability of advising '' all young writers to be - gin by being humorists , '' and must regard as anything but a counsel of perfection the recom - mendation of journalism as a collateral pursuit helpful to literary achievement .

		There is even something ludicrous in one device of the writer the use of diagrams to illustrate the charac - ter-relations of the Maupassant stories taken for texts throughout .

		We fancy , also , that the principles so neatly deduced from the practice of the French story-teller would require con - siderable modification if a systematic attempt were made to test them by the practice of two or three others , say of
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	, or of Tourguenieff , the greatest of all artists in this kind .

		But we have no doubt that a young writer may get a good deal of real help from this hand - book of the art of fiction , provided , of course , he is the kind of person who can be helped by anything .

		His attention will be called to many things which he ought to avoid , and he will find many hints about the right way to set about his tasks .

		Fiction has its technique al - most as fully as has the drama , and our writer has evidently tested his methods by practice , although he modestly avers that '' he is not the author of very many great short stories . ''

		And we could forgive greater inadequacies than any we have pointed out for the sake of his un - equivocal repudiation of the sort of realism that has played such havoc with latter-day fiction .

		He never forgets that story-writing must be the work of creative imagination , and the issue is not often so well put as in the following words : '' It would seem preposterous to let any outside circumstance determine for a writer of music the selection of chords , much less the ad - mission of discords ; but that is exactly what a writer of fiction does when he tells a story just as it happened in real life .

		His object should have been to play upon the heart of the reader a beautiful tune of life ; instead , he pro- duces a jangle of discords . ''

		A CORRESPONDENT asks the pertinent question why Professor
Drummond	PERSON	has been allowed to appropriate , without a protest , the title of Miss
Mathilde Blind	PERSON	's book called '' The Ascent of Man . ''

		It is one of those peculiar '' coincidences '' which certainly seem worth ex - plaining .

		THE RISE AND THE FALL OF THE `` THREE DECKER . ''

		There are three institutions in this country which pass the understanding of the American .

		Since we are able to understand them very well , some of our insular conceit is accounted for .

		If you think of it , indeed , that level of intelligence which enables us to understand anything which your people can - not understand is something to be proud of .

		These three institutions are
the House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, the Es - tablished Church , and the Three Volume Novel the '' Three Decker . ''

		The first two of these , in spite of long continued and determined attacks , are stronger than ever .

		The last of these , with which I have been intimately connected for five and twenty years , has just received a blow which threatens to be mortal .

		Often assailed , long derided , much abused , the
Three Volume Novel	ORGANIZATION	has been stabbed at last in a vital part and by the hand of its oldest friend .

		It is not dead : it will , perhaps , partly re - cover ; but it is doomed to carry on a languishing , lame , and limp existence for the future .

		The his - tory of the Three
Decker	PERSON	and the curiously artifi - cial character of its publication and price forms a little chapter in our branch of English literature that may not be without interest to American readers .

		At least , one may explain the genesis and the mean - ing of an institution which is full of absurdity ; which exists in no other country ; which will shortly be numbered among the things of the past .

		The English novel in its popular form , as an ar - ticle of daily or constant consumption , was born and grew up in the
last century	DATE	.

		It appeared in one , two , or more volumes , as the author chose ; there was no rule or practice as to length . ''

		The History of Tom Jones '' took three or four times as much space and time in the telling as that of `` The Vicar of Wakefield . ''

		The woes of
Clar	PERSON	- issa could not be contracted in the narrow limits which contained the adventures of Rasselas .

		But the volumes themselves were generally of equal length , forming a small octavo containing from twenty to thirty thousand words .

		And between the years
1750	DATE	and
1800	DATE	these volumes were priced at three shillings each , so that a novel in three volumes was sold for nine shillings and one in four volumes for twelve shillings .

		The reading -LRB- and purchasing -RRB- public of that time was mostly found in the towns : in every large town , in every cathedral town , and in many smaller towns , there were literary coteries , clubs , and societies , a few of which were important enough to occupy a place in the history of literature .

		The literary circles of
Norwich	LOCATION	,
Lichfield	LOCATION	,
Exeter	LOCATION	, for instance , can not be neglected by the historian of the , last century .


London	LOCATION	, of course , provided the greatest demand for new books ; and there were the two Uni - versities of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		In the country , in the quiet houses of squire and parson , there was as yet very little reading and very little demand for books .

		But the circle of readers went on widening year after year , steadily , though as yet slowly .

		And 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, the habit of reading , as the most delightful form of recreation , went on growing .

		People read faster as well as more ; they devoured books .

		No purse was long enough to buy all the books that one could read ; therefore they lent to each other ; therefore they combined their resources and formed book clubs ; therefore the circulating libraries came into existence .

		It was not that we ceased to buy books : it was that we could no longer afford to buy a tenth part of the books we wanted to read , and that we clubbed together and passed on the books from hand to hand .

		All this took place in
the latter half of the last century	DATE	.

		Then followed a long war a war of three and twenty years , nearly a quarter of a century when
Great Britain	LOCATION	stood in arms for a time against the whole of
Western Europe	LOCATION	, the one undefeated enemy of military despotism .

		I fear we are forget - ting , as a nation , that long conflict : what it meant for the liberties of the world ; the sacrifices which we made to maintain it .

		These sacrifices fell with the greatest weight upon the professional classes , those in which were found the reading public .

		They could no longer afford to buy books at all ; the book clubs increased in number : so did circulating libra - ries .

		The booksellers , finding that their buyers were growing fewer , had to raise the price of their books .

		And from
1790	DATE	to 1850 the price of novels -LRB- not to mention other branches -RRB- ran up from three shillings a volume to ten shillings and sixpence a volume .

		At the same time the number of volumes gradually became limited to three at the most , and was sel - dom under three .

		For forty years or so this arbi - trary rule has prevailed .

		The novel has had to be in three volumes ; the price has been , nominally , thirty-one shillings and sixpence ; the only pur - chasers have been the circulating libraries .

		Other changes have occurred : the book clubs , with very few exceptions , have been dissolved ; the circulating libraries , for practical purposes , have been reduced to two
Mudie	PERSON	's and
Smith	PERSON	's : these two have long since refused to pay the nominal price of thirty-one shillings and sixpence , and have ob - tained the novels at fifteen shillings a copy , and in some cases at very much less .

		Again , forty years ago the reprint of a novel in a cheap form was a rare event ; only the most pop - ular novelists were so honored , and then after a long interval .

		It is now the custom to bring out a new and cheap edition of every novel the least above the average .

		This edition appears about nine months after the first ; the price varies from three shillings and sixpence to six shillings .

		We have , therefore , this remarkable custom in the publishing of novels .

		We bring out the first edition exclusively for the readers of
Mudie	PERSON	's and
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's libraries .

		These number about 250,000 , reckoning about four to each subscribing family .

		That is to say , in a home population of 37,000,000 , and a colonial population of 15,000,000 , without counting
India	LOCATION	, whose educated natives read our literature extensively , we keep everybody waiting for our best works of fiction until this lucky quar - ter of a million has had a nine months ' run among them .

		Of late , there have been revolts here and there .

		Two or three of our best and most popular writers have refused to recognize the Three Vol - ume rule .

		Mr.
Louis Stevenson	PERSON	is one ; Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	is another .

		And now the two libraries them - selves supposed to be the props and pillars of the old system have announced to the trade that in future they will only give eleven shillings a copy instead of fifteen shillings for the Three Volume novel , and they will make it a condition that they shall have the exclusive use of it i. e. , that there is to be no cheap edition for twelve months after first publication .

		I dare say American readers have heard of the storm which during the whole
summer	DATE	has raged about this question .

		The
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, taking counsel of its novelist members , have de - clared against the Three Volume system altogether .

		Some of the publishers have advertised that they will issue no more novels in that form .

		Those of our novelists who are already engaged ahead for the old form I am myself one of these will break away from it as soon as they can .

		And although the old form will linger on for some time , its tyranny is now past .

		Henceforth , in this coun - try as in the
States	LOCATION	, we shall appeal to the whole reading public at the very outset ; and we shall ask them , for the present , to buy our stories in one vol - ume at the price of six shillings .

		And here again because we really are a most illogical race the six shillings means four shillings and sixpence , for the retail bookseller has to take off twenty-five per cent from the nominal price .

		It is often advanced in newspapers that this re - volt means a demand for shorter stories .

		The state - ment is made in ignorance .

		The Three Volume novel ranges from one hundred thousand words to three hundred thousand words in length .

		The one volume novel has exactly the same range .

		For in - stance , Mr.
Louis Stevenson	PERSON	will be found , as a rule , somewhat under one hundred thousand words . ''

		Marcella , '' on the other hand , now in one volume , is nearly three hundred thousand words .

		The only de - mand , in fact , for a shorter story I do not mean the `` short story , '' which is another thing is raised , so far as I can see , by those who write reviews for
London	LOCATION	papers .

		Readers , when they get hold of a good novel , care not how long it is .

		Who would wish '' Vanity Fair '' to be reduced by a single page ?

		When we are in good company we are loth to leave them : there are even characters with whom one would like to live for years .

		A long novel which is also tedious is , indeed but then I , for one , never allow myself to be bored by a tedious novel .

		And this if you have had patience to read so far is the history of the rise , the growth , the great - ness , and the fall , of that mysterious institution , the
Three Volume Novel	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 187 ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	.

		* The work in English in the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	is done in the two departments , Rhetoric and Oratory , and English Language and Literature .

		The combined instructional force is two professors , two assistant pro- fessors , and three instructors , seven in all .

		For many years the required work in rhetoric and composition consisted of one term 's work in formal rhetoric , and of weekly rhetorical exercises throughout the course .

		The growth of
the University	ORGANIZATION	has led to concentration .

		Rhetoric is now required twice a week through the Freshman and Sophomore years .

		There are eleven courses in the department , nearly all running longer than one term .

		In the Freshman year the aim is thoroughly to ground the students , by precept and by steady practice , in the fundamentals of composition ; the emphasis is constantly thrown on rhetoric as an art .

		Analysis of themes , paragraph formation , the study of the fundamental qualities of style and of great literary types , with much practice in writing both within and without the class-room , such , briefly stated , are the aim and method of the
Freshman	ORGANIZATION	's rhetorical training .

		Much attention is paid to the mechanics of composition .

		The unevenness of the entrance preparation in English compels this .

		Although rhetoric is now required in our accredited high schools , still the preparation is very inadequate .

		In some of the schools the study is merely formal , not looking to the production of anything ; usually too much work is required of the instructor , and not seldom the work is assigned to those teachers who have little or no special preparation for it ; helpful criticism is therefore rare .

		The course in English composition as laid down in the catalogue of the schools is seldom carried out even in the letter .

		With our Freshmen , all written work is inspected ; most of it is carefully criticised , and much of it is re - written .

		We try to lighten the burden of criticism somewhat by massing the faults , and then treating them before the class .

		Typically defective essays are type-written , reproduced on the mimeograph , and crit - icised in the class-room .

		Some of the faults common to beginners arise from ignorance , or carelessness , or * This article is the seventeenth of an extended series on the Teaching of English at

		Persistent criticism may profitably be applied to the former group of faults r while a kindly patience may often note the disappear - ance of the latter group .

		The division may not be ex - act , yet it holds true that something may be left to the general development of the student .

		Over-criticism is as bad as under-criticism or no criticism .

		Facility in expression may , at times in the student 's course , count for more than mere conformity to rhetorical principle .

		Criticism that freezes the currents of invention is always of doubtful utility .

		It is apt to lead to mere perfunctory work , just as no criticism leads to such work ; and per - functory work is the bane of the rhetorical class-room .

		In the Sophomore year the essay-writing is continued .

		The application of the principles of the paragraph ar & more strongly insisted upon ; the great problems in ex - pression are pushed to the front .

		The writing of essays - in description , narration , argumentation , and exposition proceed with the study of brief extracts of literary masterpieces .

		Milton and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Addison	PERSON	and De Quincy ,
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Huxley	LOCATION	, are critically studied for diction , adaptation , and mastery of materials .

		The great webs are pulled just enough apart that the stu - dent may see with what pains and skill the weaving has been done .

		We aim not at the production of literature , but in some little degree to arouse and cultivate the lit - erary spirit ; not that spirit that simply enjoys litera - ture , feeling what is good , but the artist spirit that re - joices in creation , in the perfect embodiment of an idea , the critical spirit as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	understood the term .

		At this stage of the work , the criticism of essays is largely personal .

		Many of the essays are read be - fore the class .

		The other influences in the
University	ORGANIZATION	that help the Freshmen and Sophomores to the attain - ment of some degree of proficiency in English composi - tion I shall speak of later .

		The required work in rhetoric ends with the
Sopho	LOCATION	- more year .

		The advanced courses in rhetoric , as well as the courses in elocution , are optional .

		The principal advanced course in rhetoric is given three times a week throughout the year , and is open to those students who have completed the required work .

		The method of in - struction is by text-book and lectures , and by wide aux - iliary reading .

		The aim is to cultivate the literary taste .

		Minto 's '' Manual '' and
Lessing	PERSON	's '' Essays on Criticism '' are read by the class .

		The text-book furnishes mate - rial for lectures or talks by the students .

		Orations , speeches , and debates are delivered before the class , then carefully written out and criticised .

		Essays of the Freshmen or of the Sophomores are corrected by mem - bers of this advanced class , who then look over the cor - rected work with the instructor .

		The above work in English is done in the academical courses .

		In the
College of Engineering	ORGANIZATION	, the Freshmen are required to take
Rhetoric and Composition	ORGANIZATION	three times a week during the year .

		The work is similar to that required of the Freshmen in the literary courses , except that special stress is laid upon scientific and tech - nical description and exposition .

		This is further carried out in an elective course in the same departments , open only to Engineering students , where the training is purely practical , intended to aid the student clearly to express himself on scientific and professional subjects .

		The work is so certain , and so uniform in quality , that it may be looked upon as part , and not an unim - portant part either , of the students ' training .

		Freshmen and Sophomores , while carrying on the work in English composition in the class-room , are listening to or en - gaging in weekly debates in the society halls .

		There are in all eight general literary societies ; and in all of them , I believe , essay writing and oration writing is sub - sidiary to debating .

		The competition runs high even within the societies .

		The Sophomores of each society hold annually a public exhibition ; those who appear are chosen for the excellence of their work in the society .

		The most important literary event of the college year , not excepting commencement , is the joint debate be - tween two of the several literary societies that consti - tute the
Joint Debate League	ORGANIZATION	.

		The joint debaters are usually chosen from those who have made a good record in the Sophomore public debate .

		No labor or expense is spared in preparation .

		The relation of the department of Rhetoric and Ora - tory to the other departments of a college or university is peculiar .

		It should be in close alliance with them ; a sharp insistence by all departments upon correctness in the composition of themes and topics , and upon correct pronunciation and correct speech in the recitation room , would add greatly to the efficiency of the English de - partment .

		A graduate 's English should be the result of all university work ; and by English I mean both spoken and written English .

		The department of English Language and Literature offers twenty-one courses ; a few of these are given only every second year .

		Anglo-Saxon and Middle English as an introduction to the historical study of English are required of students in the English course .

		This is fol - lowed by an elective course in Anglo-Saxon poetry and a survey of Anglo-Saxon literature , and this by a course in
Beowulf	LOCATION	as an introduction to the study of Old Ger - manic life .

		A general course in the history of the En - glish language is given every second year .

		A general survey of English literature is a prerequisite to all other courses in English literature , and is required of the Sophomores in the English course .

		All other courses in the department are elective .

		The method of instruction is scientific .

		Little atten - tion is paid to text-books ; the works under consideration are studied , commented upon , interpreted .

		Long lines of reading are assigned , and the results are embodied in a paper which is read and discussed before the class .

		In the Literature Seminary meeting , once a week for two hours , the general principles of literary criticism are expounded and applied .

		The scope of instruction in the department is suffi - ciently broad .

		After the general survey required for en - trance upon the elective courses , the students may study the history of literature of the fourteenth century , the literature of the Elizabethan period , the literature of the eighteenth century with special reference to the so - cial and intellectual life of the period , the English Ro - mantic movement , and the Victorian era .

		There is a group of courses on the Drama , beginning with the an - cient classical drama in translation , going to the history of the English drama , and the interpretative readings of selected plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with themes and discus - sion .

		Epic poetry is studied in translations of
Virgil	LOCATION	, Homer , and
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, leading to the great English lyric poets .

		The development of the novel and the develop - ment of English prose are each given a place .

		The En - glish essayists , from
Dryden	PERSON	to the present day , are fol - lowed by the English and American prose masterpieces , and those by the English Literary Seminary on the his - tory and theory ef literary criticism ; the subject for study in the seminary for the present year is

		The courses in English literature are , I think , the most popular courses in the

		THE DIAL 189 JAPAN KOREA CHIXA .

		* Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's book on '' Problems of the Far East '' comes in the nick of time , and has scarcely a rival in the field it covers .

		The eyes of the Western world are intently fixed on the international drama now enacting in
Korea	LOCATION	, in which
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	are the protagon - ists ; and there is an eager demand for precisely the sort of information that Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	gives .

		Of the Oriental '' impressions '' of the globe - trotter we have had enough and to spare save in the case of
Korea	LOCATION	, which floats in the minds of most of us chiefly as a land of white clothes and miraculous hats .

		Japan we know -LRB- or fan - cied we knew -RRB- pretty thoroughly .

		Pilgrims in - numerable , from sugary Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	f to '' breezy ''
Miss Duncan	PERSON	, have journeyed thither as to a traveller 's paradise , bent on seeing a fairy-land of tea-gardens and bric-a-brac , pa - per lanterns and tea-tray landscapes , with in - habitants to match ; and , naturally , they saw what they were predisposed to see .

		But of
Japan	LOCATION	, the land of aspiring statesmen and de - finite ambitions ; the potent factor in the loom - ing Pacific Question ; the scheming , far-seeing rival of
China	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	for the tongue of land the mastery of which will go far in deter - mining the maritime supremacy of the
Pacific	LOCATION	; the country that is bridging with such mar - vellous celerity the gulf between feudalism and democracy , and between Oriental stagnation and Western progress , of this , the actual and all-important
Japan	LOCATION	, travellers heretofore have told us relatively little .

		Painting pictures is no part of Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's main design , though he shows on occasion that he can wield the brush with brilliancy and effect .

		His stand - point is that of the political student , and his view throughout is broad and statesmanlike .

		The volume is the outcome of two journeys round the world , in 1887-8 and in 1892-3 , and it is essentially a comparative study of the political , social , and economic conditions of

		t '' I conceive that no worse service could have been ren - dered to
Japan	LOCATION	than the publication of the last work in En - glish which has been dedicated to her charms by a well - known writer and poet .

		These overloaded encomiums not merely clog the palate ; they foster a growing vanity against which the Japanese require to be on their guard , and which may , unless abated , both provoke and deserve the chastise - ment of some smart rebuff . ''

		Author .

		they are now playing , or are capable of play - ing , on the international stage ?

		What is the political future that may , without foolhardiness of prediction , be anticipated for them ?

		These are the leading questions Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	attempts to answer .

		His treatment of
Japan	LOCATION	is purely political , and his picture of Japanese home pol - itics is not , on the whole , a bright one .

		After a twenty years ' travail ,
Japan	LOCATION	has given birth to a Parliamentary Constitution , and the two chambers created under it are rapidly intro - ducing the people to the amenities of parlia - mentary methods obstruction within doors and demagogism without to the phenomena of Radical and Conservative parties , and to the familiar palaestra of begging and refusing supplies .

		The Diet approximates to the
Prus	PERSON	- sian model .

		There is a
House of Peers	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 270 members -RRB- which is partly hereditary , partly nominated , and partly elected .

		The members of the first two classes sit for life , those of the third class for seven years .

		The
Lower House	ORGANIZATION	, which contains 300 members , and sits for four years , being bound to meet at least once a year for a three months ' session , is wholly elective , and is composed of the representatives of the principal prefectures and towns , returned in the proportion of one to every 128,000 of the people , upon a tax-paying , residential , and age franchise .

		The Japanese have acquired the routine of parliamentary conduct with their usual facility , and the new regime has had its natural effect upon the people at large .

		There is a prodigious growth of mushroom journals of the '' organ '' variety ; and we read of polit - ical clubs , of agitations for an extension of the franchise , of mass-meetings , of '' silver - tongued '' orators and '' scathing '' speeches ; and we realize that in far
Japan	LOCATION	, Demos , hav - ing found belated utterance , is being flattered , cheated , and cajoled by his natural mentors in the good old way .

		Happily , with a limited franchise , the Japanese '' boss '' is still below the political horizon .

		The
Lower House	ORGANIZATION	, says Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	, is by its constitution afflicted with the vices of an irresponsible opposition ; and so far it has combated successive governments , impeding their measures and defeating their budgets , with a persistency worthy of Irish ob - structionists .

		Of the many '' rocks ahead '' pointed out by our author which threaten con - stitutional rule in
Japan	LOCATION	, the most menacing by far is the question of the relations of the Chamber with the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, which repro - duce , though in different form , the controver - sial impasse presented from time to time in 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
England	LOCATION	between a
Eadical	ORGANIZATION	majority in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	and a Conservative one in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	.


Japan	LOCATION	has parties , but no party government .

		The Ministers are re - sponsible , not to the Diet , but to the Emperor , retaining office during his pleasure .

		There is no a priori reason why the dangerous situation presented by a majority hostile to the Exec - utive , in both Houses , should not exist and be indefinitely prolonged . ''

		The theory of the Japanese Constitution , therefore , being the rule of a
Government	ORGANIZATION	legislating through two Chambers , but not responsible to either , and treating their representatives with comparative indifference , it may be readily understood that the popular Chamber , at any rate , which rests solely upon election , though on a narrow franchise , becomes an almost automatic ma - chine of opposition . ''

		Frequent dissolutions are obviously a dan - gerous expedient ; and should the present at - tempt of
Count Ito 's Ministry	ORGANIZATION	to tide over do - mestic dissensions by means of foreign war prove disastrous -LRB- and Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	seems to think it must , eventually -RRB- Japanese politicians may look for interesting times in the near fu - ture .

		Broadly stated , the main questions in the three-fold problem with which Japanese statesmen have to deal are these : the ances - tral conflict between democratic and oligarchi - cal theories of government ; the role of the sovereign in a so-called constitutional polity ; and the relation of ministerial responsibility to a parliamentary system .

		They are essen - tially the issues over which European states have been battling for centuries ; and it is to be hoped that here again
Japan	LOCATION	may profit by the experience of the Occident .

		Of especial interest at present is a con - sideration of the military and naval forces of the
Mikado	LOCATION	's Empire .

		Born sailors , and con - scious of an extensive and vulnerable seaboard , the Japanese are peculiarly sensitive to criti - cism of their navy ; and while the administra - tion of the department excites acrimonious party strife , there is no dispute as to the crown - ing need of a policy of liberal naval outlay .

		When in
1893	DATE	the government placed the stan - dard of national requirement at 120,000 tons , extreme radicals proposed an increase to 150 , - 000 .

		An order amounting to 2,000,000 is now undergoing execution in
Europe	LOCATION	; and re - cent events more than justify Count
Ito	PERSON	's boast to our author , that '' the Japanese fleet is the next strongest to that of
China	LOCATION	in the North - ern
Pacific	LOCATION	, and is far more serviceable for ac - tion . ''

		Not less satisfactory is the condition of the army . ''

		With a mobilized peace-footing of between 50,000 and 60,000 men , with a reserve of 113,000 , and a Land - wehr of 80,000 , armed , equipped , and drilled according to the highest standard of nineteenth-century require - ment , and , moreover , honestly and economically admin - istered , the Japanese army need not shrink from the test of comparison , in point of efficiency , with the forces of European states . ''

		The Japanese soldier has , unquestionably , dis - cipline , perseverance , and endurance . ''

		Has he valor also ? ''

		is the question recently put by an English military authority .

		The annals of the nation , teeming with the records of per - sonal valor and patriotic devotion , certainly re - turn an affirmative answer .

		The high ideal of Japanese feudal and national loyalty is fitly expressed in the old verses current for a thou - sand years among the people : '' Is my path upon the ocean yonder ?

		Let the waves my shipwrecked body hide !

		Must I over plain and mountain wander ?

		Let my slain corse ` neath the grass abide !

		Where'er I cease , For me no peace Of last release , I shall perish by my liege-lord 's side ! ''

		We gather from Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's reports that , despite the heavy draughts on the national capital implied by her war establishments , the trade and manufactures of
Japan	LOCATION	are exceed - ingly prosperous to the British apprehension rather alarmingly so .

		Surprising advances have been made , notably in the manufacture of cotton clothing ,
Japan	LOCATION	's export of the pro- duct of her own looms having quadrupled in the last five years .

		With the great increase in the import of raw material , there has been a corresponding decrease in that of manufac - tured goods .

		Especially , thinks Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	, will she profit in her export of manufactured cottons to
China	LOCATION	. ''

		Both are silver-standard countries , and in both wages are paid in stiver ; and when her superior prox - imity , her low rate of wages , and the cheapness of coal , are taken into account ,
Manchester	PERSON	and
Bombay	LOCATION	alike should find in her a most formidable competitor . ''

		What will be the effect of the present war upon this promising industrial outlook , remains to be seen .

		Having glanced at Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's account of
Japan	LOCATION	's army , it may be interesting to learn his opinion of her rival 's .

		While
China	LOCATION	has made some improvements in her military or - ganization , especially since the French war of 1884-5 , it is , as a whole , little less antique and no less rigid than its civil counterpart .

		Its first main division is the
Army of the Eight Banners	ORGANIZATION	, a close corps forming a sort of hered - itary body or caste maintained at the expense
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 191 of the Crown , and , like the Roman legionaries of the outlying provinces , holding military lands .

		The nominal strength of the
Eight Banners	ORGANIZATION	varies from 230,000 to 330,000 men ; but of these , not more than 80,000 are on a respectable war footing .

		The Imperial Guard at Peking , drawn from the
Banner Army	ORGANIZATION	, con - sists of eight regiments ; and side by side with them is the
National Army	ORGANIZATION	, a sort of militia , nominally 540,000 to 660,000 strong , about one-third of whom are usually called out , '' and the whole of whom are never organized , and are probably incapable of being organized , for war . ''

		The only really formidable contingent of the
National Army	ORGANIZATION	is the Tientsin army corps -LRB- mobilized strength 35,000 -RRB- , a compact troop armed with modern rifles and
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	guns , and drilled and organized on the Prus - sian model .

		The total land army of
China	LOCATION	, called on to garrison an Empire whose area is half as large again as
Europe	LOCATION	, and whose popu - lation is equivalent to that of all
Europe	LOCATION	, is , on a war footing , about 1,000,000 men .

		When we approach the question of discipline , train - ing , and personnel , the true value of the Chi - nese army appears .

		The men have many ex - cellent qualities good physique , wonderful endurance , natural docility and sobriety , and considerable intelligence ; of discipline , in the proper sense , they have none . ''

		No arms in the world , shuffled out from the arsenal upon the declaration of war , like cards from a pack , and placed in untrained hands , can make them follow lead - ers who are nincompoops , or resist an enemy whose tac - tics , except when it comes to getting behind a mud ram - part themselves , they do not understand . ''

		Their ordinary weapons are lances , spears , bat - tle axes , tridents , ancient rifles bought second - hand or third-hand in
Europe	LOCATION	, with a plentiful accompaniment of banners and gongs .

		The arm of the majority , however , is an archaic and -LRB- to the bearer -RRB- formidable matchlock , which requires two men to fire it .

		Bows and arrows are common ; and
European Dugald Dalgettys	ORGANIZATION	in Peking are every day scandalized by seeing the garrison at archery practice , shooting '' at a straw doll stuck up in a ditch . ''

		In fighting the French at Tonking , men of the same regi - ment had different rifles , and there was even a larger confusion of cartridges . ''

		To a Chinaman all cartridges are alike ; and what with those that were too large and those that were too small , and those that jammed and could not be extracted , it may be judged what amount of success attended the firing . ''

		All military drawbacks , however , sink into insignificance compared with the final and fatal handicap of the native officer .

		In
China	LOCATION	, the pedant 's paradise , where distinction is identi - fied with proficiency in the classics , the mili - tary profession is regarded with contempt , and attracts only inferior men . ''

		In the bulk of the army an officer still only requires to qualify by passing a standard in archery , in fencing with swords , and in certain gymnastic exercises . ''

		Oddly enough , even for
China	LOCATION	, where every - thing seems to go , as it were , stern-foremost , and where a sense of practical fitness , like the verb in a German sentence , usually comes last , the study of the theory of war is relegated to civilians , as a branch of polite learning .

		When we learn , however , that the standard military works are some three thousand years old , and that the chief authority -LRB- one Sun-tse -RRB- recom - mends such manosuvres as '' Spread in the camp of the enemy voluptuous musical airs , so as to soften his heart '' the practical loss to the profession seems inconsiderable .

		Summar - izing his impressions of the Chinese officers , Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	concludes : '' It can not be considered surprising that , so recruited and taught , destitute of the slenderest elements , either of military knowledge or scientific training , they should earn the contempt of their followers .

		Their posts are usually acquired either by favoritism or purchase .

		When it is added that they are also , as a rule , both corrupt and cowardly ; that they stint the men 's rations and pilfer their pay ; and that when an engagement takes place they commonly misdirect it from a sedan chair in the rear , we have the best of reasons for expecting uniform and systematic disaster . ''

		As to the employment by
China	LOCATION	of European officers , Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	observes that she is ready enough to enlist them and to pay them liber - ally , in the initial stages of a policy of recon - struction and to cast them aside , unrewarded with gift or preferment , as soon as she has sucked them dry . ''

		She kowtows to the foreigner as long as she has something to gain from him ; but her inordinate conceit presently reasserts itself , and a Chinaman is appointed to continue , one might rather say to take to pieces , the laborious efforts of his predecessors . ''

		In the light of Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's account it is manifest that , despite its great numerical supe - riority , the ill-armed , ill-disciplined , and worse - led horde , by courtesy called the
Chinese Army	ORGANIZATION	, must go down in the field before
Japan	LOCATION	's thor - oughly modern and efficient fighting-machine .

		It is a corps of regulars against a rabble of tramps ; and the issue of the first onset is not doubtful .

		But what of the issue of a long sus - tained struggle ?

		or of a conflict renewed after
China	LOCATION	, profiting by her disasters and eager to avenge them , shall have taken the field with an
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, army numerically far beyond the resources of the
Island Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and equipped , drilled , and officered in some conformity with modern stand - ards ?

		A defeat by
Japan	LOCATION	seems not unlikely to prove the rude jog needed to startle
China	LOCATION	from her sleep of centuries , and to bring about that real '' awakening '' predicted by
Marquis Tseng	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's graphic and comprehensive ac - count of
Korea	LOCATION	can only be touched upon here .


Korea	LOCATION	's new-born prominence in international politics is largely due to the bearing of her geographical position upon the maritime and commercial ambitions of
China	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The opening of the
Canadian Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	and Trans-Pacific route on the east - ern side ; the probable completion of the Nic - aragua or some other inter-oceanic canal to the south ; the Siberian Railway , and the ominous meddling of foreign states in the affairs of the isles of
Oceania	LOCATION	, all foreshadow a future Pa - cific Question to the vital importance of which the three Powers named are fully alive .

		Rus - sia , already dissatisfied with her base at ice - bound
Vladivostock	LOCATION	and thirsting for a
Pacific commerce	ORGANIZATION	and a
Pacific	LOCATION	armament , is quietly pushing her outposts into the coveted penin - sula ; and , as against her , the interests of
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	would seem to coincide .

		Says Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	: '' That the true policy for
Japan	LOCATION	, ignoring tradition and history and burying national antipathies , is a friendly understanding with
China	LOCATION	, interesting herself in keeping at a distance the common peril namely , the advance of the Muscovite from the north appears to me self-evi - dent , and is , I believe appreciated by her own statesmen . ''

		Every Japanese minister has , however , in shaping his course now , to reckon with a large and aggressive body of his countrymen , who , when their '' patriotic '' instincts are touched , '' are apt to respond by going stark mad . ''

		To the latter phenomenon Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	ascribes the present conflict in
Korea	LOCATION	; and he adds : '' In the event of open war
Japan	LOCATION	can not , in my judg - ment , escape the blame of provocation , and will , in the long run , be the sufferer by the issue . ''

		Touching the merits of the Korean dispute , it may be said , broadly , that while
Japan	LOCATION	's claims , technically surrendered but popularly held to , to ascendancy in the peninsula are supported by priority in time ,
China	LOCATION	's rest on the firmer ground of community of language , of manners , and of religion , as well as on ter - ritorial connection .


Japan	LOCATION	's claim dates back to the
third century	DATE	A. D. , when an Amazonian Empress-Regent -LRB- appropriately named Jingo -RRB- led an expedition into
Korea	LOCATION	, and received its submission .

		Up to the end of the fourteenth century
Korea	LOCATION	remained tributary ; and there thus grew up in most Japanese minds the abid - ing conviction that to give up this suzerainty meant an indelible stain on the national honor .

		The substantial results of the feudal relation dwindled away , however , in time , into a barren exchange of compliment ; and in
1876 Japan	LOCATION	, exhausted by her civil wars , prudently closed a treaty with
Korea	LOCATION	, in which was embodied the pregnant statement that '' Chosen , being an independent
State	ORGANIZATION	, enjoys the same sover - eign rights as does
Japan	LOCATION	'' an admission fool - ishly winked at by
China	LOCATION	'' from the mistaken notion that by disavowing her connection with
Korea	LOCATION	she could escape the unpleasantness of being called to account for the delinquencies of her vassal . ''

		By the
Convention of Tient	ORGANIZATION	- sin -LRB- 1885 -RRB- , following the revolution in Soul , the rival nations agreed for the future not to send an armed force to
Korea	LOCATION	to suppress do - mestic disorder , without giving previous notice to each other .

		Says our author : '' This document was a second diplomatic triumph for
Japan	LOCATION	; for , whilst it was safe to aver that neither Power would ever be seriously deterred thereby from hostile action , it yet involved the very admission of sub - stantial equality of rights as regards
Korea	LOCATION	, which
Japan	LOCATION	had all along been laboring to reassert , and which
China	LOCATION	, except in the moments when she had been caught nap - ping , had as consistently repudiated . ''

		It should be noted that while
Japan	LOCATION	, in
1876	DATE	, formally relinquished her shadowy feudal claim -LRB- born of aggression and weakened by time -RRB- upon
Korea	LOCATION	, she has since pursued with unflag - ging energy the more substantial goal of com - mercial and fiscal control in the peninsula .

		Her colonists and merchants , possessed of capital and understanding the use of it , have fastened a grip upon the unwary and indolent Koreans that will be hard to shake off .

		The mint and the banks are in their hands , and the Govern - ment is in their debt ; and -LRB- leaving the pos - sible fruits of the war out of the count -RRB- every - thing seems to indicate that in a few years ' time the Japanese will have obtained a mastery of the resources of
Korea	LOCATION	that will render , as Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	thinks , '' her political dependence | upon
China	LOCATION	a constitutional fiction which the wisdom born of accomplished facts may ulti - mately allow to expire . ''


Japan	LOCATION	has definite ambitions ; and it may be that the recent ad - vance on
Korea	LOCATION	is as much a bold move in the line of her general policy as a mere piece of ministerial Jinesse calculated for home effect .

		The role she aspires to play in the
Far East	LOCATION	is determined by her geographical situation .

		THE DIAL 193 '' Placed at a maritime coign of vantage upon the flank of
Asia	LOCATION	, precisely analogous to that occupied by
Great Britain	LOCATION	on the flank of
Europe	LOCATION	, exercising a pow - erful influence over the adjoining continent , but not nec - essarily involved in its responsibilities , she sets before herself the supreme ambition of becoming , on a smaller scale , the
Britain	LOCATION	of the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		... If she can but intimidate any would-be enemy from attempting a landing on her shores , and can fly an unchallenged flag over the surrounding waters , while from her own re - sources she provides occupation , sustenance , clothing , and wages for her people , she will fulfil her role in the international politics of the future . ''

		To readers interested in the more serious side of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	life , and in its political problems , Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's book is indispensable .

		His treat - ment of
Japan	LOCATION	is , as said , purely political .

		The excellent chapters on

		Mr.

E. G. J. BARTLETT	PERSON	'S CONCORDANCE TO SHAKESPEARE .

		* The Works of Shakespeare have been , per - haps , more completely laid open , in respect to his vocabulary , his phraseology , every feature of his language-shaping , his every thought and sentiment , than those of any other modern au - thor ; it may , indeed , be quite safe to say , than those of any ancient classic , Greek or Roman .

		Before noticing the work whose title heads this article , a cursory glance at previous works of the same class seems to be called for .

		More than a hundred years ago namely , in
1790	DATE	was published , as a companion volume to an edition of
Shakespeare 's Dramatic Works	ORGANIZATION	in two volumes royal octavo , published by
John Stockdale	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	, '' An Index to the remark - able Passages and Words made use of by Shake - speare ... By the Rev.
Samuel Ayscough	PERSON	, F.S.A. and assistant librarian of the British Museum . ''

		-LRB- There was a
Dublin	LOCATION	edition in
1791	DATE	, and there were
London	LOCATION	editions in
1807	DATE	,
1827	DATE	, and
1842	DATE	. -RRB-

		The references in this Index are to the play , act , and scene , and to page , * A NEW AND COMPLETE CONCORDANCE , or Verbal Index , to Words , Phrases , and Passages in the
Dramatic Works of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		With a Supplementary Concordance to the Poems .

John Bartlett	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, Fellow of the Academy of Arts and Sciences .


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		column , and line , of
Stockdale	ORGANIZATION	's Shakespeare .

		The passages given in connection with the index-word generally make complete sense in themselves .

		There are in all somewhere be - tween forty and fifty thousand references .

		Ays - cough was a skilled and experienced index - maker ; and this
Shakespeare Index	ORGANIZATION	is a very creditable piece of pioneer work .

		It was , at the time , up to the demands of Shakespearean study .

		In
1805	DATE	-
7	DATE	was published , in two octavo volumes , in
London	LOCATION	, '' A Complete Verbal In - dex to the Plays of Shakespeare : adapted to all editions .

		Comprehending every substan - tive , adjective , verb , participle , and adverb , used by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	; with a distinct refer - ence to every individual passage in which each word occurs .

		By
Francis Twiss	PERSON	. ''

		This is now a scarce work , as , according to Thimm 's Shake - speariana , 542 copies of an impression of 750 were destroyed by the fire at
Bensley	ORGANIZATION	's , the printer , in
1807	DATE	.

		A curious fact in connection with it , especially curious to Shakespeareans of the present day , is the ill-natured opinion ex - pressed in '' The Eclectic Review '' for Jan - uary ,
1807	DATE	, in regard to the homage to Shake - speare implied in such an Index .

		The compiler is reprehended for '' the misapplication of his time and talents to that blind devotion which fashion requires to be paid at the shrine of Shakespeare by everyone who makes the slight - est pretensions to refinement of taste . ''

		I have never seen a copy of this work , and can not speak of its merits .

		But it probably does not even approach a realization of what is set forth in the title .

		In
1845	DATE	, Mrs.
Mary Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	pub - lished her '' Complete Concordance to Shake - speare : being a verbal index to all the passages in the dramatic works of the poet . ''

		This Con - cordance was the result of '' sixteen years ' as - siduous labour , '' as stated by the author in the preface , '' the twelve years ' writing , and the four more bestowed on collating with recent editions and correcting the press . ''

		This was regarded at the time of its publication , and long after , as a final work .

		It was not sup - posed that Shakespearian study would ever de - mand anything more complete .

		If there had been , when Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	entered upon her long labor , a standard numbering of the lines of scenes , as has since been established by the '' Globe ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	, and had she given the latter in connection with act and scene , very little more could ever have been desired in a concordance .

		The omission of 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, certain particles , which the progress of English philology has brought into importance , might have been supplied ; but it would hardly have been necessary to do the whole work over .

		In
1874	DATE	was published by
J. B. Lippincott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, '' A Concordance to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Poems : an Index to every word therein contained .

		By Mrs.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	. ''

		This is the completest concordance ever prepared to any work .

		Every word , with - out a single exception , and every passage in which it occurs in the several poems , is given .

		Even the prepositive to of infinitives is re - corded as a separate word .

		That nothing may be wanted to the convenience of the stu - dent , the Poems themselves are reprinted at the end .

		As a justification of her recording every word , and every passage in which it oc - curs , the author says in her preface : '' As it is impossible to limit the purposes for which the language of Shakespeare may be studied , or to say that the time will not come , if it has not already , when his use of every part of speech , down to the humblest conjunction , will be criticised with as much nicety as has been bestowed upon Greek and Latin authors , it seems to me that , in the selection of words to be recorded , no discretionary powers should be granted to the ' harmless drudge ' compiling a concordance . ''

		In
1874	DATE	- '75 appeared in
Berlin	LOCATION	, in two vol - umes royal octavo , what was at the time , and continues to be , the most valuable contribution of German scholarship to Shakespearean study : namely , Dr.
Alexander Schmidt	PERSON	's `` Shake - speare Lexicon ; a complete dictionary of all the English words , phrases , and constructions in the works of the poet . ''

		No student could use this work long without an ever-increasing wonder at its thoroughness , at the sagacity of the author , at his susceptibility , as a foreigner , to the varied forces and colorings of words , the definitions of which are as exact as definitions can well be ; and the passages cited from the Plays , and those simply referred to , abundantly illustrate all the varied forces and colorings defined .

		* * A letter written me by Dr.
Schmidt	PERSON	, nearly eighteen years ago -LRB- 5th
October	DATE	, 1876 -RRB- , so admirably sets forth one impor - tant aim of such a work as his , that a passage from the letter may well be quoted here : '' Your kind letter gave me the greatest pleasure , ... as it was the first proof of a full and clear perception and appre - ciation of what my
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	- Lexicon was intended to be , namely , ' an approach toward a science of interpretation and emendation . '

		All the reviews of the book that I have seen in English and German periodicals praise it , to be sure , for its completeness , but apparently without being aware why In
1879	DATE	was published '' The Shakespeare Key : unlocking the treasures of his style , elu - cidating the peculiarities of his construction , and displaying the beauties of his expression ; forming a companion to ' The Complete Con - cordance to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	. '

		By
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Cowden	PERSON	-
Clarke	PERSON	. ''

		* This work aptly closed the long and indefatigable
Shakespear	PERSON	- ean labors of Charles and
Mary Cowden	PERSON	-
Clarke	PERSON	.

		It forms , as they state in their pre - face , the condensed result of these loving - labors , '' Wherewith , affectionately and grate - fully , we take our leave . ''


Charles Cowden	PERSON	-
Clarke	PERSON	died , at a very advanced age , before the work was committed to the press ; and in an '' Added Preface , '' by the survivor of the author-pair , dated
Villa Novello	PERSON	,
Genoa	LOCATION	,
1879	DATE	, she states that during the suspension imposed upon its production in print , by illness and death , a comprehensive Lexicon was brought out -LRB- she alludes to Dr.
Schmidt	PERSON	's * '' Shake - speare Lexicon '' -RRB- , which included many ver - bal points discussed in their work ; and she re - solved to sacrifice these points , amounting to no fewer than 630 pages of the manuscript , and to make the Key a work of reference strictly to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's style .

		But a hasty glance over the book will show that , while it presents all the wondrously magnified features of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's diction , with quite exhaust - ive illustrations of each , drawn from the en - tire body of his dramas and poems , a diction this completeness deserves any praise , and why it is not enough , for the purposes of criticism , to know only what is
Shakespearean	LOCATION	, without knowing what is un-Shakespearean .

		Indeed , completeness , absolute completeness , is the highest praise that such a work can possibly earn , and if mine should really deserve it , I should confidently hope that it would be ' sere perennius ' in spite of never so many deficiencies of de - tail which have been pointed out and complacently dwelled on by some critics . ''

		A complete and thorough knowledge of all the peculiar - ities of an author 's language will always afford the best se - curity against that spirit of innovation , that practice of ' cut - ting and slashing , ' in which the editors of Shakespeare have hitherto indulged , and which is contrary to all true principles -LRB- of criticism .

		If I am not wholly mistaken , there begin to ap - pear some signs indicating that a better state is at hand . ''

		* The MS. of this work is now in the library of
Cornell Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , having been presented to the
University	ORGANIZATION	by Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	, when I was on a visit to her , at the
Villa Novello	PERSON	, in
1889	DATE	.

		The presentation inscription reads : `` This fair copy of our ` Shakespeare Key ' -LRB- including the numerous pages that were cancelled when the Work was printed -RRB- , written by the loved hand of
Charles Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	, is presented to the
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- through my kind and valued friend , Professor
Hiram Corson	PERSON	-RRB- by
Mary Cowden	PERSON	-
Clarke	PERSON	. ''

		Villa Novello :
Genoa	LOCATION	,
October , 1889	DATE	. ''

		The MS. consists of several thousand large pages , in the beautiful `` round hand '' of
Charles Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	, which Lamb described as '' the clear , firm , impossible-to-be-mis - taken schoolmaster text-hand . ''

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 195 which , in the contriving spirit of its eloquence , is without a parallel in the world 's literatures , it does far more than this ; and the student may consult the work and find answers to num - berless questions that may arise in his study of the plays , outside of its professed scope .

		In
1881	DATE	was published , in
1034	DATE	octavo pages , '' The Shakespeare Phrase Book , '' by
John Bartlett	PERSON	, author of the new Concordance , an admirable piece of work of its kind .

		As stated in the prefa
< %	PERCENT	'' this book is intended to be an index of the phraseology of Shakespeare ; a concordance of phrases rather than of words . ''

		We now come , at last , to the magnum opws which is destined to supersede all other pre - vious works of the kind , and to maintain its preeminence in the remote future :
Bartlett	PERSON	's Concordance .

		As stated in the prefatory Note , `` this Concordance , begun in
1876	DATE	, was pre - pared from the text of the ' Globe ' edition of Shakespeare -LRB- 1875 -RRB- ; but as new readings have since been introduced into the text of the later issues , the manuscript has been revised and col - lated with the latest edition -LRB- 1891 -RRB- . ''

		As a monument of labor , of '' patient continuance in well doing , '' it equals , if it does not surpass , the great folio '' Concordantiffi Bibliorvm vtrivs - qve Testamenti , Veteris et
Novi	ORGANIZATION	, ...
Editio Novissima	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lvgdvni , M.DC.XVI . ''

		No ac - knowledgment of help is made in Mr.
Bart	PERSON	- lett 's prefatory Note , in which he states that '' the work has been prepared chiefly in the leisure taken from active duties , and from time to time has been delayed by other avoca - tions . ''

		But the dedicatory inscription reveals a kind of help which every literary man who has been blessed with it knows to be the most encouraging and sustaining : `` Affectionately inscribed to my wife , whose ever-ready assist - ance in the preparation of this book has made my labour a pastime . ''

		This Concordance is superior to all previous works of the kind , in that it gives : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Pas - sages in which the head - words occur , of such length , for the most part , as make them inde - pendent of the context .

		The narrower columns of Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	's Concordance -LRB- they being but one-fourth the width of a royal oc - tavo page -RRB- , and the passages being always con - fined to one line , do not generally admit of this .

		The passages given in
Bartlett	PERSON	often run over into the following line of a column almost dou - ble the width .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Along with act and scene , the number of the line in the scene , according to that of the '' Globe '' edition .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- '' Select examples of the verbs to be , to do , to have , may , and their tenses , and the auxiliary verb to let ; of the adjectives , much , many , more , most , and many adverbs ; and of pronouns , prepositions , interjections , and conjunctions . ''

		But -LRB- and these omissions are somewhat to be regretted -RRB- '' the definite and indefinite articles , the , a , an ; the words , a \ ah , an -LSB- if ~ \ , and , ... are not included among the index - words . ''

		A reference to these words in Dr.
Schmidt	PERSON	's `` Shakespeare Lexicon '' will show uses in many instances more or less distinct from the present .

		It would have been well , also , to give , as a sep - arate index-word , the prepositive to of infini - tives , with all the passages wherein its force in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's English differs from that of the present ; e. g. , '' To fright you thus methinks I am too savage '' -LRB-
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	, IV. , 2 , 70 -RRB- , To being the exponent of the direction of sav - age .

		-LRB- See its various forces as presented by Abbott . -RRB-

		There are several uses of as in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, and in Elizabethan English generally , of which it would have been well to give all the exam - ples which occur in the Plays and Poems ; to note one only , its use before adverbs , and ad - verbial phrases , of time , as it is still used be - fore yet .

		Bartlett gives two examples , under the word , of this use : '' one Lucio as then the messenger '' -LRB- Meas.for Meas. , V. , 1 , 74 -RRB- ; '' I writ to
Romeo	LOCATION	, that he should hither come as this dire night '' -LRB- J ?

		.

		and J. , V. , 3 , 247 -RRB- .

		But there are numerous others .

		There is one in '' The Tempest , '' where some editors put a comma after as , and thus make a non sequitur of the expression : '' as at that time through all the signories it was the first . ''

		This use is represented as redundant .

		But it is not re - dundant .

		It imparts a precision to the idea of time which it qualifies , and is about equiv - alent to '' just '' ; e. g. , '' as now '' = '' just now '' ; '' as then '' = '' just then . ''

		There are '' many such - like as ` es of great charge '' which it would have been well to include .

		-LRB- See
Schmidt	PERSON	's ''
Shakespeare Lexicon	PERSON	, '' s. t 1 . -RRB-

		Again , there are numerous instances , in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, of the use of the article a or an , to express definite unity , as opposed to the indefinite unity which it usually expresses , and all these it would have been well to include in such a Concordance ; e. g. , '' An two men ride of a horse one must ride behind '' -LRB- Much Ado , III. , 5 , 40 -RRB- ; '' For in a night the best part of my power , ... Were in the Washes all unwarily Devoured by the unexpected flood '' -LRB- 7T .

		John , V. , 7 , 61 -RRB- ; '' you , or any living man , may be drunk at a time , man '' -LRB- Othello , II. , 3 , 310 -RRB- ; '' Hear me 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, one word : Beseech you , tribunes , hear me but a word '' -LRB- Coriolanus , III. , 1 , 266 -RRB- .

		Sed hcec hactenus .

		To call attention to any deficiencies in a work of such magnificent ful - ness may be regarded as captious , as demand - ing '' better bread than what is made of wheat . ''

		Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	's Concordance consists of 2,578 columns , containing 309,000 lines and the same number of references , one line and no more being invariably devoted to each pas - sage and a designation of the play , the act , and scene to which it belongs .

		Bartlett 's
Concord	LOCATION	- ance consists of 3,820 columns , of 110 lines each , with the exception of those of the first and the last page which have 77 and 82 lines respectively , the whole number of lines being 420,078 .

		But the number of references does not , as in Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	's Concordance , correspond with the number of lines , for the passages given often run over into the follow - ing line .

		The references in
Bartlett	LOCATION	's Con - cordance may safely be said to exceed those in Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	's by a hundred thousand .

		endom , '' is conceived ; and both those who sympa - thize with his general attitude towards Christianity and those who do not will be alike interested in hearing what he has to say .

		The keynote of the book is struck in the answer to the question , Are we Agnostics ?

		No , is the emphatic reply .

		Man must be fed upon affirmations , not negations .

		Whatever knowledge may be otherwise denied us , , this is certain : the difference between right and wrong is fundamental , and .

		the service of society is the highest form of human life .

		For himself , therefore , the author rejects the name Agnostic , which calls attention to what we do not know , and if he must wear a label , prefers the use of the ad - jective ethical , which indicates the nature of his practical ideals .

		These latter are summed up in the words which he twice quotes from Tourgue ` nieff : '' My faith is in civilization , and I require no other creed . ''

		This civilization may properly be called Christian , because the essence of Christianity , he tells us , is the belief in a divine -LRB- i. e. , supersensuous -RRB- element in man , and in the establishment of the fu - ture golden age on earth .

		And these are truths that can never perish .

		Our author holds , with not a few good churchmen , that Humanity is sufficient unto itself ; that is to say , man has the seeds of virtue as well as of vice within himself .

		For the process which the
Church	ORGANIZATION	calls regeneration , set the intelligent and patient culture of the emotions and the will ; in place of the prayer for grace , `` open - ness to all influences which help the spiritual frame of mind . ''

		Above all , never doubt that what is best in life can be other than a permanent element in human nature , let creeds and systems crumble as they will .

		Evil there undoubtedly is in the world , enough of it and to spare ; and more particularly in the presence of suffering the '' mere moralist '' often finds himself at a loss for words of comfort which would flow readily from Christian lips .

		But while this can not but be depressing , he looks forward to the possibilities of the prevention of most forms of evil with a faith unknown to the past . ''

		We look to moral prevention rather than to moral cure . ''

		Man , then , is thrown back upon himself for the realization of his ideals .

		And yet he does not work all unaided .

		Through and under all the phenomena of human life Mr.
Bosanquet	PERSON	finds traces of the workings of '' the power , not ourselves , that makes for righteousness . '' ''

		The world is friendly and kindred to ourselves ... and whatever fate may be in store for the race , we can yet do , in spite of it , something worth doing . ''

		In no part of the book will be found a set presentation of the author 's creed as a whole .

		The very meagre outline just given is put together from remarks for the most part dropped by the way , in his discussion of various concrete problems of practical life .

		Some of these discus - sions are devoted to problems which concern more particularly
the Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	which he himself represents .

		Other discussions deal with subjects we all have to think upon , ranging from the rela - tion between liberty and legislation to training in
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19T the art of enjoyment .

		Whatever the attitude to - ward the author 's confession of faith , no reader can fail to carry away with him a profound impression of the intensity of Mr.
Bosanquet	PERSON	's moral earnest - ness and the depth of his moral insight .


Earnest	LOCATION	- ness and enthusiasm , in fact , form the dominant note throughout , and the written word owes much of its power to the character it all unconsciously reveals .

		The volume entitled '' Questions of the Day , '' by the Rev.
David James Vaughan	PERSON	, consists of twenty - four sermons delivered in
Leicester	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		The subjects discussed are mainly the old social prob - lems which seem to cling to the back of the age with the tenacity of Sinbad 's Old Man of the Sea .

		The church is gradually losing its '' otherworldliness , '' and is learning that the kingdom of God is some - thing to be established here on this earth of ours , and that the Christian is called upon to work for its coming .

		This view we find clearly enunciated by the author in his chapter on the
City of God	ORGANIZATION	.

		But that is about all that can be said for the book .

		No use is made of this conception in the solution of concrete present-day problems .

		And the reader who is only moderately acquainted with the litera - ture of social reform will not merely find nothing new in this volume , he will even fail to discover any traces of the thought and the observation of others .

		For instance , in his discussion of the rela - tions of labor and capital , the author does not be - tray the slightest acquaintance with the profound principle which was enunciated by
Comte	ORGANIZATION	and might be so impressively urged by the representative of him who taught '' Love thy neighbor as thyself , '' the principle , namely , that every person who lives by useful labor should be habituated to regard him - self as a public servant , working not merely for himself but for the benefit of society .

		The only light our author seems to be able to shed upon these vexed problems is that wealth does not necessarily imply happiness and honor , nor does work imply misery and degradation .

		Unimpeachable truths these .

		But one does not pay a dollar and a half for a book merely to have this sort of information ladled out to him .

		`` The Ethics of Hegel '' is not a new work on the famous German philosopher , but a translation into English of his most important contributions to the theory of morals , accompanied by the necessary in - troductory and expository matter .

		The body of the book consists of an abridgment of the '' Philosophy of Rights , '' comprising about one-half of the orig - inal work , together with a few scattered selections from other writings .

		This work of abridgment has been done with excellent judgment .

		Sometimes several successive paragraphs are summarized in a few brief sentences , while details which are not necessary to an understanding of the general move - ment of thought have simply been omitted .

		The former expedient , however , has been resorted to with great caution , and for the most part the reader has
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	's own words before him .

		We can only regret that what for the .

		beginner is the most valu - able part of the entire Philosophic des Rechts , namely , the Introduction , should have been com - pressed into so small a space .

		Very great difficul - ties have of course been experienced in the work of translation .

		The result is worthy of all commenda - tion .

		The number of Germanisms is surprisingly small , considering the nature of the original ; and while a few sentences come out obscure in the trans - lation which are clear in the German , the general tendency is decidedly the other way .

		To such a degree is this the case that even the student well - trained in reading German will find it advantageous to have a copy of this book by his side when work - ing through the Philosophic des Rechts for the first time .

		One slight change would have made the book far more valuable to the student who does not hap - pen to be able to refer to the original .

		The ex - pressions an sich , fur sich , and an und fi'ir sich , representing as they do successive phases in the de - velopment of the concept , have for
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	a very definite signification .

		But in translating it has been found impossible to find for them any single equiv - alent , so that they are translated now by one word , now by another .

		The consequence is that some one of these phases is frequently referred to without there being any mark by which it could possibly be recognized as such .

		Objectionable as the practice ordinarily is , and much as it disfigures the page , the student would have been saved a great deal of labor if in these cases the German equivalents had been placed in brackets in the text .

		The Introduc - tion , which occupies almost a third of the book , is not as satisfactory as the other parts .

		It must be re - membered that the volume under review announces itself as especially intended for college students , and the Introduction , we are told , '' has been made sufficiently popular for all persons interested in ethical thought . ''

		And yet , after this noble declara - tion of principles , little care seems to have been taken to avoid technical terms and formulae .

		For instance , the constantly recurring phrase `` universal - ization of the will '' is unintelligible to anyone but a student of
Kant	PERSON	or of his successors .

		Consider the state of mind of an average youth of twenty - one , who , on making his first bow to the Kantian system , should be informed , in order to remove his natural feeling of shyness , that ''
Kant	PERSON	considers the will of subjective man in unattainable identity with the universal will of the transcendent intelligible world . ''

		The entire introductory portion seems to us to show the most extraordinary ignorance of what the college student or , for that matter , the begin - ner in ethics , whatever his age is prepared to un - derstand .

		It is therefore in large part useless ; for whoever is capable of understanding it does not re - quire it , and he who is not well , he can read and wonder .

		There is , however , one oasis in the desert .

		A list is given of the Hegelian key-words that will appear in the text , together with the translation adopted and an explanation of their significance .

		The student will find this of a great deal of value .

		198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, To have been complete , the list should have con - tained an exposition of the meaning of the term freedom as used by
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		As here found , it is sure to mislead the student who is familiar with it only as he has met with it in the writings of English moralists .

		What has been said in criticism of the introduc - tory portion of the `` Ethics of Hegel '' applies only '' more so '' to Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	's '' Syllabus of Ethics . ''

		We have here presented us a brief out - line of the Hegelian theory of morals , written ap - parently for young people , certainly for beginners .

		The book represents , we are told in the Preface , the outgrowth of work done during several years in the
St. Louis High School	ORGANIZATION	.

		For our part , we should say the book represents the period in educational practice when the pupil was introduced to the mys - teries of the English language under the gentle guidance of
Gould Brown	PERSON	, and when the study of geography was begun by an examination of the principal political divisions of the
Eastern Conti	ORGANIZATION	- nent .

		We do not mean that it is impossible to com - municate to young students the fundamental con - ceptions of the Hegelian ethics .

		But in so doing it is absolutely necessary to begin with those elements of their moral experience which are , so to speak , most familiar to them , and which lend themselves most easily to analysis .

		These must be dealt with at such length and in such simple language that at the conclusion every abstract term stands with the student for one or more concrete facts .

		And where space is limited , completeness in treatment must be ruthlessly sacrificed to this principle .

		How much is expected from the hapless American youth may be gathered from the fact that he is earnestly ad - vised to begin by making a careful study of
Schweg	LOCATION	- ler 's '' History of Philosophy , '' in order that he may become acquainted with the various philosophical positions .

		As well expect a schoolboy just grad - uated in algebra to get an understanding of qua - ternions by the perusal of a history of mathematics .

		The u Syllabus of Ethics '' is chiefly valuable as supplying one more proof of the undeniable supe - riority of the primary school of to-day , in all that concerns methods , over the average department of philosophy . ''

		Ethics and the New Education , '' another pam - phlet by the same author , is a rather more satisfac - tory production .

		It is the reproduction of an ad - dress originally delivered before the
St. Louis Society of Pedagogy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It may be taken as a state - ment of such portions of his creed as the writer himself a teacher feels will be of most interest and value to those engaged in the work of educa - tion .

		The most important point made is that since man is '' made perfect through suffering ' ' and through suffering alone , it is a great mistake on the part of the leaders of the '' new education '' to suppose that all school - work can or should be made wholly pleas - urable .

		This idea seems well worthy of considera - tion .

		In its reaction from the harsh and unsym - pathetic regime of the past , the present is in danger of rushing to the other extreme .

		The vast majority of people are so situated that they can not be '' car - ried to the skies on flowery beds of ease , '' and if the school-boy and school-girl are to be prepared for life , their power to endure must not be left wholly undeveloped .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		An admirable Mr -
John Fiske	PERSON	has deserved well of School History his fellow-countrymen for his contri - oftheUniied ` states .

		^ ui ^ ons to sc i en tific investigation in several fields , historical and philosophical .

		His sev - eral volumes upon American history have both scholarly breadth and charm , and fairly entitle him to be ranked with the four or five great American historians .

		But we are inclined to think that he has done a still greater service to knowledge , al - though a more unobtrusive one , in the preparation of two text-books for the common schools the '' Civil Government '' of two or three years ago , and the '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	for Schools '' now published -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Of the former work we may say that it has been everywhere recognized as so much the best treatment of its subject for the purposes of elementary instruction that it stands without a rival in helpfulness .

		Much the same sort of praise must be given to the present '' History . ''

		It is such easy reading that it may seem at first to have been equally easy writing , and only a trained eye will realize the amount of nice discrimination , of careful selection , and of sound generalization compressed into its pages .

		The general reader will find it fascinating , and the practiced teacher will recognize in it a tool of the finest temper and the most perfect adjustment .

		Aside from this general praise , which we can not make too ungrudging , we must give special commendation to some of the spe - cial features of the book .

		The illustrations are of such a nature as really to illustrate the text ; adven - titious adornment of the page has been as far as pos - sible from the aim of the author in their selection .

		The selection and execution of the maps is such as to entitle them to a share of this praise .

		The ap - paratus of '' Topics and Questions , '' contributed by Dr.
Frank A. Hill	PERSON	, at least doubles the value of the work to a teacher who has any business to be teaching the subject at all .

		The suggestions for collateral reading are judicious , and draw upon a collection of books not beyond the reach of any modestly-equipped school .

		Finally , the appendix contains just the documents and tables most useful in such a book .

		The list of novels and poems re - lating to American history , for example , supplies an adjunct for which students and teachers will alike be thankful .

		Our praise of the book in all its main features is so cordially intended that we hes - itate to mar it by pointing out a few minor defects .

		The following points , however , have occurred to us
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 199 as deserving momentary attention .

		We read -LRB- p. 60 -RRB- that '' slaves were brought here from
Africa	LOCATION	until the year
1808	DATE	. ''

		This misleading statement is sup - plemented later -LRB- p. 347 -RRB- , but should not have been allowed to stand in the first instance .

		To say that the Pocahontas story is '' doubted by some people '' -LRB- p. 68 -RRB- is hardly adequate , after Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's con - vincing exposure of the mendacity of the narrator .

		We regret to see that Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	gives countenance to the
San Francisco Vigilants	LOCATION	by saying : '' Honest citizens were obliged to organize vigilance commit - tees to deal quickly and sharply with criminals '' -LRB- p. 329 -RRB- .

		The statement -LRB- p. 399 -RRB- that the Fif - teenth Amendment '' guaranteed to all adult male negroes the right of voting '' is of course inaccurate , and the statement -LRB- p. 406 -RRB- that in
1884	DATE	the Inde - pendent Republicans supported Mr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	'' be - lieving that the cause of civil service reform would not prosper with
Elaine	PERSON	'' is at least inadequate .

		Last of all , we note the inaccuracy of saying -LRB- p. 409 -RRB- that the Sherman Act of
1890	DATE	made '' the coinage of not less than
$ 4,000,000	MONEY	in silver each month compulsory . ''

		These matters are trifling , but they should be corrected in the next edition .

		The reading required for the coming A year of reading / , i ^ ti T .

		, for Chautauquans .

		y ear f the Chautauqua Literary and
Scientific Circle	ORGANIZATION	has just been issued from the
Chautauqua-Century Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Flood & Vin - cent -RRB- , in a series of five neat volumes .

		Professor
W. H. Goodyear	PERSON	is the author of a treatise on '' Ren - aissance and Modern Art , '' in which a rapid survey is taken of schools and tendencies from the
early fifteenth century	DATE	to the present time .

		This volume is printed on smooth paper , and the illustrations are many , although their reproduction leaves much to be desired .

		The history is certainly up to date , for it includes the art of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Science is represented in this series of manuals by a new edition , revised by Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, of
Alexander Winchell	PERSON	's '' Walks and Talks in the
Geological Field	LOCATION	. ''

		Dr.
Winchell	PERSON	wrote this book for Chautauquans , and their demand for a new edi - tion shows that it found an appreciative circle of readers . ''

		From Chaucer to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' by Pro- fessor
Henry A. Beers	PERSON	, affords a basis for the strictly literary study of the year .

		One can hardly be other than conventional within the narrow limits of such a volume , made even narrower by devoting a third of the space to selections .

		The author has made a compact but readable little book .

		A history of '' The Growth of the English Nation '' has been un - dertaken by Miss
Katharine Coman	PERSON	and Miss Eliz - abeth
Kendall	PERSON	, both of
Wellesley College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The re - sult is a good compilation , based upon good author - ities , although the closing pages are marred by a too pronounced radicalism .

		As for the cuts , we are inclined to think the book would have done better with no illustrations than with such abortive sketches as disfigure its text .

		The best of these five books , on the whole , and the most needed by the general reader , is Professor
H. P. Judson	PERSON	's ''
Europe	LOCATION	in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It covers much the same ground as Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's admirable book upon the same subject , but the new treatment is more up to date , and has classifications and differentia of its own that quite justify its existence .

		We might question a few minor points , such as the misleading statements as to the meaning of Irish Home Rule , the tendency to Gladstone-worship , and the assump - tion that the sensational view of Russian despotism is in all respects valid .

		We miss also the note of indignation which should not be spared in such a matter as the Napoleonic usurpation of
1851	DATE	, or the German spoliation of the French provinces
twenty years later	DATE	.

		But for a book which raises nearly all the great European `` questions of the day '' it ex - hibits a more than usual degree of judiciousness .

		On the
24th of June , 1794	DATE	, Bowdoin c iie s e received its charter ' si s ned by Governor
Samuel Adams	PERSON	, from the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The present year is consequently the centennial of the institu - tion , and the event is commemorated by expansion of the catalogue into a portly volume , containing a history , full lists of faculties and alumni , and other matter of interest to those connected with the insti - tution .

		Librarian
George T. Little	PERSON	is the writer of the history , and the editor of the volume as a whole .

		Mr.
Little	PERSON	's historical sketch makes very interest - ing reading .

		It is curious , in this age of magnifi - cent educational foundations , to read of a profes - sorship of modern languages being endowed with the modest sum of one thousand dollars , and of a mathe - matical chair endowed with only three thousand .

		But it was the day of small beginnings , and few colleges have shown as clearly as
Bowdoin	ORGANIZATION	how fruitful small endowments may become .

		The honorable record of
Bowdoin	LOCATION	, together with the many distinguished names found in its class and faculty lists , afford elo - quent testimony to the usefulness of the small col - lege in American life .

		Of Bowdoin professors may be named
Alpheus S. Packard	PERSON	,
Henry W. Longfel	PERSON	- low , and
Mark Hopkins	PERSON	, among the dead ; Profes - sors
E. S. Morse	PERSON	,
G. T. Ladd	PERSON	, and
C. C. Everett	PERSON	, among the living .

		In our issue of
September 1	DATE	was re - viewed at length the opening instal - ment of `` The Memoirs of the Baron de Me ` neval '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Volume III. , now ready , bears out our characterization of the work as `` one of the fullest , freshest , and , in point of narrative , most trustworthy '' records of Napoleonic times .

		Opening with an account of the Emperor 's visit to
Dresden	LOCATION	, in
1812	DATE	, and of the Russian campaign , the author sketches broadly yet suggestively such lead - ing events as the battles of Lutzen .


Dresden	LOCATION	,
Leip	PERSON	- sic , and
Waterloo	LOCATION	, the return from
Elba	PERSON	, and the attendant diplomatic transactions ; and he closes with a touching retrospect of the closing days at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		Summarizing , Me ` neval finds two primary causes which prevented the consolidation of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	-
Addilional Napoleonic Memoirs	ORGANIZATION	.

		200 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, leon 's empire : first , the hatred of the old dynasties for the French Revolution , after they once clearly discerned its propagandist tendencies ; and , second ,
England	LOCATION	's victories on the sea .

		Auxiliary to these main causes were : the execution of d'Enghien ; the reverses in
Spain	LOCATION	; the campaign in
Russia	LOCATION	; and , finally , treachery at home `` treachery , timid and underground at first , but hardy in the end , and stalking abroad with uplifted head . ''

		In the front rank of the traitors were
Talleyrand	LOCATION	and
Fouch	PERSON	< ^ the former , the last representative of the grand seigneurs , supple , insinuating , circumspect , always master of himself , grown gray in political perfidies ; the latter , the once fiery demagogue who had ex - changed the Jacobin red cap for a coronet , '' a fool - hardy marplot who needed intrigue as he needed air to breathe . ''

		It is especially against these men , concludes Me ` neval , that
Napoleon	PERSON	launched his anathema , when , on leaving for the last time the shores of
France	LOCATION	, he cried out : '' Farewell thou land of heroes ... farewell thou dear
France	LOCATION	; a few traitors the less and thou wouldst still be the great nation , the mistress of the world . ''

		The vol - ume contains a portrait of
Marie Louise	PERSON	, and sev - eral interesting letters , in facsimile , are appended .

		The second volume in the pretty '' Far and Feather '' series -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- is devoted to that patrician game-bird , '' The Grouse . ''

		The Rev.
H. A. Mac	PERSON	- pherson treats of its '' Natural History , '' and the chapters on `` Shooting '' and `` Cookery '' are done by Messrs.
A. J. Stuart	PERSON	-
Wortley	PERSON	and
George Saintsbury	PERSON	, respectively .

		While Mr.
Stuart-Wort	PERSON	- ley 's quota is well written -LRB- notably a graphic de - scription of a night 's trip on the '' Scotch Mail '' -RRB- , it does not strike us as at all likely to add to the repute of the British sportsman who appears therein in the light of an arrant pot-hunter , without the pot-hunter 's excuse for his atrocities .

		Much of the space is given to a peculiarly aggravated form of bird-butchery known as '' driving . ''

		We can not follow the writer into the details of this organized mode of slaughtering the innocents , but its essen - tials are simple enough : a line or so of '' butts '' -LRB- ramparts of stone and turf , breast-high , to conceal the shooters -RRB- , and a gang of `` drivers , '' provided with flags , to drive the game , or rather the poultry , the birds being preserved and presumably half-tame , up to the muzzles of the guns .

		Snugly ensconced in his coign of vantage , and provided with a small arsenal of breech-loaders and a lackey to load them , our British '' sportsman '' bangs away ingloriously at successive clouds of grouse , `` from morn till dewy eve , '' until the heath about him is a shambles and the wagon-train arrives to cart away the slain .

		The slaughter of a successful `` drive '' is something tremendous .

		We learn , for instance , in the chapter on Records , that , on Lord
Walsingham	PERSON	's '' great day , '' 1,056 grouse were killed in 449 minutes .

		His lordship , who seems to be actually proud of the bloody performance , certifies that '' once I killed three birds at one shot , and three times I killed two at one shot , each time intentionally . ''

		At Mr.
Rim	PERSON	- ington
Wilson	PERSON	's place , near
Sheffield	LOCATION	, we have a rec - ord of 4,251 birds killed in two days ; while on the moor of
High Force	ORGANIZATION	the record of
1872	DATE	shows a total of 15,484 birds for nineteen days ' shooting .

		The book is acceptably illustrated .

		The bits of genre which largely serve ** ficti n in '' The Yeii w B k '' -LRB-
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are not , as a rule , very attractive or stimulating .

		They are often ama - teurish in their impressionism , and have too marked a flavor of preciosity .

		But we must make an ex - ception -LRB- in the case of this second number of the book-magazine -RRB- of Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's alto - gether subtle and exquisite sketch entitled '' The Roman Road . ''

		So charming a bit of writing is not often met with in a periodical .

		The seventy-page novelette which Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	contributes to this number is of course the piece de resistance .

		The other prose contents include an essay by Mr.
Frederick Greenwood	PERSON	on '' The Gospel of Content , '' a study of Bizet , by Mr.
Charles Willeby	PERSON	, and a de - tailed criticism of the first '' Yellow Book , '' requested of Mr.
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	for insertion as a special feature of the second .

		The editors are out for novelty , and they are getting it .

		The poetry of the number is quite insignificant , but the art in - cludes many striking things , of which we may men - tion Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's `` Renaissance of Venus , '' Mr.
Hartrick	PERSON	's '' Lamplighter , '' Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	's ''
Gar	PERSON	- gons de CafeY ' and Mr.
MacDougall	PERSON	's `` Idyll . ''

		Altogether , this issue seems a distinct advance upon its predecessor .

		The '' Discourses Biological and Geo - .

		^ cal '' that are incl ^ d i '' the eighth volume of Professor Huxley 's collected essays -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- are dated all the way from
1861	DATE	to
1876	DATE	.

		Among them are such models of popular scientific exposition as the lectures '' On a Piece of Chalk , '' '' Yeast , '' and '' A Lobster . ''

		It is not easy to be a popular lecturer and remain strictly scientific , but there can be no question of Professor
Huxley	PERSON	's accomplishment of the two-fold task .

		But success in this field has its perils , as our essayist , with a touch of humor , suggests . ''

		The people who fail take their revenge , as we have recently had oc - casion to observe , by ignoring all the rest of a man 's work and glibly labelling him a mere popularizer .

		If the falsehood were not too glaring , they would say the same of
Faraday	DATE	and
Helmholtz	PERSON	and
Kelvin	PERSON	. ''

		The book is a piece of unusually thorough and painstaking workmanship , copiously annotated , and pro- vided with many extracts from unpublished Spanish and Latin documents .

		There is a map , a bibliography , a chronological conspectus , and all other needful appa - ratus .

		A new edition of '' Grimms ' Fairy Tales '' -LRB-
Warne	PERSON	-RRB- and there can not be too many is translated by Mrs.
H. B. Paull	PERSON	and Mr.
L. A. Wheatley	PERSON	for the popular and inexpensive collection of good literature known as '' The Chandos Classics . ''

		The translation is close and acceptable , and the collection is , as far as we are aware , complete .

		A brief introduction provides youthful read - ers with a few of the elementary facts and principles of the science of folk-lore .

		It will probably surprise most readers to learn that British
India	LOCATION	includes , besides the territory of a million square miles under the rule of the Queen-Empress , no less than 688 native states , with an area of about two - thirds of a million square miles , still under the rule of their own princes .

		These states are not strictly auton - omous , but they enjoy a large measure of independence .

		In '' The Protected Princes of
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
William Lee	PERSON	-
Warner	ORGANIZATION	discusses this complex subject , and gives a fairly clear idea of the status of these Indian dependencies .

		The discussion is philosophical in spirit , avoids tiresome details , and is clearly the work of a man thoroughly familiar with his theme .

Morehead	LOCATION	to
Myles	LOCATION	, completing the letter M .

		The Morgans , the Mor - rises , the
Mortons	LOCATION	, and the Murrays share the honors , get - ting among them nearly a third of the total contents .


Roger de Mortimer	PERSON	, first Earl of
March	DATE	, is the subject of the longest article found in this volume .

		Few names of literary interest occur , and none of any considerable importance .

		Mr.
R. W. Moore	PERSON	, of
Colgate University	ORGANIZATION	, publishes in pamphlet form a '' History of German Literature '' -LRB-
Hamilton	LOCATION	: Grant -RRB- , consisting of eight lectures given at the
Bay View	LOCATION
summer	DATE	school , and first printed in the '' Bay View Magazine . ''

		The accuracy and critical abil - ity of the author may be illustrated by his character - ization of
Herr Heyse	PERSON	's '' Im Paradiese , '' the title given to a collection of short stories , the chief '' one of which is little more than the justification and glorification of adultery . ''

		In his treatment of recent German novel - ists , the author claims to indicate by an asterisk the works that have been translated into English .

		On a single page we notice the titles of half a dozen works , unstarred , of which English translations have to our knowledge been published .

		Captain
Conder	PERSON	has just published -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a new edition of `` Maccabseus and the Jewish War of Independence , '' which first appeared in
1879	DATE	.

		Dur - ing the past fifteen years , he tells us , '' I have revisited many of the scenes described ; have lived in
Moab	LOCATION	, and have ridden through the oak woods of
Gilead	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In spite of these outings , however , and of later Palestinian dis - coveries , he has found little to correct in the earlier edi - tions of the work .

		The chief authorities remain what they were in

Macmillan & Bowes	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was delivered as the Rede Lec - ture of
last June	DATE	by Professor
J. W. Clark	PERSON	.

		Although a small book of only sixty-one pages , it contains a con - siderable amount of explanation in detail of old library methods and appliances , and , aided by a number of copies from old prints , conveys quite a satisfactory idea of the surroundings in which our forefathers read and wrote , thereby giving us fresh reason to congratulate ourselves on our improved facilities and conditions for literary labors in these modern days .

		Mrs.
Alice B. Gomme	PERSON	has collected , and Miss Win - ifred
Smith	PERSON	has charmingly illustrated , a series of `` Children 's Singing Games '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , giving also the traditional tunes to which they are sung .

		The col - lection is interesting as a contribution to folk-lore , and may be turned to helpful account by the kindergartner .

		In fact , these traditional games would be a desirable substitute for the artificial games devised by teachers of the kindergarten system .

		The publishers promise a second series for next
Christmas	DATE	.

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
September 25 , 1894	DATE	.

		Many New Yorkers retain pleasant recollections of the two visits to this country of the English poet , nov - elist , and critic ,
William Sharp	PERSON	, whose collected poems , under the title '' Flower o ' the Vine , '' were published by an American firm not long after his second trip to
America	LOCATION	.

		He is also remembered as the collaborator of
Blanche Willis Howard	PERSON	in the novel '' A Fellow and His Wife , '' as the author of fine working biographies of
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	, and as the editor of the popular '' Canterbury Poets '' series .

		For some time Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	's friends have been observing with interest a succession of dramatic sketches in the decadent man - ner , which have appeared in one or another esoteric pe - riodicals here and in
England	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , if I am not mistaken , Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	was the first writer of English to take up this field .

		It was something of a surprise , there - fore , to read a paragraph in a
New York	LOCATION	literary jour - nal to the effect that the announcement of an American edition of
William Sharp	PERSON	's '' Vistas '' was the first inti - mation that journal had ever had that Mr. Sharp be - longs to the decadent movement . ''

		Vistas '' was regu - larly published last
Spring	DATE	, and was placed on the mar - ket in
England	LOCATION	at that time , receiving a brief notice in this correspondence .

		Its sale in
America	LOCATION	was reserved for the
fall	DATE	season , and this delay has enabled the au - thor to add to its contents .

		I hear also that this Amer - ican edition will contain a four-page Dedicatory Intro - duction to Mr.
Henry M. Alden	PERSON	, the editor of '' Har - per 's Magazine '' and author of '' God in His World , '' whose fine analysis of '' 1 ` Intruse '' I quoted a few months ago .

		Probably there are not many authors in this coun - try or
England	LOCATION	who have '' arrived , '' who do not owe something to Mr.
Aldeu	PERSON	's helpful sympathy , thorough sifter of literary chaff that he may be .

		Mr.
Paul Bourget	PERSON	's impressions of American life are receiving general commendation here .

		I am reminded by them that there is talk of collecting and publishing in an English translation the letters which
M. Georges Clemen	PERSON	- ceau , the former leader of the Extreme Left in the
French Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	, sent to the
Paris	LOCATION	Temps during his residence here shortly after our Civil War .

		He sent regular letters on American affairs to the lead - ing French daily , and they are said to contain many 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, curious appreciations of the politics and public men of the stormy times succeeding the War .

		Coming from a man of
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	's position and parts , they would be sure to command attention , aside from the interest in comparing them with
M. Bourget	PERSON	's impressions .

		Much local interest is felt in regard to Mr.
Edward Gary	PERSON	's forthcoming biography of
George William Cur	PERSON	- tis in the '' American Men of Letters '' series .

		As one of the editorial staff of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' Mr.
Gary	PERSON	has , in addition to his signed articles , for a long time performed a large amount of scholarly work , the knowledge of whose authorship has been confined to the journalistic profession .

		He was the intimate friend and associate of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	, and understood , perhaps better than anyone else , the latter 's motives and ambitions .

		A striking piece of impudence is about to be carried into execution by the publication of what purports to be a sequel to Mr.
Edward Bellamy	PERSON	's '' Looking Back - ward '' by another hand .

		The son of the hero of that romance is to be carried into the twenty-second cen - tury , and a study of its social order is to be made .

		I do not know whether this is to be another '' answer '' to '' Looking Backward , '' or a romance on the same theme ; but such literary charlatanism is justly detested by all right-minded men .

		There is interest in the announcement that Miss
Kath	PERSON	- arine
Prescott Wormeley	PERSON	, the translator of
Balzac	LOCATION	, is engaged in translating the works of
Moliere for Messrs. Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		She has , I believe , translated more than twenty of
Balzac	LOCATION	's books alone , and perhaps may now be looked upon as the leading translator of this country .

		Miss
Wormeley	PERSON	's father was a British ad - miral , but he was a Virginian by birth , and she has re - sided in this country since before the Civil War , so that we may fairly claim her as our own .

		There he hopes to finish '' a great social drama '' upon which he has been for some time at work .

		According to '' The Athenaeum , '' a new volume of let - ters by

		Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	is said to have three books in course of preparation : a three-volume novel called '' Be - yond the Dreams of Avarice '' ; some essays on social subjects entitled `` As We Are : As We May Be '' ; and '' In Deacon 's Orders . ''

		The last is a collection of short stories .

		The twenty-sixth of
September	DATE	was a gala day for the
Northwestern University of Evanston	ORGANIZATION	, that being the date for the formal dedication of the
Orrington	LOCATION	Lunt Library Building , recently built at a cost of over
one hundred thousand dollars	MONEY	.

		The exercises , which filled both afternoon and evening , were largely attended , and included the usual variety of speeches .

		The spe - cial feature of the exercises was an address by Dr. Jus - tin
Winsor	PERSON	, who was invited from
Cambridge	LOCATION	for the purpose .

		The
University Library	ORGANIZATION	contains 25,000 vol - umes , and the new building provides space for five times that number , besides rooms set aside for seminary work .

		All lovers of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	will be delighted to see and such of them as can , to own the splendid etched por - trait of him made by the great French etcher
Paul Ra	PERSON	- jon , whose companion portrait of
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	is already fa - mous .

		The
Tennyson	PERSON	portrait was made from life , and represents the poet apparently at his best , although at the age of seventy .

		The hair and beard are but partly gray , and the expression is one of great force and dig - nity .

		The likeness is said , by those who knew
Tenny	PERSON	- son , to be one of wonderful fidelity .

		The head is about half life-size .

		Impressions from this magnificent plate , in several styles and degrees of expensiveness , are pub - lished by
Messrs. Frederick Keppel & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, at No. 1 Van Buren street ,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The establishment here of a permanent branch of this house , so long known and highly esteemed in art circles in
Paris	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, is a matter for congratulation to lovers and patrons of art .

		Thousands who attended the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	last year will recall , as perhaps the most impressive figure among the assembled prelates , the venerable
Dionysios Latas	PERSON	, Archbishop of the
Greek Church	ORGANIZATION	, which he represented at the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Archbishop 's death , at
Zante	LOCATION	, occurred early in
September	DATE	.

		Aside from his high position in his church , of which he was regarded as one of the brightest ornaments , and from his well known philanthropic work such as that in con - nection with the earthquake disaster at Zante in
1892	DATE	, he was eminent for his learning and for his contribu - tions to theological literature .

		A writer in the
London	LOCATION	'' Academy '' says of him : '' A greater breadth of thought acquired probably from his long studies in
Germany	LOCATION	brought him closer to the intellectual classes in mod - ern
Greece	LOCATION	than most of his brethren .

		Whenever he preached in the Metropolitan Church of
Athens	LOCATION	, the building was closely packed .

		When it was my privilege to hear him , his restrained yet burning eloquence and the but half suppressed applause of his hearers brought to my remembrance the accounts that are extant of the effect of the preaching of the Golden-mouthed at Con - stantinople , fifteen centuries ago . ''

		The difference between an '' author 's edition '' and a '' privately printed '' book is one not always recognized , although the distinction seems clear enough the '' au - thor 's book '' being understood in the trade as one pub - lished at the cost and risk of its author , while the '' pri - vately printed '' volume is really not '' published '' -LRB- made public -RRB- at all , but is issued by an author or his friends for his and their gratification .

		Mr.
James T. Fields	PERSON	, himself a veteran publisher , made the distinction very neatly by putting on the title-page of his modest vol - ume of poems the legend `` Printed , not published . ''

		Not every poet , it is needless to say , can afford this lux - ury of private printing , or the greater luxury of reject - ing the offers of publishing houses to bring out his works .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 Yet there are such fortunate ones .

		Mr.
Harry B. Smith	PERSON	, for instance , whose privately printed volumes , '' Lyrics and Sonnets '' and ''
Will Shakspeare	PERSON	, a Comedy , '' have attracted attention much beyond the circle of friends for whom they were issued , has had several offers of publication from
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	firms ; but he prefers to grat - ify his taste for privacy in the printing of his more meritorious writings , and this he is lucky enough to be able to do through the substantial income derived from his very successful comic opera books .

		WALTER PATER 'S MESSAGE .

		A very interesting article in the
London	LOCATION	''
Bookman	PERSON	, '' devoted to
Walter Pater	PERSON	, ends in this fashion : '' And what , after all , was
Walter Pater	PERSON	's message to his age ?

		He had given it to the world in the early chapters of ' Marius the Epicurean ' ; he uttered it again but a few weeks before he died .

		Someone in his company , with rem - nants of ill-digested Positivism yet strong upon him , had asserted that men lived by the memory of the great names du temps jadis , such names as Csesar and
Leonardo	PERSON	, and that it was by the study of their deeds and sayings that one required strength of character .

		But
Walter Pater	PERSON	struck it strongly : ' No , that should not be your ideal .

		Men who lived in times past , however great , can not be to you what those around you can be .

		You should learn to live in the men and women of your own immediate surroundings ; their words , their looks , their very dress should be to you the very thing that really absorbs your interest .

		Learn to live in and with your entourage , so that it may become to you vivid and real .

		To be alive to every influence around you is better far than the ex - ample of anyone in the past , however great . '

		This was only another way of expressing the ideal that
Marius	PERSON	set before himself , ' to be perfect with regard to what is here and now , ' only a re-statement of the conclusion of his ' Renaissance . '

		If
Walter Pater	PERSON	possessed anything so bourgeois as a mission or a message , assuredly this is what it was philosophy interpreted by one 's fellow men . '

		Philosophy without effeminacy , ' was the boast of Pericles concerning his native city . '

		Philosophy by and through a love of youth , ' was the reply and corollary of
Plato	LOCATION	, and this , or something very near thereto , was the conclusion of his loving interpreter of our own day ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	. ''

WEBSTER	PERSON	.

September 7 , 1894	DATE	. -RRB-

		Calm after storm , and after pain comes peace : By pain , full-purchased peace is now with thee , And surely sense of high sei-enity , That in Death 's kindly arms thou hast release .

		Sweet singer , woman true , who ne'er didst cease , In midst of lofty thinking , still to be Helpmate of those in suffering , poverty , Nor soughtest honors and ignoble ease .

		We were the poorer that thou richer art , Did we not know that spirits do not die ; But thro ' their high aspirings still have part In all the world 's aspirings , chaste and high .

		Thy genius quick and loving , must impart High impulse till all song can be put by .


Alexander H. Japp	PERSON	in '' The Academy . ''

		THE PROSPECT FOR MINOR POETS .

		Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	contributes to '' The Athemeum '' some interesting reflections concerning the present pros - pects of minor poets in general , from which we quote the following : '' I confess to being one of those cheery pessimists ' who believe that the time has gone by when English poets , save a very few , need hope to write for any other generation than their own .

		But surely that is enough : there are a good many English-speaking people about , and they do not all write verses .

		An audience scat - tered over
Great Britain	LOCATION	and all the new worlds of the entire temperate zone ought to be quite enough for the ambitious bard , who must needs , I fear , leave posterity to take care of itself .

		Our English poetic growths , from Chaucer downwards , are so rich that even the specialist the poetical student is overwhelmed by them .

		To be read for a few years by one 's contemporaries is a great compliment to any poet at a time when two-thirds of the letters of the world are written in English .

		What room will there be when the best literary ener - gie ?

		4 > f the English-speaking race in
North America	LOCATION	, the Australias , and
South Africa	LOCATION	shall exercise themselves in the production of poetry , as the best literary ener - gies of
England	LOCATION	were exercised in the time of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and
James I. ?	PERSON

		For , of course , the poetry of the
United States	LOCATION	, good as some of it is , does not in any way rep - resent , as yet , the literary endowment of that great peo - ple as English poetry represents our own .

		From the latest romantic revival of Rossetti , Mr.
W. Morris	PERSON	, and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, down to the present moment , a mass of true poetry has been produced which in quality far sur - passes all the poetry that the eighteenth century pro- duced between the time of Pope and the time of Words - worth and
Coleridge	PERSON	; but where is the room for it ?

		A poet like
Sydney Dobell	PERSON	or
Alexander Smith	PERSON	, or a poet like
Arthur O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	, rises , makes a consid - erable reputation , and seems likely to pass into litera - ture ; he dies , and in a few weeks his very name is for - gotten .

		The infirmity of our contemporary criticism is not lack of intelligence far from it but lack of knowl - edge of the literature that has gone before .

		They who have to write have no time to read .

		Nothing is more common than to see half a column of generous praise given to verses which are taken , both as to substance and as to form , from some dead bard over whose grave the daisies have scarcely begun to grow .

		I wonder how many of our contemporary critics have read a line of that ' poem of the age 's hope ' that marvellous drama , of which
Tennyson	PERSON	expressed his unbounded admiration , ' Festus ' or that ' greatest poem of the age , ' The Roman , ' or that greater than the greatest poem of the age ' A Life Drama . '

		In order to be forgotten , indeed , it is not necessary for a poet to die ; let him cease to write for five years , and he will pass out of memory , while a dozen ' greatest poets of the age ' will have been boomed in succession , and in succession forgotten , over his head .

		The names of most of the poets who were the contemporaries of Mr.
Philip James Bailey	PERSON	, and the names of most of the poets who were the contempo - raries of Mr.
John Payne	PERSON	, so familiar at those two dif - ferent periods , are now as entirely forgotten as though their songs were sung in
Nineveh	LOCATION	or
Babylon	LOCATION	.

		But it can not be helped .

		Art is short and life is long .

		The astronomers tell us that a good many years a million ?

		will run before ' heaven 's candles are all out ' be - fore the sun loses his power of keeping the earth hab - itable by the British poet , and ' there 's husbandry in heaven . '

		In that time sonnets may have gone out of fashion , as ballades and rondeaus have gone ; nay , even Shakespeare and
Milton	PERSON	may be used at the
Board	ORGANIZATION	schools as specimens of the ' latest form of intelligible English . '

		Poetical immortality is , therefore , a relative term . ''

		THE DIAL 213 THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS EDITED BY < DR.
ALBERT SHAW	PERSON	.

		TN
January , 1890	DATE	, a new magazine , with a new idea in periodical literature , made its appearance 1 in
England	LOCATION	.

		Its name , the '' Review of Reviews , '' was suggestive of its purpose .

		Its aim was to give each month an epitome of current history and a summary of the world 's best thought .

		In a single year it reached a sale of more copies than all the rest of the English reviews combined .

		In
April , 1891	DATE	, an American edition , under the editorial management of Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	, was brought out .

		This American edition was not a reprint of the English magazine .

		On the other hand , it dealt largely with American matters and was edited with perfect independence in its own office .

		The success of the American edition has become an event in the history of periodical literature in this country .

		During the first year it surpassed , in circulation , the most popular of the old and established reviews and before the close of the second year it was in close competition with the leading illustrated magazines .

		The principle on which the '' Review of Reviews '' has been built , is that a magazine , made bright , timely , and comprehensive in text and illustration , and immediately in sympathy with every movement of social progress , would be considered indispensable .

		This theory has been vindicated in the splendid success which the '' Review of Reviews '' has attained .

OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES	PERSON	.

		The last of the famous group of New En - glanders who made the dream of American lit - erature a fact , the last man of letters to survive from that annus mirabilis which also gave to
America Lincoln	LOCATION	and
Poe	PERSON	, to
England Tenny	ORGANIZATION	- son and
Darwin	PERSON	,
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	has stolen peacefully to his rest , and we have in - deed broken with the past .

		Few lives have meant so much to Americans as that now ended , its years so nearly those of the century which it adorned .

		As the intellectual associates of the gentle Autocrat went to their own places one by one , the affection in which they were held seemed to be transferred to the ever-les - sening group of those who yet remained , until , in concentration of grateful recollection , it was all heaped upon one beloved head .

		Now , there remain but memories to which we may cling ; the last leaf has fallen from '' the old forsaken bough , '' and we smile , as he bade us do , but through our tears .

		The love which Americans have felt , and always will feel , for the group of our distinc - tively national poets , including
Bryant	PERSON	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	, besides the one whose loss we now mourn , has had few par - allels in other nations for either depth or sin - cerity .

		We knew that they were not great poets , as the world measures poetic greatness ; we knew that their voices were not of those that for all ages speak to all mankind ; but they have had for us so many endearing asso - ciations , their names have been so indissolubly linked with whatever was best and noblest in our history and our aspirations , that we could not wholly measure them by the cold standards of objective criticism .

		The indigenous nature - lyrics of
Bryant	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	's delicate treat - ment of the romantic aspects of American his - tory , the passion that fired
Whittier	LOCATION	's songs of freedom , and the ethical fervor and downright manliness to which
Lowell	PERSON	gave such varied utterance , all these things meant something to us , something very precious , very personal , and altogether incommunicable to the alien .

		So we did not mind it very much when the amia - ble foreign critic told us that most of our poets were either mocking-birds or corn-crakes .

		We 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, knew that it would be useless to explain or to remonstrate ; we knew , in fact , that his lan - guage and his tests were not ours , nor ours his .

		The work of
Holmes	ORGANIZATION	, besides having qualities peculiarly its own , shares also in the special appeals indicated above .

		There is no lack of lyrical or romantic effect , of patriotic or ethical passion , in the long series of volumes that be - gan with the '' Poems '' of
1836	DATE	and ended with '' Before the Curfew '' in
1888	DATE	.

		And how much there is that falls without the categories thus summarily designated ! ''

		What shapes and fancies , grave or gay , Before us at his bidding come !

		The Treadmill tramp , the One-Horse
Shay	PERSON	, The dumb despair of Elsie 's doom ! ''

		The tale of
Avis	ORGANIZATION	and the Maid , The plea for lips that can not speak , The holy kiss that Iris laid On little
Boston	LOCATION	's pallid cheek ! ''

		And then
Holmes	PERSON	was so much more than a mere singer .

		The very fact that we most fre - quently call him the Autocrat rather than the poet suggests something of his versatile ability .

		With one aspect of his life-work we are not here concerned .

		As a medical practitioner , as a teacher of anatomy , and as a writer in the special field of his profession , he had a full and honorable career , and we may fancy that he more than once said to the physician
Holmes	PERSON	, This is what I really am , the rest is trifling ; just as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	said of his
India House	ORGANIZATION	folios , '' These are my real works . ''

		But we may put all this aside , and the man of letters remains , not sensibly diminished in stature .

		For to his credit stand many entries .

		There are the three novels , and of them we must say that they have few equals in our American fiction . ''

		A Mortal Antipathy '' we might perhaps spare , but we would not will - ingly lose ``
Elsie Venner	PERSON	, `` even if science frown upon its thesis , or '' The Guardian Angel , '' even if it do not in all respects fulfil the require - ments of the fictive art .

		We should say that no reservations need be made when it is a ques - tion of praising the four volumes of Table-Talk , which begin with the breakfast-table and end with the tea-cups .

		And besides these gifts , he gave us the sympathetic and beautiful memoirs of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	and
Emerson	PERSON	, and the many prose miscellanies that are only less charming than his more famous works .

		As a poet and in the final settlement the poet will outweigh the writer of prose
Holmes	PERSON	preserved for us the spirit of the classical age at a time when romanticism was in full cry .

		But , as Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	happily suggests , his work was a survival rather than a revival .

		It is curious , indeed , as the same acute critic re - marks , to note how persistently he remained an artificer upon the old-fashioned lines , al - though ever alert to seize the new occasion and the new theme .

		We have had no other so ex - pert in personal and occasional verse , no other who could so distil the very quintessence of Yankee humor , or of the other and finer qual - ities of the
New England	LOCATION	intellect , into the most limpid of song .

		And when he was en - tirely serious , how exquisite was his touch , how pure his pathos , how clear his ethical sense !

		Let '' The Voiceless , '' '' Under the Violets , '' and '' The Chambered Nautilus '' bear witness .

		And , since no one knew so well as he the word most fit to be spoken upon any solemn occa - sion , let us write in his own words his epitaph : '' Say not the Poet dies !

		Though ' in the dust he lies , He can not forfeit his melodious breath , Unsphered by envious death !

		Life drops the voiceless myriads from its roll ; Their fate he can not share , Who , in the enchanted air Sweet with the lingering strains that Echo stole , Has left his dearer self , the music of his soul ! ' '

		He sleeps ; he can not die !

		As evening 's long-drawn sigh , Lifting the rose-leaves on his peaceful mound , Spreads all their sweets around , So , laden with his song , the breezes blow From where the rustling sedge Frets our rude ocean 's edge To the smooth sea beyond the peaks of snow .

		His soul the air enshrines and leaves but dust below ! ''

		DA VIP SWING .


David Swing	PERSON	, who died at his home in
Chicago	LOCATION	on the
third of October	DATE	, was one of the most widely known of
Chicago	LOCATION	preachers , and enjoyed also a certain reputation , albeit a slender one , as a man of letters .

		In the latter capacity , he was the author of three or four volumes of essays sermons and liter - ary club papers which are characterized by grace rather than forcefulness , and by a certain languor of manner equally characteristic of their author as a public speaker .

		These books exhibit the workings of a mind given to much reading of good books , one whose mental process remotely suggests that of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		As a preacher ,
David Swing	PERSON	stood for the forces that have done so much to liberalize re - ligious thought during the
past quarter	DATE	of a century , and in his sermons , dogma , which most theologians offer to their public in solid lumps , had gone com - pletely into solution .

		Still , it was his instinct rather than his logical faculty that thus placed him in the van of religious thought , for he was always more of a rhetorician than a thinker .

		He was too good - natured to be critical , and he sometimes scattered his praise of men and books in a way to make the judicious grieve .

		His great professional reputation was due in large measure to the celebrity of his trial for heresy about twenty years ago .

		The result of that trial was a technical acquittal , but soon there - after he severed his relations with the Presbyterian organization , and entered upon the independent ca - reer which he has since pursued .

		Opinion has been divided upon the question of his justification in this step .

		Those who stood by him during the trial , and labored to secure the verdict that was given in his favor , were naturally aggrieved when he afterwards abandoned them .

		But his friends claimed that he could not have continued in the church without in - justice to himself , and that his sphere of usefulness was much widened by the separation .

		Readers of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, especially in its earlier years , will re - member him as an occasional contributor to its pages .

		INADEQUACY .

		Thy palace walls were founded well , And well its courses thou didst lay ; One tower defied the genie 's spell , And stands a ruin to this day .

		The Land of Flowers thou didst attain , And see the
spring	DATE	's immortal jet ; Thy staff-worn hand was reached in vaiu Thy lips that crystal never wet !

		With pains the altar thou didst dress , And the burnt sacrifice prepare , And call upon the God to bless All but the Fire from Heaven was there !

		Thou shak ` st thy lance on hard-fought field , Thou sleep ` st , the tingling stars above ; Pity and praise sweet eyes can yield , But ne'er vouchsafe the Light of Love !

		What dost thou lack ? '

		T is almost naught That parts thee from thy Heart 's Desire , A step a span an airy thought , A pulse-beat more , thou didst require !


EDITH M. THOMAS	PERSON	.

		ONE STEP SHORT .

		It was remarked of a gentleman who was one of the most accomplished flutists of his day , that his performance was almost maddening because it was so good !

		His execution was brilliant , his tone superb , his interpretation and shadings admirable , but alas !

		he was always a little out of tune , so very little out of tune , that his accompanists , whether or - chestral or those of the piano , declared that it would have been a positive relief had he but been a little more out of tune !

		Persons who could listen with equanimity to that musical monstrosity , a tune played in two different keys at once , felt for this gentleman 's playing a degree of abhorrence which '' fairly made the flesh crawl . ''

		This provoking qual - ity affected the player himself , who seemed con - scious of his defect , although unable to correct it ; and he finally gave up music in despair .

		I have learned that this failing is by no means an uncom - mon one among musicians otherwise able ; and it has been my misfortune to hear some of the leading soloists of an orchestra play so out of tune that the water would come into their own eyes , as well as into those of the audience .

		I also remember that the great
Julien	PERSON	brought over with his band of Con - tinentals an English musician whose business it was to '' raise the note , '' as it were ; this Englishman 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, being possessed of an exquisite ear , though other - wise master of no remarkable accomplishments in his profession .

		Failure analogous to that of the unfortunate flut - ist will be found running through much achievement in art .

		There would seem to be something in the near approach to perfection which , while it warns one of deficiency , does not so adequately warn as to enable him to correct that deficiency .

		Many of the monodies written on half-genius and other forms of incomplete fruition owe their motive to a percep - tion of this lamentable fact .

		Familiar , indeed , is that despair which must be felt , when all has gone well with scheme and devisement , while -LRB- though too vague for specific analysis -RRB- the execution is so faulty as to obscure what must be seen , or we , as artists , perish !

		Poets have rhymes to help them to a so - lution of the difficulty , to bridge the lacuna between intention and accomplishment ; and the musician , in beginning a phrase , finds himself almost irresistibly dragged along entrain ^ the French would say to a consistent form of resolution .

		Yet it is just at this point that what musicians call the '' disap - pointed cadence '' must make itself known in all the arts ; for there are few masters in any that , like
Chopin	PERSON	, can turn all their discords into reconciling dissonances , few that , like
Browning	PERSON	, can divert their faulty metre to represent purposely a halting movement .

		Such power of conversion may be reckoned as among the highest uses of intuition and as verging closely upon the pure creative faculty .

		As a boy I was once young enough to enjoy un - questionably that youth 's frenzy , the poetry of Al - exander
Smith	PERSON	.

		But in an evil day my idol became the mark of ruthless iconoclasm ; for his volume falling into the hands of Mr.
Punch	PERSON	, that gentleman chanced to allude to the great frequency of stars in
Smith	LOCATION	's poetic firmament ; declaring that the
Life Drama	ORGANIZATION	contained as many stars as did the bosom of a Polish refugee !

		Hence I became somewhat sensitive at the unabated recurrence of the stellar apparition ; and , as often as the mood was upon me to quote to admiring friends several of the most ap - proved passages from this poet , I was fain to leave out the stars -LRB- silently substituting asterisks there - for -RRB- !

		Now ,
Alexander Smith	PERSON	presents one of the most pathetic instances of failure at the very goal of achievement : a fertile fancy is his , and a most sonorous diction , yet almost always obscured by some defect in execution which spoils the whole , some needless repetition which borders on the ab - surd , but which seems to escape the consciousness of the perpetrator himself .

		In the presence of such embarras de richesse , misapplied or squandered , how often does one feel tempted to cry out for plain mediocrity , defective mechanism , blurred perceptions anything where the result falls obviously short of the intention .

		In this latter accident there is at least an absence of profanation ; and we feel almost rec - onciled to those fatuous rash ones who gallantly rush in where real artists fear to tread !

		That which is ex - plicitly commonplace we tolerate , for it doubtless fulfils its mission .

		But whether the poet be conscious of his shortcoming or otherwise , we , the laity , are not unfamiliar with the heart-sinking sensation that certain lines in noble verse are worse than unsatisfy - ing .

		Their approximate perfection begets an an - guish so keen that we could wish the poem of which they are part had never been written .

		Especially does this feeling prevail when the context promises an imperial fulfilment not borne out in the final re - sult .

		Take a well-known example
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's sonnet on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		What a wide hiatus between conception and execution , between the sombre gran - deur of the opening verse , '' It flows through old hushed
Egypt	LOCATION	and its sands , '' and the concluding lines , which go to sleep as to aesthetic perception , but '' wake '' to the somewhat trite moral consideration , '' how we shall take Our own calm journey on for human sake . ''

		Less well-known , though as pungent in illustra - tion , is the following couplet from
Edward Coates Pinckney	PERSON	: '' Save where volcanoes send to Heaven their curled And solemn smokes , like altars of a world . ''

		What lines these might have made , had
Swinburne	PERSON	been the poet 's master in prosody !

		A beautiful idea obscured deadened by inadequate wording , lies buried in the lines subjoined : '' And then I saw that , in my pride bedight , I craved from erring man the gift of Heaven . ''

		Yes , too often it happens that some one of the instruments in the orchestra of poetic genius has lapsed a semi-tone or so , dragging back the whole movement to what the sensitive mind feels to be worse than chaos , more intolerable than clamoring discord .

		It does not help us towards resignation to reflect that the same accident is constantly recurring in many of the great problems of life , that our woo - ings , our weddings , our winnings , are too frequently beset by the same distressing deficiency so near and yet so far from that ultimate perfection which in their case seems a necessity .

		But let us consider whether , in the instances noted , there be any remedy for this tendency to fail while almost at the goal of artistic perfection .

		And again let us refer to
Alexander Smith	PERSON	.

		Possibly he might have been saved much of that which gave pretext to his critics had he possessed , to any degree , the sense of humor ; and , indeed , he was so conscious of the absence of that element , as well as of the mischief wrought by such absence , that in the prose papers written after his retirement from verse he seeks to belittle the whole arcana of wit and humor , as foreign to sincerity , incompatible with earnest purpose ; intimating that such small change is only current with those who dwell in cities .

		He even goes so far as to cite these qualities as among the effete results of overwrought civilization !

		No doubt he was stung by such arrows in his day ; but it is no part of a worthy vindication to ignore the weapons that have brought about one 's discomfiture .

		The unfinished is too often funny , or , at least , grotesque ;
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 and so it is not without reason that the shafts of criticism , when directed towards so vulnerable a mark , should be not only winged but often enven - omed by wit .

		It is so difficult gravely to note an obvious absurdity , when the announcement is so much more effectively made by an epigram .

		The work of
Alexander Smith	PERSON	, whatever its pleas - ing promise , whatever its casual power to surprise the reader , is unfinished .

		He has animation , but not that '' animated moderation '' so highly com - mended by an English critic of our own day .

		Nor had he , as it would seem , in any very strongly de - veloped degree , the artistic conscience , which com - mends the role of patience .

		He therefore reaped the inevitable consequences .

		With pathetic -LRB- may we not say prophetic ? -RRB-

		consciousness the poet in the following lines alludes to his own shortcomings and their tragic lesson : '' There is a deadlier pang than that which beads With chilling death-drops the o'er-tortured brow , When one has a big heart and feeble hands , A heart to hew his name out upon Time As on a rock ; then , in immortalness To stand on Time as on a pedestal !

		When hearts beat to this tune and hands are weak , We find our aspirations quenched in tears , The tears of impotence and self-contempt .

		That loathsome weed upspringing in the heart , Like nightshade ` mid the ruins of a shrine . ''

		The lesson of deliberation in artistic workmanship is suggested in the biographical fact that Pope , the most finished and painstaking of the writers of his period , never allowed anything of his to be pub - lished until it had lain by him a year , subject to re - vision and alteration .

		Probably no man who laughed so much and so cynically was ever , so far as his work was concerned , so little laughed at .

		And it may be noted that , while the literary world and the general public almost universally accorded the palm to
Dryden	PERSON	as a man of affluent genius , but compara - tively little of the work of that master has come down to us .

		On the other hand , the phrasing of his rival , the succinct yet ample diction of Pope , lends household words to every department of liter - ature -

		Among the happy results of the discussion must be counted this : that more than one lonely stickler for the supremacy , even in the classroom , of literature as an art has discovered , like
Elijah	PERSON	of old , that the faith has no lack of prophets .

		Professor Cor - son , for instance , has seemed , at times not far re - mote , to stand almost alone in his insistent procla - mation that the appeal of literature is not exclusively to the intellect , but to the three-fold spirit .

		Yet the aim at
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	can not easily go beyond the purpose at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, as voiced by Professor
Cook	PERSON	in the opening article of the series , to promote '' the acquisition of insight and power , taking these terms in the broad - est sense , so as to include the emotional and aesthetic faculties as well as the purely intellectual , the will and the moral nature no less than the reason . ''

		But
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, pleading for English as `` an unsurpassed ali - ment of the spiritual life '' and '' a most effective in - strument of spiritual discipline , '' hardly outvoices the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, valuing the study of English literature for `` its enormous weight against utilitarianism , '' or of
Chicago	LOCATION	, claiming that '' liter - ary masterpieces should be studied chiefly for their beauty . ''

		Truly THE DIAL is marking a new hour .

		America , throwing off the tyranny of the German method , in which , nevertheless , her leading profes - sors of English have been trained , and facing the disapproval of gray-towered
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, which , at the present writing , has two men enrolled as candidates for its brand-new English school , is still the land of the free and the home of the brave .

		But if free - dom is to be preserved from anarchy , and bravery vindicated from the charge of headlong folly , teach - ers of English have yet to find a general method proportioned to their aim .

		Enthusiasts , it is true , decry that soulless substantive , method . ''

		When a teacher begins to cast about for a method , '' writes a member of the English Faculty of
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' he is already lost . ''

		And yet Thomas the Rhymer saw , between the paths to heaven and hell , a path to fairy - land .

		May there not be `` a bonny road That winds about the ferny brae , '' which teachers of literature , who would fain awaken their students to the beautiful , may seek for un - ashamed ?

		Indeed , we need a road .

		Let the new day dawn .

		Let the student 's lifted head , cleared from all suspicion of an ache , be haloed with golden lights .

		Let the ideal professor guide him to the heart of poetry , of humanity , and the divine ; but how is such supernal guidance to be effected ?

		`` He shall have chariots easier than air , That I will have invented ; and ne'er think He shall pay any ransom ; and thyself , That art the messenger , sha.lt ride before him On a horse cut out of an entire diamond .

		Nothing , then , could be more practically helpful , at this stage of the experiment , than these descrip - tions of English courses now pursued in American colleges , especially where the professors in charge are committed to the literary aim .

		Upon this ac - cumulated material of experience , theory will soon be at work .

		THE DIAL has already given judg - ment in favor of dividing English , as a university subject , into the science of linguistics and the art of literature .

		From the various reports , however , it would appear that composition and rhetoric , elo - cution , and comparative literature , must also be taken into account as candidates for separate de - partments .

Roland	LOCATION	, the Nibelungen Lied and the Vol - sunga Saga , were originally offered in the English literature department .

		A few years since , this department , stricken with humility , handed the re - sponsibility on to the professors of Greek and Ger - man and the Romance tongues , who undertook a composite course of English lectures upon the clas - sic and mediaeval epics .

		This arrangement proved unwieldy , and fell , like
Poland	LOCATION	, for lack of a cen - tral control .

		The Romance department offers En - glish courses in
Dante	LOCATION	and in the French epics of the Middle Ages ; but for a comprehensive survey of the Aryan literatures in their development and relations ,
Wellesley	LOCATION	has still to wait .

		Anglo-Saxon is taught in the department of En - glish Language and Rhetoric ; and also , by Dr.
Helen L. Webster	PERSON	, in the department of Compara - tive Philology .

		Three , at least , of our English faculty are eager to offer
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	courses ; and this year
Wellesley	LOCATION	, like
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, has three under - graduates electing Anglo-Saxon .

		In connection with the testimony from various universities
Illi	PERSON	- nois , for example as to the disfavor with which English students regard linguistics , and in light of the experience of
the University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, which has succeeded , by emphasizing the literary side of the study , in making courses in Anglo-Saxon and Middle English popular , questions press for discus - sion .

		Is this artful dodging of Anglo-Saxon to the discredit of the artful dodger ?

		Should
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	be made a required subject in the English group ?

		Should it be taught with full linguistic severity , as valuable mental discipline , or should the teaching be suited to the tastes and aims of lit - erary students ?

		What is the decent minimum of philology ?

		And should the Anglo-Saxon course precede or follow the treatment of the more mod - ern literature ?

		In the department of English Literature at
Welles	LOCATION	- ley , no critical courses are offered on material prior to 1300 ; and , from
Langland	LOCATION	to
Browning	PERSON	, the lan - guage is taught solely as a means to an end .

		The forty students electing fourteenth century work this year , for instance , will study the
East Midland	LOCATION	dia - lect for the sake of Chaucer 's poetry , not the poe - try for the sake of the dialect .

		The Professor of English Language and Rhet - oric ,
Miss Margaret E. Stratton	PERSON	, of
Oberlin	LOCATION	, finds time for some linguistic work , but the rhetorical side of her department secures the lion 's share of attention .

		Professor
Scott	PERSON	's longed-for Utopia is not located at
Wellesley	LOCATION	.

		Frequent themes are required of Freshmen , Sophomores , and Juniors , these classes numbering , in the aggregate , about six hundred .

		Moreover , here , as at
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	and
Indiana	LOCATION	, classes of conditioned Freshmen are a conspicuous feature of the Rhetoric department , the training of the secondary schools being grievously inadequate .

		Miss
Hart	PERSON	, of
Radcliffe	LOCATION	, and
Miss Weaver	PERSON	, trained in
England	LOCATION	as well as in
America	LOCATION	, bend their united energies to developing in the Freshmen the ability to write clear , correct , well - constructed English sentences .

		To have mastered the paragraph is to become , so far as the Rhetoric department is concerned , a Sophomore ; and to proceed , under guidance of
Miss Willcox	LOCATION	, whose preparation was in part received in an editorial office , to the structure of the essay .

		This involves , together with the analysis of masterpieces and the making of outlines , various studies in the orderly and effective arrangement of material .

		Subjects may be drawn from any course of study in which the student is interested , and some slight opportu - nity is afforded for experiments in story-telling .

		With the second semester comes , to able students , the chance of electing , in place of the regular work , a course in journalism .

		This undertakes the gathering up and editing of news from far and near , the condensing and recasting of `` copy , '' the writing of book reviews and editorials .

		A news - paper staff is organized , the members rotating in office , and from time to time the class is addressed by working journalists .

		THE DIAL 221 ful activities ; while , for better or for worse , the calls from newspapers , the
Union	LOCATION	over , for student reporters of college life grow more numerous with every autumn .

		The Junior year brings the course in argumenta - tion , which , making as it does for logical thinking , is speedily felt in every line of college work .

		This course , conducted by Mr.
George P. Baker	PERSON	of Har - vard , and similar to the forensic course given by him in that university , is described in Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's paper in THE DIAL 'S series .

		Mr.
Baker	PERSON	offers , too , an elective course in debate .

		The crowded Senior elective , however , is the Daily Theme course , conducted by
Miss Weaver	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purpose of this elective is to quicken observation and give as much practice as possible in the sifting and grouping facts of personal experience , and in the clear , concise , and cogent statement of whatever there may be under a Senior cap to state .

		These various instructors are united in the per - suasion that the laws of rhetoric should be assimi - lated , so far as may be , by an informal and almost unconscious process , and that there should be no unholy divorce between the English of the pen and the English of the lip .

		They stand for graded and orderly advance , for the development of the per - ceptive and inventive powers , as well as of taste and reason , and , in general , for a fuller experience and more accurate expression of life .

		It is unfortunate that they are themselves mortal , and have thus far been unable to accede to the desire of the other de - partments that all students whose technical themes and examination papers , while good in substance are bad in statement , shall be conditioned in English and turned over to the Rhetoric department for reformation .

		The limits of my space necessitate brief mention of the work in English Literature .

		In this subject there is no requirement .

		It is elected this year by more than half the undergraduates , while some ten or twelve graduate students pursue courses in res - idence and others are working at a distance by cor - respondence .

		The corps of instruction consists , in addition to myself , of Miss
Vida D. Scudder	PERSON	, asso - ciate professor , and three instructors ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	,
Miss Sherwood	LOCATION	, and Miss Eastman .

		Vassar ,
Smith	PERSON	, and
Wellesley	LOCATION	are our nursing mothers , although
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	have somewhat tem - pered our aboriginal mood .

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	's espe - cial interest is in nineteenth century literature ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	's in Spenser and in lyric poetry ,
Miss Sher	LOCATION	- wood 's in the analysis of prose , and my own in drama .

		Miss Eastman is bowed beneath the weight of the introductory course such a pre-requisite as is given at
California	LOCATION	and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, presenting a bird 's - eye view of the field of English literature .

		This accomplished , the student is advised to elect one of three courses which have for their peculiar end and aim the cultivation of the literary sense .

		These courses draw their material from the pre - Victorian prose , and from the early poetry , epic and lyric ; the emphasis in one of the poetical courses being put on
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and in the other on
Milton	LOCATION	.

		The student 's third choice is made from a group of courses dealing with the literature of various great epochs : a fourteenth century course , a Shakespeare course , and nineteenth century courses .

		But to the student who proposes at the outset to specialize in English we recommend a different sequence : a course in Anglo-Saxon for the Freshman year , fol - lowed in turn by the Chaucer course , the Shake - speare course , and a course either in Georgian and Victorian poetry or in Victorian prose , with a con - cluding course in the development of English liter - ature .

		There are one-hour lecture courses , alternat - ing , year by year , in American literature and in Poetics .

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	conducts a seminary in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	or Shelley or
Browning	PERSON	, as the spirit moves ; while my own seminary deals with some period of the English drama .

		No text-books are used in any of our class-rooms save editions of the masterpieces under consideration , and save such in - nocuous pamphlets outlines of the courses , with bibliography as we individually prepare for our own classes .

		For a young college ,
Wellesley	LOCATION	is ex - ceptionally fortunate in her library , and the stu - dents of literature and history flock to it as flies to honey .

		Informal addresses by one or another mem - ber of the force are fortnightly given before the students of the department on current topics of lit - erary note ; and frequently an unwary poet strays into our parlor , or a famous scholar mounts our lecture-platform .

		The literary societies of the col - lege further the aim we have in view ; and , in gen - eral , the responsiveness and earnestness of our stu - dents are such as often to shame our own inadequacy . ''

		The hungry sheep look up and are not fed . ''

		We do what we can , but are beset by many puz - zles .

		What is the function of the lecture in the teaching of literature ?

		At what point in her career shall the susceptible undergraduate encounter the standard critic ?

		Can a student be conditioned on coldness of heart and on native apathy in the pres - ence of beauty ?

		But our chief problem is the cru - cial one of the modern experiment .

		If , indeed , as was claimed by a contributor to `` School and Col - lege '' two or three years ago , the constituents of a sound education are character , culture , insight , and the disciplined working power of the brain , can the study of literature be made to promote the final end as effectively as it certainly subserves the other three ?

		THE PUBLIC APPRECIATION OF BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In turning over the leaves of a current review , my attention was caught by a curious outbreak from Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	who seems to have , like the city of his residence , a sort of recurring '' silly season . ''

		Like the bandolining young ladies at `` Mugby Junction , '' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	harbors , as it appears in the review cited , a fine contempt for the public .

		He does n't go so far as to call it '' a great beast , '' as our
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	did , but he rates it pretty cheaply , nevertheless . ''

		The pub - lic , '' he says , '' does not read books , that is the plain truth .

		The public reads newspapers , and , in very earn - est moods , magazines ... There never was an age that read less , or cackled more about what it does not read . ''

		Indeed !

		The public does n't read books , and it will read newspapers and magazines .

		Does this mean that it is n't doing its duty lately by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's books that it grudges its crowns and half-crowns for his re - prints , on the paltry ground that it has already had the originals for sixpence or a penny ?

		There seems , on the whole , to be some method in this form of popular madness .

		Or is Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, after all , only rattling on in his old airy way , trying to startle us with a paradox , and not meaning anything in particular ?

		Surely the asser - tion that the public `` does not read books , '' and that `` there never was an age that read less , '' is , literally taken , the veriest nonsense .

		Can Mr.
Lang	PERSON	point to an age that read more books , or even half as many , or that was a hun - dredth part as liberal say as just to the makers of good books , as the present one ?

		Is literary genius now - adays driven to live in a garret and dine off a shin-bone of beef , and to write cringing dedications and lying odes to pay for its garret and its dinner ?

		Publishers may be presumed to be pretty good judges of their own business , and to know , even better than Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, how many and what sort of books the public is willing to pay for .

		Do their yearly announcements show a falling - off in the demand for good literature ?

		Even in this year of commercial depression , we learn in THE DIAL that '' more than the usual number of important and expensive works '' are announced , '' with at least the usual number of books of serious and unquestionable interest . ''

		Touching our lack of seriousness , at which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	sneers , well , perhaps this charge would be better worth noticing if it came from a writer who could himself remain serious for a half-dozen pages to - gether .

		One thing is certain : nine-tenths of us -LRB- with all our frivolity -RRB- greatly prefer just those writings of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's own in which the fun of Mr.
Merryman	PERSON	is least obtrusive .

		Finally , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	complains not over-civilly that the public is given to `` cackling '' -LRB- that 's his elegant word -RRB- about what it has not read .

		Perhaps the public may reply , by may of reprisal , that certain authors cackle so much , directly or allusively , about what they have read as to breed the suspicion that they never stray out of their libraries .

		Reading , we know , '' maketh a full man , '' and , within bounds , is an excellent thing ; but is n't over-reading pretty apt to make a man , what a political opponent once styled Mr.
Mill	PERSON	, a mere '' book in breeches '' ?

		Of course neglected authors have a prescriptive and indefeasible right to scold at the public , and to affect to regard it as a sort of philistine Goliath of
Gath	LOCATION	at whom the smallest liter - ary
David	PERSON	may have his fling .

		It does them good , and we are not going to grudge them so cheap a lenitive to - their smarts .

		But Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, certainly , has not the neg - lected author 's excuse for his ill-humor with the public .

		THE HEBREW AS A SAILOR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was not a little amazed to find in a recent number of THE DIAL the statement that `` a son of Abraham ... having anything to do with a ship '' was `` almost contra naturam . ''

		Being a Frenchman by birth , I hap - pen to know that nearly every year some Jewish boy enters the
French Naval Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and that at the present time quite a number of '' sons of Abraham '' have reached distinguished rank in the navy of
France	LOCATION	.

		This is one sure proof that when not ostracized the He - brew engages in as many varieties of occupations as the

		THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN PREPARATORY SCHOOLS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In connection with your timely series of articles on the teaching of English at our colleges and universities , which have been to me and doubtless to many others of the greatest interest and value , I venture to suggest the importance of a discussion of the work done in this branch of teaching at secondary schools .

		My experience is that very many of the students who come to college from weak preparatory schools are almost hopeless , so far as appreciating literature is concerned .

		Too often they have become bewildered or disgusted with the sub - ject ; or , worse , they have learned a trick of superficial vaporing about literature which is very hard to unlearn .

		In many cases , perhaps in most cases , the college teacher is compelled to direct his efforts toward correcting the blunders of incompetent fitting schools , to the neglect of his own aims and methods .

		A series of papers set - ting forth the work done in teaching English at repre - sentative fitting-schools and high schools would perhaps do an even greater service for teachers of English than the admirable series referred to .

		THE DIAL 223 Nefo THE `` EMINENT SCOUNDREL '' IN LITERATURE .

		* The monotonous regularity with which writ - ers of the lives of eminent people have hitherto devoted their pens to celebrating virtue and good works is agreeably broken in '' The Lives of Twelve Bad Men : Original Studies of Em - inent Scoundrels . ''

		The title has an attract - ive ring .

		Here is a biographer who not only frankly owns that his heroes are no better than they should be , but estops himself at the out - set from the tedious and altogether too common practice of whitewashing them .

		Indeed , as we shall show further on , to rob one of these wor - thies of a single jewel in the crown of his knavery would be to weaken his title to figure in the company in which the editor 's judgment has placed him .

		It may seem at first glance as if Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	, in selecting his names , must have been sorely perplexed by an embar - rassment of riches ; for bad men , in the usual sense , have always been as plenty as blackber - ries .

		What the reader may possibly ask is one dozen among so many ?

		History fur - nishes a long roll of what we are used to call bad men relatively bad , that is , and sufficient - ly so to illustrate the otherwise obscurer vir - tues of their better contemporaries ; while the most casual glance at existing society shows that the rascally tribe , so far from decaying , gives every sign of indefinite and triumphant survival .

		Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	, however , as we gather from his preface , has really been limited by a narrow principle of selection .

		Preeminence in ill-doing , absolute and unqualified badness , is the price of a niche in his pantheon .

		Turning to his list of '' eminent scoundrels , '' we find that it embraces the following wor - thies a careful consideration of whose names reveals little to cavil at on the score of insuf - ficient rascality :

Thomas Griffiths Wainewright	PERSON	, pois - oner -LRB- 1794-1852 -RRB- ;
Edward Kelley	PERSON	, bushran - ger -LRB- 1855-1880 -RRB- .

		In this '' galaxy of stars , '' literature is ably represented by that pseudo - Italianate scoun - drel and practical toxicologist ,
Thomas Grif	PERSON	- fiths Wainewright ; and as he was really a man of some note , outside his criminality , and a friend of the leading literary and artistic lights of his day , some account of him here may not be amiss .

		In point of cool-blooded , subtly - contri ved villainy , and utter callousness to the sufferings of the victims of his cowardly crimes ,
Thomas Griffiths	PERSON	, to our thinking , easily bears away the palm .

		Wainewright was born in
1794	DATE	, at
Chiswick	LOCATION	, where his father was a practising solicitor .

		His parents dying during his infancy ^ he went to live with his grand - father , Dr.
Ralph Griffiths	PERSON	, proprietor of the `` Monthly Review , '' at
Linden House	ORGANIZATION	, Turn - ham
Green	ORGANIZATION	, a fine mansion with a rent value of four hundred a year .

		In
1803	DATE	Dr.
Griffiths	PERSON	died , leaving X5 ,200 in trust for our hero ; and his son ,
George Edward Griffiths	PERSON	, reigned at
Linden House	ORGANIZATION	in his stead .

		On his grand - father 's death ,
Thomas	PERSON	went to school at
Charles Burney	PERSON	's academy at
Hammersmith	LOCATION	, and here evinced for the first time his love for art , his drawing-book showing , as his gratified master testified , `` great talent and natural feeling . ''

		After leaving school , while still a mere boy , he was '' placed frequently in literary society '' -LRB- not very much to his profit , however -RRB- , and for a short time devoted as much attention to painting as his naturally '' giddy , flighty dis - position '' allowed him to devote to any one subject .

		This pursuit proving tame , he pres - ently drifted into the army , where he served successively as an orderly officer in the Guards , and a cornet in a yeomanry regiment .

		About this period he seems to have fallen a victim to the wiles of Bacchus or , vulgarly speaking , to have taken to drink ; for we have his own statement that he habitually drank ten tum - blers of punch of a morning , which modicum , he adds very credibly , had the effect of '' ob - scuring his recollections of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	as in a dun fog . ''

		The military ardor did not last long ; in fact , nothing ever lasted long with
Thomas Griffiths	PERSON	, except his inveterate yearning to leave off what he was doing , and set about doing something else . ''

		My blessed art , '' he wrote , in his usual high-sailing style , '' touched her renegade ; by her pure and high influences the noisome mists -LSB- bred largely by the matutinal '' ten tumblers , '' we presume -RSB- 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, were purged ; ray feelings , parched , hot , and tarnished , were renovated with a cool , fresh bloom , childly simple , beautiful to the simple - hearted . ''

		Naturally , in this chastened mood ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poems , breathing sweet natural - ness and tender piety , touched his regenerate heart ; and to testify conclusively to his change of spirit , he left the army , and liberally re - duced his morning 's allowance of punch .

		About this date -LRB- 1820 -RRB- , '' The
London	LOCATION	Magazine '' was started , and it soon had a brilliant staff of contributors :
Charles Lamb	PERSON	,
Hood	LOCATION	,
Hart	PERSON	- ley
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	, De Quincey ,
Procter	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , and
Wainewright	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter wrote pretty frequently , under the pseudonyms of `` Janus Weathercock , '' `` Egomet Bonmot , `` and ''
Cornelius Vinkbooms	PERSON	, '' usually affecting fan - tastic titles .

		That
Wainewright	PERSON	's prose had merit , is undeniable ; while his love of art , his usual topic , was genuine , and his knowledge of it considerable .

		But besides art , there was another subject on which Wainewright never tired of speak - ing ; and that was his precious self .

		Once launched on this engaging theme , he rambles on with a sickening self-complacency , and an affected , mincing euphuism that prepares one to believe the worst of him .

		A thorough cad , he is forever proclaiming himself '' a gentle - man . ''

		Even when , a triple murderer and a condemned forger , he was in
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	await - ing transportation for his crime , he still gloried in the one imperishable fact that he was '' a gentleman . ''

		Nothing not the dock , nor the gyves , nor Botany Bay could erase that in - bred distinction ; and when a visitor asked him if he did not look back with shame on his past life , he briskly answered , quite in the old '' Weathercock '' vein : '' Not a bit .

		I have always been a gentleman , always lived like a gentleman , and I am a gentleman still .

		Yes , sir , even in
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	I am a gentleman .

		The prison reg - ulations are that we should each in turn sweep the yard .

		There are a baker and a sweep here besides myself .

		They sweep the yard ; but , sir , they have never offered me the broom . ''

		Having married ,
Waineright	PERSON	found himself with an income of about 200 an altogether insignificant sum for one who , in the words of Oscar Wilde , was '' an amateur of beautiful things , and a dilettante of things delightful . ''

		He lived well , dressed well , loved good wines , hot - house plants , majolica , rare books -LRB- he boasted some especially choice ones on poisons -RRB- , etc. , and like all respectable Englishmen he '' kept his gig . ''

		He also entertained a good deal such guests as
Macready	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilkie	PERSON	,
Westall	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	,
Forster	PERSON	, and Sergeant Talfourd , dining pretty often at his table .

		It is not surprising that , living at this gentlemanly rate on a beggarly two hundred a year , he soon found himself ruinously in debt ; and he was gradually forced from one shady method of '' raising the wind '' to another still shadier , until he committed his first crime -LRB- outside of literature -RRB- forgery .

		Unable , by the terms of the will , to touch the capital of the fund left him by his grandfather , he forged a trustees ' order for 2,259 of it , secured the money , and was , for a brief space , relieved from pecuniary pressure .

		This first coup had , of course , the ultimate effect of lessening his regular income ; and things were again rapidly drifting from bad to worse , when the wind was once more unexpectedly tempered to the shorn lamb .

		In
1828	DATE	, a fortunate invitation opened
Linden House	ORGANIZATION	to the married couple , and they accord - ingly took up their abode with their bachelor uncle ,
George Edward	PERSON	.

		The pecuniary possi - bilities of the situation at once flashed upon
Wainewright	PERSON	.

		Here was a fine mansion which , on the demise of its owner , must pass by nat - ural descent to his nephew in fact , to him ,
Wainewright	PERSON	; and , what was still more import - ant , a round sum of money must pass with it .

		The owner of the house was an old man a disappointingly healthy one , it is true ; but there is nothing so very remarkable , still less suspicious , in old men , however healthy , dying suddenly .

		Could not his demise be arranged to take place rather earlier than Nature de - manded almost immediately , in short ?

		He would only be cheated of a few years at best ; and his loss would be really inconsiderable compared with the handsome gain accruing from it to others .

		Convinced by his devil 's logic , Wainewright at once proceeded to apply theory to practice .

		He had a curious knowl - edge of poisons far in advance , it is said , of most medical men of his time ; and here , at last , was a chance of testing this knowledge in a practical way .

		Unfortunately , the details of
Wainewright	ORGANIZATION	's first experiment in toxicology are lost to science ; but it is enough for us to know that it was perfectly successful .

		The venerable uncle died , a little in advance of his time , and
Linden House	ORGANIZATION	passed quietly into the possession of its new owner .

		But once again the relief brought to our in - satiate '' amateur of beautiful things '' proved transitory .

		In the interim , moreover , his bur - dens had increased ; for a son was born to him , and a now destitute mother-in-law , with
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 225 her two daughters , had come to live under his roof .

		Clearly , something must be done to stave off the creditors now growing more and more vulgarly importunate , after the manner of their tribe ; and
Wainewright	PERSON	, in his dire extremity , naturally thought of his last brilliant operation .

		To quietly and unsuspiciously `` re - move '' any or all of his household was quite within the bounds of practical science .

		He had proved that .

		But here the logical difficulty arose that none of these relatives had '' expect - ations . ''

		To make away with the impecunious mother-in-law , or her still more impecunious daughters , only meant risk of detection , be - sides the expense of a funeral .

		Plainly , that would n't do .

		But the devil again inspired him .

		He had heard of the life insurance offices whose business it was to provide large pay - ments in the event of premature death , in re - turn for a small premium down .

		The problem was solved .

		In casting about for a victim for this new enterprise ,
Wainewright	PERSON	hit upon his sister-in-law ,
Helen Abercromby	PERSON	, as almost ideally suited to his purpose ; and the diabol - ical sang-froid with which the reptile lured this charming and innocent girl into blindly furthering a plan that essentially involved her own destruction seems without a parallel in the annals of crime .

		Provided in advance with a trumped-up story with which to parry awkward inquiries , she was sent about from office to office , making , in her own name , proposals for short periods and for amounts in no case large enough to give rise to special investigation .

		Suspecting nothing , and swallowing her scru - ples as to the fictions imposed upon her , she put herself completely into her future murder - er 's hands .

		Finally two proposals , each for .3,000 , were accepted .

		Then a new difficulty arose in completing the transaction .

		The scheme was opposed by the girl 's mother , who not unreasonably urged the folly of insuring for short periods the life of a penniless and very healthy girl who was almost certain to outlive the policies .

		Wainewright was equal to the emergency ; he saw an opportunity to rid himself of a provoking obstacle to his plans , and of a mother-in-law also , at one stroke , and he did not hesitate .

		Recourse was again had to science , with the natural result .

		Mrs.
Abercromby	PERSON	, too , was prematurely gathered to her fathers .

		After a decent interval of mourning , the assurance scheme was revived .

		Miss
Aber	PERSON	- cromby made proposals to seven offices for an aggregate of over 20,000 , of which 12,000 was accepted ; and the promoter of the enter - prise , satisfied with the total amount in view , concluded that things were ripe for the denoue - ment .

		At his instance , the girl put the final touch to the preparations for her own murder by making a will in favor of her sister Made - leine .

		The latter , it is needless to say , was also to be '' removed '' as soon as her pecuniary condition warranted it .

		Everything ready , Wainewright suddenly grew unusually kind , unremitting , in fact , in his delicate attentions to the sisters .

		One evening , after taking them to the play , the party had a supper of lobsters and porter .

		During the meal she began to feel strangely ill , '' and in the
night	TIME	had a bad , rest - less headache and was very sick . ''

		She grew rapidly worse . ''

		Dr.
Locock	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Forster	PERSON	describes as a distin - guished physician , was called in .

		... She said , < Doc - tor , I am dying ; I feel I am ; I am sure so . '

		He said , ' You will be better by and by . '

		The family nurse said that Mrs.
Abercromby	PERSON	had died in the same way , and
Helen	PERSON	cried out , ' Yes , my mother !

		oh , iny poor mother ! '

		The doctor left , but the convulsions returned , and an hour or so later she died .

		A grim figure in the sick chamber was the old nurse who from the first expected a fatal result , and who uttered gloomy and despairing cries to the effect that
Helen	PERSON	's mother and Dr.
Griffiths	PERSON	had died in exactly the same manner . ''

		This was the vilest and probably the last -LRB- though others are charged -RRB- of
Wainewright	ORGANIZATION	's murders .

		Incredible as it may seem , he was never brought to trial for them , being trans - ported for his first crime , forgery , in
1837	DATE	.

		The damning facts we have outlined only came to light indirectly during the trial of the suit brought for the recovery of
Helen Abercrom	PERSON	- by 's insurance which suits , by the way , were won by the defendants on the ground of the girl 's misrepresentations .

		Forster , who , with
Macready	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
Hablot Browne	PERSON	, vis - ited
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	just before
Wainewright	PERSON	's de - parture , gives a last glimpse of this unpar - alleled scoundrel .

		The party were suddenly startled by a tragic cry from
Macready	PERSON	of '' My God !

		there 's Wainewright . '' ''

		In the shabby genteel creature , with sandy , disor - dered hair , and dirty moustache , who had turned quickly round with a defiant stare at our entrance , looking at once mean and fierce , and quite capable of the cowardly murders he had committed ,
Macready	PERSON	had been horri - fied to recognize a man familiarly known to him in for - mer years , and at whose table he had dined . ''

		The volume is a handsomely appointed one , and it is altogether likely to attract at least its due share of attention .

		The illustrations , mostly portraits and cuts after curious paint - ings , call for special mention .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, THE SHERMAN The letters of General
Sherman	PERSON	and
Senator Sherman	ORGANIZATION	will interest different readers in differ - ent ways .

		Some will value them most as a direct contribution to our knowledge of their distin - guished writers considered as biography .

		Some will regard them most highly as an addition to the history of the country in the long and inter - esting period which they cover .

		Others , our - selves included , will find the centre of interest in the materials that the book presents for the study of character .

		Here are two men of nearly the same age , brothers growing up under the same conditions and trained in their earliest years in the same way , who attain , not by adventi - tious means , but by sheer ability and force of character , the one the foremost place in the military service of his country , the other a place next below the highest in its political service , and excluded from the highest only by that logic of our later American politics which keeps those of highest ability and character and of greatest prominence from attaining the highest position ; these men we have telling each other their acts , thoughts , and feelings , for more than fifty years , in the most unconscious fraternal correspondence .

		It is impossible for the reader who looks at the
Sherman Letters	ORGANIZATION	from this point of view , not to see that
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	was by nature a soldier , while Senator
Sherman	PERSON	was a statesman ; and it is hard for him to re - sist for the moment the conviction that in such matters inheritance stands for more , and edu - cation and environment for less , than our cur - rent philosophy leads us to suppose .

		For us , the principal interest of the book lies in the opportunity that it furnishes to follow these two men as they move along their divergent paths from youth to age .

		The story opens in
1837	DATE	, with
W. T. Sher	PERSON	- man , then in his seventeenth year , just enter - ing on his studies at West Point , and
John Sherman	PERSON	, three years younger , serving as junior rodman in an engineer 's corps on the Mus - kingum River Improvement ; it closes in
1891	DATE	, with
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	in retirement at
New York	LOCATION	, and Senator
Sherman	PERSON	still in active duty at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The reader suffers no loss because the senior brother wrote the larger number of letters , for the soldier was distinctly a better letter-writer than the politician .

		In part this was no doubt due to his more change - * THE SHERMAN LETTERS .

		ful life , but not wholly so .

		It is about as un - profitable to compare men of such different talents and careers as it is to discuss the rel - ative ability of men and women ; but one gets from the letters the distinct impression that the
General	ORGANIZATION	, in quickness of insight , in frank - ness of character , in mobility of mind , in a word , in real genius , was the superior man .

		In the first period , 1837-1846 , the letters are all from his hand .

		In the beginning his style is heavy and stiff , as well as frequently ungrammatical , but he soon begins to show that command of nervous and happily-phrased English which is characteristic of his later life , and which , while by no means always correct according to the rules laid down by the critics , is nevertheless always interesting .

		Still , when all is said , the remark that the editor makes of the
General	ORGANIZATION	's boyish letters , that they are interesting only because they are his , has a wider application both to him and to the Senator .

		For some years the older brother seems to have acted as a sort of fatherly monitor for the younger one .

		In
January , 1840	DATE	, he discussed the outlook of the engineer , concluding that a man in that profession could not look for con - stant employment , and therefore could not ex - pect a sure and constant reward for his labor .

		He thought the States were likely to expend less money for public works than they had been doing , and he caught no glimpse of the coming wonderful expansion of private enterprise in that field .

		He had no vision of his brother 's future career , and cherished no high ambition for him .

		His letter concludes : '' I have mentioned these things to you that you may reflect , while there is still time , of the propriety of se - lecting means to be resorted to in case of necessity .

		What more naturally suggests itself than a farm ?

		Who can be more iudependent , more honest and honorable , who more sure of a full reward for his labor , who can bestow more benefits on his fellow-beings , and conse - quently be more happy , than an American farmer ?

		If by any means you may be able to get some land in
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	, or
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, you should do so by all means , and more especially if it is partially improved .

		I do not mean for the purpose of speculation , but to make use of yourself . ''

		Learning two months later that
John	PERSON	is to study law , he says it would be impertinent for him to object , but the law would be his last choice of a profession .

		For himself , he intends to en - ter the army , although it is doubtful whether he shall remain in it for life . ''

		Should I re - sign , '' he says , '' it would be to turn farmer , if ever I can raise money enough to buy a good farm in
Iowa	LOCATION	. ''

		However it may be now , it was quite the fashion before the Civil War for offi -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 227 cers of the regular army to depreciate or de - spise politics and politicians ; and General
Sher	PERSON	- man was no exception .

		A string of piquant passages expressive of that sentiment could be selected from his early letters .

		He did not take kindly to
John	PERSON	's becoming a politician ; on the other hand , he wrote him in
October , 1844	DATE	, as follows : '' What in the devil are you doing ?

		Stump-speaking !

		I really thought you were too decent for that , or at least had sufficient pride not to humble and cringe to beg party or popular favor .

		However , the coming election will sufficient ly prove the intelligence and patriotic spirit of the American people , and may deter you from com - mitting a like sin again ... For my part , I wish Henry Clay to be elected , and should rejoice in his success , for various reasons ; but I do not permit myself to in - dulge in sanguine feelings when dependence has to be placed on the pitch-and-toss game of party elections . ''

		But the politician learned something in his school that he commended to the soldier 's at - tention at a later day .

		For example , he told him , in
August , 1862	DATE	, that '' the general popu - lar sentiment is sometimes passionate , hasty , and intemperate , but after a little fluctuation it settles very near the true line . ''

		Again he tells him : '' Take my advice , be helpful , cheer - ful , polite to everybody , even a newspaper re - porter .

		They are in the main clever , intelli - gent men , a little too pressing in their vocation . ''

		Still , the
General	ORGANIZATION	, to the end of his life , never took kindly to the ways of politics or to the arts of popularity .

		After the War was over and his reputation was firmly established , he shrank from life at the
National Capital	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
December , 1866	DATE	, he wrote from
St. Louis	LOCATION	: '' I do not want to come to
Washington	LOCATION	, but to stay away as long as possible .

		When Grant goes to
Europe	LOCATION	, then I shall be forced to come .

		The longer that is deferred , the better for me . ''

		And a few days later , in reference to the same subject : '' There can be no satisfaction to me in being drawn into the vortex of confusion in which public affairs seem to be . ''

		President
Johnson	PERSON	strove to thrust
Sherman	PERSON	into his quar - rel with
Stanton	PERSON	and
Grant	PERSON	, seeking first to make him Secretary of War , and later Brevet General of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		The honest soldier wrote him , in
January , 1868	DATE	, a manly letter of ex - postulation , declaring that
Washington	LOCATION	was ob - jectionable to him because `` it is the political capital of the country , a focus of intrigue , gos - sip , and slander . ''

		He spoke of the fate that had there befallen Generals
Scott	PERSON	and
Taylor	PERSON	, and pointed out the baneful influence of the Capital on the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac from the beginning of the War .

		He recounted the trials that he had seen Grant pass through in the War , and declared : '' And yet I have never seen him more troubled than when he has been in
Washington	LOCATION	, and has been com - pelled to read himself a ' sneak and deceiver , ' based on reports of four of the Cabinet and apparently with your -LSB- the President 's -RSB- knowledge .

		If this political atmosphere can disturb the equanimity of one so guarded and pru - dent as he , what will be the result with one so careless and outspoken as I am ?

		Therefore , with my consent ,
Washington	LOCATION	never . ''

		His removal to
St. Louis	LOCATION	in
1874	DATE	was prima - rily due to the strained relations between him - self on the one hand and the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	and the President on the other ; but the old feeling of aversion had its influence .

		General
Sherman	PERSON	saw that
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	suffered in peace of mind and reputation by accepting the Presidency , and stoutly repressed all attempts to '' bring him out '' as a presidential candidate .

		He wrote in
1874	DATE	: '' Dear Brother : Do n't ever give any person the least encouragement to think I can be used for political ends .

		I have seen it poison so many otherwise good charac - ters , that I am really more obstinate than ever .

		I think Grant will be made miserable to the end of his life by his eight years ' experiences .

		Let those who are trained to it keep the office , and keep the army and navy as free from politics as possible , for emergencies that may arise at any time .

		Think of the reputations wrecked in pol - itics since
1865	DATE	. ''

		We are not surprised to find the General say - ing in
1872	DATE	: '' Grant , who never was a Repub - lican , is your candidate , and
Greeley	PERSON	, who never was a Democrat , but quite the contrary , is the Democratic candidate . ''

		But we are surprised to find the Senator assenting to the statement , and , what is more , adding that there was no es - sential difference in the platforms of the two parties .

		General
Sherman	PERSON	's letters show how much better he understood the political situation in the South previous to the Civil War than his brother and the Northern politicians generally ; also how completely he grasped the military problem at the opening of the great strife .

		His famous saying , in
1861	DATE	, that two hundred thou - sand men were necessary to defend
Kentucky	LOCATION	, which was then considered proof of his insan - ity , is now considered proof of his genius .

		His letters bearing on the mistaken ideas of men at the North in both periods are very interesting reading .

		Previous to reentering the army in
1861	DATE	,
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	's career had been broken and on the whole discouraging .

		He had served a few years as a soldier in
Florida	LOCATION	and in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia , and had been disappointed in his desire 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, to go to
Mexico	LOCATION	; he had been a banker in
San Francisco	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, and then for a year or two had taken up the law , despite his old jibes at his brother ; he had acted as the head of a military school in
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and finally , just as the War was opening , drifted into the presidency of a street railway company in
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		He was forty-one years of age , but nothing that he had done gave promise of a great career , although he had done well what - ever he had undertaken .

		One or two letters breathe a note of discouragement .

		The War gave him his opportunity , and one of the pleas - ing features of the book is the sanguine confi - dence with which
Senator Sherman	PERSON	, before the General had reentered the army , marked out a great military future for him .

		The volume abounds in quotable passages .

		We give two more , one written from
Kansas	LOCATION	, in
May , 1859	DATE	; the other from
Paris	LOCATION	, in
June	DATE	of the same year . ''

		Of course we are all expectation here to read news of the war in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Our latest accounts are simply that the Austrians , after entering
Piedmont	LOCATION	, have manoeuvred without any definite plan , giving full time for the
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- dinians to organize , and for
France	LOCATION	to pour into
Italy	LOCATION	her well-equipped armies by every avenue of approach .

		We know , too , that the Emperor of
Austria	LOCATION	has gone to control the operations of his army , that the King of
Sardinia	LOCATION	is also his own generalissimo , and that
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon had sailed from
Marseilles	LOCATION	for
Genoa	LOCATION	, whence , I take it , he promptly crossed to
Turin	LOCATION	, and that he , too , will command in person .

		... If
Napoleon	PERSON	can drive the Austrians out of all
Italy	LOCATION	, even from
Venice	LOCATION	and
Triest	PERSON	, and from thence north of the Styrian Alps , and then gradually surrender the power thus acquired to a federation of states , retiring to
France	LOCATION	, he would be the most celebrated man of this or any age .

		He can do so .

		The elder
Bonaparte	PERSON	could not , as he was never cor - dially recognized by other governments ; but
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		is so firmly fixed , to all appearance , in
France	LOCATION	, that he can moderate his plans , and cease conquest the mo - ment his aim is accomplished .

		So few ambitious men , however , have been able to stop at the right place that fortune seems to tempt them beyond human depth into ruin ; still , so wilful , silent , and determined has he shown himself that I expect that he will force the Austrians back from
Italy	LOCATION	, and then allow some form of govern - ment to control the Italian kingdoms , states , and re - publics .


Austria	LOCATION	, however , will not relinquish
Triest	PERSON	,
Dalmatia	LOCATION	, and
Venice	LOCATION	without a death-struggle , and it may be that the war now begun may spread and make as many dynastic changes as those wars which followed the French Revolution .

		I wish I were there to watch the operations and changes ; but alas !

		I am in
Kansas	LOCATION	. ''

		If the above extract shows clearly how the soldier misread the foremost man in
Europe	LOCATION	in
1859	DATE	, the following shows no less clearly how the politician misread the history and genius of two foremost European peoples . ''

		My conclusions are all against the British govern - ment ... When Englishmen hereafter talk about their rights , I will know what they mean .

		They do en - joy a limited liberty of speech and of the press , and then you have said all .

		It is a government of the aristocracy , more exclusive , repelling , and narrow than I conceived of .

		The
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	is the only pre - tended representation of the people , and that is but a mere pretense .

		The representation is so glaringly un - equal that it is a surprise to me that the people will submit to it .

		As the members are not paid , and none can vote without property , it is a mere representation of money and not of men .

		Every regulation of the gov - ernment , the rules of caste , the combined insolence and obsequiousness of all classes with whom I came in con - tact , were so unpleasant to me that , while my visit there was a constant enjoyment and a school , I would not live under the British Government for any consideration . ''

		The French government is much more tolerable .


Louis Napoleon	PERSON	is emperor by usurpation , but I really think that the government is not only for the good , but is the choice of the people and others .

		There is the greatest personal liberty and equality here , and the in - stitutions tend to advance equality and give a fair chance to merit .

		It is true that through the press people can - not discuss politics except on one side .

		In private life , and indeed in the saloons and public places , there seems no restraint .

		The administration of the law seems well conducted .

		Taxes , as compared with
England	LOCATION	, are light , and the Frenchman has no restraint , either by caste or law , from doing what he wishes , except that he must not write against the government .

		His equality with his neighbor is recognized .

		There is more freedom , if I might say so , more mixing of all classes of people here , and on terms of kindliness and equality , than you will find even in
America	LOCATION	.

		The blouses , the uniforms , and the black coats all sit and eat and chat together .

		On the whole , they have much more claim to be a ' free people ' than the English , and hereafter I will know how to appreciate an English account of French tyranny . ''

		The volume is admirable in mechanical ex - ecution , and is furnished with a good index .

		The most serious misprint that we have noticed is '' Ladslen '' for ''
Gadsden	LOCATION	, '' page 54 .

		If we have given the General more prominence than the Senator , we have also suggested the rea - son -

		* In one respect at least ,

		He won for himself during his lifetime a devoted friendship which after his death made it a labor of love to see that his writings were adequately presented to a public that had not received them entirely with gratitude .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 of some vagaries and considerable irrelevant matter , is a genuine contribution to American biographical literature .

		Alcott , in a letter given in the volume which occasions this brief article , says of Thoreau : '' There has been none such since Pliny , and it will be long before there comes his like ; the most sagacious and wonder - ful Worthy of his time , and a marvel to com - ing ones . ''

		One can not forbear quoting a few lines from
Emerson	LOCATION	's splendid tribute : '' Through the green tents by eldest nature drest He roamed , content alike with man and beast .

		Where darkness found him , he lay glad at night ; There the red morning touched him with its light .

		******* Go where he will , the wise man is at home , His hearth the earth , his hall the azure dome . ''

		To these eulogists must be added Mr.
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	, who brings to his labors his simple and refined style , his tact , his wide knowledge , his devotion to the subject .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	shows again in this volume the qualities which make his biography of Thoreau a model of its kind .

		Surely the
Concord	LOCATION	group is not lack - ing in pietat .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's book is what one must expect from the experienced hand that put it together .

		The introduction has the unusual fault that it is altogether too brief for the reader 's profit and pleasure .

		The book is divided into three parts '' Years of Discipline , '' '' The Golden Age of Achievement , '' '' Friends and Follow - ers '' ; and the division is certainly a happy one .

		The editor 's passages in connection with or elu - cidation of the letters are always adequate and luminous ; the volume becomes a familiar auto - biography of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, fresh , thoroughly uncon - ventional , and sufficiently complete .

		The ac - knowledgment of another debt to Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	gains strength from the many which he has already required from his readers .

		The following paragraph from Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's introduction is worth reproducing here , as it tells briefly how the establishment of
Thoreau	LOCATION	as a permanent figure in American literature has been gaining firmness ever since his too early death : '' The fortune of
Henry Thoreau	PERSON	as an author of books has been peculiar , and such as to indicate more permanence of his name and fame than could be pre - dicted of many of his contemporaries .

		In the years of his literary activity -LRB- twenty-five in all -RRB- , from
1837	DATE	to
1862	DATE	when he died , not quite forty-five years old , he published but two volumes , and those with much de - lay and difficulty in finding a publisher .

		But in the thirty-two years since his death , nine volumes have been published from his manuscripts and fugitive pieces , the present being the tenth .

		Besides these , two biog - raphies of Thoreau have appeared in
America	LOCATION	, and two others in
England	LOCATION	, with numerous reviews and sketches of the man and his writings , enough to make several volumes more .

		At the present the sale of his books and the interest in his life are greater than ever ; and he seems to have grown early into an American classic , like his
Concord	LOCATION	neighbors ,
Emerson	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		Pilgrimages are made to his grave and his daily haunts , as to theirs , and those who come find it to be true , as was said by an accomplished woman -LRB- Miss
Elizabeth Hoar	PERSON	-RRB- soon after his death , that ' Concord is
Henry	PERSON	's monument , adorned with suitable inscriptions by his own hand . ' ''

		The struggling writer of to-day may take this to his heart , and ponder on it ; he must remem - ber , however , that , like all authors who have had a similar destiny ,
Thoreau	PERSON	had something to say which was above all limitations of time and space , and will be as worth thinking and believing in the days to come as it was when he uttered it .

		He was a realist in the best sense of that term ; he had his eye fixed upon the object ; he certainly endeavored to see it as it was ; but he made no effort to reproduce it in its crude isolation , or in the aspect which it as - sumed in some momentary relation between it and his own mind .

		He had a sufficient store of belief in himself , but he was not egotist enough to suppose that a transcription of his fleeting moods was of much importance to mankind at large .

		His representation of the object was always plentifully mixed with thought , and so we have a living landscape , filled with clear air and light .

		And then he had the transcen - dentalist 's unfailing resource , high meditations , which were the reality in reality itself .

		The letters presented in this selection show
Thoreau	PERSON	from his gentlest and most familiar side .

		They are domestic and gossipy , they dis - play his simple likes and dislikes , they will bring him closer to those who have long ad - mired him , and will win for him friends who have been somewhat repelled by his satire and austerity .

		They are as characteristic as any - thing which he has left , and are permeated with the flavor which is his and no other man 's .

		They also disclose his limitations , some of which he shared with his contemporaries , and some of which were his own peculiar property , and rather unduly estimated for that wholly unsatisfactory reason .

		It is possible here to give only a few extracts , but they will indicate what is to be expected by the reader who takes up
Thoreau	PERSON	for the first time , and they will recall to the reader of many years the things and thoughts which he has found pleasant before .

		Here is part of a letter to his sister
Helen	PERSON	; it was written in
1837	DATE	, when
Thoreau	PERSON	was twenty years old .

		The child is , indeed , father of the man .

		230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, '' Please you , let the defendant say a few words in defense of his long silence .

		You know we have hardly done our own deeds , thought our own thoughts , or lived our own lives hitherto .

		For a man to act himself , he must be perfectly free ; otherwise he is in danger of losing all sense of responsibility or of self-respect ... Further , letter-writing too often degenerates into a communicating of facts , not truths ; of other men 's deeds and not our thoughts .

		What are the convulsions of a planet , compared with the emotions of a soul ?

		or the rising of a thousand suns , if that is not enlightened by a ray ? ''

		The longer and more important letters are written to Mr.
Blake	PERSON	.

		Thoreau apparently opened his heart to the latter , and to his En - glish friend
Cholmondeley	PERSON	.

		Here is a passage with the authentic savor : '' Shall , then , the maple yield sugar , and not man ?

		Shall a farmer be thus active , and surely have so much sugar to show for it , before this very
March	DATE	is gone , while I read the newspapers ?

		... Am I not a sugar - maple man , then ?

		Boil down the sweet sap which the
spring	DATE	causes to flow within you .

		Stop not at syrup , go on to sugar , though you present thy world with but a single crystal , a crystal not made from trees in your yard , but from the new life that stirs in your pores .

		Cheerfully skim your kettle , and watch it set and crys - tallize , making a holiday of it if you will .

		Heaven will be propitious to you as to him . ''

		Say to the farmer , There is your crop ; here is mine .

		Mine is a sugar to sweeten sugar with .

		If you will listen to me , I will sweeten your whole load , your whole life . ''

Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The interest of it all appears as fresh as ever , and demands our attention as much as ever .

		The men and women of that time did not work in material wholly ephem - eral ; they searched for what was lasting , and they found it ; they tried to learn what life and progress meant ; they had no time to waste in empty complainings or sickly coddlings of the emotions ; they labored hard and seriously , and what they left belongs to the most import - ant contributions made to man 's pleasure and wisdom by the planet in this century .

		There was a free market for the oil as it came out of the wells and out of the refineries , and free competition between buyers and sellers , producers and consumers , manufacturers and traders .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 were panics in oil speculation , bank failures , defal - cations , followed by distress and the violent acts of despair .

		The year
1872	DATE	marked the beginning of a new order of things .

		Ten years before '' a man of brains and energy , without money , '' had appeared in
Cleveland	LOCATION	and started a small refinery .

		He as - sociated others with him , and prosecuted his busi - ness with such marked success that when disaster overtook others he was in a position to profit by it .

		His prosperity was in the ratio of the bankruptcy , the ruin of competition .

		The public agitation was great .

		Investigations by
State	ORGANIZATION	legislatures and by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	followed , only to be suppressed by some in - visible power .

		But it was revealed to the people that '' They , and the production , refining , and transporta - tion of their oil , had been made the subject of a secret ' contract ' between certain citizens .

		The high contract - ing parties to this treaty for the disposal of an industrial province were , on one side , all the great railroad com - panies , without whose services the oil , crude or refined , could not be moved to refineries , markets , or ports of shipment on river , lake , or ocean .

		On the other side was a body of thirteen men , ' not one of whom lived in the oil regions , or was an owner of oil wells or oil lands , ' who had associated themselves for the control of the oil business under the winning name of the South Im - provement Company . ''

		Ten of these thirteen proprietors of the
South Improvement Company	ORGANIZATION	were members of the oil trust , known and feared the world over .

		With them the railroads had contracted to increase the freight rates on oil so as to destroy their competition ; to give them the advance collected from these compet - itors , and to rebate to them on their own business all above the old rates .

		Thus the company of thir - teen , and not the railroad companies , was to get the benefit of the additional charge made to the people .

		This was estimated to amount to eighteen thousand dollars a day in the year the contract was made .

		Having succeeded in effecting this powerful com - bination , the trust proceeded to the conquest of the world .

		This was not accomplished in a season .

		To absorb the properties of competition on their own terms was the first step , the ingenuity and boldness of which mark the master-mind in control .

		When the competitors were convinced that they were shut out from their markets , that they could not afford to pay the double rates the transportation companies prescribed , and that even if they could cars would be denied them , they were in a frame of mind to accept the terms the enemy offered .

		The capacity of their refineries was reduced one-half , which en - abled the trust to advance the rates five hundred per cent to the public , and to pocket profits that in five years amounted to a fabulous sum .

		Embold - ened by this success , the next step was the absorp - tion of the independent refineries .

		The sales which were forced were kept secret , and the victimized proprietors became the salaried employees of the trust .

		In a city not a hundred miles from
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, two brothers had inherited a business of forty thou - sand dollars a year , which had been built up by the energy and ability of their father .

		They were happy and contented in their business associations , and were esteemed as among the most useful and solid members of the community .

		In time they were invited by an agent of the trust to sell their busi - ness . ''

		We do not want to sell , '' they replied . ''

		Then we shall have to compel you to , '' was the parting warning .

		Through the aid given by the railroad companies , the trust obtained the names of their customers , to whom goods were offered at rates they could not meet .

		When their business was taken away , the trust succeeded in buying their property at a nominal valuation , and in securing the services of the unfortunate brothers as employees .

		In
Cleveland	LOCATION	a widow was conducting a business left by her husband , at a profit of
$ 25,000	MONEY	a year .

		She refused an invitation to sell , and was warned that if she did not sell she would be ruined .

		Then in time the head of the trust called on her .

		The result of this visit was afterwards revealed in court .

		The widow told the great man that she realized that her company was entirely in his power . ''

		` All I can do is to appeal to your honor as a gentle - man , and to your sympathy , to do the best with me that you can .

		I beg of you to consider your wife in my po - sition , left with this business and with fatherless chil - dren , and with a large indebtedness that my husband had just contracted for the first time in his life .

		I felt that I could not do without the income arising from this business , and I have taken it up and gone on , and been successful in the hardest year since my husband commenced . '

		He promised , with tears in his eyes , that be would stand by her . '

		He agreed that I might retain whatever amount of stock I desired .

		He seemed to want only the control .

		I thought his feelings were such that I could trust him , and that he would deal honor - ably by me . ' ''

		She appraised her property at
$ 200,000	MONEY	, and the directory of her company approved the sale at that figure .

		But the sale was made without her volition , at
$ 71,000	MONEY	; and she was required to sign a bond not to go into the refining business for ten years .

		This was caring for the widow and the fatherless in a manner worthy a robber baron of other days .

		These cases illustrate the method usually pursued to obtain possession of the refining business .

		But when this failed , property was destroyed and life placed in jeopardy .

		The end justified the means , in the opinion of these gamblers for wealth .

		There has not been wanting resistance on the part of the people interested in the oil fields ; and enterprising competition has appeared again and again .

		Shut out from railroad transportation , American ingenuity suggested a pipe line reaching to a lower level ; then invented a power pump to force the crude oil to any level ; and finally dis - covered that refined oil could be forced through a tube for hundreds of miles without loss of quality .

		But every improvement was resisted by the great combination .

		At one point in
Northern Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania an armed force and a Gatling gun checked 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the construction of a pipe line .

		The aid of courts , and aggravating suits , were means employed to harass and break down opposition .

		When at last the independents succeeded in getting their oil to the seaboard , the shipping docks of the several trunk lines were found to be in possession of the trust .

		At one time the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Railroad Company broke up the combination and went into opposition .

		Backed by the other trunk lines , the trust waged the war with such vigor as to bring the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Company to terms and compel it to enter into a new contract in
1885	DATE	'' a contract so vicious and illegal , '' said the counsel of the inde - pendent refiners before the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	, '' that the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Railroad re - fuses to bring it into court for fear a disclosure of its terms might subject it to a criminal prosecution . ''

		Thus the oil sea of the American continent has produced its octopus as well as the salt sea , but of a size commensurate with the magnitude of its prey , its all-powerful arms furnished with a thousand times 960 pairs of suckers .

		But we may not dwell on this absorbing phase of our subject .

		The history of the oil trust illustrates , says our author , '' Nearly every phase of the story of our great mo - nopoly : dearness instead of cheapness ; willingness of the managers of transportation to deny transportation to whole trades and sections ; administration of great railroad properties in direct opposition to the interests of the owners to their great loss for the benefit of favorites of the officials ; great wealth thereby procured by destruction , as if by physical force , of wealth of oth - ers , not at all by creation of new wealth to be added to the general store ; impossibility of survival in modern business of men who are merely honest , hard-working , competent , even though they have skill , capital and cus - tomers ; subjection of the majority of citizens and dol - lars to a small minority in numbers and riches ; subser - vience of rulers of the people to a faction ; last , and most disheartening , the impotence of the special tribu - nal -LSB-
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- created to en - force the rights of the people on their highways ... '' The smokeless rebate makes the secret of success in business to be , not manufacture , but manufracture breaking down with a strong hand the true makers of things .

		To those who can get the rebate , it makes no difference who does the digging , building , mining , mak - ing , producing the million forms of the wealth they covet for themselves .

		They need only get control of the roads .

		All that they want of the wealth of others can be switched off the highways into their hands . ''

		From using railroad power to give better rates to the larger man , it was an easy step to using it to make a favorite first a larger man , then the largest man , and finally the only man in the business .

		In meat and cat - tle we see men rising from poverty to great wealth .

		From being competitors , like other men , in the scram - ble , they get into the comfortable seat of control of the prices at which the farmer must sell cattle , and at which the people must buy meat .

		Many other men had thrift , sobriety , industry , but only these had the rebate , and so only these are the ' fittest in the struggle for exist - ence . ' ''

		Our author observes that in the
United States	LOCATION	the processes of business feudalization are moving more rapidly to the end than in any other country .

		The middle classes , the keepers of small retail stores , small manufacturers , are being crowded out , and a few men in each trade are rising to supreme wealth .

		The independence of the old order is rapidly giving way to dependence on the power of wealth , before which skill , ability , industry , with limited means , stand helpless .

		The success of the men who have formed the great trusts is tempting the ambitious in other lines of trade to bring about combinations that shall concentrate power in a few hands .

		An examination of prices of fourteen staple products during the depression of
1893	DATE	shows that granu - lated sugar , petroleum , steel rails , and anthracite coal all controlled by strong trusts declined not quite ten per cent , whereas the prices of the other ten staple products , subject to the natural laws of trade , declined twenty-four per cent .

		As the cost of pro- duction can be lowered faster in factory than in farm products , it is clear that the natural order is reversed under the influence of trusts .

		Where does this tend ?

		When we shall have further extended this policy of concentration , what will be the status of the American people ?

		The shred of republican government remaining will not be worth preserving .

		Already the courts and executive departments are laughed to scorn .

		The law for the protection of the people is dead .

		As , in the days of the old
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	, the sign-manual of the manager , Mr.
Child	PERSON	, was held in greater favor in
Bombay	LOCATION	or
Calcutta	LOCATION	than an act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, so in the model Republic at the close of the nineteenth century , the expressed wish of our monopoly is the law .

		Independent
America	LOCATION	was the first great protest of a united people against monopoly .

		In the early days of the mother country no market could be opened without authority of the King , and no ship could unload in any bay or estuary which he had not declared to be a port .

		This principle , ex - tended to commerce , made the industries of the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	dependent wholly on the kingly will expressed through the
British Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	.

		We rebelled , and set human industry and commerce free .

		The individual secured liberty for develop - ment .

		America became great ; her people intelli - gent and happy .

		But these very conditions have invited an enemy to enter and set up a tyranny .

		Our highways , our seaports , are subject to his will .

		Thus we have returned to subjection without the saving grace of obedience to lawful authority .

		The sacrifices of revolution and of civil war to extirpate a slave oligarchy had better have been spared , if we are to fail in self-government at last .

		But we shall not fail .

		The outlook is dark , but we shall find the narrow path of duty leading to the true , the imperishable light , and , as a people , be endowed with the courage to follow it .

		Many questions are suggested by Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's story of the trusts , which can not be considered in limited space .

		The great danger at present con - fronting us is the tendency to extreme measures of
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 redress .

		If , in dealing with the railroad question , we are governed by the broad spirit pervading the great opinion of Mr.
Justice Harlan	PERSON	, recently delivered , we shall find out what is just for all parties .

		It is certain that if the managers of the railroads of the country have made great mis - takes , as they surely have , the investors in railroad securities have already suffered to an extent that entitles them to special consideration .

		Upon high authority it is shown that during the past decade 74,348 miles of railway operated by 311 independ - ent corporations , and capitalized at
$ 3,853,371,000	MONEY	, passed from the control of stockholders into that of receivers appointed by the courts on account of in - sufficient revenue to meet the expenses of operation , taxes , and interest .

		In
1871	DATE	the dividends paid averaged
$ 1,265	MONEY	per mile of line ; in
1882	DATE	the av - erage was
$ 952	MONEY	; in
1893	DATE	only
$ 572	MONEY	.

		* Let it not be said that we are incapable of ad - justing the railroad complications confronting labor and capital , on an equitable basis .

		We are at the threshold of a settlement .

		And these once ad - justed , we shall have leisure for dealing with other questions that seriously affect the political , social , and moral well-being of the American people .

		I very much doubt whether we shall witness a repe - tition of the humiliating spectacle of the legislative branch of government obeying the behests of the sugar trust .

		The public conscience will make itself felt .

		It will be quickened and strengthened by read - ing the last two chapters of Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's book , which deal with the moral phase of the questions at issue . ''

		If all will sacrifice themselves , none need be sac - rificed .

		But if one may sacrifice another , all are sacrificed . ''

		That is the spirit . ''

		In industry we have been substituting all the mean passions that can set man against man in place of the irresistible power of brotherhood .

		To tell us of the progress - ive sway of brotherhood in all human affairs is the sole message of history . ''

		Our author is optimistic .

		He believes that democracy is not a lie ; that there '' live in the body of the commonalty the unex - hausted virtue and the ever-refreshened strength which can rise equal to any problems of progress . ''

		Happy shall we be as a people if we do not mistake the true road for that which leads back to barbarism .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Professor
John Maccunn	PERSON	's small vol - ume `` P < > n `` The Ethics of Citizen - ship '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of the most remarkable books of political philosophy that have been published for years .

		It deserves a place by the side of such works as Mill 's '' Liberty '' and Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	's '' Compromise . ''

		This praise is due , not to anything startling or even novel in the con - tents , but simply to the ripeness of its thought and the unfailing soundness of view displayed .

		It dis - cusses such subjects as equality , fraternity , natural rights , the rule of the majority , political consistency , the effects of democracy upon character , and the economic and ethical aspects of luxury .

		It would seem as if nothing new could possibly be said upon these subjects , and , as has already been suggested , the weight of Professor
Maccunn	PERSON	's treatment comes from its manner rather than from its matter .

		The treatment is highly abstract , but the author knows how to clothe abstractions with the charm of a care - fully-considered , dignified , and even noble , style .

		Particularly noticeable is the use that he makes of what is evidently a wide range of reading .

		He does not quote in blocks , as is so often done , but has a positive genius for the selection and use of the tell - ing phrase of
Burke	LOCATION	, or of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, or of
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		Nor are the poets neglected , a fact which we may illustrate by the extremely effective use of
Burns	PERSON	at the close of a chapter on '' The Rights of Man , '' as well as by many another apposite bit from Words - worth , or
Shelley	LOCATION	, or
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		As an example of the author 's style , let us take a passage from the discussion of political consistency .

		After eloquently setting forth the evils that flow from the ignorance , the haste , and the self-interest of the politician , he goes on as follows : '' There is no direct remedy .

		For it is not by wishes or resolves , not by warnings or exhortations , that men are ever likely to be kept consistent .

		They must learn to take that longer way round which is the shortest way home .

		They must first do their part to secure the conditions of the thing they covet .

		To Knowledge they must add Deliberation , and to Deliberation , Disinterestedness , in well-grounded confidence that , though these great elements of character can only blend into effective union through time and experience , the man who has them has at least the stuff out of which consist - ency is made .

		Most of all must they learn from earliest years to love their country with that deep and settled affection which , above all other influences , can redeem men 's public lives from the most fatal forms of inconsistency .

		If one were asked what was the secret of the consistency of
Mazzini	PERSON	, it would not be enough to answer that he had an ideal .

		It would be needful to add that it was an ideal on which he had set not only mind but heart , and to point out that , through all defeats , disillusionments , and disgusts , his affections never swerved from that vision that upheld him of an
Italy	LOCATION	free , united , and republican . ''

		The tone of Professor
Maccunn	PERSON	's book is that of the sobered optimism that comes to all deeply reflective souls , rather than of the pessimism that we find , for example , in the late Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's '' National Life and Character . ''

		He is not despond - ent for democracy , like the late Sir
Henry Maine	PERSON	, but hopeful , like our own
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		Democracy , in our day , is growing tolerant ; since
Bentham	PERSON	's time , it has gone to school . ''

		It has given ear to the tales of the travellers , and to the researches of the eth - nologist , who have made even the popular mind fa - miliar with customs , morals , laws , which are not its 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, own .

		It has listened to the student of other coun - tries and other civilizations , to which perhaps De - mocracy has never come .

		The historian has told his story of men greater even than modern reform - ers , and of events more momentous even than re - form bills .

		The magic of historical romance has shown how lives , heroic , gentle , saintly , could be lived under old Feudalism as well as under new Radicalism .

		And the political philosopher , even the political reformer , has ceased to wish to fashion men and things anew .

		For he has come to see that not only for the sake of the hoarded wisdom of past experience , but in obedience to Evolution and the very laws of life , the Radical who would look for - ward to posterity must also , in a deeper sense than
Burke	PERSON	imagined when he used the words , look back - wards to his ancestors . ''

		The domestic side of army life is Domestic life drawn with unrelenting realism in MI the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		y \ i - - n - i > < * i Mrs.
Orsemus Bronson Boyd	PERSON	s '' Cav - alry Life in Tent and Field '' -LRB-
Tait & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The writer , an officer 's wife , started for the Far West to join her husband in
1867	DATE	; and from that time to
1885	DATE	, when she was left a widow , the breaks in the monotony of her career as an '' army lady '' seem to have been about on a par with Mrs.
Prim	PERSON	- rose 's migrations from the blue bed to the brown .

		Military life , in the piping times of peace , is a poor one at best ; and Mrs.
Boyd	PERSON	does not idealize it .

		Not that her book is a dull one .

		A faithful trans - cript of personal experiences , it is to our thinking much more interesting , and certainly more edifying , than the familiar brass-button novel , with its wire - drawn expansions of garrison gossip and flirtation , and its sentimentalized view of garrison life .

		To the delusions bred of these airy productions , Mrs.
Boyd	PERSON	furnishes a wholesome corrective .

		Take , for instance , the picture of her first '' home '' in the West a cheerful abode , '' formed of two wall tents pitched together so the inner one could be used as a sleeping and the outer as a sitting room .

		A cal - ico curtain divided them , and a carpet made of bar - ley sacks covered the floor .

		The wall tents were only eight feet square , and when windowless and doorless , except for one entrance , as were those , they seemed from the inside much like a prison . ''

		Such was Mrs.
Boyd	PERSON	's home for the first year of her mar - ried life .

		Love , of course , laughs at more danger - ous foes than locksmiths ; but one fancies that a year in a wall tent would put him to a rather se - rious test .

		Some of Mrs.
Boyd	PERSON	's experiences are amusing enough , notably those with her soldier cooks .

		One of these worthies -LRB- evidently a '' pam - pered menial , '' as the old verse has it -RRB- used to strongly object to '' cooking for company . ''

		On one occasion , when in his cups , he distinguished himself and extinguished his mistress '' by reeling in before a whole party of friends who were awaiting lunch - eon , and declaring that he was no slave , nor had he engaged himself as a hotel cook . ''

		`` His freedom of manner , '' adds the good-natured narrator , '' was so natural among frontier people , that everyone laughed , and all sallied out in the dining room , where we passed around bowls of bread and milk . ''

		This frontier '' freedom of manner , '' by-the-bye , was early brought to Mrs.
Boyd	PERSON	's notice at
Ruby	ORGANIZATION	, a halting-place on the first journey overland to Ne - vada , where she overheard a station-lounger ask her husband , with a show of polite interest , '' How did the old woman stand the trip ? ''

		the '' old wo - man '' being then a bride of a few months ' standing .

		The book is readable and informing , in its way , and it contains a portrait of Captain
Boyd	PERSON	, with some account of his career and character .

		A surprising Miss
Mildred Rutherford	PERSON	has com - coiiection of piled a work upon '' American Au - American authors .

		t h ors '' -LRB-
Atlanta	LOCATION	: The Author -RRB- , which we have examined with considerable interest , not unmixed with amusement .

		It includes writers known and unknown to fame , in about equal pro- portions .

		That it might have included still more of the latter class is hinted at in a prefatory note which informs us that '' in the South alone there are over 3500 writers . ''

		We are spared many of these , and might have been spared more , Mrs.
Lollie Belle Wylie	PERSON	, for instance , some of whose poems , we are informed , `` are quite striking . ''

		Even the '' Sweet Rose of
Florida	LOCATION	, '' who gets five pages of this book , is , we blush to confess it , unknown to us .

		The quality of Miss
Rutherford	ORGANIZATION	's work may best be shown by a few brief extracts .

		Of
George Ripley	PERSON	we are told that '' he possessed valuable books in German and French . ''

		Walt Whitman '' can never reach the refined circle of humanity . ''

		` Cos why ? ''

		He appeals to the worst part of our nature , not the best . ''


F. S. Saltus	PERSON	`` had no rev - erence for the Bible , and often gave strange ver - sions of the records there . ''

		As for Colonel
Inger	PERSON	- soll , we suppose that he must be beyond hope ; for does not this writer , after relating some choice an - ecdotes of obviously journalistic origin , piously ex - claim : '' Alas !

		morality can not save ! ''

		After this , we are not surprised to read that ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	'' is '' truly a great book , '' and that the productions of the late
E. P. Roe	PERSON	'' are safe books to place in the hands of our young people . ''

		Apropos of the latter ingenious writer , this remark is made : ''
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's unjust criticism of Roe may have been caused from mistaking another
Roe	PERSON	's works for his . ''

		According to the best of our recollection , Mr. Ar - nold simply said that the inhabitants of the Missis - sippi Valley were reported to derive a large share of their intellectual sustenance from the writings of a native author called Roe .

		But this was an '' unjust criticism '' of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, not of Roe .

		A description of one of the productions of Mrs.
Amelie Rives Chanler	PERSON	tells us that the book '' is filled with passion , deep intrigue , wild jealousy , hatred , murder , and terrible revenge . ''

		After this , it is somewhat tame to come upon so simple a state - ment as that the conversations of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	'' while flippant are natural . ''

		The book may be described ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 on the whole , as an uncritical hodge-podge , sea - soned with mythical anecdotes , of which an excel - lent example is the yarn about Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	and the lady who became his wife .

		It is needless to say that the story is a baseless fabrication , prob - ably due to the imagination of some newspaper writer hard-pressed for '' copy . ''

		University Extension addresses .


University Extension	ORGANIZATION	has been made the target of many jibes and shafts of more or less ill-tempered criticism from those who judge all educational movements from the standpoint of a narrow scholasticism , and who condemn the Extension movement because it modestly helps within its own sphere and does not attempt the impracticable .

		But in spite of the hu - morous pictures of blacksmiths wrestling with the intricacies of
Browning	PERSON	's poetry , and the pathetic de - scriptions of housemaids perplexed by the choruses of Greek tragedy , the movement has gone on its way , has reached the respectable age of twenty-one , and is now more firmly than ever before fixed in the educational machinery of
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		How seriously it has been taken in
England	LOCATION	, at least , is made sufficiently clear by the names of the men who have identified themselves with it to the extent of addressing the students of the
London	LOCATION	Society at the annual meetings of that body .

		These meetings were started in
1886	DATE	with an address by Mr.
G. J. Goschen	PERSON	, and the speakers for the sub - sequent years have been Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, Sir
James Paget	PERSON	, Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	, the
Duke of Argyll	ORGANIZATION	, the Bishop of
Durham	LOCATION	,
Canon Browne	PERSON	, Pro- fessor
Jebb	PERSON	, and Lord
Playfair	PERSON	.

		Although the ad - dresses of some of these men have already seen the light elsewhere , it was an excellent idea to collect the nine in a single volume , as has now been done , the volume being appropriately entitled '' Aspects of Modern Study '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		That all of the men thus represented are convinced of the value of Ex - tension work is sufficiently evident from the tenor of their utterances .

		Aside from their special bear - ings , these nine essays constitute a volume of edu - cational discussion of the most suggestive sort , and deserve to be widely read .

		Where all are good , it is invidious to single out a few for special praise , but we may perhaps be permitted to call particular attention to Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's address on `` The Study of Literature , '' and to Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's beautiful study of `` The Influence of the Greek Mind on Modern Life . ''

		Outlines of
American Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Seldon L. Whitcomb	PERSON	's ''
Chrono	PERSON	- logical Outlines of American Liter - ature -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a companion volume to Mr.
Frederick Ryland	PERSON	's similar treat - ment of English literature on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		To the usefulness of that work , published in
1890	DATE	, we can testify from much experience , and it is with great satisfaction that we place Mr.
Whit	PERSON	- comb 's compilation by the side of the other upon the shelf .

		The same general plan is followed : the parallel columns being headed as in Mr.
Ryland	PERSON	's book , excepting that we have here a new column of '' British Literature '' -LRB- which was of course neces - sary -RRB- , and that the annotations are given by Mr.
Whitcomb	PERSON	at the foot of the page .

		It goes without saying , also , that the treatment is much fuller in the present case , which none will esteem a fault , although the wish may emerge that Mr.
Ryland	PERSON	's book might be extended to relatively comparable dimensions .

		The column headed '' Foreign Liter - ature '' is also much elaborated , and the historical column strengthened .

		We may add that a most important feature , although not a new one the beginnings of the most important American period - icals are chronicled under their respective dates .

		The first entry is
John Smith	PERSON	's `` True Relation '' -LRB- 1608 -RRB- ; the last is `` The Standard Dictionary '' -LRB- 1894 -RRB- .

		The entries up to 1640 -LRB- `` The Bay Psalm Book '' -RRB- are , of course , of books printed in
England	LOCATION	.

		The following list of the veterans among our living writers has been gleaned from the index of `` Au - thors and Their Works , '' and is not without inter - est. .

		The venerable Judge Gayarre * -LRB- 1805 -RRB- heads the list .

		Then comes Mr.

New York	LOCATION	history York history .

		J J and topography , collected under the title of `` In Old New York '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , forms a volume of much local and fair general interest .

		Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	writes entertainingly , and his pages are brimful of forgotten fact and curious reminiscence .

		Notably good are the pictures of old
New Amster	LOCATION	- dam days , when the placid Dutchmen , as yet un - ruffled by the forays of their
New England	LOCATION	neigh - bors , smoked their pipes and contemplated their cabbages on the banks of the odorous canal in Broad Street .

		Since Irving , historians have felt rather bound to gird pleasantly at these multi-breeched ancestors of
Gotham	LOCATION	's Brahmins ; and Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	follows the irreverent rule .

		In point of morals ,
New Yorkers	LOCATION	of two hundred years ago would seem if we are to believe the Reverend
John Miller	PERSON	, resident Chaplain to the
King	ORGANIZATION	's forces a pretty bad lot .

		The reverend gentleman , after roundly scoring the Province at large , berates the citizens of
New York	LOCATION	in particular as '' drunkards and gam - blers , '' and adds : '' This , joined to their profane , atheistical , and scoffing methods of discourse , makes their company extremely uneasy to sober and relig - ious men . ''

		In the paper on ''
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	'' we are afforded a glimpse of
Thomas Paine	PERSON	, who , about 236 .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16 y	DATE	A students 1 Anglo-Saxon Dictwnary .

		1809 , lived in a house in Herring street -LRB- now 293 Bleecker -RRB- where Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	's informant often saw him at his window : '' The sash was raised , and a small table or stand was placed before him with an open book upon it which he appeared to be read - ing .

		He had his spectacles on , his left elbow rested upon the table or stand , and his chin rested between the thumb and fingers of his hand ; his right hand lay upon his book , and a decanter containing liquor of the color of rum or brandy was standing next his book or beyond it . ''

		Touching the contents of this decanter , it would perhaps be more charitable to guess that the ex-staymaker -LRB- who was an admirer of
Berkeley	LOCATION	-RRB- was assisting his meditations and solac - ing his labors with tar-water .

		We refer the point to Mr.
M. D. Conway	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	's book is beau - tifully illustrated , and it contains several useful maps and charts .

		by Dr j ohn R >
Ckrk Hall	PERSON	^ fiUg a vacant place and supplies a real need .

		The old
Bosworth	ORGANIZATION	is badly out of date , and the new Bos - worth is still far from completion .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's work consequently provides the student with just what he wants pending the complete revision of
Bosworth	ORGANIZATION	, and will , indeed , provide most students with as full a dictionary as they will need at all .

		The original plan of the author was '' to collect into one volume the information contained in the numerous glos - saries to Anglo-Saxon text-books , readers , etc. , which have appeared in
England	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	within the last fifteen years or so such books , for instance , as Sweet 's Reader ,
Harrison	PERSON	and Sharp 's Beowulf , and
Kluge	PERSON	's Lesebuch . ''

		But as the work progressed , the original plan suffered several ex - pansions , and now includes the
Wright	PERSON	- Wtilker Vo - cabularies ,
Harrison	PERSON	and
Baskerville	PERSON	's translation of
Grosschopp	LOCATION	,
Leo	PERSON	's Angelsachsisches Glossar , a con - cordance to the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		of Alfred prepared by the author for separate publication , the new
Bosworth	ORGANIZATION	as far as published , and a number of unglossaried texts .

		Among matters of detail we note the strictly alphabetical arrangement , the reduction of spelling to the Early West Saxon standard -LRB- provided the forms actually occur -RRB- , the use of the macron as the only diacritical mark , the reference of many words to the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		in which they occur , the grammatical references to Sweet 's Reader and to Cook 's
Sievers	PERSON	, and the large number of cross-references .

		The work is a square octavo of 369 three-columned pages .

		Pasquier 's third volume of Memoirs -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , opening with the first Bourbon restoration and closing with the earlier events of the second , will prove of ab - sorbing interest to serious readers .

		The story of the Hundred Days is luminously treated , chiefly from the political standpoint ; and the book through - out is rich in incidents that fell under
Pasquier	PERSON	's immediate notice .

		Commenting on
Waterloo	LOCATION	, he describes the dissatisfaction of the marshals over More of Pasquier ^ s Memoirs .

		Grouchy 's appointment , at the previous council at
Charleroi	LOCATION	, to the very important command of the army corps constituting the right flank .

		After the council , it seems ,
Soult	LOCATION	, as spokesman for his col - leagues , returned , and informed the Emperor that the marshals considered it their duty to say that they believed Grouchy had received a command altogether disproportionate to his talents .

		Capable of executing in the field , with brilliancy and effect , orders immediately given him , he was incapable of an initiative , and lacked the perspicacity needed ta modify orders in obedience to new and unforeseen conditions .

		Grouchy , in short , was a serviceable tool but only a tool .

		Napoleon , continues Pas - quier , strode up and down for a few moments , as was his custom , without answering , and then said : `` You are right , sir ;
Marshal Grouchy	ORGANIZATION	is not en - dowed with any great ability ; but what am I ta do ?

		I have just given him his baton , and I can - not refuse him a command .

		Moreover , I have placed by his side two of the army 's best lieutenant - generals ; they will guide him , and , besides , I will constantly have my eye on him . ''

		`` After this ,
Sire	ORGANIZATION	, our responsibility ceases , '' said
Soult	PERSON	, as he with - drew .

		Whether or no the loss of the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	is rightly laid at
Grouchy	ORGANIZATION	's door , is a question ; but it is certain his appointment was a disastrous one .

		All in all , the Pasquier Memoirs may be regarded as the weightiest and most critical of recent contributions to Napoleonic history .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		From the special publication
department of Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have received an edition of the Tacitean '' Dialogus de Oratoribus , '' prepared by Mr.
Alfred Gudeman	PERSON	of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		This edi - tion , including , as the title-page adds , '' prolegomena , critical apparatus , exegetical and critical notes , bibli - ography , and indexes , '' is upon a scale that may fairly be termed monumental , for the fifty slight pages of the Latin text are imbedded in over five hundred pages of erudite comment .

		This is indeed the thoroughness which we are accustomed to style Germanic .

		It represents over five years of steady work on the part of the editor .

		The same publishers send us a college edition of the '' Dialogus , '' edited for their '' Series of Latin Authors '' by Mr.
Charles E. Bennett	PERSON	, and based in part upon the manuscript notes of the late
Lucius Heritage	PERSON	.

		First among the new German text-books upon our table must be named Dr.
Sylvester Primer	PERSON	's very at - tractive and complete edition of ''
Nathan	PERSON	der Weise '' -LRB- Heath -RRB- .

		Introduction , notes , and bibliography are all good .

		For younger students , Professor
Charles F. Brusie	PERSON	has edited three of Theodor Storm 's charming '' Ges - chichten aus der Tonne . ''

		Still younger students are aimed at by Mr.
R. J. Morich	PERSON	, who edits a tale entitled ''
Fritz	PERSON	auf dem Lande '' -LRB-
Maynard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Herr Hans Ar	PERSON	- nold , unknown , we should say , to any extended fame .

		It is not often that a new writer finds himself , after not more than four or five years of vogue , put among the classics , but some such fate has now befallen Dr.

		THE DIAL 237 for use as a school reading-book -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The text is of course much condensed , and the chapters are pro- vided with explanatory vocabularies .

		After all , school - children often have put before them matter of far less value , to say nothing of interest .

		In this connection we note the publication -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- of a handsome library edition , with good illustrations by Mr.
G. W. Bardwell	PERSON	, of this really great novel of
Monmouth	LOCATION	and his Rebellion .

		The maximum condensation not incompatible with interest and readability seems to be the aim of the '' Co - lumbian Knowledge '' series -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Pro- fessor
David P. Todd	PERSON	.

		We have had occasion to praise highly Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's '' Public Libraries in
America	LOCATION	, '' written for this series , and similar praise is deserved by Mrs.
Mabel Loomis Todd	PERSON	's '' Total Eclipses of the Sun . ''

		The amount of accurate information collected within the covers of this little volume is very great , and the setting-forth thereof , with the aid of maps , diagrams , and cuts , leaves little to be desired .

		Mrs.
Todd	PERSON	has chosen for her subject one of the most fascinating chap - ters of astronomical science , and even the specialist in eclipses , unless his reading is close up to date , may find matters of interest in this excellent little treatise .

		Some time ago we noted the appearance of the first volume of '' A
Laboratory Manual of Physics	ORGANIZATION	and Ap - plied Electricity '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Professor
Edward L. Nichols	PERSON	.

		The second and final volume , containing '' Senior Courses and Outlines of Advanced Work , '' is now at hand .

		In the preparation of this vol - ume the editor has had the collaboration of Messrs.
G. S. Moler	PERSON	,
F. Bedell	PERSON	,
H. J. Hotchkiss	PERSON	, and C. P. Mat - thews .

		The electrical courses given are in direct and alternating current work , the others in photometry , heat , spectroscopy , physiological optics , and magnetism .

		The treatise is one of the best of its class that we have seen .

		The third volume of Larned 's '' History for Ready Reference , '' Gree Nibe -LRB-

		These take up over 500 pages of the 793 contained in the volume .

		The histor - ical sketch of Law was prepared by
Austin Abbott	PERSON	, Dean of the
New York University Law School	ORGANIZATION	, but upon the same general plan as the other papers .

		Recent text-books of the French language are Mile .

George W. Rollins	PERSON	has just put forth .

		The selec - tions in this volume range from
Baron Marbot	LOCATION	to La - biche , from La Fontaine to
Gautier	PERSON	.

		There is a full vocabulary and a table of irregular conjugations .

		A useful handbook for persons practically connected with the art of printing is Mr.
W. J. Kelly	PERSON	's short treat - ise on '' Presswork '' -LRB- The
Inland Printer Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is made up of information and directions on a mul - titude of technical subjects , such as '' making ready '' a form on the press , '' overlaying '' and '' underlaying , '' the qualities and proper treatment of inks , etc. .

		Printers of the older school will look in vain for any but a casual reference to dampened paper the disuse of which , con - sequent upon the introduction of swift cylinder presses , the '' old-timers '' will probably never quite cease to de - plore .

		Their reverence for old times and methods will , however , find satisfaction in Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	's admission that after an investigation of all the systems of '' make - ready '' of the present time , he is unable to discover a single effective one which is not traceable to those used in hand-press printing .

		Even Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	could not ask a better tribute than this . ''

		The Surgeon 's Daughter '' and '' Castle Dangerous '' are the contents of the volume which completes the ''
Dryburgh	PERSON	'' edition of the '' Waverley Novels '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		The illustrations to this volume are by Messrs.
Paul Hardy	PERSON	and
Walter Paget	PERSON	.

		One may now have the pleasure of contemplating all twenty-five of these '' Dry - burgh '' books in a row , and few book-shelves will be as well furnished as that on which they rest .

		We have so frequently praised this edition of the great romancer , as it has come to us in instalments , that anything we might now say would be mere superfluous repetition .

		A note must be made , however , of the general index to the set which comes at the end of this last volume .

		That classic of mountaineering , Mr.
Edward Whym	PERSON	- per 's '' Travels amongst the
Great Andes	LOCATION	of the Equa - tor , '' reviewed by us at the time of its publication in
1892	DATE	, has just been reissued by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	at a noticeable reduction in price , although the form is sub - stantially that of the expensive first edition .

		From the same publishers we have a reissue , in a single stout vol - ume , with slightly reduced text and greatly reduced price , of General
A. W. Greely	PERSON	's '' Three Years of Arc - tic
Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' with its graphic and intensely interesting story of the
Lady Franklin Bay	LOCATION	Expedition of 1881-84 .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
October 10 , 1894	DATE	.

		The death of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	is the event chiefly spoken of in literary circles in
New York	LOCATION	.

		I may be permitted to recall here nay last glimpse of the poet -LRB- which was also my first -RRB- .

		It was at his home on Beacon street , and no earlier than the
Spring	DATE	of the present year .

		I had previously called to see him during the winter , with proper credentials , and was informed that he was '' out , '' not learning until two or three days after that he was seriously ill and in charge of a nurse .

		Of late years , it seems , a system had been perfected for concealing any illness , even the slightest , from public knowledge ; for no sooner would such a rumor get abroad than all Bos - ton would flock to
Beacon	LOCATION	street to make inquiries .

		I was received by the Doctor in the well-known study overlooking the
Back Bay	LOCATION	, and we chatted of my busi - ness for some ten minutes .

		He complained slightly of the after effects of his illness , but he was so bright and chatty and well-looking that I set him down mentally for from five to ten years more of life at least .

		What seemed to worry him more than anything else was the constant flow of letters which poured in on him every day ; and yet I could not help fancying that he would have greatly missed them if they had ceased to come .

		The death of the Autocrat seems to have been com - mented on in print less than might have been expected .

		Coining without warning , it threw the daily papers en - 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	y tirely upon obituaries already at hand in their files .

		His family , also , suppressed all efforts to make his fu - neral an affair of public demonstration , and it took place during a severe storm , with
King 's Chapel	ORGANIZATION	only half filled .

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's last appearance in this city was at a medical dinner given him here some years ago .

		He did not often visit the metropolis .

		The death of Professor
Vincenzo Botta	PERSON	, which re - sulted from the effects of a fall from his window , re - moves about the last survivor of the old
New York	LOCATION	lit - erary group .

		He married Miss
Anne Lynch	PERSON	in
1855	DATE	.

		It was at one of
Miss Lynch	LOCATION	's receptions that Poe first acknowledged and recited '' The Raven , '' and after her marriage Mrs.
Botta	PERSON	continued to hold these receptions until her death
two years ago	DATE	.

		Since that event Pro- fessor
Botta	PERSON	has been busy with Mrs.
Botta	PERSON	's '' Me - moirs , '' recently published .

		The visit of the rector of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's church in
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	to this country , in search of the grave of that
Virginia	LOCATION	settler who attended
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's fu - neral , is a matter of some amusement to those who re - member Mr.
Moncure D. Conway	PERSON	's similar search some years ago .

		Whence
Frederick Wadsworth Loring	PERSON	, or the residents of
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	, derived the legend on which
Loring	PERSON	's poem is based , I know not , as the poem appeared in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' in
1870	DATE	, and Lor - ing was killed by
Arizona	LOCATION	Indians the following year .

		The first stanza reads : '' In the old churchyard at
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	A gravestone stands to-day , Marking the place where a grave has been , Though many and many a year has it seen Since its tenant mouldered away .

		And that quaintly carved old stone Tells its simple tale to all : ' Here lies a bearer of the pall At the funeral of Shakespeare . ' ''

		It is a fine poem throughout , and it led Mr.
Conway	PERSON	a fine chase after the aforesaid tombstone .

		He found it at last , I believe , and also found that it belonged to another man , and that no pall-bearer of Shakespeare could have died at
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	anyhow .

		All this was told in a merry fashion by Mr.
Conway	PERSON	himself at the time .

		The ''
Springfield	LOCATION	Republican '' animadverts rather severely upon Dr.
Arbuthnot	PERSON	for his '' restora - tions '' in the
Stratford	LOCATION	church , but says that his action in suppressing the noisy tourists who visit it is com - mendable .

		Another traveller from
England	LOCATION	, Dr.
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	, has been the object of a great deal of attention from
New York	LOCATION	editors and publishers .

		After three or four days of entertainment on the part of these friends , Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	and his brother left for the Adirondacks for a week 's shooting .

		He stood the usual fire of questioning from reporters on his arrival , and came off very well , doubtless being prepared to meet this ordeal .

		He lec - tured here once before leaving for
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's new book , '' The Lilac Sunbon - net , '' which
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are about to publish , is said to be a more poetic and tender romance than those which have preceded it .

		There is perhaps more of delicacy and charm than is shown in the others .

		This firm is just bringing out the poems of
Frank L. Stanton	PERSON	, of the ''
Atlanta	LOCATION	Constitution , '' with the title , '' Songs of the Soil . ''

		Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	is a working jour - nalist , and his verse has been written at odd moments , but it has been taken up and copied all over the coun - try .

		The book will include poems both of sentiment and dialect . ''

		lola , the Senator 's Daughter '' is a story of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, soon to be brought out by Messrs.
G. P. Put	PERSON	- nam 's Sons .

		It is intended to be a life picture of the business classes of that city nineteen centuries ago , the author 's theory being that the Romans did not always - wear the toga , but were often modern in their ways .

		Another volume of special interest on this firm 's list is the ''
Napoleon	PERSON	'' of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	, translated by Mr.
John B. Larner	PERSON	, a
Washington	LOCATION	lawyer , who is said to have preserved the very forceful style of the French original .

		The Putnams will publish in
Janu	LOCATION	- ary the first volume of M. Jusserand 's '' Literary His - tory of the English People , '' which has attracted a great deal of attention in
England	LOCATION	.

		M. Jusserand is thought '' to have been influenced by
Taine	PERSON	and
John Richard Green	PERSON	, but the scale of his book gives him the liberty of indulging in detail where
Green	ORGANIZATION	could only work through a few broad strokes , while the thirty years that have elapsed since
Taine	PERSON	's book saw the light , not to mention the idiosyncrasies of the two writers , have shown him that if a literary history is to be true the historian must not ride theories to death . ''

		One of the most important books promised for the near future is the late Professor
Jowett	PERSON	's '' Conversa - tions . ''

		Dr.

		The '' History of the Thousand , '' by no less a person - age than
Signor Crispi	PERSON	, is an interesting announcement from
Italy	LOCATION	.

		It will be remembered that the author , himself a Sicilian , took a prominent part in the expedi - tion .

		Professor
B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	, of
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, has printed a '' Teacher 's Professional Book List '' leaflet , giving the titles of some thirty books believed by him to be among the most useful for the foundation of a profes - sional library .

		Professor

		Professor
Vineenzo Botta	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, died on the fifth of this month , at the age of seventy-five .

		A Pied - montese by birth , he was a professor in the
University of Turin	ORGANIZATION	, a member of the Sardinian legislature , and a special commissioner of the government for the study of foreign educational systems .

		He came to this coun - try in
1853	DATE	, became naturalized , married
Anne C. Lynch	PERSON	, and occupied for many years a professorship in Italian in the
University of the City of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among his books are a memorial volume to his wife , and works upon
Dante	PERSON	,
Cavour	PERSON	, and modern Italian philosophy .

		A suit now pending in the
United States Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	las for its object the testing of the Copyright Act of

		The complainants are Mr.
H. Rider Haggard	PERSON	and Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, represented by Mr.
Daniel Greenleaf Thompson	PERSON	.

		The point at issue is the power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to delegate de - clarative power to the President , and consequently the constitutionality of the law itself .

		Since other such delegations of power have already been fully sustained by the courts , there is no reasonable doubt of their find - ing in the present case , and it will be well to have the question settled forever .

		In concluding a series of selections from the corre - spondence of Poe , in '' The Century Magazine '' for Oc - tober , Mr.
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	says : `` It is a gratification to find that American men of letters who were contem - porary with Poe are so fully freed from the charge , brought against them by English admirers of the poet , of lack of aid and appreciation toward him .

		Few men have received such cordial encouragement , praise , and wel - come , material and moral , as Poe received from nearly all who were brought into relations with him , and the number of these was many Irving ,
Kennedy	LOCATION	,
Paulding	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Willis	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Simms	PERSON	, and others less dis - tinguished , but then of note .

		Yet Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	says that
Poe	PERSON	was < a gentleman among canaille . ' ''

		The
London	LOCATION	correspondent of '' The Critic '' has the following interesting note about a biography that we are all waiting for : `` Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	has been occupied upon the life of his father continuously during the past few months , and has made considerable progress with it , but the work will certainly not be completed during the present year , and it is doubtful whether it will even see the light during
1895	DATE	.

		When it comes , it will be genuinely welcome .

		It is announced that Lord
Tenny	PERSON	- son has had the personal assistance of several eminent men of letters , foremost among whom one would place conjecturally the names of Mr.
Frederick Locker-Lamp	PERSON	- son and Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	.

		But no detail of the probable character of the volume has been allowed to escape from
Farringford	LOCATION	, nor is it likely that anything will be known until the biography makes its public ap - pearance . ''

		President
J. N. Larned	PERSON	of the American Library As - sociation made an address at the
Lake Placid	LOCATION	meeting of that organization , which is summarized as '' a mas - terly setting-forth of the relation of public libraries to the social movement of the time , claiming for them an exact fitness to the needs of the age .

		The education of the schools and universities fails to carry more than a select few beyond the rudiments , giving to the masses only that little knowledge ' which is dangerous .

		The newspaper press , valuable as it is , is to a large extent mercenary and partisan , and , as generally read , culti - vates prejudice and disseminates narrow views .

		To the public library , distributing to the homes of the people good literature , and welcoming to its halls all students of any subject without question as to their previous at - tainments , we look for that generosity and breadth of popular culture which alone can save our democratic commonwealth from destruction . ''

		A monument to
Shelley	PERSON	was unveiled at Viareggio on the
morning	TIME	of

		271 COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ENGLISH .

		A SUMMARY .

		With the article upon '' English at
Wellesley College	LOCATION	, '' printed in the last issue of THE DIAL , we closed our series of reports upon the work done in English at our colleges and univer - sities .

		These reports , contributed in every case by someone closely identified with the English department of the institution concerned , and in the majority of cases by the head of the de - partment , have provided the most elaborate comparative showing ever made of the methods pursued in this important branch of the higher instruction .

		There have been eighteen arti - cles altogether , representing as many centres of light and leading ; and while the subject might have been continued for some months more without loss of interest , enough facts have been furnished to provide a safe basis for gen - eralization , and to illustrate every important phase of the teaching of English as it is now understood by those among us who are fore - most in its profession .

		The colleges and universities represented in this series fall into certain natural groups which it may be well to indicate .

		First of all , we have such venerable
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	institutions as
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		With these we may group
Amherst	LOCATION	and
Lafayette	LOCATION	, standing for the class of small colleges to which
American education	ORGANIZATION	owes a debt far from measurable by their size , and
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, representing the earlier type of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	education so well justified of its children during the long ante - bellum period .

		A second and fairly compact group is formed of the state-supported institu - tions of the New West the Universities of
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	,
Nebraska	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	.

		The third and last group includes those later foundations of pri - vate philanthropy which , with their suddenly acquired wealth and mushroom-like rate of de - velopment , already threaten to overshadow the ancient fame of the
New England	LOCATION	institutions .

		To this category belong
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	and
Stanford Universities	ORGANIZATION	, and the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, Here we may also include , as representing both the new philanthropy and the new spirit that 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, does not seek to exclude woman from the ben - efits of the higher culture , the excellent college to which special attention was called in our last issue
Wellesley	LOCATION	.

		Although this grouping is but one of several that might be chosen , it seems , on the whole , the most natural and the most suggestive .

		It very nearly amounts to a geographical group - ing of the East and the West , or to a chrono - logical grouping of the old and the new .

		And perhaps the first idea suggested by this anti- thesis of East and West , of old and new , is that the former class stands for a conservative adherence to well-tried methods and aims , while the latter class stands for experiment , fertility of invention , and the broadening of standards .

		Certainly , the new ideas and the novel methods reported come rather from the West than the
East	LOCATION	, rather from the youthful than from the ancient foundations .

		It is undoubtedly true that the newer communities of the West sup - ply the educator with a cruder material than comes into the hands of a
New England	LOCATION	fac - ulty , and possibly this is the very thing that stimulates him to new departures and novel activities .

		It makes a vast difference whether the average student comes from a home in which books are among the most essential of furnish - ings and from a family in which culture is a traditional inheritance , or from the environ - ment of the pioneer settlement , which has not yet forgotten or outlived the hard struggle for subsistence and a foothold .

		And , while we are not disposed to say that the new universities are doing more than the old ones for the study of our common speech and literary inheritance , we can not refrain from commendation of the alertness , the keenness of scent , and the adapt - ability with which they are shaping their work to their special conditions .

		Viewing our collection of reports as a whole , it is clear that they supply the material for a considerable number of fairly trustworthy in - ductions .

		A few of these we will endeavor briefly to set forth .

		The statistics given to show the numbers of students pursuing English courses at the respective colleges show that these courses are nearly everywhere very pop - ular .

		They run the classical courses closely , and in some cases seem to attract a larger num - ber of students , although the figures are lack - ing for any exact comparative statement on this subject .

		In a recent review article Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	contends that the twin bases of the new liberal education ought to be the study of literature and the study of institu - tions .

		As far as the study of literature is concerned , it would seem that the contention is already justified , or nearly so , by the fact .

		The thousand odd students at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- and Shef - field -RRB- , at
Harvard	LOCATION	, at the Universities of Mich - igan , and even of
Nebraska	LOCATION	, give eloquent tes - timony to the popularity of English teaching , to say nothing of the 873 reported by
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia , the 629 by
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the 450 by
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Equally eloquent , from another point of view , are such English faculties as that of
Harvard	LOCATION	, with twenty men , and of
Chicago	LOCATION	, with fifteen .

		Courses are reported in so many different ways that comparison is not easy ; but
Chicago	LOCATION	, with upwards of sixty hours a week , seems to head the list , while
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	,
Stanford	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	are not far behind .

		The important subject of entrance require - ments is not discussed in the majority of our reports , but the few allusions made to it are of the greatest interest .

		During the present year ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has for the first time required an entrance qualification in English .

		From
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	comes the vague report that '' English litera - ture '' is required for entrance .

		As we go West , we do better and better .


Indiana	LOCATION	has relegated the bugbear of '' Freshman English '' to the preparatory schools , and
Nebraska	LOCATION	has accom - plished a similar reform .

		The most interesting reports upon this subject come from the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		The
University of California	ORGANIZATION	requires '' a high-school course of at least three years , at the rate of five hours a week ; and it advo - cates , and from some schools secures , a four years ' course . ''

		This requirement is further said to be fifty per cent more extensive and stringent than that made by the
New England Association of Colleges	ORGANIZATION	.


Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	started out with what was substantially the
New England	LOCATION	requirement , but has since raised that standard upon the side of composition . ''

		This year , '' it is said , '' we have absolutely refused to admit to our courses students unprepared to do real collegiate work .

		The Freshman En - glish course in theme-writing has been elimin - ated from our programme , and has been turned over to approved teachers and to the various secondary schools .

		Had this salutary innova - tion not been accomplished , all the literary courses would have been swept away by the rap - idly growing inundation of Freshman themes , and all our strength and courage would have been dissipated in preparing our students to do respectable work at more happily equipped uni - versities . ''

		The study of these reports shows the exist -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 ence , in most of our colleges , of a well-marked differentiation of literature from linguistics .

		In many of the cases , indeed , there is an equally distinct differentiation of rhetoric from the other two departments .

		We have , of course , no quarrel with either the science of linguistics or the art of rhetoric , but we have always con - tended that neither of the two should be per - mitted to masquerade as the study of literature .

		It is gratifying to find that the distinction is both made and observed in nearly all of the in - stitutions under consideration . ''

		Mere litera - ture '' seems to have its full share of attention and teaching strength ; it appears to be cor - dially recognized as a true university subject , with its own methods and aims , and with its own tests of the culture which it has to impart .

		That university teaching in literature may be made something more than the '' chatter about Shelley '' which one of its most famous oppo - nents delighted to call it , should be sufficiently evident from a careful study of these eighteen reports .

		The question may be raised whether it would not be well to set an official seal upon the separation of literature from its allied sub - jects by making of it a separate department of university work , just as some of our more pro- gressive institutions have erected sociology into a distinct department , thus definitely marking it off from the allied departments of political and economic science .

		If literature , linguistics , and rhetoric are grouped together as consti - tuting a single department , it becomes almost impossible to provide that department with a suitable head .

		One can no longer be a specialist in so many fields ; the head of a modern En - glish department is not likely to be both an accomplished student of literature and a philo - logical expert ; and since his real distinction is pretty sure to be in one of these subjects alone , there is always the danger that the subject of which he is master will be given a preponder - ant place in the work of his department .

		Space fails us for the discussion of the many remaining subjects of interest offered by a comparative examination of these reports .

		We should like to speak of the growing impor - tance of graduate work in English , of the ten - dency to give a larger place to Seminar inves - tigation , of the historical aspect of literary study , of the extent to which American litera - ture should receive special treatment , of the importance of introducing courses which bring into comparison the literatures of culture , of the inexhaustible subject of special methods of instruction , and the equally inexhaustible subject of the general aims to be kept in view by the teacher of literature .

		To some or all of these subjects we shall doubtless recur as occasion arises , and in connection with the dis - cussion that is likely to follow the republication of these reports in their more serviceable per - manent shape .

		Our closing word shall be one of gratification at the admirable variety , vital - ity , and individuality of the presentment as a whole .

		Whatever may be the shortcomings of our present higher instruction in English , it has not fallen into the stagnation of a pedantic routine .

		It is alert , progressive , and eager in its outlook for higher things than have as yet been attained , however far it may yet be from the fulfilment of its whole ambition .

		JAMES
ANTHONY FROUDE	PERSON	.

		However diverse may be the judgments passed upon the work of Professor
Froude	PERSON	, friends and foes must unite to recognize in him one of the giants of his age .

		His impress upon the spiritual de - velopment of the last half-century has been very deep , and would have been deeper had he stood by himself , not overshadowed by his friend and mas - ter ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		His originality , combined with his aggressive energy , was bound to stir up contention , into whatever field of thought he might make excur - sions ; and few men have lived so continuously as he in an atmosphere of acrimonious disputation .

		His abandonment of the priestly profession , coupled with the outspoken propositions of '' The Nemesis of Faith , '' aroused the first bitterness against him , and his famous defense of Henry the Eighth set all the dogs of controversy upon his heels .

		The deliv - ery and subsequent publication of his American lec - tures exposed him to reprisals from vindictive Irish - men all over the world , and all sorts of colonial doctrinaires felt themselves outraged by his two books upon the outlying provinces of the English Empire .

		Then came the
Carlyle	PERSON	publications , with their unnecessarily truthful revelations ; and there were none so poor , after that , to do reverence to an editor who had thus ruthlessly -LRB- although in all unconsciousness -RRB- played the iconoclast .

		We think that the general effect of the many at - tacks made upon the great historian has been to create a distinctly unfair and prejudiced opinion concerning the value of his work , and that his repu - tation is one that will grow rather than diminish with the lapse of years .

		Let us allow to the full for the exaggerated hero-worship of many of his books , and for his constitutional inability to see things from any other than his own intensely indi - vidual standpoint ; let us also allow for the charges of inaccuracy and the unscholarly use of material , not only brought against him , but amply substan - tiated , by such men as Professor
Freeman	PERSON	and Pro- 252 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, f essor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	; yet when all these allowances have been made , there still remains the great corpus of his work , magnificent as literature , masterly in its power of holding the attention , and , after all , consistent with itself and with the method deliberately chosen by the author to fit with his nat - ural predispositions .

		It is the ethical method , not the scientific , and must be judged by its own stan - dards , unless , indeed , the possibility of an ethical method of writing history be denied altogether .

		His - tory , he said , '' is a voice forever sounding across the centuries the laws of right and wrong ... Justice and truth alone endure and live .

		Injustice and falsehood may be long-lived , but doomsday comes at last to them , in French revolutions and other ter - rible ways . ''

		And he remarks in another passage that '' the most perfect English history which exists is to be found in the historical plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		.

		Shakespeare 's object was to exhibit as faith - fully as he could the exact character of the great actors in the national drama the circumstances which surround them , and the motives , internal and external , by which they were influenced .

		To know this is to know all ... No such directness of insight , no such breadth of sympathy , has since been applied to the writing of English history . ''

		Now Professor
Freeman	PERSON	, for example , did not write his - tory upon this theory , and consequently his stric - tures altogether miss the essential point at issue .

		Time , which sets most matters right , will justify Professor
Froude	PERSON	's method by preserving his mem - ory and by sparing his books from oblivion .

		They will remain , we doubt not , as lasting monuments of our literature , and minister not only to the delight but also to the instruction -LRB- in the higher sense -RRB- of generations yet unborn .

		BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY .


James Anthony Froude	PERSON	was born on the 23d of
April	DATE	-LRB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's birthday -RRB- ,
1818	DATE	, at
Totnes	LOCATION	, in
Devon	LOCATION	- shire .

		He was educated at
Oriel College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, where he took his degree in
1840	DATE	.

		In
1842	DATE	he took the Chan - cellor 's prize for an essay on '' The Influence of the Sci - ence of Political Economy on the Moral and Social Welfare of the Nation , '' and in the same year became a fellow of
Exeter College	ORGANIZATION	.

		While a student he had come under the influence of the Tractarians , and deter - mined to follow the clerical life .

		He received deacon 's orders in
1844	DATE	, but during the years immediately fol - lowing his ideas became so modified that he found it impossible to remain identified with a church that was wedded to what he called the `` Hebrew mythology . ''

		His '' Nemesis of Faith '' -LRB- 1848 -RRB- gave expression to his changed views and marked his separation from the cler - ical calling .

		He says of this step : `` I found myself unfitted for a clergyman 's position and I abandoned it .

		I did not leave the church .

		I withdrew into the posi - tion of a lay member , in which I have ever since re - mained .

		I gave up my fellowship and I gave up my profession with the loss of my existing means of main - tenance , and with the sacrifice of my future prospects . ''

		The next year -LRB- 1849 -RRB- marked the beginning of his ac - quaintance with
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		During the next few years , he contributed much to the reviews , and began the studies for his famous '' History of
England	LOCATION	from the
Fall of Wolsey	ORGANIZATION	to the Defeat of the Armada . ''

		The first volumes of this work appeared in
1856	DATE	, the last in
1869	DATE	.

		In the latter year he was chosen Rector of
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	, and received an LL.D .

		from that university .

		In
1872	DATE	he made a visit to the
United States	LOCATION	, and lec - tured upon the Irish question .

		These lectures formed the basis of '' The English in
Ireland	LOCATION	in the Eighteenth Century '' -LRB- 1871-1874 -RRB- .

		In
1874	DATE	, he was sent to
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	to investigate the Kaffir insurrection .

		He also travelled extensively among the English colonies , from
Australia	LOCATION	to the
West Indies	LOCATION	. ''

		Oceana '' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- and '' The English in the West Indies '' -LRB-
1888	DATE	-RRB- contained the fruits of his many observations of
Greater England	LOCATION	.

		In
1892	DATE	he was appointed by
Lord Salisbury as Regius Professor of History	ORGANIZATION	at
Oxford	LOCATION	, to succeed his old-time combatant , Professor
Freeman	PERSON	.

		His '' Short Studies on Great Subjects '' were collected into volumes at various dates , the first series appearing in
1867	DATE	.

		His sketch of ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	'' appeared in
1876	DATE	.

		He edited Car - lyle 's `` Reminiscences '' in
1881	DATE	, and published the bi - ography and letters of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	in
1882	DATE	and
1884	DATE	.

		He also edited the '' Letters and Memorials of
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	. ''

		His other publications include the ''
Bunyan	PERSON	'' in the '' English Men of Letters '' series , ''
Reminis	PERSON	- cences of an Irish Journey in
1849	DATE	, '' `` The Two Chiefs of Dunboy , '' an historical romance of the last century -LRB-
1889	DATE	-RRB- , a life of Lord Beaconsfield -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , `` The Di - vorce of Catherine of Aragon '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , '' The Spanish Story of the Armada , and Other Essays '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , and , this very year of his death , a volume of Oxford lectures on '' The Life and Letters of Erasmus . ''

		He died on the

October 20	DATE	, after a protracted period of illness .

		ENGLISH TRIBUTES TO
HOLMES	PERSON	.

		The English literary press is substantially unani - mous in just appreciation of the late Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, and the tone of its comment is well illustrated by the following selection of extracts .

		The first is from '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review . '' ''

		The copious and generous tributes which have been paid by the English press to the memory of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	would greatly have gratified that genial autocrat .

		There are Americans who really desire to be neglected by En - gland , and there are a great many more who are fond of pretending to desire it .

		Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	was none of these .

		While preserving that preference for the institutions of his own country to which every reasonable man clings , no one was more conscious than he of the prestige and weight of the Old World , and no one , within the bounds of self-respect , was more anxious to come within its orbit .

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	was by the very constitution of his mind and the nature of his talent a conservative . '

		It is a great happiness , ' he says some - where , ' to have been born in an old house haunted by recollections ' ; and to him
Europe	LOCATION	and its literature , and its philosophy , were venerable and stately mansions in which , if he was not actually born , he still had been a constant and a happy lodger .

		He who would search for the wild aboriginal American poet , with a mind arrayed in boots and buckskin , had never any chance of finding him in
Beacon Street	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		What he found there was a little , brilliant old gentleman , with something of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	about him and something of
Chaulieu	LOCATION	, a
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253 touch of Gay , a suspicion of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	, a hint of the abbe 's who had known
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, an old gentleman who appeared to have stepped straight out of the eighteenth century , and to be trying by the exercise of consummate tact and intelligence , to seem to belong to the nineteenth .

		An exquisite old-fashioned sense of fitness marked all that Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	excelled in .

		... We shall now learn more about him than needs be told , and there will cer - tainly be a reaction against his present excess of celeb - rity .

		But this also will pass , and
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	will live in the literary history of the nineteenth century as a fellow of infinite jest , who knew mankind and the human heart , who was the enemy of all bombast , and bigotry , and assumption , and who exercised in what was sometimes a very crude and fanatical generation an influence unwaveringly on the side of urbanity and reason . '' ''

		The Academy '' makes the following remarks , among others in similar strain : '' An attempt not particularly happy has been made to ' place ' Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	by linking his genius with that of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	.

		The resemblance between them , if any , is quite superficial , but their difference is marked .

		As Mr.
George William Curtis	PERSON	said of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's early poems , so we might say of Lamb 's most charac - teristic work : ` The high spirits of a frolicsome fancy effervesce and sparkle ' ; but , while Lamb was essentially whimsical and often capricious , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, even in his most daring moods , was wary .

		He was exceedingly sensitive on the subject of his good breeding , and felt he could not afford to forget his manners .

		If bold , he was not too bold ; judicious always , without being false .

		He was much bound by social usage a
Boston	LOCATION	man , having the fear of eminently respectable
Boston	LOCATION	always before his eyes and it would have horrified him to have been responsible for those little outrages on the conven - tionalities in which Lamb took an exquisite delight .

		Moreover , Lamb 's taste was more literary than that of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, and not in the least scientific ; and his touch , like Irving 's , was more delicate .

		It is , in truth , difficult to classify Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	at all .

		He was somewhat of a man apart .

		He followed no model , and has had no suc - cessful imitators . ''

		And `` The Athenaeum '' thus passes restrained and thoughtful judgment : '' When the time shall come for assigning their proper place in literature to the writings of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, we think it probable that neither his lively verse nor genial essays will be placed in the front rank .

		His artistic talent is chiefly displayed in the small works wherein the lives of his friends
Motley	ORGANIZATION	and
Emerson	PERSON	are depicted .

		He tells the story of both in a condensed and effective fashion .

		He enables the reader to understand them within the compass of a few pages .

		His countrymen should study both works when they contemplate writing a biography .

		He had the skill to select and dwell upon the important points , and the self-command to suffer the others to remain in the background .

		More than one New Englander of note who is entombed in a heavy bi - ography would have defied oblivion if Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	had been entrusted with writing his life . ''

		The closing years of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	were saddened by friend after friend dropping off and by the terrible mal - ady of asthma .

		Yet he retained his sweet temper to the end , and his pen was never idle .

		There is no trace of senility in the last verses or prose which he wrote , and the perfect preservation of his faculties is quite as remarkable as the prolongation of his life .

		He has left none behind him in
America	LOCATION	who can wield the pen with greater witchery .

		He was as little of a public speaker as his friend
Longfellow	LOCATION	; indeed , a slight physical im - pediment marred his utterance .

		But a cheerier com - panion could not be found ; a man of larger sympathies and wider cultivation has never adorned
New England	LOCATION	; and his death is not mourned more sincerely there than in the old Motherland which in his heart he loved . ''

		`` MERE LITERATURE . ''

		Is there any justification for the phrase `` mere literature '' which one often hears nowadays ?

		There is no doubt a serious sneer in it , as Professor
Wilson	PERSON	, in a recent ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' essay , avers ; but I think the sneer is not aimed so much at literature in itself as at certain phases of literature .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has recently been quoted as saying that '' mere scholarship is as useless as the collecting of old postage stamps '' ; yet at vital scholarship scholarship that is wielded as a weapon , and that results in power
Lowell	PERSON	would be the last man to sneer .

		In all time 's of high literary culture and crit - icism , a great deal is produced that may well be called mere literature the result of assiduous training and stimulation of the literary faculties , just as a great deal of art is produced that may be called mere art .

		Literature that is the result of the fric - tion upon the mind of other literatures , is usually mere literature .

		That which is the result of the contact of the mind with reality , is of another order .

		Or we may say '' mere literature '' as we say '' mere gentleman . ''

		Now gentlemanly qualities refine - ment , good breeding , etc. are not to be sneered at unless they stand alone , with no man behind them ; and literary qualities style , learning , fancy , etc. .

		are not to be sneered at unless they stand alone , which is not infrequently the case .

		We would not apply the phrase '' mere gentleman '' to Washing - ton , or Lincoln , or
Wellington	LOCATION	, though these men may have been the most thorough of gentlemen ; neither would we apply the phrase '' mere litera - ture '' to the works of
Bacon	LOCATION	, or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or Car - lyle , or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, or Plato .

		The Bible is literature , but it is not mere literature .

		We apply the latter term to writings that have little to recommend them but their technical and artistic excellence , like the mass of current poetry and fiction .

		The men who have nothing to say and say it extremely well pro- duce mere literature .

		Both
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	have at the present time many excellent writers , men who possess every grace of style and charm of expression , who still give us only a momentary pleasure .

		They do not move us , they do not lay strong hands upon us , their works do not take hold of any great reality ; they produce mere literature .

		Literary seriousness , lit - erary earnestness , can not atone for a want of manly seriousness and earnestness .

		A sensitive artistic conscience can not make us content with a dull or 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, obtuse moral conscience .

		The literary worker is to confront reality in just as serious a mood as does the man of science , if he hopes to produce anything that rises above mere literature .

		The picnickers , the excursionists , the flower gatherers of literature do not produce lasting works .

		The seriousness of
Hawthorne	PERSON	was much more than a literary serious - ness ; the emotion of
Whittier	LOCATION	at his best is funda - mental and human .

		There is a passage in
Amiel	LOCATION	's Journal that well expresses the distinction I am aiming at . ''

		I have been thinking a great deal of
Victor Cherbuliez	PERSON	, '' he says , under date of
December 4 , 1876	DATE	. ''

		Perhaps his novels make up the most disputable part of his work , they are so much wanting in simplicity , feeling , reality .

		And yet what knowledge , style , wit , and subtlety , how much thought everywhere , and what mastery of language !

		He astonishes one ; I can not but admire-him .

		Cherbuliez 's mind is of immense range , clear-sighted , keen , full of resources ; he is an Alexandrian exquisite , substituting for the feeling which makes men earnest the irony which leaves them free .

		Pascal would say of him , ' He has never risen from the order oJE thought to the order of charity . '

		But we must not be ungrateful .

		A
Lucian	PERSON	is not worth an
Augustine	LOCATION	, but still he is a Lucian ... The positive element in
Victor Cherbuliez	PERSON	's work is beauty , not goodness , nor moral or religious life . ''

		The positive element in the enduring works is always something more than the beautiful ; it is the true , the vital , the real , as well .

		The beautiful is there , but the not-beautiful is there also .

		The world is held together , life is nourished and made strong , and power begotten , by the neutral or negatively beautiful .

		Works are everywhere produced that are artistically serious , but morally trifling and in - sincere ; faultless in form , but tame and barren in spirit .

		We could not say this of the works of Froude or
Ruskin	LOCATION	, Huxley or
Tyndall	LOCATION	; we can not say it of the works of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, because he had a higher purpose than to produce mere literary effects ; but we can say it of most of the produc - tions of the younger British essayists and poets .

		In
Swinburne	LOCATION	, for instance , there is a mere lust of ver - bal forms and rhythmic lilt .

		In reading his poems , I soon find myself fairly gasping for breath ; I seem to be trying to breathe in a vacuum an effect which one does not experience at all in reading
Tennyson	LOCATION	, or
Browning	LOCATION	, or
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		One is apt to have serious qualms in reading the prose of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, the lust of mere style so pervades his work .

		Faultless workmanship , one says ; and yet the best qualities of style freshness , naturalness , simplicity are not here .

		What in Victor
Hugo	PERSON	goes far towards atoning for all his sins against art , against sanity and proportion , are his terrible moral earnest - ness and psychic power .

		Whatever we may think of his work , we are not likely to call it '' mere litera - ture . ''

		That masterly ubiquitous sporting and toy - ing with the elements of life which we find in Shake - speare we shall probably never again see in letters .

		The stress and burden of later times do not favor it .

		The great soul is now too earnest , too self-con - scious ; life is too serious .

		Only light men now essay it .

		Art for art 's sake is now the stamp of third or fourth rate men .

		With so much criticism , so much knowledge , so much science , another Shake - speare is impossible .

		Renan says : '' In order to estab - lish those literary authorities called classic , something especially healthy and solid is necessary .

		Common household bread is of more value here than pastry . ''

		There can be little doubt that our best literary workers are intent upon producing something anal - agous to pastry , or even confectionery , something fine , complex , highly seasoned , that tickles the taste .

		It is always in order to urge a return to the simple and serious , a return to nature , to works that have the wholesome and sustaining qualities of natural products , grain , fruits , nuts , air , water .

		THE `` ROYAL ROAD '' TO LEARNING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
October 1	DATE	my booklet on '' Ethics and the New Education '' is approved as emphasizing the significance of pain as a necessary factor of all true spiritual growth and refinement .

		If I may have your permission , I would be glad to cry a further note on the same theme through the speaking-tube of THE DIAL .

		The note is this : Growth is possible only through reasonable exercise of power .

		But mind as an indivis - ible unit of energy still presents in its individual char - acter two radically distinct modes .

		The one of these modes is the sensuous ; the other , the reflective .

		In its sensuous mode , mind is appealed to by -LRB- or rather through -RRB- physical '' facts , '' pictorial forms .

		In its reflective mode , mind is exercised in the discovery and estimate of the relations of '' fact '' to '' fact , '' and in the tracing of such relations to the ultimate principles of which they are only special phases .

		No mind can be truly educated save through the constant interplay of these two thor - oughly complementary modes .

		With this distinction clearly in view , it is easy to see that as a rule the cry to the effect that education must be '' made easy , '' and that the work of the school - room must be made '' interesting , '' practically amounts to nothing more than a demand for endless multiplica - tion of illustrative matter that is , matter that appeals directly to the sensuous aspect of consciousness .

		It is ordinarily synonymous with the catch-phrase , '' Facts first and theory after '' ; and this practically is much the same as '' facts '' always and '' theory '' never .

		Though what a '' fact '' is , apart from a theory , might easily prove an embarrassing question .

		Nevertheless , natural-science teaching , with its bril - liant experiments and its astonishing array of speci - mens , has led irresistibly in the direction of multiplying '' illustrations , '' until too often that which was to be illustrated has been fairly lost from view .

		And the work has proved so intensely '' interesting '' that the conspicuously '' successful '' teacher has for the most part gone victoriously forward with the absolutely inno -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 cent assurance that lie has at last actually discovered the true Royal Road in which Learning is once for all made easy , and that all painful struggle in the educa - tional field must henceforth prove an inexcusable an - achronism .

		How far this brilliant superficiality has ex - tended , few seem as yet to be clearly aware .

		In truth , the whole educational world is to-day dealing largely in '' watered stock , '' and the next generation must inev - itably pay the penalty in serious `` shrinkage of values . ''

		Nor is this by any means confined to work done in the natural sciences .

		So convincingly brilliant have been the results in this field that the now rapidly reviving in - terest in the science of mind , both on the side of Psy - chology and on the side of ethics , seems destined , for a while at least , to come under the same spell .

		Nerve - ends , nerve-fibre , ganglia , white matter and gray mat - ter , cerebral convolutions , mapping the cerebral cortex how nearly tangible the mind is becoming !

		Shall we not be able presently to photograph an emotion , to catch the color of a thought , to touch a motive with the tips of our fingers ?

		How much more real the '' mind '' would seem to '' us '' if only '' we '' could roll '' it '' about on the palm of '' our '' hand !

		And then there is Hypnotism wonderful , splendidly mysterious Hypnotism !

		Why , we are just awaking to the really `` interesting '' aspects of the science of mind !

		And '' interesting '' all this un - questionably is interesting to consciousness in its sen - suous mode first of all .

		It is , indeed , interesting also to consciousness in its reflective mode , because mind re - quires a form through which to express itself , through which to unfold itself .

		Nevertheless , interesting though this psychological aspect of physiology may be , import - ant though it may be that the student of psychology should note the special parts of the one whole organ through which the one whole mind gives expression to the various phases of its one continuous whole activity interesting and important though all this may be in its place , even to the reflective aspect of consciousness , it is still a fatal mistake to suppose it to constitute psy - chology in any proper sense of the term .

		Physiological Psychology ?

		Strange combination of terms !

		No nerve - change , however subtle , can constitute any phase of con - sciousness properly speaking .

		At most such nerve-change is only a precondition of one or another specialized mode of consciousness .

		Meanwhile , the '' method of the natural sciences '' is here seized upon , with more or less unreflecting zeal , as being already proven a '' successful '' method , and is now confidently applied in a field where it can not but prove the more disastrous the less carefully the workers in this field note the distinction between mind as agent and body as instrument or organ .

		Such distinction , ade - quately made and maintained , necessarily implies ma - turity of mind in its reflective mode .

		With this mode imperfectly developed , it is but inevitable that the '' facts '' of the nervous system , so unequivocally there to the sensuous consciousness , should seem to constitute the whole reality of man , and that materialism should appear as furnishing the only rational account of life and '' mind . ''

		An antidote to all this is the crying need of the time .

		Or if not yet vocal , it must soon become vocal .

		We have been led widely astray by the luring phantom of a Royal Road to Learning .

		No such road exists save the truly kingly road of work .

		And work , like chastisement , is for the present not `` joyous but grievous '' ; though in the end it is the one way that has in it any real promise of '' eternal life . ''

		Doubtless this subordination of the sen - suous aspect of consciousness , in the form of mere pres - ent enjoyment , to the reflective aspect of consciousness in the form of steadfast adherence to an infinitely out - reaching ideal purpose , is the way of '' crucifying the flesh '' ; and that must always be something altogether frightful and even insane to the man '' in his senses '' ; but also it must ever prove to be something necessary and desirable and wholly sane to the man '' in his right reason . ''

		Whatever may be said , then , respecting my ''
Sylla	PERSON	- bus of Ethics '' that will live if it deserves to live , and die if it deserves to die , whatever friendly or unfriendly critics may say of it I still insist that for the purposes of the class-room the first requisite for a text-book is , not that it shall be '' interesting '' to or easily manage - able by the student , but that it shall present in as con - cise and rigidly logical form as possible a really ade - quate outline of the subject .

		It is an utter prostitution of educational appliances to turn the school into an in - formation-mill or a variety-show .

		The true school is a medium the most efficient of all media for the awak - ening of youth to a clear , adequate , genuinely reflective consciousness of the fundamental principles constituting the inner substance of the world both as mind and as '' matter . ''

		It is for the living teacher to stimulate the pupil to such living interest in the theme that he comes to comprehend experiment and text-book alike in their proper significance as mere instruments devised solely for his own self-development .

		And , after all , precise technical language , so far from being the language of obscurity , is just that medium which realizes the very perfection of clearness .

		It is simply the exact form of exact thought , and there is in it nothing dreadful certainly nothing more so for ethics than for , say , chemistry or electricity .

		Neither is it less indispensable in the one science than in the other .

		And if ethics is really to be taken seriously as seriously , for instance , as biology then whatever of technical language is necessary to the full and clear expression of the complex thought involved must frankly be faced and mastered .

		Education , let us repeat , is not merely , nor even chiefly , a matter of pleasure .

		It is , above all , a process of self-realization .

		Hence , what precisely the character of the education is to be is in sober truth a matter of mental , of spiritual , life and death .

		When dilettantism shall have once gained permanent posses - sion of the school-room , the end of the world will be near at hand .

Nov. 1	DATE	, AN AMERICAN STAGE FAVORITE .

		* Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's title , '' The Life and Art of
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, '' is a little misleading , since it covers , strictly speaking , only about half the volume .

		The remaining space is devoted to the other Thespian members of the
Jefferson	PERSON	family Thomas -LRB- 1728-1807 -RRB- ,
Joseph	PERSON	-LRB-

Joseph	PERSON	-LRB-
1804	DATE	- 42 -RRB- , and
Charles Burke	PERSON	-LRB- 1822-54 -RRB- , to each of whom a separate chapter is given .

		The Me - moir is a revision , '' rectified , augmented , re - arranged , and in part re-written , '' of Mr.
Win	PERSON	- ter 's '' The Jeffersons , '' published in
1881	DATE	, and it is therefore virtually a new work .

		In its present shape it forms a collection of American stage anecdotes and memorabilia second only to Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's ; while its delightful style and delicate appreciations of the player 's and the playwright 's art lend it a charm and value dis - tinctively its own .

		The sketch of the present
Jefferson	PERSON	, though rather desultory in form , is graphic and warmly sympathetic , and it con - veys a clear impression of Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's tal - ent and personality .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	is a good narrator , and he is of the order of critics who , like Lamb and
Hazlitt	PERSON	, do us the substantial service of bringing to light , and making us feel , the finer and more recondite beauties that es - cape the untrained and the heedless eye .

		Few will read the chapters in which Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's leading impersonations are severally reviewed without wishing to again see that finished actor on the stage , in order to appreciate and enjoy his art more fully in the light of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's exposition .


Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, of '' Rip Van Winkle '' fame , was born at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
February 20 , 1829	DATE	.

		Both of his parents were actors , and the boy made his own debut in a very comical way at the age of four , when he was carried upon the stage by
James D. Rice	PERSON	, the founder of negro minstrelsy , and originator of the im - mortal ''
Jim Crow	PERSON	. '' ''

		The comedian , on a benefit occasion , introduced the child , blackened and dressed like himself , into the per - formance of
Jim Crow	PERSON	.

		Little
Joe	PERSON	was taken upon the scene in a bag , and emptied from it , with the couplet , ' Ladies and gentlemen , I 'd have you for to know I 've got a little darkey here to jump
Jim Crow	PERSON	. '

		A witness of that scene says that the boy promptly as - sumed the attitude of
Jim Crow Rice	PERSON	, and sang and * THE LIFE AND ART OF

		In
1837	DATE	,
Jefferson	PERSON	, then a boy of eight , ap - peared at the Franklin Theatre ,
New York	LOCATION	, where he did a broadsword-combat with a Mas - ter Titus after the manner of the brothers Crummies , doubtless ; and at the close of the season the family left for the far West .

		There for twelve years they led the life of the stroll - ing player , roaming from town to town in ox - carts , flatboats , etc. , and often enough on foot -LRB- there were no smoothly-gravelled ties in those days , be it remembered , to ease the steps of the crushed tragedian -RRB- , and playing at times in barns and hotel dining-rooms , with scenery not much more elaborate than Quince the car - penter 's .

		At that date the term '' barn-storm - ing '' had a very literal sound and was no mere playful metaphor for a tour in the provinces .

		Once the
Jefferson	PERSON	company , adrift in a region far from any settlement , lighted on an unusually spacious barn owned by an unusually benevo - lent-looking farmer , and they resolved forth - with to give a performance . ''

		There was a cordial response .

		The farmers and their wives and children , from far and near , came to see the play .

		The receipts were twenty dollars , and that treasure was viewed as a godsend by the poor players , who saw in it the means of food , and of a ride to the next town .

		But no adequate allowance had been made for the frugality of the genial owner of the barn . '

		I guess that pays my bill , ' he said , as he put the money into his pocket ; and so the venture was settled , and the rueful comedians walked away . ''

		Amid scenes of this kind , says the author , young
Jefferson	PERSON	learned to be an actor ; and , except barely three months at school which he once enjoyed , that was the only kind of train - ing he ever received . ''

		In
Mexico	LOCATION	, when the war occurred , in
1846	DATE	, he was among the followers of the American army , and gave performances in tents .

		He saw General
Taylor	PERSON	on the banks of the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	; he heard the thunder of the guns at
Palo Alto	LOCATION	; he stood beside the tent in which the gallant Major Ringgold lay dying ; he witnessed the bombardment of Matamoras , and , two nights after the capture of that city , he acted in its Spanish theatre . ''

		Jefferson returned to
New York	LOCATION	in
1849	DATE	, and filled successive engagements at
Chanf	LOCATION	rau 's New National Theatre , at
Mitchell	ORGANIZATION	's Olympic ,
Brougham	PERSON	's Lyceum ,
Niblo	PERSON	's Garden , and , after a Southern tour and a non-professional trip to
Europe	LOCATION	, at
Laura Keene	PERSON	's new play - house on
Broadway	LOCATION	, where , in
1857	DATE	, he scored a hit as '' Dr.
Pangloss	PERSON	, '' making the charac - ter , says Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, exceedingly comical , yet '' human , natural , probable , real , and even es - tablishing him in a kindly regard . ''

		While at
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 257 this theatre an incident occurred which shows
Jefferson	PERSON	in an agreeable light .

		One of the troupe ,
Blake	PERSON	a good actor , but with a ten - dency to coarseness resenting
Jefferson	PERSON	's habit of expunging indelicate lines from the old comedies , ridiculed him as '' the
Sunday	DATE	- school comedian . '' ''

		There was a scene in the green-room and
Blake	PERSON	was discomfited . '

		You take an unfair and unmanly advan - tage of people , ' said
Jefferson	PERSON	, ' when you force them to listen to your coarseness .

		They are , for the time , imprisoned , and have no choice but to hear and see your ill-breeding .

		You have no better right to be offensive on the stage than in the drawing-room . ' ''

		The production , on
October 18 , 1858	DATE	, of '' Our American Cousin '' marked the decisive turn of the tide in
Jefferson	LOCATION	's professional for - tunes .

		He acted ''
Asa Trenchard	PERSON	, '' and he was famous . ''

		Seldom has an actor found a medium for the ex - pression of his spirit so ample and so congenial as that part proved to be for
Jefferson	LOCATION	.

		Rustic grace , simple manliness , unconscious drollery , and unaffected pathos , expressed with artistic control , and in an atmosphere of repose , could not have been more truthfully and beau - tifully combined . ''

		It was then also that
Sothern	PERSON	his future greatness thrust upon him , as it were , in the trivial , reluctantly-accepted part of '' Lord Dun - dreary '' laid the foundation of his fame and fortune . ''

		Our American Cousin '' ran for one hundred and forty consecutive nights a prodigious run at that time , and it proved the success of the year and of the theatre .

		In
1861	DATE	Jefferson sailed for
Australia	LOCATION	, where he remained four years , winning golden opin - ions and hosts of friends by his acting of ''
Asa Trenchard	PERSON	, '' ``
Caleb Plummer	PERSON	, '' ``
Bob Bri	PERSON	- erly , '' and other characters .

		His performance of `` Bob Brierly '' -LRB- in `` The Ticket-of-leave Man '' -RRB- on one occasion at
Hobart Town	LOCATION	drew an audience including over six hundred ticket - of-leave men ; and , '' though at first they re - garded him with looks of implacable ferocity , they ended by giving him their hearts , in a hurricane of acclamation . ''

		After leaving
Australia	LOCATION	,
Jefferson	PERSON	spent a lit - tle time in
South America	LOCATION	and at
Panama	LOCATION	, and sailed thence for
England	LOCATION	.

		Arriving at Lon - don he commissioned Boucicault to recast and rewrite the old play of '' Rip Van Winkle '' for production in the English capital .

		There were already several stage versions of Irving 's story , and
Jefferson	PERSON	had no less than seven predeces - sors in the part with which his name is now inseparably linked .

		The first recorded drama - tization of '' Rip Van Winkle '' was produced at
Albany	LOCATION	,
May 26 , 1828	DATE	, and the first '' Rip '' was
Thomas Flynn	PERSON	-LRB- 1804-49 -RRB- .

		The second '' Rip , ''
Charles B. Parsons	PERSON	, played at
Cincin	LOCATION	- nati in 1828-29 , using a version bought in
New York	LOCATION	by the manager ,
N. M. Ludlow	PERSON	.

		Still another version , probably by an English dra - matist named
Kerr	PERSON	, was presented at
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia ,
October 30 , 1829	DATE	, with
William Chap	PERSON	- man in the leading role ; and in 1830
James H. Hackett	PERSON	, the famous '' Falstaff , '' and Jef - ferson 's ablest predecessor , produced the play in
New York	LOCATION	, using a version written probably by himself .

		Hackett went to
England	LOCATION	in
1832	DATE	, and had a new draft of the piece made by Ber - nard
Bayle	PERSON	, in which he appeared in
London	LOCATION	, and which he continued to present for several years after his return to
America	LOCATION	.


Charles Burke	PERSON	,
Jefferson	PERSON	's half-brother , made a play for himself on the subject in
1849	DATE	, and amended and improved it in
1850	DATE	; and this was the piece put in
Boucicault	LOCATION	's hands for recasting in
1865	DATE	.

		Boucicault finished the revision in a week , but had no faith in the practical success of his work , telling
Jefferson	PERSON	that it could not possibly hold the stage for more than a month .

		Many of the new features were due to
Jeffer	PERSON	- son , particularly the happy suggestion that the spectres , in the midnight encounter on the mountain , should maintain an awful silence , and that only the bewildered man should speak .

		Boucicault contributed the scheme of ''
Gretch	PERSON	- en 's '' second marriage ; and to him also is due the powerful climax of the third act , `` Meenie 's '' recognition of her father a touch suggested by the recognition of '' Cordelia '' in ''
King Lear	PERSON	. ''

		With this new version
Jefferson	PERSON	sought the favor of the
London	LOCATION	public , on
September 4 , 1865	DATE	; and his success was great enough to herald his future renown .

		A laughable inci - dent preceded the first performance .

		On the approach of the fateful hour ,
Jefferson	PERSON	, nervous and apprehensive , and as absent-minded as ''
Dominie Sampson	PERSON	, '' retired to his room in Regent Street , and abstractedly proceeded to '' make up '' for the third act . ''

		The window-curtains happened to be raised , and the room was brightly lighted , so that the view from with - out was unobscured .

		Not many minutes passed before it began to be utilized , and a
London	LOCATION	crowd is quick to assemble .

		Inside , the absorbed comedian uncon - cernedly went on acting Rip Van Winkle : outside , the curious multitude , thinking him a comic lunatic , thronged the street till it became impassable .

		The police fought their way to the spot .

		The landlady was finally alarmed ; and the astonished actor , brought back to the world by the clamor at his door , inquiring if he were ill , at length comprehended the situation , and suspended his re - hearsal . ''

		258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	,
Jefferson	PERSON	left
England	LOCATION
July 30 , 1866	DATE	.

		and on
September 3	DATE	he appeared at the Olympic Theatre ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		His performance of '' Rip '' took the house by storm ; and we need trace no further the history of a part that for nearly thirty years has held perhaps the chief place in the hearts of American play-goers .

		To can - cel from our stage memories the masterful fig - ure of
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	as '' Rip Van Winkle '' would leave a hiatus indeed .

		On
September 13 , 1880	DATE	, Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	pro- duced '' The Rivals '' at the Arch Street Thea - tre ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and made a pronounced hit as ''
Bob Acres	PERSON	, '' a part in which he had shone in his youth , and which he revived prob - ably as the most effective answer to the charge that he was a one-part actor .

		Apropos of this widely erroneous impression , Mr.
Winter	PERSON	tells a story of
Charles Matthews	PERSON	. '' '

		I am glad to see you making your fortune , ' he said , ' but I do n't like to see you doing it with one part and a carpet-bag . '

		... The comment of
Matthews	PERSON	, how - ever , was meant to glance at the one-part policy ; and
Jefferson	PERSON	's reply to that ebullition was alike significant and good-humored . '

		It is perhaps better , ' he said , ' to play one part in different ways than to play many parts all in one way . '

		That sentence explains his artistic vic - tory . ''

		Since 1880 , the story of Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's pro- fessional life is mainly the record of his pleas - ant wanderings with `` Rip , '' `` Acres , '' and `` Dr.
Pangloss	PERSON	. ''

		Living mostly at home , and act - ing but a part of each season , he has devoted himself to painting an art in which he has achieved some substantial success . ''

		Several of his works have been exhibited .

		Some of them have been circulated in etchings .

		The charm of his pictures , like that of his acting , is tenderness of feeling , combined with a touch of mystery , an imagin - ative quality , kindred with the freedom and the wild - ness that are seen in the paintings of
Corot	LOCATION	. ''

		Following the biographical essay , and essen - tially part of it , are four excellent chapters , de - scriptive and critical of Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's leading characters .

		In this special field Mr.
Winter	PERSON	is at his best .

		He conjures back for us with a few vivid touches the familiar figures the joy - ous , drunken , wholly disreputable and wholly lovable '' Rip '' ; the debonair ''
Golightly	PERSON	'' ; the vaporing '' Acres '' ; and , to our thinking best of all , quaint old '' Caleb '' with his sackcloth coat and his quavering song about the Sparkling Bowl .

		Not to have seen
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	as ''
Caleb Plummer	PERSON	'' is to have missed perhaps the best exemplification on the modern stage of the ability of the actor to achieve humor not humor in the popular sense , but that subtle blending of things merry and things sad which is at once the rarest of arts and the commonest of facts .

		It will certainly be a satisfaction to Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	to have found so sympathetic a biographer and so sound and eloquent a critic as Mr.
Winter	PERSON	.

		As already intimated , the book is rich in the materials of theatrical history old play-bills , casts , press-notices , press-extracts , and the va - rious odds and ends of forgotten stage fact and anecdote .

		There are a number of illustrations , including portraits of Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	in favorite roles .

		THE HEAL , JAP AX OF OLD .

		* A year or so ago ,
Henry Norman	PERSON	, a
London	LOCATION	newspaper man , published a book entitled `` The Real
Japan	LOCATION	, '' which gave a remarkably thor - ough and accurate study of contemporary
New Japan	LOCATION	.

		Within the past few years others have been trying to penetrate beneath the surface , and to find out the secrets and mysteries of the inner life of the Japanese .

		Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	found many beauties , but did not get far below the surface .


Percival Lowell	PERSON	carried his in - vestigations yet farther , and ascertained many interesting motives of life among the Japanese .

		But it has been left for
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	to find '' the hidden springs of their life '' as no other foreigner has been able to see them ; and to describe the real
Japan	LOCATION	as it has been un - affected by
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	influences .

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	had unusual opportunities for his work .

		He tried to adopt native manners and customs ; was '' wonderfully sensitive to
Japan	LOCATION	- ese influences , '' and thus came into perfect sym - pathy with all `` things Japanese . ''

		His home was in
Matsue	LOCATION	, chief city of
Izumo	LOCATION	, '' the Province of the Gods , '' where divinity first condescended from heaven to earth , or -LRB- as iconoclastic his - torical critics express it -RRB- where emigrants from
Korea	LOCATION	landed in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		His two volumes are modestly entitled : they are more than '' glimpses '' they are long searching exam - inations , microscopical investigations , careful studies .

		They give the minute facts and fan - cies of Japanese life for the philosopher to use in ascertaining the meaning of that life .

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	was the first European to enter the inner shrine of the Kitzuki temple , the old - est Shinto temple in
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		To see
Kitzuki	PERSON	is to see the living centre of Shinto and to feel the life-pulse of the ancient faith . ''

		THE DIAL 259 ethics , no metaphysics , '' is still a difficult ques - tion to answer .

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	thinks that the explanation is to be sought '' not in books , nor in rites , nor in commandments , but in the national heart , of which it is the highest emo - tional expression . ''

		His own explanation is as follows : '' Shinto signifies character in the highest sense , courage , courtesy , honor , and , above all things , loyalty .

		The spirit of Shinto is the spirit of filial piety , the zest of duty , the readiness to surrender life for a principle without a thought of wherefore .

		It is the docility of the child ; it is the sweetness of the Japanese woman .

		... It is religion , but religion transformed into he - reditary moral impulse , religion transmuted into eth - ical instinct .

		It is the whole emotional life of the race , the Soul of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		It is readily noticeable that the meaning of Yamato-damashii -LRB- '' the Japanese spirit '' -RRB- is practically the sdlme as the meaning of the Latin word pietas .

		The personal experiences of Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	while he was holding the position of teacher of En - glish in the
Middle School	ORGANIZATION	and the
Normal School	ORGANIZATION	at
Matsue	LOCATION	are very interesting .

		He evidently explored with great care the country roundabout .

		He went to
Kaka	LOCATION	, where it is for - bidden to go if there is wind enough '' to move three hairs , '' and examined the Cave of the Children 's Ghosts ; to
Mionoseki	LOCATION	, the god of which hates hen 's eggs , hens and chickens , and * ' the cock above all living creatures '' ; to Hi - nomisaki , where '' no European has ever been , '' and where is a far-famed double temple of the Sun-Goddess ; to
Oki	ORGANIZATION	, where '' not even a mis - sionary had ever been , '' and where he found * ' fine strong men and vigorous women '' more numerous than on the mainland ; and to several out-of-the-way places .

		The two volumes are rich in folk-lore , le - gends , superstitions , proverbs , and poems .

		They tell of the magical and beautiful writing of
Kobo Daishi	PERSON	, the inventor of the Japanese syllabary ; of the jolly worship of Jizo , the sweet-faced God of Children ; of the wonderful sights of
Enoshima	LOCATION	; of the market at which are purchased the articles used in the Feast of Lanterns in honor of the dead , and the weird dance of that festival ; of the pathetic custom of double suicide on the part of two lovers , sep - arated in life , but united in death ; of the un - canny foxes and badgers , and the worship of
Inari Sama	ORGANIZATION	, the rice-god ; and of many other festivals , manners , and customs , too numerous to mention . ''

		But these strange beliefs are swiftly passing away .

		Year by year more shrines of
Inari	ORGANIZATION	crumble down , never to be rebuilt .

		Year by year the statuaries make fewer images of foxes .

		Year by year fewer victims of fox - possession are taken to the hospitals to be treated ac - cording to the best scientific methods by Japanese phy - sicians who speak German .

		The cause is not to be found in the decadence of the old faiths ; a superstition outlives a religion .

		Much less is it to be sought for in the efforts of proselytizing missionaries from the West most of whom profess an earnest belief in devils .

		It is purely educational .

		The omnipotent enemy of super - stition is the public school ... The little hands that break the Fox-god 's nose in mischievous play can also write essays upon the evolution of plants and about the geology of
Izumo	LOCATION	.

		There is no place for ghostly foxes in the beautiful nature-world revealed by new studies to the new generation .

		The omnipotent exerciser and reformer is the Kodomo -LSB- Child -RSB- . ''

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	's style is simple and picturesque , eminently befitting the Oriental life which he describes .

		He writes pathetically and sympa - thetically of the life of a dancing-girl , but gives an entirely wrong impression that the geisha is spotless .

		He vividly describes a Japanese garden as absolutely realistic , '' at once a pic - ture and a poem perhaps even more a poem than a picture '' ; and shows how the trees and stones have '' character , '' '' tones and values . ''

		The Japanese certainly succeed in finding '' ser - mons in stones , books in the running brooks , tongues in the trees . '' ''

		Why should the trees be so lovely in
Japan	LOCATION	?

		With us a plum or cherry tree in flower is not an astonish - ing sight ; but here it is a miracle of beauty so bewilder - ing that , however much you may have previously read about it , the real spectacle strikes you dumb .

		You see no leaves , only one great filmy mist of petals .

		Is it that the trees have been so long domesticated and ca - ressed by man in this land of the Gods , that they have acquired souls , and strive to show their gratitude , like women loved , by making themselves more beautiful for man 's sake ?

		Assuredly they have mastered men 's hearts by their loveliness , like beautiful slaves .

		That is to say , Japanese hearts .

		Apparently there have been some for - eign tourists of the brutal class in this place , since it has been deemed necessary to set up inscriptions in En - glish announcing that ` It is forbidden to injure the trees . ' ''

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	tells stories of ghosts and goblins in a way to charm young
America	LOCATION	; discourses of souls in a way to interest spiritualists ; and masterfully analyzes the Japanese smile as a matter of etiquette that demands a stoical man - ifestation of joy even in adversity or affliction . ''

		It is the native custom that whenever a painful or shocking fact must be told , the announcement should be made , by the sufferer , with a smile .

		The graver the subject , the more accentuated the smile ; and when the matter is very unpleasant to the person speaking of it , the smile often changes to a low , soft laugh .

		However bitterly the mother who has lost her first-born may have wept at the funeral , it is probable that , if in your ser - vice , she will tell of her bereavement with a smile : like the Preacher , she holds that there is a time to weep and a time to laugh ... Yet the laugh was politeness 260 THE DIAL -LSB-

		It sig - nified : This you might honorably think to be an un - happy event ; pray do not suffer your superiority to feel concern about so inferior a matter , and pardon the ne - cessity which causes us to outrage politeness by speak - ing about such an affair at all . ' ''

		Some of the sketches in this volume have ap - peared in the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Mail '' and other news - papers , and some in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' ; but almost two-thirds are entirely new .

		The great fault of the work is that it is one - sided .

		The preface merely acknowledges the existence of a '' darker side , '' but calls even this '' brightness compared with the darker side of Western existence . ''

		Throughout the entire book one rarely meets even a hint that sin ex - ists in
Japan	LOCATION	; the beauty of the work must not be marred by stains .

		Japanese life '' has its foibles , its follies , its vices , its cruelties , '' but they do n't amount to anything !

		Kaempfer is quoted with approval : '' In the practice of vir - tue , in purity of life and outward devotion , they far outdo the Christians . ''

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	's '' own conviction '' that ''
Japan	LOCATION	has nothing to gain by conversion to Christianity '' is the usual opinion of `` us agnostics , '' who can scarcely be called '' impartial . ''

		But it is the calm judgment of many '' experienced observers of Japanese life , '' that true Christianity , with its lofty moral standards , its great spiritual power and personal inspiration , is much needed in
New Japan	LOCATION	.

		THE CANTERBURY TALES `` AS POETRY .

		* At last we have an edition of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's Can - terbury Tales adapted to the wants of those who would read them as poetry rather than as a monument of fourteenth century English .

		Accordingly , there is not obtruded upon the reader 's attention , in the editorial matter , a great mass of mere scholarship , which it is very easy in these days to collect .

		Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	has strictly observed , as an editor , the ne quid nimis ; and that is not an easy thing to do .

		This edition , as stated in the Preface , is the result of an engagement entered into , as far back as
1888	DATE	, by Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	and Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	, that they should cooperate in the preparation of a complete Library edition of
Chaucer , for Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		On this arrangement a beginning was made ; but Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	's many engagements compelled him to with - * CHAUCER 'S CANTERBURY TALES .

		Edited , with notes and introduction , by
Alfred W. Pollard	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		draw from the work soon after it was under - taken .

		In the meantime , Professor
Skeat	PERSON	, who , in his Chaucer studies and editing , had been for years collating texts and collecting notes and elucidations of various kinds , planned an edition on a large scale -LRB- now in course of pub - lication by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Says Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	: '' I gladly abandoned , in favor of an editor of so much greater width of reading , the Library edition which had been arranged for in the original agreement of Dr. Fur - nivall and myself with Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		I thought , however , that the work which I had done might fairly be used for an edition on a less extensive plan and in - tended for a less stalwart class of readers , and of this the present issue of the
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	is an instal - ment . ''

		The
London	LOCATION
Chaucer Society	ORGANIZATION	's Six - Text Edition of the
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	revealed the great superiority of the
Ellesmere MS. Upon	LOCATION	this the text of the edition before us is based , the Six Texts and the Harleian MS.
7334	DATE	hav - ing been carefully collated , and all variations from the
Ellesmere	LOCATION	being stated in the foot - notes .

		These variations are not numerous enough to make the page dreary ; and the text is not disfigured by marks calling attention to them .

		There is great certainty now , especially in the case of the
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	, as to what Chaucer actually wrote , far greater certainty than there is as to what
Shakespeare	PERSON	wrote ; and it is to be hoped that the text of this edi - tion , and of Professor Skeat 's edition , will be accepted by the learned world as final .

		It is hard to see what more could be done .

		Of course there are many scholars who do n't like to have things settled .

		Othello 's occupation would be gone .

		To notice the chief editorial features of Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's edition , as presented in his Preface : The glossing of obsolete words in the foot - notes is kept within the smallest limits possible , a glossary of the commoner words being ap - pended to the second volume , to avoid explain - ing them whenever they occur . ''

		To interrupt one 's enjoyment of poetry , '' says the editor , '' by looking up words in a glossary appears to me an intolerable penance , and I have there - fore put explanations of the obsolete words in foot-notes to the pages where they first occur . ''

		It is truly refreshing in these days of engulf - ing scholarship , to meet with an editor of Chaucer -LRB- or any other poet , indeed -RRB- , who , re - garding annotations and other editorial things as necessary evils , makes it a special object to reduce these evils as far as he can consistently with the real wants of the general reader .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 Where the final e -LRB- the common residual of various earlier inflections -RRB- has a syllabic value in the verse , a single small dot is placed over it , which is scarcely noticeable when the eye is cast over the page .

		Acephalous verses , which occur occasionally , are indicated by an accent over the vowel of the syllable of which an initial foot consists ; e. g. , '' Twenty bookes clad in blak or reed . ''

		The spelling of the
Ellesmere MS.	LOCATION	has been followed , without regard to uniformity ; the modern use of u and - y , i andj , being , however , adopted ; and in a few words very few where y in the MS. stands for the Semi-Saxon < 7 , it is represented by the g in present use .

		In regard to uniformity of spelling , the editor quotes what Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	wrote on the sub - ject , six-and-twenty years ago : '' To force a uniform spelling on Chaucer by what - ever process arrived at would be to force a lie on him and on the history of the English language ; an evil for which no fancied gain in convenience of teaching boys could compensate .

		Before him for hundreds of years is no uniformity ; after him for centuries , none ; why in the works of him the free and playful above all others , are letters to lose their power of wandering at their own sweet will ; why are words to be debarred their rightful inheritance of varying their forms ?

		This notion of a uniform spelling , as applied to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's words , is to me a Monster , bred by Artificialness out of False Analogy . ''

		To this the editor adds : '' The variations of spelling which can safely be elim - inated never really disguise a word , and the attempt to introduce into
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's English a modified system of phonetic spelling -LRB- phonetic as applied to vowels , if not to consonants -RRB- seems to me to involve an assumption of knowledge as to the poet 's individual pronunciation con - siderably beyond what we can lay claim to . ''

		It would have been well if the editor had introduced into his Preface , to make the work quite complete in itself , the results arrived at by
Alexander J. Ellis	PERSON	, in his '' Early English Pronunciation , '' as to the powers of the letters in Chaucer results which are generally ac - cepted by Chaucer scholars .

		There is not a full agreement among them ; but anyone who would train his voice -LRB- and it requires much training -RRB- to read Chaucer fluently according to
Ellis	PERSON	, and with due expression , would get at much of the flavor of the poet 's language , not to be otherwise got at .

		A fluent reading of his verse is the most effectual way of assimilating its moulding spirit .

		Chaucer continues to be one of the great masters of verse in the litera - ture ,
Dryden	PERSON	's monstrous chatter about the progress of English verse to the contrary not - withstanding : '' We must be children before we grow men .

		There was an Ennius , and in process of time a Lucilius , and a Lucretius , before
Virgil	PERSON	and
Horace	PERSON	; even after
Chau	PERSON	- cer there was a Spenser , a
Harrington	LOCATION	, a
Fairfax	LOCATION	, before
Waller	PERSON	and
Denham	PERSON	were in being ; and our numbers were in their nonage till these last appeared . ''

		What rhetorical nonsense !

		Even in the use of the rhyming couplet ,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	surpasses immeasurably both
Dryden	PERSON	and Pope .

		His thought is not so paddocked therein .

		In his hands it is not the '' rocking horse , '' as
Keats	PERSON	characterizes it , which it is in the hands of
Dryden	PERSON	and Pope .

		Of
Waller	PERSON	,
Dryden	PERSON	says that '' he first made writing easily an art , first showed us to conclude the sense , most com - monly in distichs , '' etc. .

		One great merit of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's use of the couplet is , that he does not conclude the sense most commonly in dis - tichs .

		His sensitiveness as to melody did not allow him to run into a mechanical uniformity .

		All who read Chaucer as a poet rather than as a writer of fourteenth century English must give this edition of the poet 's masterpiece a hearty welcome .


HIRAM CORSON	PERSON	.

		CURIOSITIES or AFRICAN FOLK-LORE .

		* For some time past the
American Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	has been engaged in raising an espe - cial publication fund for publishing a series of Memoirs .

		The first volume resulting from its efforts is
Chatelain	PERSON	's '' Folk-Tales of
Angola	LOCATION	. ''


Angola	LOCATION	is certainly one of the most important political divisions of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		A possession of
Portugal	LOCATION	, it lies on the west coast , between 4 40 ' and 17 20 ' south latitude .

		With great and varied natural resources , with considerable diversity in climate and topography , the coun - try is quite naturally divided into several great '' districts , '' each with its own capital and its own population .

		The four great districts are called
Kongo	ORGANIZATION	,
Loanda	LOCATION	,
Benguella	LOCATION	, and Mos - samedes .

		The capital city of
Kongo	LOCATION	is Ka - binda ; the capitals of the other districts bear the same names as these .

		The people of
Kongo	LOCATION	are called
Kongo	LOCATION	; those of
Loanda	LOCATION	are the
Angola	LOCATION	proper , or A-mbundu ; those of Ben - guella are the Ovi-mbundu ; those of Mossam - edes do not form a well-marked group , but are much like the Ovi-mbundu but with affinities with the Ova-fferero and Ova-Ndonga of Ger - man
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Our author gives detailed lists of the tribes in each of these groups , and states their geographical location .

		The stories he pre - * FOLK-TALES OF
ANGOLA	LOCATION	.

		By
Heli Chatelain	PERSON	.

		Memoirs of the
American Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	, Vol .

		I.
Boston	LOCATION	:
Hough	PERSON	- ton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		262 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, sents to us are in the Ki-mbundu language of
Angola	LOCATION	proper .

		They represent two dialects the
Loanda	LOCATION	and the
Mbaka	LOCATION	.

		Having thus located his field , geographical and linguistic , our author gives valuable eth - nological data concerning those who speak Ki-nibundu .

		Their government is tribal : there is a chief , with two standing officers , and a council .

		The organization of the family , as among the
Bantu	LOCATION	generally , is based upon ma - ternal kinship and inheritance ; the mother and child are the nearest relations ; the mother 's brother owns nephews and nieces , and can sell them , although they are also his heirs , both of property and position .

		We shall pass the rest of our author 's ethnological notes , but must quote one important statement : '' The ever-repeated assertion that Africans are f etich - ists , that is , worshippers of inanimate objects , is utterly false , or else all superstitious people are fetichists ... -LSB- The Angolans -RSB- are not idolaters in the strict sense , nor atheists , nor fetichists , nor polytheists , but superstitious deists ... True fetichism I have found in
Africa	LOCATION	, among ignorant Portuguese , who do assert and believe that this or that image is God , does work miracles and must be worshipped , not as a mere symbol of its spirit - ual prototype , but as the actual incarnation or embod - iment of it , equal in all respects to the original . ''

		After this consideration of country and peo - ple , Mr.
Chatelain	PERSON	discusses African folk-lore in general and Angolan folk-lore in particular .

		Having traced the study of folk-lore in other parts of
Africa	LOCATION	, he says : '' Proceeding to
West Africa	LOCATION	, we look at the great province of
Angola	LOCATION	, where Europeans have been settled for about four centuries , and we search in vain , through a pile of colonial publications , for a single native folk - tale .

		When intelligent Europeans have been four hun - dred years living and mixing with a native population and never recorded a single sample of the natives ' oral literature , is that not superabundant proof of its non - existence ?

		... Yet as soon as we intelligently and persistently searched for it , that literature revealed it - self to us in amazing luxuriance .

		One of the dullest native boys was able , unaided , to dictate to us , from the book of his memory , over sixty tales and fables , a material equal to that of the largest collection of Afri - can tales ever yet published . ''

		Of real Negro folk-lore there are but a few collections .

		Those of
Callaway	LOCATION	, Theal ,
Koelle	PERSON	,
Schon	PERSON	, and
Chatelain	PERSON	, are about all .

		From a study of the whole material our author deduces several propositions , among them the follow - ing : -LRB- a -RRB- African folk-lore is not a tree of itself , but a branch from one universal tree : many myths , favorite types or characters , and incidents , of frequent recur - rence elsewhere , are also found in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- & -RRB- Portuguese and Arab stories may be recognized but they are entirely worked over and localized .

		-LRB- c -RRB- African folk-lore abounds in animal stories .

		-LRB- J -RRB- The folk-lore of the Bantu is remarkably homo - geneous and compact .

		-LRB- e -RRB- In the animal stories , each animal , while true to its real nature , shows the same character and plays the same role everywhere .

		-LRB- _ / -RRB- Many of the stories are etiologic , attempting to assign a cause or origin for natural phenomena or for individual characteristics .

		Our author finds among the Angolans a ver - itable native classification of oral literature .

		This classification he follows .

		It seems that they recognize : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Fictitious tales containing a miraculous element ; beginning and ending usually with a set formula : mi-soso .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Narratives supposedly true ; sometimes in - structive : maka .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Historical traditions chronicles of the tribes handed down by the jealous care of the headmen and elders : ma-lunda or mi-sendu .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- Proverbs closely connected with the maka , which are often but an illustration of a proverb ; -LRB- a proverb is frequently a narrative in a nutshell -RRB- : ji-sabu .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Poetry and music extemporization is very com - mon ; songs are called : mi-imbu .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- Riddles for pastime and amusement ; often with set formula preceding and following : ji-nongonongo .

		In the present volume we have samples of but two of these classes the mihoso and the maka .

		Fifty of these samples are given .

		The first story , which is very long , is printed in the original
Loanda	LOCATION	, with a literal interlinear trans - lation .

		The remaining stories are printed in the original language , with a careful English translation on the opposite page .

		In these translations the author aims to preserve the simple and direct form of the original and to depict the mode of thought of the narrator .

		Notes historical , linguistic , ethnographic , com - parative , and critical , follow the stories .

		The whole work is scholarly , and will be of great value to linguists and ethnographers .

		Some of the stories are long and elaborately detailed ; others are brief , summarized ; some show keenness of perception , delicacy of ex - pression , beauty of thought ; many convey les - sons of importance .

		The first story , no better than many of the others , shows several points of interest .

		It begins with the usual formula , Erne ngateletele = '' I often tell of , '' correspond - ing to our '' Once upon a time . ''

		It ends with , '' I have told my little story ; whether good or bad , I have finished . ''

		Self-depreciation by a performer appears to be world-wide !

		Fenda Maria is a young girl , locked up by her mother , who is jealous of her beauty .

		Escaping , she searches for a lover , even more beautiful than herself , who is bound by a magic sleep ; by helping an old woman , she is instructed as to 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 how she may find and release the young man ; when found , he must be awakened by the weep - ing of twelve jars full of tears : wearied in this labor , she calls her slave to relieve her ; this one plays her false , gains the prince , and poor
Fenda Maria	ORGANIZATION	is reduced to slavery .

		Of course , in the end , she gains the victory by magic means .

		The conclusion is tragic : `` Pele Mi - landa -LSB- the husband -RSB- called young men two .

		They lift JZamasoxi -LSB- the traitor slave -RSB- and they put her into the barrel of coal-tar , and they set it on fire .

		Kamasoxi then burns , gets charred ; a little bone flies up , alights on
Fenda Maria	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fenda Maria then rubs herself with it . ''

		This is common custom in
Africa	LOCATION	: anoint - ing one 's self with charcoal of burnt bone or flesh protects against enemies , material and spiritual .

		Very commonly the whole story is summar - ized , in a single paragraph , just before it ends .

		These summaries are really models .

		Thus , a two-page story is summarized as follows : '' A young man married his wife .

		The man had four brothers .

		The woman whom he married knew not their names .

		When she went to pound , a little bird told her the names of her brothers-in-law . ''

		Angolan stories are often etiologic .

		At times the etiological idea re - mains in suspense , quite unsuspected , until the close of the tale .

		Thus , a story of three girls and a little child , who visit the makishi -LRB- can - nibals -RRB- is quite excitingly told through nearly five pages ; the girls barely escape with their lives and only with the aid of
Hawk	ORGANIZATION	, to whom they promise payment .

		When he arrives to claim his reward , '' he says : ye pay me now ' ; they said : ` we can not pay thee into hands ; thou thyself , the fowls are here , help thyself . '

		The Hawk assented .

		And thus it remained : the Hawk , who is wont to catch fowls , of old he did not catch them ; he was eating locusts and small birds only . ''

		The folk-lore student will make many inter - esting comparisons between these
Angola	LOCATION	tales and the lore of other peoples .

		The author makes many such in the notes .

		Of course there are frequent resemblances to '' Uncle Re - mus 's '' stories of our Southern negroes .

		We meet both parts of the tar-baby story .

		In the story of
Leopard	ORGANIZATION	,
Monkey	ORGANIZATION	, and
Hare	PERSON	, we have the sticky figures used as a trap to catch the two latter creatures .

		In the story of the Man and the Turtle , we have the balance of our old favorite .

		A man caught a turtle ; the neigh - bors said , '' Let us kill it ! ''

		They propose using hatchets ; the turtle replies , '' Turtle of
Koka	ORGANIZATION	, And hatchet of
Koka	ORGANIZATION	, Hatchet not hurt me a bit . ''

		Stones , fire , knives , are suggested , and , on ac - count of his indifference , rejected .

		At last they said , '' Let us cast him into the depth of the water . ''

		The turtle replying , '' Woe !

		I shall die there !

		how shall I do ? ''

		he is thrown into the river .

		After diving , he rises , and sings as he swims : '' In water , in my home , In water , in my home . ''

		But we must stop .

		The collection is an ex - cellent one , admirably presented and annotated .

		It is rare that so important and scholarly a con - tribution is made at once to folk-lore , ethnog - raphy , and linguistics .

		Mr.
Chatelain	PERSON	is to be congratulated upon producing so good a work , and the American Folk-lore Society upon se - curing it as its first volume of Memoirs .

		264 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ing that the heroine is a '' brune , '' and that it would never have done for her to be anything else : '' Some of the boys regretted her not being fair .

		But , as they felt , and sought to explain , in the manner of the wag of a tail , with elbows and eyebrows to one an - other 's understanding , fair girls could never have let fly such a look ; fair girls are softer , woollier , and when they mean to look serious , overdo it by craping solemn , or they pinafore a jigging eagerness , or hoist propriety on a chubby flaxen grin ; or else they dart an eye , or they mince and prim and pout , and are sigh-away and dying-ducky , given to girls ' tricks . ''

		This is surely English in delirium tremens , and the disease is too frequently recurrent in this and in milder forms .

		Yet the reader who , undeterred , ac - cepts it as inevitable , and has the heart to perse - vere , is not without his reward .

		There is character , there is passion , there is even simple strength at times ; there is , moreover , an ideal of robust hu - manity , vigorous enough to sweep aside petty con - ventions -LRB- although in the process those conventions , which , so far from being petty , are the very base of the social fabric , sometimes go by the board as well -RRB- , and to view life sub specie ceternitatis .

		We are again impressed -LRB- as so often before -RRB- with the analogy between Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's genius and that of the late
Robert Browning	PERSON	an analogy based upon a fundamental theory of life no less than upon per - versity of expression .

		And of the latter , we may make for Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	the defence made for
Browning	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	when he says that the poet '' is something too much the reverse of obscure ; he is too brilliant and subtle for the ready reader of a ready writer to follow with any certainty the track of an intelligence which moves with such in - cessant rapidity . ''

		Such a defence , justifiable to a certain point , may of course easily be read as grant - ing too much .

		After all , it does not excuse ; it only palliates .

		And it does not make a Tennyson -LRB- or an artist equal in rank -RRB- of
Browning	PERSON	any more than it makes a Thackeray of Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		The prompt success scored by Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	's '' Trilby '' is one of those things that restore confi - dence , often sadly shaken , in the public taste .

		For the success is richly deserved , even when we judge the book by an exacting standard and it does not seem accountable for otherwise than as following from a true appreciation of the artistic quality of Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	's genial transcript of life .

		The drawings count for something , to be sure ; but one would suppose the book handicapped for the aver - age reader by its lack of a plot , as the term is com - monly understood .

		And it must be admitted that the book is very imperfect from the standpoint of construction .

		The nice theorists who formulate and lay down the laws of the novel will not easily fit this one into any of their schemes , and it may well prove the despair of the student of literary archi - tectonics .

		The hypnotism business , for example , is unjustifiable both in science and in art , and seriously mars the work .

		But this stricture , as well as the many others that might be made , only illustrates anew the fact that genius may do almost anything and yet be forgiven .

		And genius Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	certainly has , if deep insight into character , rich criticism of life , delicate artistic perceptions , and a shrewd and wholesome humor , are enough to con - stitute that not easily definable quality .

		In the first half of the book , every page is a delight ; the latter half only is a little disappointing .

		The na'ive way in which the author takes you into his confidence from the start is irresistibly winning ; the descrip - tions of student life in the
Latin Quarter	LOCATION	are as in - imitable as those of Thackeray or
Murger	PERSON	; the pathos of Trilby 's life and fate is exquisite ; and the unconventional diction with which all these mat - ters are set forth is most refreshing .

		The omniv - orous reader , a little tired of writers so intent upon the manner of their saying things that they have no time to find things worth saying , will eagerly wel - come a man who has viewed life with tenderness and a sane outlook , and who has so much to report that he occasionally forgets to polish his paragraphs , if indeed , he do not deliberately eschew the ways of the stylist .

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, after certain literary wanderings into strange foreign parts , has returned to the scene in which his first conspicuous success as a novelist was made , and produced , in '' The Manxman , '' a work which must sensibly increase his reputation .

		The outline of this new novel is comparatively sim - ple , and it culminates in an episode which is , mu - tatis mutandis , essentially that of '' The Scarlet Let - ter . ''

		The narrative , which exhibits great elabora - tion of detail , displays a mastery of tragic irony , and has passages of singular power ; but yet , when we think for a moment of the art of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, we see that far greater power is possible with far less of elaboration , and wonder whether Mr.
Caine	PERSON	would not have been better advised had he worked along simpler lines .

		As a minute and faithful study of a locality and a variety of the human species , this Manx romance is entitled to the highest praise .

		We are made to know the people as if we had lived with them for years , and doubtless they are inter - esting enough to be made the subject of so thorough a treatment .

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's genius , moreover , weighted as it is upon the emotional side of the balance , fits him to deal with people under such primitive con - ditions as obtain in the Isle of Man .

		He would hardly be at home in the world of Thackeray or
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		Right into the midst of the Thirty Years War , into the most hideous and meaningless chapter in the annals of all modern warfare , we are plunged by the new romance of Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	.

		The scene is focussed upon the
summer of 1832	DATE	, the period between
Breitenfeld	ORGANIZATION	and
Liitzen	PERSON	, the weeks when the Swedish king confronted
Wallenstein	PERSON	be - fore

		With these scenes for a background , Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	has told the story of a noble lady , driven from her home , exposed to all
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 the perils of travel in that lawless time , and to the greater peril of the love of a brutal soldier of for - tune whose protection she unwittingly seeks , until , after many vicissitudes , she emerges from her dif - ficulties as every well-conducted heroine of romance is bound to emerge , and once more finds peace and happiness and all the other things that have to come at the end of the story .

		The book is , of course , one of the most stirring sort of adventure , and the au - thor has '' got up '' his period and his accessories well enough .

		But the action is more confused and the incidents upon a scale of greater monotony than , say , in '' A Gentleman of
France	LOCATION	, '' and we are in - clined to think that Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	has done better work on at least two , and possibly on three or four , occasions .

		To write a whole novel in dialogue , or after the manner of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's farces , was a somewhat daring undertaking , especially on the part of a writer who was to forego dramatic incident almost alto - gether , and rely upon the sparkle of conversation to sustain the interest .

		`` The Maiden 's Progress '' is unquestionably clever , and abounds in little touches that show delicate observation and sympathy .

		Taken a few pages at a time , it is extremely read - able ; run through at a sitting , it palls .

		Nor is the story remarkable for coherency either of character or plot .

		Whipped cream is excellent in its way , but there should be some sort of pudding beneath .

		One does not nowadays expect a new novel by Mr.
Black	PERSON	to furnish very substantial nutriment , but there are limits to the permissible dilution even of gruel , and it must be said that '' Highland Cous - ins '' exceeds those limits .

		The book offers us the old Highland background , the old and badly worn stage-sets , the old Gaelic talk , and absolutely noth - ing to relieve the monotony of these too familiar adjuncts .

		We suppose that there are persons who have never read a novel by Mr.
Black	PERSON	, and to such it may be imagined that this latest of the long line might have a message and a charm ; but it is not easy for the jaded reviewer to assume the suggested standpoint , and we must be content to note that the present work is more exclusively provincial than most of its predecessors , that it tells a pretty and pathetic story , and that it contains nothing likely to haunt the memory long after the closing page has been read .

		But the simple and unpretending plan of the narrative should disarm criticism ; and then , the author is by no means the only modern novelist who has repeated himself .

		Besides , few have the grace to repeat themselves in so frank and unblushing a way .

		Mrs.
Margaret L. Woods	PERSON	made her first appear - ance in literature with '' A Village Tragedy , '' pub - lished nearly six years ago .

		A year or two later she published ''
Esther Vanhomrigh	PERSON	. ''

		The first of these books was a masterpiece of the tragic idyll ; the other was as unquestionably a masterpiece of historical fiction .

		So undoubted a success in two so distinct fields of the art of fiction naturally at - tracted much attention to the hitherto unknown writer , and the most discerning critics were lavish in their appreciation of the rare qualities displayed by Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	in her work .

		We hardly need , then , to bespeak a welcome for '' The Vagabonds , '' her third novel , now just appeared .

		It must be classed with '' A Village Tragedy '' rather than with her brilliant study of the life and times of Swift , and is at least the equal of its predecessor .

		The characters are very humble folk indeed , merely the members of a strolling show , circus performers and menagerie attendants .

		Nothing is spared us of their illiteracy , their vulgarity , or their vice ; yet the art of the writer is such that our thought does not dwell upon these things overmuch , but is rather led to contemplate the common humanity which is ours no less than theirs .

		Pathos we may expect in such a story , and maudlin pathos is too frequent an element in tales of the lowly , intended to arouse a cheap sentimentality in readers belonging to a higher social stratum .

		But the aim of the present writer is a far higher one , and her pathos , so far from be - ing cheap , is of the noble sort that levels all social distinctions , and sets us face to face with the funda - mental verities of life .

		How often we are forced to exclaim , '' This is truth , '' and not merely truth in the barren sense of the photographic realist , but truth as it exists for the artist , truth sublimated and significant .

		The art of Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	is the art of the true realists , the art of ''
George Eliot	PERSON	, '' for ex - ample , in her scenes of village or provincial life .

		To make of the clown of an itinerant circus the hero of a novel was a daring task indeed , and it is a true spiritual triumph that we should be forced to accept him as a man and a brother , which we clearly must do in the present instance .

		The author of '' The Manxman '' has done something akin to this ; but his method , when compared with that of Mrs.
Woods	PERSON	, shows obvious traces of the melodramatic .

		In this special achievement , the woman is at once a sim - pler and a subtler artist than the man .

		Under the modest disguise of the initials '' Z. Z. , '' a new writer , seemingly emulous of ''
Maarten Maar	PERSON	- tens , '' bids for our interest in a little group of Dutch settlers in
London	LOCATION	.

		This '' Drama in Dutch '' is a very simple story , and the people with whom it deals are merely transplanted Dutchmen , preserv - ing intact , in their new colony , their national char - acteristics .

		Before the end is reached , we feel pretty well acquainted with them , both in their in - dustrious money-getting and in their domestic sur - roundings , and this is a great effect for any writer to achieve .

		The author can hardly be other than a Dutchman himself his knowledge and sympathy are too evident to be otherwise explained but he writes an irreproachable English , and his manner is engaging .

		Most readers will feel themselves dis - tinctly defrauded in the outcome of this '' drama , '' for the long-lost son is not discovered , or the re - verse , by the long-lost father , although both are upon the scene , thus furnishing the conditions of a 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, climax which , according to all the traditions of good story-telling , we have a right to expect .

		The ele - ment of pathos in the story becomes it well , and is distinctly marked .

		The master of an English public school is respon - sible for as unliterary and curiously dull a piece of story-telling as is often seen .

		His taste as a stylist may be seen in the title , '' The Thing that Hath Been ; or , A Young Man 's Mistakes , '' a formula which would have handicapped `` Vanity Fair '' itself .

		The book deals with the inner life of an English school , and no details are too petty and insignificant to find a place in its pages .

		The chief character is a young man destitute of breeding , but endowed with a certain intellectual force , who for a time occupies a master 's place .

		He is distinguished by a bluntness in saying what he thinks and an un - comfortably logical way in putting things , which characteristics seem intended to deserve our sym - pathy , but utterly fail in their purpose .

		If we are to accept the graceless realism of this book , the En - glish public school is a place without tone or manly feeling , a place where the masters are given over to bickering and to devices for shirking their duties , to say nothing of being brutal in their relations to one another , and where the boys are dull , idle , and unambitious .

		But this picture is probably as far away from the average truth as is , in the other di - rection , the picture of
Arnold	LOCATION	's Rugby , made famil - iar to us all by the classic account of Judge
Hughes	PERSON	.

		The heroine of '' Dr.
Janet	PERSON	of Harley Street '' is a young woman who , at the age of seventeen , is en - gaged to marry a French marquis of some fifty summers .

		All goes well until the wedding morn - ing , when the elderly wooer does violence to the maidenly susceptibilities of his betrothed by kissing her in the garden of her mother 's house .

		Still , the marriage ceremony is permitted to take place , but it is no sooner over than the bride takes flight from her country home , goes up to
London	LOCATION	, and walks the streets in search of employment .

		Being penni - less , she passes the first night h la belle etoile ; a repetition of this dismal experience is spared her by the accident of finding a grimly good-natured physician of her own sex , who takes her into the household , and sets her to studying medicine .

		In the course of time an attractive professor of chem - istry appears upon the scene , and the usual entangle - ment ensues .

		A second wedding follows upon a false report of the death of the marquis ; the discovery that he still lives places the heroine in the uncom - fortable position of a bigamist .

		Whereupon the re - doubtable Dr.
Janet	PERSON	seeks out the marquis , and urges him to commit suicide as the best way of clear - ing the atmosphere .

		This he obligingly does , with the accompaniment of an interesting attack of de - lirium tremens , and the story ends .

		Everything about it is , of course , in the highest degree absurd , while a hysterical method and the introduction of much dismally irrelevant matter deprive the book of its last hope of arousing the interest , as even a very absurd story may possibly do , when told by a writer having some share of the novelist 's instinct .

		Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's new story is so different from '' The Prisoner of Zenda '' that the reviewer finds a complete readjustment of focus necessary .

		Instead of intrigue , adventure , and the atmosphere of romance , we have a simple story of an English country town , told in the best of taste , and distinctly novel in plot .

		The hero is a poet who has become famous by his audacious denunciations of kings , priests , and tyrants in general , to say nothing of the social order in which it is possible for them to exist .

		He takes up residence in a quiet village , and his presence , reinforced by his lurid reputation , con - siderably flutters the rural dovecotes .

		Falling in love with the daughter of a local magnate , his views un - dergo a remarkable modification , and he even pens an ode to a visiting prince .

		These relapses secure for him the deadly hatred of a radical physician of the neighborhood , who has taken the poet 's rhetoric far too seriously , and who now treats him as a '' lost leader . ''

		For a time , the situation grows almost tragic , but the story ends happily for most of those concerned .

		It is impossible to help discerning in the hero 's career a sort of travesty of Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne 's progress from his early radicalism to the conservatism of his later years .

		But suggestions of this sort need not , of course , be applied too literally .

		Readers of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's '' New Republic '' dur - ing recent years must often have thought that the Mr.
Rose	PERSON	of the satire , obviously a caricature as far as
Walter Pater	PERSON	is concerned , was far from be - ing a bad likeness of Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, whose me - teoric career was a thing of the future at the time when Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	wrote .

		The hero of '' The Green Carnation '' is Mr.
Rose	PERSON	over again , much exagger - ated , with a neat taste for paradox superadded to his old insistence upon the value of the moment and the mood , thus reminding us still more dis - tinctly of the author of a certain pleasant essay on '' The Decay of Lying . ''

		The new book , like the old one which it suggests , aims to satirize some of the men and movements most prominent to-day in English life and literature .

		It , too , has for its ma - chinery a house party and the incidents and discus - sions thereto appertaining , but in the present case the names of those at whom its shafts are aimed are not disguised .

		Here is a typical example : '' ' Dear Lady ! '

		said Esme '' , getting up out of his chair slowly , ` intelligence is the demon of our age .

		Mine bores me horribly .

		I am always trying to find a rem - edy for it .

		I have experimented with absinthe , but gained no result .

		I have read the collected works of
Walter Besant	PERSON	.

		They are said to sap the mental pow - ers .

		They did not sap mine .

		Opium has proved use - less , and green tea cigarettes leave me positively bril - liant .

		What am I to do ?

		I so long for the lethargy , the sweet peace of stupidity .

		If only I were
Lewis Morris	PERSON	! ' ''

		There is a certain cleverness , although of a cheap
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 sort , in this kind of writing , but a whole volume of it grows wearisome .

		Here is another and rather taking bit : '' ' I will stay at home and read the last number of '' The Yellow Disaster . ''

		I want to see Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	's idea of the
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has drawn him sitting in a wheelbarrow in the gardens of Lambeth Palace , with underneath him the motto , '' J' y suis , j' y reste . ''

		I believe he has on a black mask .

		Perhaps that is to conceal the likeness . ' '

		I have seen it , ' Mrs.
Windsor	PERSON	said ; ` it is very clever .

		There are only three lines in the whole picture , two for the wheel - barrow and one for the Archbishop . ' ''

		Such a book as this calls for sampling rather than for comment , and we select the following for our final extract .

		The hero , as before , is the speaker . '' '

		What shall I give you for a wedding present , Reg - gie ?

		I think I will give you the
Book of Common Prayer	ORGANIZATION	in the vulgar tongue .

		One would think it was something written by a realist .

		The adjectives would apply to the productions of
George Moore	PERSON	, which are boycotted by
Smith	PERSON	on account of their want of style or something of the sort .

		If
George Moore	PERSON	could only learn the subtle art of indecency he might be toler - able .

		As it is , he is , like Miss Yonge , merely tedious and domesticated .

		He ought to associate more with educated people , instead of going perpetually to the de - pendent performances of the Independent Theatre , whose motto seems to be , '' If I do n't shock you , I 'm a Dutch - man ! ''

		How curiously archaic it must feel to be a Dutchman .

		It must be like having been born in Ice - land , or educated in a grammar school .

		I would give almost anything to feel really Dutch for half-an-hour . ' ''

		We are not surprised to hear that '' The Green Car - nation '' has made something of a flutter in
London	LOCATION	.

		But we shall be greatly surprised if anyone is found to read it ten years from now .

		A
Healy	ORGANIZATION	's `` Reminiscences of a Portrait Painter '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Mr.
Healy	PERSON	, as the world knows , was a master of the brush , and his book shows that he could wield the pen with a fluent neatness that might put many a professed writer to the blush .

		In Part I. , he sketches rapidly and deftly the story of his life and of his progress as a painter , of his child - ish dabblings with the toy colors ; his first portrait , first sale , and first patron ; his journey to
Europe	LOCATION	and taste of bohemianism in
Paris	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	; his marriage , early struggles , and final success ; his return home , and his experiences in
Chicago	LOCATION	, then a chaotic , rude town , where squalor elbowed inci - pient finery ; where the Dives of to-day was the La - zarus of yesterday ; where the calico , pork , and gro - cery millionaires were yet in the bud , thrifty , and sus - picious of art , yet , as potential ancestors , not unwilling to have their portraits done in '' ile '' ; and where '' un - couth shanties reared their shabby heads close to fine new mansions . ''


Chicago	LOCATION	has not , perhaps , lost all her old characteristics .

		In Part II. , the author writes of his friends and his sitters ; and among the latter , we need scarcely say , were many of the most distin - guished people of the old and the new worlds .

		Thiers ,
Gambetta	PERSON	,
Guizot	LOCATION	,
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, the Abbe * Liszt ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	,
Jackson	PERSON	, Clay ,
Webster	PERSON	, Pope
Pius IX.	PERSON	, and
William B. Ogden	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, have sat before his easel ; and for each he has a page or so of graphic anecdote and comment .

		There is a glimpse of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, and it is not a pleasant one .

		Mr.
Healy	PERSON	was at
Windsor	LOCATION	, copying a Lawrence portrait , when the Queen and Prince
Albert	PERSON	, crossing the gallery , stopped to glance at his work . ''

		As she wished for some details as to the order the
King of France	ORGANIZATION	had given me , she turned to her husband , saying , ' Ask Mr.
Healy	PERSON	if , ' etc. ; and Prince
Albert	PERSON	put the ques - tions to me , as though he had been translating from a foreign tongue .

		Then she exclaimed , looking at my copy , ' It is extremely like , ' and , with the slight - est possible bend of the head , passed on .

		I own that my American blood rather boiled in my veins . ''

		Not much more courteous was Mr.
Healy	PERSON	's treat - ment at the hands of '' Old Hickory '' though the outcome of his visit to the veteran was successful .

		He had been commissioned to paint
Jackson	PERSON	's por - trait by
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, and found the old hero at the Hermitage , suffering from dropsy , propped in his great arm-chair , and in a thoroughly
Jackson	PERSON	- ian temper . ''

		Ca n't sit , sir , ca n't sit , '' he an - swered curtly , on learning Mr.
Healy	PERSON	's errand . ''

		But ,
General	ORGANIZATION	, '' urged the painter , '' the
King of France	ORGANIZATION	, who has sent me all this way on purpose to paint you , will be greatly disappointed . '' ''

		Ca n't sit , sir , not for all the Kings in
Christendom	LOCATION	, '' still growled the veteran ; and Mr.
Healy	PERSON	beat a retreat , discomfited .

		The sitting was afterwards granted at the instance of Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	, wife of the
General	ORGANIZATION	's adopted son , and a prime favorite .

		`` Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	told me afterwards , '' says Mr.
Healy	PERSON	, `` that her task had not been an easy one .

		At her first words he exclaimed , ' Ca n't sit , child .

		Let me die in peace . '

		She insisted , used her best arguments all in vain .

		Finally , she said , < Father , I should so much like you to sit . '

		He hesitated , much moved by her earnestness , and , with tears in his eyes , an - swered , ` My child , I will sit . ' ''

		The portrait proved satisfactory , and it led to other commissions .

		The book is prettily gotten up , and the many por - traits after originals by Mr.
Healy	PERSON	form an element of decided interest .

		The two handsome volumes contain - t the '' Letters and Sermons of Samuel Longfellow '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- bring us into contact with a very sweet and lovable soul , the brother and biographer of the poet whose name is so dear to all .

		This younger brother was also poet as well as preacher ; and though his poetic genius was of narrow range , yet it was true and del - icate in quality , and to it we owe some of the finest 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, modern hymns .

		They are hymns of universal re - ligion , tender , catholic , thoughtful .

		In these he made his chief contribution to the world ; by them he will be remembered and honored .

		He was a preacher of a very inclusive and progressive
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , rational and yet spiritual , free and yet de - vout , radical and yet both appreciative and affirma - tive .

		As a pastor , he was the delight of children , the inspirer of youth , the teacher of mature men and women , the guide to peace for troubled souls , the comforter of those who mourn .

		He was not a pulpit orator , nor was he a church organizer ; but wherever he ministered , in
Fall River	LOCATION	,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, or
Germantown	LOCATION	, he made himself felt in every good work and for every good cause .

		All lives that he touched he blessed and beautified ; his memory is treasured by all who knew him for the gracious and gentle spirit which he diffused wherever he went .

		The book of hymns , the joint work of himself and his intimate friend
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	, was his main literary venture in early life .

		Later he contributed many articles to reviews and magazines on religious topics .

		His last years were devoted to the prepa - ration of the biography of his distinguished brother , which he completed to the satisfaction of all .

		His sweet and quiet spirit shows through all his pages , as it did in the man himself .

		Still , he was a man of courage and force who could act as well as write and preach .

		He was a brave reformer in his way , an early enemy of the institution of slavery , always nobly aggressive against all forms of sin .

		Mr.
Jos	PERSON	- eph
May	DATE	, a worthy son of a distinguished father ,
Samuel J. May	PERSON	, has done his editorial work in these volumes with fine taste and with good judgment .

		In the first volume the life-story is presented largely in the words of Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	, taken from his correspondence with
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	,
Edward Ev	PERSON	- erett
Hale	PERSON	, and a few others , whom we here meet in ways of pleasantness .

		The second volume con - tains the '' Essays and Sermons . ''

		There is nothing very startling or luminous here , but the reader will find great themes treated in an instructive and help - ful manner .

		The spirit is broad , the thought is clear and strong , the language is chaste , the tone is reverent , the teaching is human and spiritual .

		Our candid friend ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	, '' in his ``
John Bull & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Webster	PERSON	-RRB- , takes a wider geographical flight than usual .

		Having described , to the satisfaction of every - one but his victims , the senior member of this en - terprising firm , he further avenges
Waterloo	LOCATION	by '' showing up the colonial branches in
Canada	LOCATION	, Aus - tralia ,
New Zealand	LOCATION	,

Cape Town	LOCATION	,
Kimberley	LOCATION	, etc. , are `` written up '' or written down in turn , and the local humors and foibles are hit off with characteristic point and good temper .

		Entertainment is not un - mingled with instruction .

		Certain abortive experi - ments of our own with this instrument had weak - ened our faith in the current accounts of it ; but ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	'' has seen it , and seen it perform .

		The boomerang , he says , is a flat piece of wood about two and a half feet long , arched somewhat like a triangle . ''

		The Queenslander spies an object at some distance from him .

		The boomerang , after having hit this object -LRB- if it is a living thing its end has come -RRB- , mounts into the air like a bird , with a whirr - ing as of wings , to a height of sixty to eighty yards , describes immense circles , and , if cleverly thrown , comes back in its fall to the feet of the thrower . ''

		The most exacting could ask no more of it .

		The volume is generously illustrated with photographic prints .

		A guide-book bearing the name of Baedeker naturally supersedes all others , and it is with no little satis - faction that we place the new ''
Canada	LOCATION	'' on the shelf with all the rest . ''

		The Dominion of Can - ada , with
Newfoundland	LOCATION	and an Excursion to Alas - ka '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is the full title of the book , and Mr.
J. F. Muirhead	PERSON	, who did the `` United States '' so well for the same series , is the author .

		All the familiar features are here , the condensa - tion , the wealth of exact information , the supply of just those facts that travellers want to know , the convenient arrangement of routes , and the beautiful maps which so put to shame the best American ef - forts in this direction .

		The special features of the work are Dr.
J. G. Bourinot	PERSON	's essay on `` The Con - stitution of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' Dr.
G. M. Dawson	PERSON	's ''
Geo	PERSON	- graphical and Geological Sketch , '' and the article on '' Sports and Pastimes '' contributed by Messrs.
W. H. Fuller	PERSON	and
E. T. D. Chambers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The article on
Newfoundland	LOCATION	is mainly the work of the Rev.
Moses Harvey	PERSON	.

		Since the book is designed largely for En - glish tourists , it includes the transatlantic routes , as well as those from
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	to Mon - treal and
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		A book like this does not offer much room for the personality of a writer , but touches are not wanting , as for example , in the de - scription of
Cape Trinity	ORGANIZATION	on the
Saguenay	LOCATION	, in which we read : '' The front of the cliffs is defaced by the staring advertisement of a
Quebec	LOCATION	tradesman , whom , it is hoped , all right-minded tourists will on this ac - count religiously boycott . ''

		This hope we are only too happy to echo .

		An engaging little work , and a choice piece of book-making withal , is the '' Diary of
Anna Green Winslow	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- , edited , with introduction and copious notes , by Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	.

		The diarist was a bright little scion of sound Puritan stock , who in

		experiences , and quietly regardful , like all sharp `` little pitchers , '' of her unwary elders , she has left us a really capital silhouette of the domestic man - ners of her day .

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's Introduction , we need scarcely say to THE DIAL 'S readers , is schol - arly and graceful ; and the notes evince her usual curious and accurate knowledge of things Colonial .

		There are several illustrations , including a portrait of the diarist , and a specimen of her writing in facsimile .

		Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	's '' Costume in Colonial Times '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- should prove a real godsend to artists , whether in words or in colors , who incline to
Colonial	ORGANIZATION	motifs and wish to keep their works free from the anach - ronisms in matters of dress that mar too many portrayals of Colonial life .

		The book is a glos - sary , and it is something more , for the author sets forth her facts entertainingly as well as conveniently , and she has prefaced the glossary proper with an instructive '' History of Colonial Dress . ''

		The work is based on facts drawn from old letters , newspa - pers , wills , court-records , etc. , and while the New En - gland references predominate , the scarcer sources of the southern Colonies have been carefully ex - plored .

		While Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has done
Dryasdust	ORGANIZATION	's work , she certainly has not , save in point of thor - oughness , done it in
Dryasdust	ORGANIZATION	's way .

		The book is an exceedingly tasteful one outwardly .

M. Frederic Masson	PERSON	has passed it in his `` Napoleon , Lover and Husband '' -LRB- The
Merriam Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Much of the book is indelicate , more of it is trivial , and some of its `` revelations '' are broad enough to explain the otherwise inexplicable fact that it has reached a fourteenth edition in
France	LOCATION	.

		The marital experiences of
Josephine	PERSON	and
Marie Louise	PERSON	have already been told ad nauseam ; and we see no good reason for dragging the vul - gar liaisons of Napoleon to light .

		The publishers have given the work a more respectable setting than it deserves .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Those who prefer tried old fiction to experimental new will find their account in some reprints that have just appeared . ''

		Quits , '' by the
Baroness Tautphceus	PERSON	, is published by the Putnams in two neat volumes , boxed , and styled the '' Leonora '' edition .

		The immortal '' Three Musketeers '' of
Dumas	PERSON	appears in two very attractive volumes , illustrated by
M. Leloir	PERSON	, from the press of
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes , likewise , is
Henry Kingsley	PERSON	's '' Ravenshoe , '' issued by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, and to be followed by ''
Austin Elliot	PERSON	'' and ''
Geoffrey Harnlin	PERSON	. ''

		The author was well worthy of this new edition , which will , we doubt not , find a hearty welcome .

		Reversing the title of her sprightly little book of three years ago on '' Adopting an Abandoned Farm , '' Miss
Kate Sanborn	PERSON	continues the tale of her rural ex - periences in the pretty volume entitled '' Abandoning an Adopted Farm '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The point of the book is expressed in its title .

		Like its predecessor , it is chatty and unconventional to a degree , and brimful of the humors of rustic life as seen through urban spectacles .

		Volume II .

		of `` The Writings of Thomas Paine '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Moncure D. Conway	PERSON	, has just been published .

		It is a straight reprint , with but little in the way of introduction and annotation , of the books and tracts that date from
1779	DATE	to
1792	DATE	.

		The Rights of Man , '' dating , complete , from
1792	DATE	, fills the latter half of the volume .

		Of the other papers the most im - portant are the '' Letter to the Abbe *
Raynal	PERSON	, '' the tract on '' Public Good , '' and the letters , from the
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania '' Gazette , '' on '' Peace , and the
Newfoundland	LOCATION	Fisheries . ''

		Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	has collected into a volume of the '' Religion of Science '' library a large number of his fugitive papers upon philosophical subjects , and the col - lection , entitled '' Fundamental Problems , '' is sent forth by the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contents of this book are of an exceedingly varied character , and there is no unity of plan except that which comes from the unity of the underlying thought .

		The papers make sug - gestive popular reading upon the most serious problems that engage the human intellect , and there is doubtless somewhere a large audience of persons who will find them helpful .

		Tbe third and latest volume of the '' Studies in Clas - sical Philology '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , issued from time to time by
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, is a monograph upon '' The Cult of Asklepios , '' by Dr.
Alice Walton	PERSON	.

		Miss
Walton	PERSON	briefly treats of the subject as a whole , and appends to the chapters which make up the work proper a number of very valuable indices , particularly one of '' Literature and Inscriptions '' and one -LRB- nearly thirty pages in length -RRB- of '' Localities of Cults . ''

		In the latter index , the clas - sification is geographical , and authorities are given .

		The `` Ariel Shakespeare '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , of which we have already noticed four instalments of seven volumes each , is now completed by the publication of a final batch of twelve volumes .

		Three of these are devoted , respectively , to the '' Poems , '' the '' Sonnets , '' and a '' Glossary , '' thus eking out the full number of forty , of which the set consists .

		The set costs
$ 16.00	MONEY	in cloth , and
$ 30.00	MONEY	in full leather .

		It may also be had in sets of twenty double volumes , also in two styles , cloth and half-bound .

		In either of these forms , the edition is very neat and serviceable .

		We note also in this connection , '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' and '' A Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' in the '' Temple Shakespeare '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The bridge of the
Rialto	LOCATION	and the room in which Shake - speare was born are the etchings which serve as frontis - pieces .

		Recently published classical texts include Professor
B. Perrin	PERSON	's edition -LRB- Ginn -RRB- of Books V.-VIII .

		of the '' Odyssey , '' based upon
Hentze	PERSON	's text in the Teubner series ; a little book of exercises , called `` The Gate to the Anabasis '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , by Mr.
Clarence W. Gleason	PERSON	; Dr.
John C. Rolfe	PERSON	's attractive edition -LRB-
Allyn	PERSON	-RRB- of '' Cor - nelii
Nepotis Vitse	PERSON	, '' with many notes and exercises for translation into Latin ; an edition of the '' Alcestis '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , supplied with much excellent apparatus by Dr.
Mortimer Lamson Earle	PERSON	; and a very small book of scenes from the '' Persse '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , edited by the Rev.
F. S. Ramsbotham	PERSON	.

		270 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		The long-expected
Whittier	LOCATION	's Letters are to appear immediately .

		The letters of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, we learn , are not likely to be published for some months .

		Mr.
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	has succeeded Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	as editor of '' The Fortnightly Review . ''

		The author of '' The Green Carnation , '' reviewed else - where in this issue , is said to be Mr.
R. S. Hitchens	PERSON	. ''

		The Jewish Library , '' a series of monographs by em - inent scholars , is to bear the imprint of
Messrs. Mac - millan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Calumet , '' a new inter-university magazine , edited by Mr.
John Seymour Wood	PERSON	, will begin publica - tion in
December	DATE	.

		The
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	have in hand a reprint of
Withers	ORGANIZATION	's '' Chronicles of Border Warfare , '' to be edited by Mr.
Reuben G. Thwaites	PERSON	.

		Dr.
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	gave a public lecture in
Chicago	LOCATION	, at the
Central Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	, on the
evening	TIME	of
October 26	DATE	.

		He was greeted by a very large audience .

		The lecture dealt with his own literary experiences , and a few brief readings from his books were interspersed .

		A new translation of ''
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	'' is to be published soon by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translation is by Professor
Melville B. Anderson	PERSON	, head of the English department at
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, whose previous achievements as a translator justify the belief that this work will now become an English classic .

		Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	has been awarded damages to the extent of
$ 5000	MONEY	in her suit against the
New York	LOCATION	'' World '' for its unauthorized publication -LRB- from a stolen copy -RRB- of her '' Ode '' written for the opening of the Co - lumbian Exposition .

		We do not know whether or not the case is to be appealed , but if it is we trust that the higher courts will sustain so righteous a verdict .

		The ''
Hans Sachs Feier	PERSON	'' will be held at
Munich	LOCATION	on the fourth , fifth , and sixth of this month .

		The celebra - tion will open on the fourth with a new play by
Herr Martin Grief	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the fifth , being the poet 's four hun - dredth birthday , several of his '' Fastnachtsspiele '' will be performed in the same manner as they were four hundred years ago , but supplemented by preludes , in - terludes , and epilogues .

		The performance of
Wagner	PERSON	's '' Meistersjnger , '' on the sixth , will conclude the national festival .

		Professor
James Darmesteter	PERSON	, of the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	, died on the twentieth of
October	DATE	, at the age of forty-five .

		He was a distinguished Orientalist , and for nearly ten years past has held the chair of Persian lit - erature and language at the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	.

		He married , a few years ago ,
Miss A. Mary F. Robinson	PERSON	, the English poet .

		Early in the present year he added to his other duties the editorial conduct of the new '' Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		Professor
John Nichol	PERSON	died on the twelfth of
October	DATE	, at the age of sixty-one .

		He was particularly inter - ested in American subjects , and was one of our warm - est defenders at the time of the Civil War .

		He pub - lished a '' Sketch of American Literature '' some years ago , and also wrote the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' article upon that subject .

		He held the chair of En - glish literature at the
University of Glasgow	ORGANIZATION	for twenty - eight years .

		He also wrote the volumes on
Byron	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	in the '' English Men of Letters '' series .

		Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	has been making some very in - teresting inquiries into
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's connection with
Gloucestershire	LOCATION	, and is satisfied that the poet 's evident familiarity with that county is owing to his having staid at
Dursley	LOCATION	with one of the Shakespeares who was living there during his lifetime .

		The
Gloucestershire	ORGANIZATION	names of people mentioned by him are still largely represented in
Dursley	LOCATION	, and the descriptions of the neighborhood are so singularly accurate as to be easily identified .

		The Associated Press dispatches have recently sup - plied the newspapers with the following anecdote : '' All
London	LOCATION	has been laughing this week over the published correspondence between Mr.
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	and an Amer - ican lady .

		The latter wrote asking for an interview .


Gil	PERSON	- bert replied that his charge therefor would be twenty guineas .

		The lady replied that , while she could not go to that expense , she cheerfully looked forward to writ - ing his obituary for nothing .

		Thereupon the irascible humorist sent the correspondence to the ' Times ' with a very petulant letter , and the lady threatens to sue for libel . ''

		The widow of
Leconte de Lisle	ORGANIZATION	is preparing her late husband 's manuscripts for the press .

		She is working in collaboration with De He `` redia , and they hope to col - lect sufficient material for a volume of poems , which shall add to the reputation of the author of '' Poemes Barbares . ''

		The task is a difficult one , as the late poet was very critical about his own work , and they are anxious not to print anything which he would have re - fused to publish .

		Leconte de
Lisle	LOCATION	destroyed more than four thousand lines of verse which he deemed unsatis - factory , and what he published had been revised and revised again .

		The
London	LOCATION	''
Bookman	PERSON	, '' in its monthly reports of publications having the largest sale in
England	LOCATION	, often affords interesting indications of the drift of public taste .

		According to the
October	DATE	lists ,
East London	LOCATION	is still finding its favorite reading in '' If Christ came to
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' but the title has disappeared from all the other lists , although it occupied the first place in many of them a few weeks ago .

		Novels are just now the fav - orites , even in pious
Scotland	LOCATION	; and `` The Manxman '' heads eight lists out of fifteen . ''

		Perlycross '' is the next in favor -LRB- although
Glasgow	LOCATION	does sandwich it in be - tween '' Helps for Common Days '' and a '' Bible Dic - tionary '' -RRB- ; while '' Lourdes '' and '' Under the Red Robe '' follow at no great distance .

		We learn that the trustees of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	have called Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	, of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, to the vacant librarianship .

		They are to be congratulated upon their choice .

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	is a trained librarian and an accomplished man of letters , and
Chicago	LOCATION	will give him a cordial welcome .

		The following extract from the
San Francisco	LOCATION	''
Argonaut	ORGANIZATION	'' expresses the es - teem in which Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	is held upon the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		We notice a slight inaccuracy concerning the relations of the late Dr.
Poole	PERSON	to THE DIAL .

		While Dr.
Poole	PERSON	was second to none in our affections as a con - tributor , he was never editorially connected with the review .

		Says `` The Argonaut '' : '' It is stated , on apparently good authority , that the trustees of the great
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, in
Chicago	LOCATION	, have decided to come to
San Francisco	LOCATION	for a successor to the late librarian , Dr.
William Frederick Poole	PERSON	.

		The man whom they are said to have chosen is Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	, now at the head of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	Free Pub - lic Library .

		It is a great compliment to Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	.

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 The
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, although not an old one , is al - ready a notable institution , and is so liberally endowed that it is destined to be the largest library in this coun - try , if not one of the largest in the world .

		Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, its late librarian , was a scholar of ripe erudition , and a man of much experience in managing libraries .

		He was the compiler of the famous ''
Poole	PERSON	's Index to Period - ical Literature , '' an invaluable aid to writers and editors .

		He was also one of the editors of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, a literary journal of which
Chicago	LOCATION	may well be proud , something which can not be said of all her publications .

		It is Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's place which Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	is called upon to fill .

		We think he will fill it worthily .

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	is a gen - tleman of
New England	LOCATION	ancestry , of liberal education , with the tastes of a scholar , and the temperament of a poet .

		That he can retain this last in the prosaic envir - onment of
San Francisco	LOCATION	shows that it is ingrained .

		His love of letters is strong .

		He has made an excellent official in charge of our small library here on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, and he will make a better one in the larger sphere to which he is called .

		He will be more appreciated in
Chicago	LOCATION	than in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		When some San Fran - cisco millionaire leaves to the people such a magnificent endowment for a library as the late
James Newberry	PERSON	left to
Chicago	LOCATION	, men like Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	will doubtless think twice before they leave us , and the people will think twice before they let them go . ''

		IN MEMORIAM ,
EDWARD AUGUSTUS FREEMAN	PERSON	.

		Died at
Alicante	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
March 16 , 1892	DATE	.

		Called to his rest , though not on that loved strand That claimed his last life-labor , now denied Its high fulfilment , yet he sleeps beside Blue Mediterranean waters , in a land Of palms and columns , over-towered of old By that white rock whose sunlit bastions brought Light to his darkening eyes .

		For there , too , rolled Th ' '' eternal strife '' whose island-fields he sought From Mongibello to the wind-swept crest Of
Julian	PERSON	and Astarte .

		East and West , Thraldom and freedom , were to him no theme
Scholastic	ORGANIZATION	, but that mighty human heart , Outpouring words of thunder , still took part In each uprising , were it but a dream .

Nov. 1	DATE	, THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS EDITED BY < DR.
ALBERT SHAW	PERSON	.

		TN
January , 1890	DATE	, a new magazine , with a new idea in periodical literature , made its appearance * in
England	LOCATION	.

		Its name , the '' Review of Reviews , '' was suggestive of its purpose .

		Its aim was to give each month an epitome of current history and a summary of the world 's best thought .

		In a single year it reached a sale of more copies than all the rest of the English reviews combined .

		In
April , 1891	DATE	, an American edition , under the editorial management of Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	, was brought out .

		This American edition was not a reprint of the English magazine .

		On the other hand , it dealt largely with American matters and was edited with perfect independence in its own office .

		The success of the American edition has become an event in the history of periodical literature in this country .

		During the first year it surpassed , in circulation , the most popular of the old and established reviews and before the close of the second year it was in close competition with the leading illustrated magazines .

		The principle on which the '' Review of Reviews '' has been edited , is that a magazine , made bright , timely , and comprehensive in text and illustration , and immediately in sympathy with every movement of social progress , would be considered indispensable .

		This theory has been vindicated in the career of the '' Review of Reviews . ''

		The leaders in the religious and educa - tional worlds , the most prominent literary and professional men and women , have written to express their sense of the extraordinary ability and awakening power of this magazine .

PHILIP GILBERT HAMERTON	PERSON	.

		It was the fortune of the late Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	to achieve equal distinction in the art of liter - ature and the arts of design .

		Although his work as painter and etcher is not so well known in this country as his written work , it has re - ceived the warmest recognition in
Europe	LOCATION	, and given him honorable rank among the followers of the graphic arts .

		Carefully eschewing the methods by which artists of the baser sort seek for fame , and get at least notoriety , he quietly went his way , studied nature with loving assid - uity , mastered a great variety of technical pro- cesses , and produced in various mediums a long series of masterly works .

		His paintings were exhibited at the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	and elsewhere ; his delightful etchings have served to illustrate many volumes of no less delightful text .

		The thoroughness and sincerity of his methods are well shown by his accounts of `` A Painter 's Camp in the
Highlands	LOCATION	'' and of his canoe - voyage upon '' The Unknown River , '' while the evidence for these qualities is strengthened by the fact of his deliberate choice , after much reflection , of a permanent residence in one of the most picturesque regions of
Central France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's literary activity was ex - tremely varied ; so varied , indeed , and so un - tiring , that it caused a certain suspicion of the seriousness of his work as painter and etcher .

		In spite of the long line of witnesses to the contrary , from
Michel Angelo	PERSON	to
Rossetti	PERSON	, or even to Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	and Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	, there are some who will have it that the practitioner of both the graphic and the liter - ary art must be an amateur in at least one of the two .

		Undoubtedly , Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's great reputation as a writer has , with many , caused his reputation as a painter to be overshadowed , and , with some , subjected it to contemptuous attack .

		But those who have known him best are the most cordial in their recognition of his dual distinction .

		His published work falls into two groups that of the books directly con - nected with his study and practise of the fine arts , and that of the books addressed to the larger public which is made up of all cultivated persons .

		Let us glance briefly at the two lists .

		In the first category come the two books already mentioned , and about a dozen others .

		284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, The sumptuous works entitled '' Etching and Etchers , '' '' Landscape , '' '' Man in Art , '' and '' The Saone '' will first occur to the reader .

		And besides these there are the '' Thoughts about Art , '' '' Painting in
France	LOCATION	after the De - cline of Classicism , '' '' Contemporary French Art , '' `` The Etcher 's Hand - Book , '' `` The Graphic Arts , '' '' Imagination in Landscape Painting , '' `` Portfolio Papers , '' and a life of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is difficult to overestimate the value of the polished , scholarly , and sane art - criticism contained within this body of writings .

		It has not the startling quality of such work as Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's , and it sometimes approaches the commonplace ; but it is , as a whole , sym - pathetic , stimulating , and grateful .

		In this connection , we should note Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's work in periodical literature .

		He was for a time art-critic of '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' he contributed much to '' The Fine Arts Quar - terly Review , '' and was for many years the edi - tor of '' The Portfolio . ''

		As a producer of literature addressed to the general public , Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	made his first bid for fame with a volume of verse , `` The Isles of Loch Awe , '' published at the age of twenty-one .

		We owe to him three novels '' Wenderholme , '' ``
Harry Blount	PERSON	, '' and '' Mar - morne '' and a long series of volumes wherein we find description , reflection , and wise comment on man and nature , and a genial and catholic outlook upon life .

		The most widely popular of these volumes is '' The Intellectual Life , '' which was published a score of years ago , and has gone into numberless editions since . ''

		The Sylvan Year '' is science , art , and literature all combined ; it is one of the best of outdoor books . ''

		Chapters on Animals '' charmingly exhibits one aspect of his wide sympathies , and '' Hu - man Intercourse '' illustrates his many-sided nature . ''

		Modern Frenchmen '' is a series of five biographies , that of
Henri Regnault	PERSON	being perhaps the best . ''


Paris	LOCATION	in Old and Present Time '' is a semi-historical study , contrasting the past and the new with a fine sense of ar - tistic effect and significant social changes . ''

		Round My House '' is a description of rural life in the part of
France	LOCATION	chosen by the author for his home some thirty years ago , and is one of the most intimate studies of the sort in ex - istence .

		The latest of the miscellaneous vol - umes contains the series of papers entitled '' French and English . '' ''


Max O'Rell	PERSON	`` to take his authority for whatever it is worth has declared Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	to be the only for - eigner who has written intelligently of the con - ditions of French life .

		At all events , it would be difficult to surpass the minute observation , the delicate discrimination , and the real insight displayed by this volume .

		Any book that makes for the comity of nations deserves praise , and we should be particularly grateful for a book which , like this , helps to break down the prejudices and misunderstandings that give rise to an imperfectly veiled antagonism between the two races that seem destined to preserve their long-held leadership of the civilization of the world .

		The chief facts of Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's life may be briefly related .

		He was born
September 10 , 1834	DATE	, in
Lancashire	LOCATION	.

		Orphaned when a child , he was taken care of by an aunt who bestowed great pains upon his education .

		He fitted for
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, but , in the process , discovered a voca - tion for landscape painting , and , instead of go - ing to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, went to
London	LOCATION	, and entered the studio of Mr.
Pettill	PERSON	.

		In
1855	DATE	, after publishing his volume of youthful verse , he went to
Paris	LOCATION	for further study .

		Here he remained for some years , then returned to En - gland , and started the '' Painter 's Camp '' of which he has written so charmingly .

		At the age of twenty-four he married a French lady , Mad - emoiselle
Gindriez	PERSON	, the daughter of a well - known Republican statesman .

		After his mar - riage , he spent some time in
Scotland	LOCATION	, then lived for three years at Sens , painting indus - triously , then fixed his permanent residence at Pre Charmoy , near
Autun	LOCATION	.

		Here , with occa - sional outings , he has since lived , and here he died on the sixth of
November , 1894	DATE	, at the age of sixty .

		Those who would like a fuller account of his life are referred to THE DIAL for
December , 1884	DATE	.

		To that issue , the late
Horatio Nelson Powers	PERSON	, who knew him inti - mately , contributed a biographical sketch and study of character , based upon a full acquaint - ance with the facts , and inspired by the closest sympathy .

		We can not better bring this article to an end than by extracting from the study above mentioned some of its most interesting passages . ''

		Whatever science , observation , and actual practice can afford for an accurate judgment is at his command .

		He has lived with nature in the closest intimacy .

		He is familiar with the history of art , and with the methods of the great masters , so far as they are known .

		His mind is happily balanced and admirably constituted for the function of criticism .

		His sense of the beauti - ful is keen and cultivated , and the mood in which he lives is hospitable to truth of every kind ... He wisely directs his efforts in lines of production for which he has special aptitude , and he has the inde - pendence and courage that are inseparable from gifted
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 285 minds and influential utterance .

		His freedom from any - thing merely provincial , his delicate moral sensibility , the large and candid way in which he treats his subjects , are exceedingly agreeable to just-minded persons ; while the value of his matter , the rare beauty of his style , and the delightful spirit that pervades his work , enhance the enjoyment and deepen the gratitude of the reader .

		He has made solid and admirable contributions to our literature , and can rest assured that he has stimulated and nourished our better natures by his appeal to our nobler faculties and susceptibilities . ''

		THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE .

		The ideal History of English Literature , like the great American novel , is always to be written .

		Never until the Elizabethan age had vanished into the tur - moil and smoke of the Civil War did there exist materials for the writing of such a history .

		Shake - speare 's performance alone , however , was enough to make the thing possible and desirable , and con - sequently a large part of the chronicling and sifting of documents which in every case must precede the writing of a true history has been concerned with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name and works .

		The eighteenth century would have been a fitting time for the ac - complishment of this labor , were it not that the point of view of eighteenth century
England	LOCATION	, in re - spect of literature at least , was essentially provincial .

		Toward the end of the century a group of critics arose who began to have an understanding of what literature means ; and Dr.
Hurd	PERSON	, the Wartons , and Gray began to turn the attention of scholars and readers to the greater literature which lay beyond the confines of
England	LOCATION	in the '' Augustan '' age .

		Gray , as we learn from his prose remains , long en - tertained the idea of writing a history of English poetry , and had gathered considerable material for that purpose ; but hearing that
Thomas Warton	PERSON	had undertaken the task , he gave his notes into War - ton 's hands .

		For some purposes and for a certain period
Warton	PERSON	's history , especially in its modern form as edited and revised by a committee of schol - ars , still remains one of the best works that we have .

		But perhaps on the whole it was fortunate that no comprehensive and complete attempt at a history of English Literature was made during the eighteenth century .

		During the present century , and especially in this latter half of it , numerous flying shots at the mark have been tried .

		The skirmishing line has been sent farther out and the unexplored regions have been pretty well reconnoitred .

		The result is a con - siderable library of monographs , critical disquisi - tions , and short sketches , covering the entire field .

		One livre de fond
Taine 's History	ORGANIZATION	has appeared .

		Professor
Henry Morley	PERSON	compiled an extensive chronicle of English Writers ; and an accomplished critic Mr.
Stopf	PERSON	ord
Brooke	PERSON	has put forth the first volume of an ambitious and hopeful history .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's work is to be welcomed as an attempt to deal with the subject in a large and systematic way .

		It is a misfortune a misfortune not without some compensating advantages that with the exception of
Taine	PERSON	's volumes we have practically no thorough and rationalized treatment of the literature of our mother tongue considered as an organic whole .

		There has been theorizing in abundance , but no his - tory in the proper sense of the word .

		No writer of the calibre or accomplishment of
Gibbon	PERSON	, or
Grote	PERSON	, or Motley , or
Prescott	PERSON	, or
Parkman	PERSON	has appeared in the field .

		It is true that the task is more diffi - cult in many ways , and less attractive , than the writ - ing of political history .

		It is one thing to write the history of great men in the midst of great events : it is quite another to trace the history of the human mind as expressed in literature .

		Moreover , few ex - cept historians care to study the documents of po - litical history , while the documents of literary his - tory are in everybody 's hands .

		The historian of literature consequently is subjected to a much more variable criticism , and to the more vexatious in - quisition of subjective taste .

		Taine 's great work exemplified with peculiar bril - liancy a certain theory of the writing of literary his - tory .

		It was a study of literature as a document for history , and an interpretation of the mind of a race from its milieu and its essential tendencies .

		The theory seems to have gained few followers .

		Recent German and English writers , of whom Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	is in some sense a representative , while fixing their attention , like
M. Taine	PERSON	, on the fundamental characteristics and on the growth of the national mind , have not neglected the study of literature for its intrinsic value .

		A third method , which was hinted at by the late Professor
Minto	PERSON	in his u Manual of English Prose '' and in the '' Characteristics of English Poets , '' is to centre the interest upon the greatest writers in the national literature , studied not so much for what they have in common with one another and with the host of minor producers , but for what is characteristically theirs , the gift of genius and dower of fortune , for what they con - tribute to the world 's store of that '' Heavenly quintessence they still From their immortal flowers of poesy , Wherein , as in a mirror , we perceive The highest reaches of a human wit . ''

		The danger of a method like that of
Taine	PERSON	is to neglect in literature precisely that which gives to it its fundamental value for mankind .

		The danger of the German method is lack of method , the dissi - pation of attention over insignificant men and pe - riods -LRB- insignificant , that is , for the final compte rendu of literature -RRB- .

		Still , the antiquarian and scholar will not consent to forego much of such dissipation .

		The difficulty of the last method is to find among his - torians a wit of sufficient reach to compass it .

		But for the permanent uses of mankind a history at - tempted after this method is what is always needed , but seldom obtained .

		THE SAN FRANCISCO VIGILANTES AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		Touching your recent criticism of Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	's approval of the
San Francisco Vigilantes	LOCATION	, permit me to suggest that the stigma ordinarily attaching to lynch law does not fairly attach to the measures of that fa - mous committee .

		Lynch law is reprehensible in that it needlessly supersedes established law and usurps the office of regular tribunals , thus sanctioning the law - lessness it assumes to repress .

		In the absence of such law and tribunals the community resorts to summary methods of self-protection , for the same reason and with the same right that the individual knocks down the footpad in the absence of the police .

		It is the dernier ressort .

		Anyone who knows anything of the early history of
California	LOCATION	knows that , at the period alluded to by Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	, there were no regular and ef - ficient means for the administration of justice .

		It was the primitive regime of the strong hand ; and whether the hand of the outlaw or that of the bona fide settler were the stronger , had to be decided by the young so - ciety , and that quickly .

		On the appearance of the '' gold fever , '' desperadoes from all parts of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and from
Australia	LOCATION	, had swelled the tide of emigration to the coast ; and quiet citizens were literally at the mercy of thugs and cut-throats until the swift reprisals of the Vigilantes brought about inchoate law and order .

		Doctrinaire professors of absolute social ethics , who censure the rough-and-ready expedients to which the early Californians were driven in defence of their lives and homes , should remember that these expedients were born of grim and pressing necessity .

		Action not cogi - tation , speed not ceremony , was the essential order of the day in stormy
' 49	DATE	.

		If revolutions , as
Mirabeau	PERSON	said , '' are not made with rose-water , '' neither , one may add , are crude and turbulent communities controlled with it .


W. R. K.	PERSON
Pittsfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
Nov. 8 , 1894	DATE	.

		-LSB- Our correspondent 's illustration of an individual knocking down a footpad in the absence of the po - lice is a very good one .

		Nobody questions such right of self-protection , which is as strictly a legal as it is a natural right .

		But the individual , if he be also a good citizen , having knocked down his as - sailant , turns him over to the first policeman he can find , and if necessary aids the officer in making the arrest , instead of calling a party of friends to over - power the officer and hang his prisoner to the near - est lamp-post .

		The
San Francisco	LOCATION	Vigilantes began operations , not by knocking down footpads , but by breaking into the county jail and taking out pris - oners who were awaiting trial , and hanging them .

		The police power of the city , the sheriff and his posse , the governor and the judiciary , and even the state militia , all the regularly constituted author - ities of the city , county , and state , were forcibly resisted and defied .

		The answer of the Vigilantes that these officials were inefficient or corrupt , and the only way to get rid of them was to overthrow them vi et armis can hardly be accepted as suffi - cient .

		It is hard to understand why , if the good citizens of
San Francisco	LOCATION	were able to so outnumber and overwhelm the bad citizens by physical force , they should have thought themselves unable to de - feat them at the polls ; why the great zeal and energy expended by the Vigilantes in the '' summary methods of self - protection '' should not have been directed to the work of upholding and improving the machinery of the law .


San Francisco	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	was by no means an unorganized community , des - titute of established law or regular tribunals , as our correspondent assumes ; and one smiles to think of his distrusted '' doctrinaire professor '' in the per - son , say , of General
Sherman	PERSON	, who occupied an offi - cial position in
California	LOCATION	at that time , and whose very explicit testimony and very clearly expressed opinions on the Vigilantes and their work may be found in the recently-published Letters of
General	ORGANIZATION	and Senator
Sherman	PERSON	.

		We would not judge the Vigilantes harshly ; they were confronted by pecu - liar conditions and exasperations , and no doubt worked , as they believed , for the good of the com - munity .

		But we see no escape from the conclusion that they worked by wrong and extremely danger - ous methods , the evil effects of which have not yet wholly disappeared ; and no good can come from the glossing of their errors by historians like Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	and our correspondent who defends him .

		THE WORK OF PREPARATORY SCHOOLS IN ENGLISH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In THE DIAL of
October 16	DATE	, Professor
Clapp	PERSON	, of
Illi	PERSON	- nois College , suggests '' a series of papers setting forth the work done in teaching English at representative fitting-schools , '' as a possible explanation why '' very many of the students who come to college from prepar - atory schools are almost hopeless , so far as appreciating literature is concerned . ''

		I have no disposition to con - tribute to this presentation , or even to claim eligibility therefor ; but I wish to divert this invitation into a ground for reiterating some of the peculiar difficulties to which secondary schools must adjust themselves as the conditions of their existence , while colleges persist in evading the difficulties they are better situated for controlling : in this way I shall endeavor to emphasize the selfishness of the college attitude towards secondary schools and society at large .

		These difficulties of sec - ondary schools are less likely than ever to be compre - hended by the college instructor or the general critic , now that the very existence of any difficulties in the conduct of schools has been so successfully disguised by the great decemvirate ; and it is a public duty , as well as an honorable self-protection , for conscientious school - masters to present their side of the question .

		The proposed series would not give the explanation that Professor
Clapp	PERSON	seeks , because the inadequacies of these students in literary appreciation depend not so much on lack or poverty of methods as on lack and pov - erty of interesta lack fatal in any original or second - ary form of creative effort , under which head falls the instinctive criticism that begets appreciation .

		Such ap - preciation belongs to the maturity of college life and the sphere of electives : its proper atmosphere is not the school , already overburdened with graduated measures of Latin , Greek , mathematics , and the other weighed in -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 gradients of entrance-requisites , all of them -LRB- except the new English , vaguely and inconsistently apotheosized -RRB- enumerated in detail and ganged by the vagaries of ex - aminational convenience and vicissitude .

		Such appre - ciation might in a degree be prepared for in the home ; but a practical business and a practical scientific age , a society leisurely only for luxurious amusement , for vi - carious thought or vicarious sport , a generation with no sentiment but sensation , afford few such homes .

		On the other hand , if colleges are still dissatisfied with the tribute of helpless schools , quousque tandem ?

		Surely , appreciation is the one reservation a college profes - sor might be expected to demand for his own , for him - self and his specialty .

		Schools have long ago real - ized that all the teaching a boy gets is at school : must we now , while the friction of training still burns , expect him to exult in the discipline of coercion or restraint ?

		It is after the castigation that mothers teach they have been cruel to be kind : do colleges expect schools to de - range the steps of the process , when the college reserves to itself the name of Alma Mater ?

		The school can do no better than the lightning-rod man who sells to peo - ple that do not want to buy : the college must reconcile purchasers to their bargains , and lead them to detect unsuspected glories in their possessions .

		To secure appreciation of any study is given only to exceptional teachers and pupils in exceptional relations : even in the exact sciences , beginning with arithmetic , the theoretical discussion is always neglected in the hurry towards the '' answer '' ; in literature , whose aim as a study is not the organization and manipulation of enumerated details , but identity with a sense and a spirit , the lack of a practical nucleus is an almost over - powering difficulty , especially in an age that , in the face of library statistics , reads only for information , or diver - sion , or relief from thought .

		In teaching literature , the methods are few and old ; and the work of appreciation is not furthered by methods so much as by sympathy , to which few are susceptible .

		Interest can not be man - ufactured , and no way of inoculating pupils with gen - uine interest has yet been discovered : certainly , college professors have made no such discovery , for no class of instructors has had smaller influence on their pupils , as the pupils themselves testify .

		Moreover , in teaching English to English-speaking boys there is one special difficulty .

		Original work , in - volving grammatical and rhetorical facility , is hard work in any language ; in his own , as the boy already enjoys the practical advantage of speech , which appears to him the culmination of linguistic mastery , and as he does not find himself impelled towards written expression , he looks on required composition as arbitrary , and refuses his interest .

		Composition without interest , under such disciplinary conditions as the present age does not favor , can indeed be taught , but is not worth teaching .

		THE DIAL 'S recent series on the teaching of English at our colleges and universities has its value ; but it does not prove that , in this department more than in others , colleges hold themselves responsible for teach - ing as distinguished from furnishing opportunities for learning , which is a very different thing indeed .

		At this moment , the colleges , having suffered many things in dreams , because of English are going through various types of penitential spasms with the characteristic fervor of devotees .

		But if English is just now so all-important a matter , why have they been so long finding it out ?

		and , now that they have satisfied themselves of its im - portance , why do they not aid the schools toward de - termining the best practical procedure for attaining its proper position and proportions ?

		To follow
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	, and exclude all candidates who do not come up to their standard in English alone , is illog - ical , so long as not all college presidents can spell , and reports to college boards on English need not conform to the college 's own resident authority .

		To assign for compositions such subjects as
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has of late been giving shows absolute ignorance of the youth of to-day , their environment and the atmosphere they breathe , and what schools can make of them .

		Harvard 's examina - tions in English are perfunctory for a '' pass '' and almost exclusive for a '' credit . ''

		Yale 's examinations are rather in literature than in English .

		To make the writing of English an excluding condition for entrance is , in view of the lottery of examinations , a questionable strain of deglutition : to make the English examination a test of memory as to the contents of a few books is to lay the stress wrongly .

		To know , however well , the contents of a few books implies no sympathy with literature , which , in the wide access to electives , is more than likely to be ignored or pursued as a '' snap '' ; and , for a mere draft on the memory , history would be better from every point of view .

		If colleges would help the work that schools confess their inability to perform without projecting the gen - eral difficulties into the vantage-ground of the college , and if college professors would learn the duties and the functions of teaching and examining , then the situation would be somewhat improved .

		But it will not be en - tirely corrected until the times alter ; these are evil times for the work of education : the pound of flesh is hard enough to get , and the blood is almost certain to be all spilled before we get the weight .

		THE PROPOSED SOCIETY OF COMPARATIVE LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Whenever a new undertaking is proposed , it is well to have set before us its comical aspect .

		Rarely does a new idea , a new project , a new voyage of discovery offer itself for consideration without calling down the facetious disparagement of the conservers .

		The pro- posed Society of Comparative Literature is to be con - gratulated on having this almost ritualistic service performed for it by such a high priest of literature as Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- THE DIAL ,
Sept. 1	DATE	, p. 110 -RRB- .

		But , now that we have had our smile upon the seeming incongruities pointed out by Professor
Cook	PERSON	, is the project to be laid aside as unworthy of se - rious consideration ?

		Is the field of literature to be re - garded as essentially limited ; as '' a product of culture '' ; as an almost exclusively race affair ; as a '' corpus '' set off by itself and regulated by laws or '' canons of criti - cism '' which refuse to reveal themselves more clearly or to take on new and richer meanings when considered in their relations to more primitive modes of human expression ?

		However we may answer for ourselves such questions as these , however college policies may legislate , the fact remains that there are pioneers , '' spe - cialists '' if you like , who , acting in its deepest meaning
Bacon	PERSON	's well-worn apothegm , '' I take all knowledge to be my province , '' push out through the tangled wilder - ness , if need be into the very heart of savagedom , and at least register its pulsations .

		To establish communi - 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, cations with these individual workers ; to stimulate re - newed investigations ; to correlate the results ; to make these results common property ; to trace the evolution , to discover the laws of various literary types , with the end in view of putting the existing standards of literary judgment on a more secure and rational basis , these are some of the aims , as I understand them , suggested by Professor Gayley in his advocacy of a Society of Comparative Literature .

		Such an organization as this demands no defense or apology , but rather hearty welcome , and lively interest to know more of its purposes and plans .

		It is hardly fair to require that it demonstrate at the outset how its researches are going to affect favorably existing '' canons of literary criticism . ''

		That science works by faith and not by sight is , I presume , a trite idea .

		In the case before us the faith seems to be , that if these precious '' canons of criticism '' are to be kept from hardening into barren military rules , or from mouldering into form - less sentiment , they must be played upon , remodelled , reformed , and builded anew by intelligence working in the light of an ever-broadening outlook , in the light of the ideal university spirit .

		If the Dahomeans have an epic , by all means let us have it ; nor can we do with - out the lyrics of the
South Sea Islanders	LOCATION	; least of all can we spare the rich heritage of
Persia	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps , after all the material is collected , sorted , sifted , and set in order , so that its meaning can be plainly read , there will be some of the learned folk , who , sated for a time with the rich '' products of culture '' on exhibition in the white temples of reconstructed
Greece	LOCATION	and

		A personal experience has sometimes a lesson which requires us to share it with the brethren .

		Hinc illce la - crimce .

		To an acquaintance , editor of a great orthodox reli - gious weekly , I sent last
January	DATE	, by invitation , an essay , the result of several weeks ' labor .

		Under the circum - stances the retention of a fair copy seemed needless .

		A prompt reply from the reverend editor expressed doubts as to certain veiled allusions to certain ancient vices , which might disturb his innocent circle of readers .

		Upon this , unlimited use of the shears was straightway granted .

		After this , a great silence .

		At intervals of about a month , five or six inquiries were made .

		Stamps enough to send the paper around the world were forwarded .

		A '' reply postal card '' was tried , with a request pathetic as Catullus 's for '' Paulum quid libet allocutionis . ''

		I appealed , also , to the same high morality which had led the editor to protect his readers from any hint of an - tique wickedness .

		All in vain .

		No echo came back .

		Finally , in the present month , a metropolitan critic , who is also a professional '' protector of the poor '' au - thor , was retained , and moderately feed .

		He , among other efforts , made a personal appeal to the proprietor of the weekly .

		Finally ,
October 20	DATE	, came the thrice - prayed-for long-despaired-of essay , stript of its covers and quite forlorn .

		The accompanying letter was clever , considering all things : `` I neglected to answer your in - quiries , in constant expectation of coming across the article .

		... I have at last found it , after I had sup - posed that it was irrecoverably lost . ''

		And the moral ?

		Always keep your best copy ; and '' go into literature , '' especially in the direction here in - dicated , for amusement , if you choose , or from a sense of duty , or to cultivate the Christian virtues , but not in quest of cash or courtesy .

		A NEW VERSION OF AN OLD FAVORITE .

		-LRB- From the French of
Gustave Nadaud	PERSON	. -RRB-

		`` I 'm an old man ; I 'm sixty years ; I 've worked hard all my life , Yet never have gained my heart 's desire , With all my toil and strife .

		Ah , well I see that here below There is perfect joy for none ; My dearest wish is unfulfilled , I have never seen
Carcassonne	LOCATION	! ''

		The city lies almost in sight , Beyond the mountains blue ; But yet to reach it one must needs Five weary leagues pursue , And then , alas , the journey back !

		I know not how ` twere done : The ripening vintage fears the frost , I shall never see Carcassonne ! '' '

		T is said that in that favored place All days are holidays , With happy folks in robes of white Passing along the ways ; ' T is said there are castles there as grand As those of
Babylon	LOCATION	, And a Bishop and two Generals there , I shall never know

		The Vicar a hundred times is right , We are weak and foolish all ; And in his sermon he teaches us That ambition makes men fall ... But yet if I could somehow find Two days under

		but I would die content After having seen

		I ask thy pardon , gracious God , If my prayer offendeth Thee !

		We strive to peer beyond our sight , In age as in infancy ... My wife and son , they both have been As far as to
Narbonne	LOCATION	; My godson has seen
Perpignan	LOCATION	, And I 've never seen
Carcassonne	LOCATION	! ''

		An aged peasant thus complained , Bowed down with toil and care ; I said to him , '' Arise , my friend , Together we '11 go there . ''

		We set out on the morrow morn ; But our journey was scarce begun When the old man died upon the road , He had never seen

		THE DIAL 289 Ejje Nrfxr THE IJIFE AND WORK OF
EDISON	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Thomas A. Edison	PERSON	is so unique a figure in modern scientific and industrial affairs that the public is naturally eager for details of his wonderful career and character .

		The latest contribution to this store of information is made by Mr.
W. K. L. Dickson	PERSON	and Mr.
Antonia Dickson	PERSON	, in a large and handsome volume , with liberal illustrations .

		Barring a certain inflation of style , the work is a very satisfactory one full , graphic , and lucid in its technical descrip - tions .

		The authors , who have been for some years attaches of the
Edison	ORGANIZATION	works at Orange ,
N. J.	PERSON	, have had unusual facilities for securing full and accurate data , Mr.
Edison	PERSON	having him - self partly supervised the biographical portion of the work , besides aiding in the history and description of his chief inventions .

		The book is therefore to a certain extent autobiograph - ical , and it is likely to remain for some time the standard '' Life '' of the great inventor .

		Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's turn for invention and experi - ment showed itself early , his maiden essay in the line of telegraphy being made while he was still a newsboy on the
Port Huron Railway	ORGANIZATION	.

		It can not be said that the issue of this venture , in which he was joined by his friend
James Ward	PERSON	, was premonitory of the later Edisonian marvels .

		`` A line was constructed between the boys ' homes , consisting of an ordinary stovepipe wire , insulated with bottles , and crossed under a busy thoroughfare by means of an old cable rescued from the bed of the
Detroit	LOCATION	river .

		The first magnets were wound with wire , swathed in ancient rags , and a piece of
spring	DATE	brass formed the key .

		With a view to generating a current , and with a mind somewhat hazy on the score of static and dynamic electricity ,
Edison	ORGANIZATION	secured two Brobdingnaggian cats , with volcanic tempers , attached a wire to their legs , administered a violent amount of friction to their backs , and breathlessly awaited developments ... The fe - line mind , concentrated on personal grievances , refused to lend itself to science , and the test resulted in a frantic stampede , enlivened by whoops and splutters . ''

		Edison received his first regular lessons in telegraphy from Mr.
J. U. Mackenzie	PERSON	, a grate - ful station agent at Mt.
Clemens	PERSON	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, whose child 's life he had saved at the risk of his own .

		Touching his pupil 's progress , Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	testifies that '' at the expiration of three months he could teach me , and was quite eligible for the appointment -LRB- at
Port Huron	LOCATION	-RRB- * THE LIFE AND INVENTIONS OF THOMAS ALVA EDISON .

		which I secured for him at that time . ''

		The Port Huron position was held for just three months .

		The future '' Wizard of Menlo '' was , in fact , naturally something of a rolling stone ; and this trait , coupled with a marked talent for mischief , kept him revolving pretty rapidly from post to post , until his real abilities came to light .

		Leaving
Port Huron	LOCATION	, he drifted to
Stratford	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, whence -LRB- after a brief and erratic career -RRB- he returned to
Port Huron	LOCATION	, and soon distinguished himself by bringing his pro- fessional knowledge to bear on a novel set of conditions .

		The winter had been a hard one , and the enormous masses of ice which had formed in the river between
Port Huron	LOCATION	and
Sarnia	LOCATION	had made it impassable , besides cutting off telegraphic communication .

		The situation was serious , but
Edison	LOCATION	was equal to it . ''

		Jumping on a locomotive he sent the incisive whistle over the ice-bound waters to the rhythmic cadences of the
Morse	PERSON	alphabet Hello ,
Sarnia	LOCATION	;
Sarnia	LOCATION	, do you get what I say ? '

		No response from the Sarnian operator .

		Again and again the short and long toots shaped them - selves into the dots and dashes of telegraphy , until at last , while the spectators on the river bank quivered with pent-up excitement , the answer came , clear , cheery , and intelligible , and the connection between the two cities was resumed . ''

		Mr.
Edison	PERSON	had now become an expert oper - ator , and had thenceforth little difficulty in get - ting employment , but a good deal of difficulty in keeping it , his love of fun and experiment -LRB- especially the latter -RRB- usually getting him , sooner or later , into hot water with his chiefs .

		His conge from one office -LRB- the appointments of which he had partly ruined with sulphuric acid -RRB- was accompanied with the curt explana - tion that '' what they wanted was operators , and not experimenters . ''

		After the
Sarnia	LOCATION	ex - ploit , he filled in rapid succession positions at
Adrian	LOCATION	,
Indianapolis	LOCATION	,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	,
Memphis	LOCATION	,
Louisville	LOCATION	, and again at
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, signaliz - ing his sojourns and hastening his hegiras in the usual way ; and in
1868	DATE	he returned to
Port Huron	LOCATION	for a period of eighteen months , which brought him to his twenty-first year .

		At this time an ingenious telegraphic device of his was adopted by the
Grand Trunk Company	ORGANIZATION	, which -LRB- with the proverbial munificence of cor - porations -RRB- rewarded him with a free pass to
Boston	LOCATION	, where he found employment in the Franklin telegraph office .

		Mr.
Edison	PERSON	de - scribes his
Boston	LOCATION	advent with characteristic humor : '' My peculiar appearance caused much mirth , and , as I afterwards learnt , the night operators consulted to - gether how they might put up a job on the jay from the woolly West . '

		I was given a pen and assigned the 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	,
New York	LOCATION	No. 1 wire ... the conspirators having arranged to have one of the fastest senders in
New York	LOCATION	send the despatch and ' salt ' the new man .

		... I had long since perfected myself in a simple and very rapid style of handwriting susceptible of being increased from forty-five to fifty-four words a minute .

		This was sev - eral words faster than any operator in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Soon the
New York	LOCATION	man increased his speed , to which I easily adapted my pace .

		This put my rival on his mettle , and he put on his best powers , which , however , were soon reached .

		At this point I happened to look up , and saw the operators all looking over my shoulder , with their faces shining with fun and excitement .

		I knew then that they were trying to ' put up a job ' on me , but kept my own counsel and went on placidly with my work , even sharpening my pencil at intervals , by way of extra aggravation .

		The
New York	LOCATION	man then commenced to slur over his words , running them together and sticking the signals ; but I had been used to this style of tel - egraphy and was not in the least discomfited .

		Finally , when I thought the fun had gone far enough , I quietly opened the key and remarked , Say , young man , change off and send with your other foot ! '

		This broke the
New York	LOCATION	man all up , and he turned the job over to another man to finish . ''

		It is needless to say that '' the jay from the woolly West '' at once took his place as an es - teemed member of the Franklin fraternity .

		Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's first patented invention was a vote recorder , exclusive rights on which were obtained in
1869	DATE	; and from that time on his marvels have followed each other as regularly and surprisingly as the objects fall from the juggler 's hat .

		Capital , once aware of his tal - ents , was not slow to exploit them .

		In
1872	DATE	a committee of the Gold and
Stock Telegraph Company	ORGANIZATION	waited on him to negotiate for the rights to his numerous stock printers and kin - dred appliances .

		His dealings with this body are best told in his own words : '' I had made up my mind that five thousand dollars would be about right , but rather than not sell the in - ventions , I would take anything , no matter what , as I needed money sorely for my further experiments .

		With these dazzling expectations I received the committee . '

		Well , Mr.
Edison	PERSON	, ' said one of the members , ' how much do you want for your devices ? ' '

		I do not know what they are worth , ' I replied , make me an offer . '

		< Well , continued the speaker , ' how would forty thousand dol - lars strike you ? '

		I believe I could have been knocked down with the traditional feather , so astonished was I at the sum . ''

		In
1873	DATE	Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's services were formally retained by the
Western Union	ORGANIZATION	and
Gold Stock Companies	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Edison Laboratory and Factory	ORGANIZATION	, the precursor of the great plants at
Menlo Park	LOCATION	and Orange , was opened .

		The fiscal regime of the new establishment was , to say the least , peculiar , though quite character - istic of the director .

		Says Mr.
Edison	PERSON	: `` I kept only pay-roll accounts , no other kind ; pre - served the bills and generally gave notes in payment .

		The first intimation that a note was due was the protest , after which I had to hustle around and raise the money .

		This saved the humbuggery of bookkeeping , which I never understood , and the arrangement had besides the advantage of being cheaper , as the protest fees were only one dollar and
fifty cents	MONEY	. ''

		The workshop methods were as irregular as the fiscal ones , and must have resulted in hope - less anarchy but for the spirit of good-fellow - ship and cooperation that prevailed .

		Mr.
Edi	PERSON	- son was the friend of his men and their co - worker , and they appreciated the fact as men always do .

		A strike at the works was a moral impossibility , and the only '' labor question '' was the normal one how to make labor arrive quickest at the best results . ''

		We had , '' says Mr.
Edison	PERSON	, '' no fixed hours , but the men , so far from objecting to the irregularity , often begged to be allowed to return and complete certain experiments upon which they knew my heart was set . ''

		His boyish love of fun was not quenched by his growing fame and responsibil - ities .

		There were times when his joyous nature fairly bubbled over , sweeping all decorum be - fore it in a tide of hilarity .

		The great plant at
Menlo Park	LOCATION	was the re - sult partly of the demand for increased manu - facturing facilities , partly of the modest inven - tor 's desire to escape the visitors who thronged the
Newark	LOCATION	laboratory . ''

		When the public tracks me out here , '' remarked Mr.
Edison	PERSON	, '' I shall simply have to take to the woods . ''

		The new establishment was equipped to the point of luxury , its appointments including a costly scientific library and a pipe organ , the latter being brought into play `` whenever , in Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's opinion , music 's magic strains were needed to soothe the savage breasts of his em - ployees . ''

		The report of the '' Wizard of Menlo Park '' soon overran the world ; the wildest tales of his achievements , habits , business re - lations , finding ready credence .

		An article in the
Paris	LOCATION	`` Figaro , '' in
1878	DATE	, headed `` Cet etonnant Eddison '' is worth quoting . ''

		M. Eddison 's '' latest invention , the a5rophone , is thus lucidly outlined , and the inventor himself described as he appears to the imagination of a Frenchman : '' It is a steam machine which carries the voice a dis - tance of eight kilometres .

		You speak in the jet of va - por ; a friend previously warned understands readily words at a distance of two leagues .

		Let us add that the friend can answer you by the same method ... It should be understood that
M. Eddison	PERSON	does not be - long to himself ; he is the property of the telegraph company , which lodges him in
New York	LOCATION	at a superb hotel , keeps him on a luxurious footing and pays him a formidable salary , so as to be the one to know of and

		THE DIAL 291 profit by his discoveries .

		The company has , in the dwell - ing of
Eddison	LOCATION	, men in its employ who do not quit him for a moment , at the table , in the street , in the labora - tory .

		So that this wretched man , watched as never was a malefactor , can not give a second 's thought to his per - sonal affairs without one of his guards saying : '
M. Eddison	PERSON	, a quoi pensez-vous ? '

		> : That most fascinating of Edisonian wonders , the phonograph , owed its inception partly to ac - cident ; and it is interesting to note how slight a spark could fire the train of the inventor 's constructive fancy .

		Says Mr.
Edison	PERSON	: '' I discovered the principle by the merest accident .

		I was singing to the mouth-piece of a telephone , when the vibrations of the voice sent the fine steel point into my finger .

		That set me to thinking .

		If I could record the actions of the point and send the point over the same surface afterward , I saw no reason why the thing would not talk .

		I tried the experiment first on a strip of tel - egraph paper , and found that the point made an alpha - bet .

		I shouted the words < Halloo !

		Halloo ! '

		into the mouth-piece , ran the paper back over the steel point , and heard a faint ' Halloo !

		Halloo ! '

		in return .

		I de - termined to make a machine that would work accurately , and gave my assistants instructions , telling them what I had discovered .

		They laughed at me .

		That 's the whole story .

		The phonograph is the result of the prick - ing of a finger . ''

		The phonograph took the Old World by storm .

		At the French Exposition of
1889	DATE	, 30,000 people daily visited the phonograph de - partment no nationality , from the impassive Turk to the excitable
Gaul	PERSON	, resisting the temp - tation of hearing its tones reproduced . ''

		Never before was such a collection of the languages of the whole world made .

		It was the first lin - guistic concourse since Babel times . ''

		During the
Handel Festival	ORGANIZATION	of the same year , the most striking phonographic results were achieved a gigantic horn placed in the concert room gathering to the ear of the instrument the com - poser 's harmonies , in the several vocal and in - strumental settings . ''

		Four thousand voices , a thunderous organ , and a mammoth orchestra , combined in the exposition of Han - del 's '
Israel	LOCATION	in
Egypt	LOCATION	, ' and this Titanic volume of sound , with its finer contrasts of light and shade , was reproduced by the phonograph in a manner little short of the mirac - ulous . ''

		The name of Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's inventions is le - gion .

		He has wrought in a year more marvels than were feigned or dreamed of in the Rosi - crucian philosophy ; but he might , one would think , safely rest his fame on this instrument alone , which stores for all time all accents , from the notes of '' Music 's golden tongue '' to the drone of the curtain lecture , out-Boswelling
Boswell	PERSON	's literalness , and conjuring back at our bidding from the undiscovered country '' the sound of a voice that is still . ''

		SOME BOOKS ABOUT BIRDS .

		* The beautiful denizens of the bird - world must at last be coming into their right of recogni - tion , judging from the books about them which are accumulating .

		We have at once four earn - est writers , men of gifts and culture , giving their loving thought and the fruit of their care - fully-gained knowledge to the portrayal of the character and charms of the '' winged-folk in feathers , '' '' our little brothers in the air , '' who have shared our planet with us for many ages and received little or no appreciative attention .

		In this stage of the earth 's existence , three groups of animals are in the ascendant : human beings , birds , and insects .

		It is the period of their culmination , all other races having passed their noontide in a previous aeon , and now be - ing in a condition of decline the afternoon or evening of their span of life .

		We have a number of admirable text-books upon ornithology , suited to the student 's needs , but they are too costly and technical for the popular reader .

		Just what to recommend to such , as a manual that will help him best to an acquaintance with our common birds , has been a puzzle .

		Among the books in the quartet now before us is one which goes far toward supply - ing the long-felt want .

		It is entitled `` The Birds About Us , '' and is written by Dr.
Charles Conrad Abbott	PERSON	.

		The author is widely known as a faithful investigator in various fields of natural science , and as a contributor of acknowl - edged value to the department of ornithology .

		His present work is a compend of the history of the different families of North American birds , a brief review of their respective distinguishing traits , with plentiful illustrations of individual characteristics .

		The style is pleasing , the in - formation very considerable and systematically presented .

		The plates and wood-cuts with which the book abounds deserve especial commenda - tion .

		The plates are all remarkably truthful , as though taken by a '' snap shot . ''

		The en - gravings in the text are equally excellent , the whole together lending much worth to the book , and not , as is generally the fact , forcing it above a moderate price .

		An essay by Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	is always a piece of fine art .

		The writer has something to say when he takes pen in hand , and he says it in the most exquisite manner .

		The ten papers included in '' A
Florida	LOCATION	Sketch Book '' con - tain the observations which this enchanting scientist and philosopher gathered up during a few weeks ' sojourn in our south-eastern penin - sula .

		It was in the season when our migrating birds are preparing for their annual flight north - ward , and all animal and vegetable life feels the quickening influence of
Spring	DATE	.

		Mr.
Tor	PERSON	- rey wandered from point to point in the same quiet , easy fashion in which he writes , appar - ently aimless and indifferent , really eager and intent , and in every contact with man and bird and beast , in every scene and event in nature , reaping a harvest of impressive reflections .

		One cares not for the sum of positive knowledge Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	communicates , be it much or little .

		It is his quaint method of selecting and vivify - ing it that proves the charm and renders him an ever engaging and exhilarating companion .

		One passage , the farewell of the volume , so per - fectly represents the man , and his style , which is an integral part of him , that we give it as bet - ter than any possible words of critical analysis : '' My holiday was done .

		For the last time , perhaps , I listened to the mocking-bird and the cardinal , as by and by , when the grand holiday is over , I shall listen to my last wood-thrush and my last bluebird .

		But what then ?


Florida	LOCATION	fields are still bright , and neither mock - ing-bird nor cardinal knows aught of my absence .

		And so it will be , ' When you and I behind the veil are past , Oh , but the long , long while the World shall last . '

		None the less , it is good to have lived one day and taken our peep at the mighty show .

		Ten thousand things we may have fretted ourselves about , uselessly or worse .

		But to have lived in the sun , to have loved natural beauty , to have felt the majesty of trees , to have enjoyed the sweetness of flowers and the music of birds , so much , at least , is not vanity nor vexation of spirit . ''

		We take regretful leave of one of the prom - ising band of young American ornithologists in the posthumous volume '' From Blomidon to Smoky , '' by Mr.
Frank Bolles	PERSON	.

		It is a col - lection of thirteen sketches outlining the work of the naturalist in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, among the
White Mountains	LOCATION	, and at the author 's home in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		It is an honorable monument to his memory ; none can view it without respect for the honest and painstaking and persistent qualities it commemorates .

		The articles on the woodpeckers and the owls are particularly im - portant , containing as they do a large number of original and interesting notes on curious and striking members of the bird family .

		Mr.
Bolles	PERSON	made prolonged studies of these species under peculiarly favorable conditions , both in their native haunts and in captivity .

		While so doing he made use of the capital traits of a naturalist ingenuity , fidelity , and patience .

		The capacity for apprehending the great in the little , for bestowing upon minute and weari - some detail the care necessary for the achieve - ment of serviceable results , commands admir - ing respect .

		To watch in vigilant stillness , hour after hour and day by day , the rnano3uvres of a bird , for the sake of establishing some new faculty or habitude interesting to science , is to evince abilities of a high order .

		It was by such steadfast perseverance that
Audubon	PERSON	won his fame , and it is for the same that Mr.
Bolles	PERSON	will be gratefully remembered .

		In all his ob - servations he recorded the significant incidents , however trivial , and thus was enabled to add to our previous knowledge a mass of novel cer - tified facts regarding humming-birds , swifts , and a bevy of species besides the various ham - merers and hunters wrapped in the feathers of the woodpecker and the owl .

		The special region included in `` Bird Land , '' by Mr.
Leander S. Keyser	PERSON	, lies in and around
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		It offers a populous hunt - ing-ground for the bird-lover , and was dili - gently searched in all times and seasons by this representative of an odd but most attractive genus .

		Carlyle says , '' We are all poets when we read a poem well . ''

		So we are all touched with a fine enthusiasm which turns our speech straightway to song when we have opened our hearts to the beauty of the birds .

		Mr.
Keyser	PERSON	is one of the transported ones , and the sweetness and gentleness of human nature come forth in his talks about the wonder and the enchant - ment of the creatures which walk as well as we do , and fly as we never can , and sing with a wild ecstatic rapture we can not hope to rival .

		If only the great world could know what hap - piness the naturalist gains from a quiet ramble along country roadways , through the fields and over the hills , at how little expense his heart is set throbbing with delight , in what simple , in - nocent ways he is able to gather hordes of bliss - ful memories with which to solace a lifetime , and meanwhile , what a store of health and strength he amasses , without care or afore - thought , all men and women would hasten to learn of him the secret charm of his pastime which gives so liberally and exacts so little .

England	LOCATION	meet at their shire stones on Wraynose Pass , known as the Lake Dis - trict .

		Whoever here surrenders himself to his imagination can never be alone or unsolaced .

		He is in company not only with mountains but with men .

		Clever Lord
Jef	PERSON	- frey , with his knack at naming things and his reluctance to recognize new merit , first bestowed the name '' Lake Poets , '' and a less-known epi - grammist explained it : '' They lived in the Lakes : an appropriate quarter For poems diluted with plenty of water . ''

		The world long since rebelled against the judgments of the critical autocrats of the ''
Edin	PERSON	- burgh Review , '' but the name has proved suffi - ciently convenient for perpetuation as a distinc - tive and distinguished title .

		Now we have a work by the Rev.
H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	, written for the ex - press purpose of embalming the '' Literary As - sociations of the English Lakes , '' and of adding facts to our fancies of how these men lived and labored amid these chosen scenes .

		There are two volumes .

Greta Hall	PERSON	, occupying a portion of it only .

		To him
Wordsworth	PERSON	mentioned a friend of his , a man of great learning and a poet , with whom he had travelled in

Jackson	PERSON	, with his love of '' beuk lam - ing , '' was glad to accept the stranger as tenant , or part tenant .

		Although he had had another offer at double the amount that
Wordsworth	PERSON	's friend could afford to pay , brains won the day with
Jackson	PERSON	, and
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	came to share the double house with its builder , and to be told , when the first half year 's rent was due , '' No , no , Mr.

		The exceeding beauty of
Greta Hall	PERSON	and its surroundings had much to do with his brief reawakening , when , '' with his poetic powers no longer in a state of suspended animation , '' he determined to dedi - cate himself anew to writing verse and helping his fellow-men .

		Three years later , on
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's repeated invitations , came
Robert Southey	PERSON	with his wife ,
Edith	PERSON	, a sister of Mrs.
Coleridge	PERSON	, to share the roomy house .

		An interesting household it was in that first season -LRB- 1803 -RRB- , at what
Southey	PERSON	called jocularly '' The Ant Hill . ''

		Besides the Coleridges and Southeys and
Aunt Lowell	PERSON	and the
Jacksons	LOCATION	, there was
Southey	PERSON	's beloved dog Dapper ,
Jackson	PERSON	's dog Cupid , a '' noble jack - ass '' which the children rode , cats galore
Bianchi	PERSON	,
Pulcheria	LOCATION	, Othello , the
Zombi	LOCATION	, and the humble retainers ,
Nurse Wilsey	ORGANIZATION	and
Betty Thompson	PERSON	, whose affection and long service to her master are inscribed on the
Laureate	ORGANIZATION	's tombstone .

		But the ever-restless
Coleridge	PERSON	soon disappeared from the scene .

		Full of imaginary aches and pains , and some real ones his mind as restless as if it had
St. Vitus	LOCATION	's dance , eter - nal activity without action , miserable about trifles and a prey to hypochondria , poor pro- crastinating
Coleridge	PERSON	in the following year packed off to
Malta	LOCATION	for his health , returning 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, after two years to
England	LOCATION	, but never again to
Keswick	PERSON	except for a short time .

		Henceforth
Southey	PERSON	cared not only for his own family , but he took upon himself also the charge of
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's deserted wife and three fatherless chil - dren .

		Coleridge 's curious bewilderment of the moral sense was as puzzling to his friends and relatives as it is to posterity ; and there is some - thing very touching in the way in which
Southey	PERSON	, with all his regret for
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's failings , never failed to fulfil the trust those failings imposed on him .

		In these early days of acquaintance , Words - worth and
Southey	PERSON	did not take to each other as much as one would have expected .

		But in later years , when sorrow had come to both , common experience and agreement on matters social and political drew them together .

		In the end , each came to admire the other 's powers greatly . ''

		A greater poet than
Wordsworth	PERSON	there never has been , nor ever will be , '' wrote
Southey	PERSON	; and it was
Wordsworth	PERSON	who was se - lected to write the fitting epitaph for
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's tomb when he was buried in Crosthwaite church among the scenes which he had loved so well .

		Of the four homes of
Wordsworth	PERSON	in these dales ,
Rydal Mount	LOCATION	was the last and most be - loved .

		Hither he came , driven forth by domes - tic sorrow from the old
Grasmere Rectory	ORGANIZATION	in the year
1813	DATE	, and here he continued to live until his death ,
thirty-seven years later	DATE	.

		Little understood by his neighbors as a poet , he was yet a figure-head among men , honored for his uprightness and integrity , his simplicity , kind - ness , and piety , and was looked upon as a man of practical judgment in all that concerned home affairs in the dale .

		A worthy '' volunteer , '' a trusted justice of the peace , the pattern of high thinking and plain living , he set a kind of moral tonic for the whole district .

		As for his poetry , it was '' aw reet eneuf , but queer stuff , varra , '' to these simple folk ; and they hardly believed that when the fit of making it was on ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	was in his right mind .

		They heard him '' bummin ' away , '' they saw his '' jaws agoain t ' whoale time , '' they thought of him as possessed , and would say , '' Aw yes , I darsay he 's quite sensible , whiles , if ya nobbut catch him reet he '11 talk as plaain as oyder you or me '' ; and they were to be pardoned if they looked on his periodical poetry-making on the public highway as periodical fits of mania .

		It was '' Mr.
Wordsworth	PERSON	stamp-maister , him o ' Rydal , '' not
Wordsworth Poet-Laureate	PERSON	, whom they knew .

		Indeed , one yeoman , who went some miles out of his way to attend a political gathering , attracted by the announcement that the Poet-Laureate would address the meeting , was heard to say , ''
Schaff	PERSON	on it , it 's nobbut old
Wordsworth	PERSON	o ' Rydal efter aw ! ''

		and he left the meeting in high dudgeon .

		Mr.
Rawnsley	PERSON	's volumes are full of interest - ing materials , gathered with much diligence from original sources , with footnotes of refer - ence thereto ; and there is an excellent map of the whole region at the close of Volume I. Beside the notable figures of the Lake Poets themselves , many others scarcely less distin - guished appear who at one time or another have had some associations with the country .

		Among these are the modern names of
Tenny	PERSON	- son ,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		The chief defect of the work is that it leaves an impression of scrappiness , owing partly to the somewhat obscure and rambling style of the author 's expression and partly to his disjointed arrangement of subjects .

		There is in it a lack of that unity and wholeness which should char - acterize a work of such length , importance , and intrinsic charm .

		THE ENLARGEMENT OF FAITH .

		* There is nothing more striking , in our group of recent books on religious themes , than the manifold forms faith assumes in them .

		With one , it is a mys - tical impulse ; with another , an historic force ; with a third , a philosophical development ; but in them all it declares itself as a primary power among men , in whose just apprehension the highest wisdom of the world is to be found .

		THE DIAL 295 of which he is a member .

		The New Church was the first to organize its subordinate congress .

		The volume entitled `` The
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	in the World 's Religious Congresses , '' edited by the Rev.
L. P. Mercer	PERSON	, is chiefly made up of the papers prepared for this special congress .

		These papers discuss at length the origin and nature of the New Church , its doctrines , its planting , its future , and the work of women in it .

		The special feature of the
New Church	ORGANIZATION	is its belief in the second coming of
Christ	LOCATION	; not in person , but as an `` unfolding of the spiritual sense of his Holy Word , '' whose literal sense was given in his first coming .

		This second coming , or new unfolding , has been achieved in the works of
Emanuel Swedenborg	ORGANIZATION	.

		This starting-point gives oc - casion for high spirituality united to much mysticism .

		The ruling conception and force are of a transcen - dental character .

		There is in the New Church a segregation of spiritual power that simply laughs at naturalism and secularism .

		Among the forces at work in the human mind this is by no means least significant .

		It offers itself as a sporadic , but not an antiquated , impulse . ''

		The Scheme of Christianity '' is an earnest and scriptural discussion of the dogmas of faith .

		It ad - heres very closely to historic orthodoxy , attaching implicit faith to the sacred narrative .

		In its inter - pretation of the Scriptures , however , it is ethical and rational rather than conventional , and carries on an independent and earnest inquiry into their spirit and force .

		The point of most prominence , and of present interest , is that of discipleship .

		The author holds that the searching commands of Christ in reference to self-denial were directed to the dis - ciples ; were a regimen for the training of lead - ers , and were not laid upon the average believer .

		This view the author enforces extendedly and thor - oughly .

		The discussion touches a point of much practical moment the tendency to accept theoret - ically the words of Christ , and still , in the use we make of them , to rob them of practical significance .

		The book , by virtue of its earnest temper , its as - sumed faith , its intelligibility and independence , will be found interesting and instructive to those who are travelling , with diligent inquiry and without much digression , the road of Biblical belief .

		`` The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ '' is a brief volume of four nearly equal parts : the Introduc - tion , by
Virchand R. Gandhi	PERSON	; '' The Journey to Thibet , by
M. Notovitch	PERSON	; a translation of the An - cient Manuscript narrating the life of
Christ	LOCATION	; and a Summary .

		The manuscript on which the other parts hinge opens with a general sketch of the his - tory of the People of
Israel	LOCATION	and of the birth of Christ ; his journey in the
East	LOCATION	between the ages of fourteen and twenty-nine years ; his preaching in
India	LOCATION	, and his crucifixion .

		The narrative of the events which lead to his crucifixion is quite differ - ent from that of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The words of Christ which the manuscript contains are chiefly his instructions in the
East	LOCATION	.

		They are elevated in tone , but lack almost wholly the simplicity of his precepts as given in the Gospels , and the close asso - ciation of his teachings with the events of life .

		There is very little in the volume to call out belief . ''

		The Life and Teachings of Jesus '' is a work aiming at a purpose which occupies many earnest minds , and is the predominant religious impulse of not a few .

		One of the objects of the work is `` to show that , after all that an unsparing criticism can say , the religious value of the
Bible	ORGANIZATION	still remains , and that it speaks to the present generation with a power which , under the old conceptions , it could never hope to have '' -LRB- page 6 -RRB- . ''

		What I have had in mind particularly to do was to bring the results of a careful criticism of the Gospels to bear upon the words attributed to Jesus , and to bring together into a consistent picture whatever this test may have left untouched '' -LRB- p. 14 -RRB- .

		The method in which this end is pursued is sufficiently indicated by the fact that the author does not accept miracles , and '' insists that the statements of the Bible are to be accepted or rejected on just the same degree of probability or improbability which would govern us anywhere else '' -LRB- p. 7 -RRB- .

		The work is able , and evinces an admirable and a spiritual temper .

		The first half of the book is occupied with the Gospel narrative , and the last half with the life and teach - ings of Jesus .

		The earlier half is historically crit - ical ; the later constructive .

		As the author wholly rejects miracles , his criticism is necessarily very ag - gressive and destructive , but it is penetrating and candid .

		We find ourselves slow to accept the con - clusions of a process so essentially a priori and whose clues of guidance are often so slight .

		It has , however , this one most important result : it pulls down that scaffolding of dogma and of ready appeal to supernaturalism which has so long obscured the beauty and symmetry of the true spiritual building which has slowly gone up within them .

		We are best pleased with the second part , which goes very far to show how little has been really lost , and how much has been truly gained , by the sifting and waste of the earlier portion .

		The book is not un - like in temper to the '' Natural History of the
Chris	PERSON	- tian Religion , '' by Dr.
William Mackintosh	PERSON	, which was lately noticed in THE DIAL -LRB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, p. 157 -RRB- .

		The two works are quite diverse in method and de - tail ; but the general drift of their conclusions , and the motive which prompts them , are the same .

		Both are thoroughly instructive .

		The supernatural cer - tainly needs correction as an idea , and in the serv - ice we assign it ; but those who hunt it down so vig - orously hardly seem to understand whither they are going .

		If the miracle is incredible , so is the answer to prayer .

		If prayer fail us , the crowning words of Christian Revelation fail us also , '' Our Father who art in Heaven . '' ''

		The Johannine Theology '' is a book carefully wrought out within the limits of liberal orthodoxy .

		It discusses , in a dozen directions , the phases of doctrine which belong to the Gospel and to the 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Epistles of
John	PERSON	.

		The work is done in a scholarly , penetrative , and thorough method .

		Some of the topics are : '' The Idea of God in the Writings of
John	PERSON	, the Doctrine of the Logos '' ; '' The Union of the Son and Father '' ; '' The Doctrine of Sin '' ; The Work of Salvation '' ; '' The Doctrine of the
Holy Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, of Love , of Prayer , of Eternal Life . ''

		An inquiry of this sort , which accepts the full weight of Scriptural authority , has its advantages and its disadvantages .

		It tends to thorough and minute investigation .

		Nothing is to be passed lightly .

		But it is also liable to feel too strongly the need of rec - onciling all discrepancies , and to embarrass itself unnecessarily by any refractory material .

		Truth as truth loves scope and wide rendering .

		The author is not only liberal in his creed , he lays the founda - tion of his exegesis in ethical doctrinal construction .

		The writings of
St. John	ORGANIZATION	yield themselves fully to this tendency .

		Under the doctrine of Love the au - thor finds in the statements of John that which pre - cludes any other than a redemptive , a spiritually constructive , administration of the world .

		The feel - ing that justice is supreme with God , that the exer - cise of his love is optional , that he may well enough hate the sinner , arises from a technical definition and idea of sin formed with the general intention of making it more dreadful that do not at all correspond with the facts of life .

		Man is interpreted by theology , not theology by man . ''

		The Claims of Christianity '' is a book like a sally from a beseiged fort thrust boldly forth from a body of believers thoroughly self-centred and ag - gressive , but also widely beleaguered by unsympa - thetic and hostile sentiment .

		Its author is a clear and vigorous writer who knows what he wants to say and says it without hesitation .

		It is a pleasure to come in contact with such a mind , and pleasant to meet it in the defense of old things the history of the world as so far achieved .

		The claims of the work are that Christianity is '' the sole and sufficient oracle of divine truth , '' and that it forms a `` polity perfect and complete in itself . ''

		This polity is of course the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		These claims are first enforced chiefly on the external side against Buddhism and Islam , and then as against the Ren - aissance and Reformation .

		The Middle Ages are dwelt on as laying securely the foundations of this universal polity .

		How little soever one may accept the final conclusions of the author , it is well , espe - cially in our day when we so much magnify the things that are nearest us , to listen to one who stands within the shadow of events which contain the significance of millenniums .

		When one comes in contact with
Newman	PERSON	,
Ward	PERSON	,
Lilly	PERSON	, the question is , what the fulfilling of the law and the prophets means .

		Is it a literal or a spiritual fulfilment ?

		The two volumes of '' The Philosophy and De - velopment of Religion '' are in every way inviting books .

		The form and print are excellent .

		The author 's style is vigorous and clear ; the subject is comprehensively and thoroughly discussed .

		The topic , being treated in lectures , has none of the dry - ness of details .

		The first volume rests chiefly on philosophical principles , and some will find it peculiarly acceptable .

		It considers the nature of religion in its relation to the world and man . ''

		Re - ligion , as well as science and art , morals and law , is a constitutive element of human nature , and there - fore may pass through the most manifold develop - ments , but can never cease as long as there are men '' -LRB- p. 99 -RRB- .

		It strives to frame a conception which shall overcome the constant collision between the natural and the supernatural , an effort which we desire especially to commend .

		While it does not complete itself in a just recognition of the supernat - ural , it does a good deal of work in preparation for it .

		The second volume discusses Christian faith as it offers itself in the New Testament and in the phases it has since passed through .

		The author , in this discussion , gives free range to historical criti - cism , but he unites with it an eager insight into spiritual truth .

		If the letter is somewhat rudely scattered , the spirit is carefully sought after and diligently gathered up .

		In a neat volume of 170 odd pages , The question of Mr jj g _ g alt w and conc l se l y Ammalt ' rights .

		.

		> > discusses the question of `` Animals Rights '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- from the humanitarian stand - point .

		Mr.
Salt	PERSON	undertakes in his essay to set the principles of the jus animalium on a plain and log - ical footing , and to expose the fallacies of the apol - ogists of the present system .

		No one is likely to gainsay his fundamental rule condemning `` all prac - tices which inflict unnecessary pain on sentient be - ings . ''

		When he comes , however , to the considera - tion of special cases , to the question whether this or that current practice falls under the rule , his path is beset with the old polemical difficulties .

		First in importance is the time-honored food question ; and here the author calls on humanitarians of the more timid sort to stand by their colors and cease palter - ing for , as he reasonably argues , it is not very con - sistent to sentimentalize over the rights of an animal on whom you propose to dine .

		On the question of flesh-eating , the balance of authority is still rather against Mr.
Salt	PERSON	, though vegetarians have latterly made some logical advances toward establishing their case .

		Shall we agree with
Paley	PERSON	, who -LRB- appeal - ing , as usual , to Scripture to justify eighteenth cen - tury practice -RRB- maintained our '' right to the flesh of animals '' ; and with
Bentham	PERSON	, who naively argues , `` We deprive animals of life , and this is justifiable , since their pains do not equal our pleasures '' ?

		Or shall we side with
Thoreau	PERSON	, who wrote : '' I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race , in its gradual improvement , to leave off eating animals , as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other '' ?

		Mr.
Salt	PERSON	is of the latter opin -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 ion ; and he bases his belief on the facts that man is structurally frugiverous , and that , when he tries it , he gets along perfectly well without flesh-foods , as well as on the growing popular tendency to look with abhorrence on flesh-eating and its concomi - tants .

		On the latter point Mr.
Salt	PERSON	seems to us a little over-sanguine .

		In a day when the magnitude of stock-yards and slaughtering establishments is made a matter of civic pride and rejoicing , it is cer - tainly going too far to say that butchers and slaught - ermen form '' a pariah class . ''

		Nor is the era as yet in sight when a great fortune is regarded as seriously tainted by the stains of the abattoir .

		On the ques - tion of '' Murderous Millinery , '' Mr.
Salt	PERSON	has com - paratively plain sailing ; and we cheerfully subscribe to his axiom , touching the slaughter of birds and mammals for purposes of human adornment , that it is not the man who does the killing , but the woman who wears the trophies , that is the true offender .

		She is the principal , he the tool .

		For the behoof and possible amendment of those fashionable gentlemen and ladies who deck themselves -LRB- like the ass and the jackdaw in the fables -RRB- in borrowed skins and feathers , we subjoin a few facts from the trade in those commodities , which ought to touch the most rudimentary conscience .

		`` One dealer in
London	LOCATION	is said to have received as a single consignment 32 , - 000 dead humming-birds , 80,000 aquatic birds , and 800,000 pairs of wings .

		A Parisian dealer had a contract for 40,000 birds , and an army of murderers were turned out to supply the order .

		... At one auction alone in
London	LOCATION	there were sold 404,389 West Indian and Brazilian bird-skins , and 356,389 East Indian , besides thousands of pheasants and birds-of-paradise . ''

		These , be it remembered , are but scattered instances of a continuous and growing traffic .

		We heartily commend Mr.
Salt	PERSON	's treatise to all who desire a clear idea of the humanitarian theory and arguments .

		There is a bibliography , and an interesting essay on vivisection by Dr.
Albert Leffingwell	PERSON	.

		Another volume Perhaps the illustrations are the best of Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	's part of the new volume the third We of
Pusey	LOCATION	.

		of Liddon 's '' Life of Pusey '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , lately reviewed in our pages .

		It is pleasant to see the face of
Charles Marriott	PERSON	, that man of wide learning and rare sweetness of character , who took the lowest place , content to toil obscurely , in the early days of the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a singularly attractive portrait of the author of '' The Christian Year , '' with a fine brow , large , deep , thoughtful eyes , and a frank , smiling , almost rogu - ish mouth .

		As for the letter-press , if anyone de - sires to know from a very one-sided view-point more of the inner history of '' the Anglican claim to the doctrine of Regeneration , of Absolution , of the Real Presence , of the Eucharistic Sacrifice , '' than he has derived in livelier form from the writings of Church and
Ward	PERSON	and
Mozley	PERSON	; if he is still eager about the
Jerusalem Bishopric	LOCATION	, the
Hampden Controversy	ORGANIZATION	, the
Gorham Case	PERSON	, the departure to
Rome	LOCATION	of New - man and
Manning	PERSON	and
Archdeacon Wilberforce	PERSON	; if he is looking for a list of the '' Tracts for the Times '' and their writers ; if he enjoys five hundred pages of ecclesiastical controversy lighted by no single gleam of imagination or humor , without a revealing anecdote or vivid sketch of character ; if he cares for copious assurance of how weary and heavy - hearted under the burden of his own sins and those of others a good and devout man can be , how an anxious temperament , a scrupulous conscience , and a superstitious system can overcloud a Christian 's joy and peace ; if he would note how a prosperous Englishman , a scholar and divine , a leader among his fellows , in the middle of the nineteenth century of the Christian era can turn his back upon his age and adjust himself to mediaeval ideas and usages , can wear a hair-shirt always by day unless ill , can find virtue in a hard chair by day and a hard bed by night , in wearing no gloves , in keeping his eyes downcast and looking at nothing out of curiosity , in refraining from smiles and in stern repression of humor , a task easier , perhaps , for Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	and Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	than for Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, or that earlier canon of
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	,
Sidney Smith	PERSON	; if one is in search of any of these things he will find a mine of interest in this third volume of
Liddon	ORGANIZATION	's
Pusey	PERSON	.

		To all others it will be a measureless waste , where the air is heavy and the prospect dreary .


John Brown	PERSON	's Mr.
Hinton	PERSON	` saccountof ``
John Brown	PERSON	story , as told and his Men '' -LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by a follower .

		ig ft work that can not jj e overlooked by the student of American history .

		Its literary merit is but slight ; it is written in a clumsy sort of style , with little skill in the sifting or the orderly arrangement of material .

		But the material is there , and it makes the book in a way invaluable .

		The author is himself one of
John Brown	PERSON	's men one of the few present survivors of the group ; he was with them in
Kansas	LOCATION	, and wrote accounts of events there for
Boston	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	papers .

		His account is therefore that of an eye-witness , whose recollec - tions are supplemented by a careful study of mate - rial gathered in many years of industrious research .

		The book is a storehouse of information , and as such it is , as we have said , invaluable .

		The author is an unqualified defender of
John Brown	PERSON	, and in this earnestly written book he shows the courage of his convictions unabated by the nearly forty years that have passed since the stirring events of which he treats .

		The so-called '' Pottawatomie massacre , '' for example , which has been regarded as the darkest stain on
John Brown	PERSON	's career in
Kansas	LOCATION	, is boldly admitted and defended . ''

		The men were slain , and the act was deliberately done .

		There never was any doubt of that .

		It was a question for some years whether or not the act was done under the influence of and by the direct orders of
John Brown	PERSON	.

		No one now doubts that it was . ''

		The act is regarded by our author as a logical necessity of the situation ; and its effects are thus forcibly , if not conclusively , stated : '' The Pottawatomie slaying , temporarily at 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, least , awed the border ruffians into a trembling peace and startled alike the brave and timid in free-state ranks with a triumphant yet serious feeling that on their side at last a Man had arrived . ''

		It unques - tionably did all that ; yet more would be required , one would think , to justify such deeds of savagery .

		It must not be overlooked , however , that
John Brown	PERSON	claimed to have had conclusive evidence that the men killed by him on
Pottawatomie Creek	ORGANIZATION	had set a date when they would kill him and his sons , and that in his belief it was simply a question of which party should kill the other .

		The author 's standpoint and writing , as our brief extracts show , are those of the partisan rather than the historian .

		The book does much , however , to throw light on
John Brown	PERSON	's character and acts , and will have its useful place among his biographies .

		It is a pity the work could not have been given a more presentable form ; the typography is worthy of
Kansas	LOCATION	in its darkest days .

		It is a prize monograph , and deals with the relatively neglected part of the great Pri - mate 's career before he became Archbishop of Can - terbury and the champion of ``
Peter	PERSON	's rock '' against the '' customs '' of the realm .

		The work is admir - ably done ; it is compact , scholarly , and readable , with reference to the best and latest authorities , and with a conception of the character of Thomas not biased in either of the two directions in which bias is commonly found .

		In the presence of the great problem presented by the chancellor-archbishop 's career , the author frankly admits that absolute con - sistency is not to be predicated .

		He takes refuge , however , in the view that there is a lower sort of consistency to be found , and he thus defines it : '' It is the consistency less lofty , but not less real on its lower level of the man who is faithful to the ideal of the office in which he is placed , but allows himself to be placed in office without any definite choice of his own ; who holds to his principles , but takes them from his position , instead of carrying them into it ; who does whatever he finds to do with all his might , bat leaves circumstances to find it for him . ''

		Some such view as this , we fancy , must be taken by the candid and impartial historian .

		In a note , the author discusses
Miss Lambert	PERSON	's glorification of Thomas apropos of
Tennyson	PERSON	's play in `` The Nineteenth Century '' ; and in an appendix he dis - cusses the claims of the various biographies of the martyr of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a curious fact , not , we fancy , known to many who are not specialists in the period , that one of these biographies is a saga ''
Thomas Saga Erkibyskups	PERSON	'' the work of an Ice - landic visitor to
England	LOCATION	, probably Arngrin , Abbot of Thingeyrar .

		The statement is also made that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries churches were dedicated to Thomas in all parts of
Iceland	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Edwin L. Shuman	PERSON	's '' Steps into Journalism , '' published at
Evanston	LOCATION	by the `` Correspondence School of Journalism , '' is the outcome of a course of instruc - tion given at the
summer	DATE	school of
Bay View	LOCATION	,
Mich	LOCATION	- igan .

		The number of young people who are already inclined to turn their `` steps into journalism , '' when they might become useful members of society in - stead , is so great that we naturally look askance upon any attempt to swell these misguided ranks .

		But the author reassures us at the start by saying : '' It is not the aim of this book to make any more writers : we have too many now .

		On none of these pages will there be found a single word tempting any young man to leave the farm or the business office , or advising any young woman to forsake the household routine , in order to run after the ignis fatuus of literary fame . ''

		This introductory claim is sustained by the text that follows .

		Mr.
Shuman	PERSON	's chapters describe from full knowledge the workings of the modern newspaper , and contain much prof - itable advice for reporters and others ; but they cast no glamour over the newspaper life , and do not minimize its degrading influence upon the majority of those who choose to lead it .

		The only aim of the modern city newspaper is to make money ; '' as for the uplifting of the public morals or ideals , that `` Steps into Journalism .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 299 scarcely cuts any figure at all in the purpose of the publisher . ''

		This is a frank saying , but a true one ; and equal in both frankness and truth are the re - peatedly urged statements that the newspaper writer , whether reporter or editor , has no business with con - victions of his own , but must make himself a mere automaton for the registration of ideas that are not even the convictions of anybody else .

		It is de - lightful to note the vigorous way in which the writer describes the newspaper life as it actually is .

		Here , for example , is a pen-portrait of the city editor : '' Damocles was a bobolink in nesting-time compared with the city editor of a great daily , who forever sits with two swords dangling over him , ready to carve off his editorial head without a moment 's warning .

		One of these is the deadly ' scoop , ' and the other is the no less sanguinary libel-suit . ''

		Surely , no one is likely to be tempted into journalism by such pas - sages as these .

		But for those already in the net , and for those who are bent upon finding cause for repentance in their own experience , we can recom - mend the book as likely to prove helpful in a hun - dred ways .

		Mr.
Shuman	PERSON	's advice is usually good and to the point .

		Upon two matters only do we feel bound to disagree with him .

		He does not suf - ficiently condemn in fact , he rather justifies the practise of eking out facts by the aid of a lively im - agination , and publishing all sorts of statements that are not true .

		His remark that '' the day of servile party organs is past '' is not only false , but it is so amazingly false that we can not understand how Mr.
Shuman	PERSON	could have made it .

		The partisan spirit has never , we should say , been so offensive and un - blushing as it has become in the newspapers of our own times .

		_ Special reprints of new volumes have been added
Swinburne	PERSON	's lyrics to the exquisite '' Bibelot '' series of andlhe `` Rubaiya -LRB- .

		repr -LSB- nis published by Mr
> Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, and are even more acceptable than the two with which the series began a year ago .

		One is a book of lyrics selected from the works of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and the other is
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' Omar . ''

		The book of lyrics , named '' Felise , '' has drawn largely upon the first volume of '' Poems and Bal - lads , '' although the other two are not ignored .

		It also includes two choruses from ''
Atalanta	LOCATION	, '' three lyrics from the `` Mary Stuart '' trilogy , and the lovely '' Adieux a
Marie Stuart	PERSON	. ''

		The edition of the immortal '' Rubaiyat '' is easily the most desira - ble of those yet published at a moderate price .

		It includes Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's verses , Mr.
J. H. McCarthy	PERSON	's '' Envoy , ''
FitzGerald	PERSON	's introduction and notes , a bibliography of the English versions of Omar , and the texts of first and fourth editions printed page to page for easy comparison .

		The quatrains that appeared in the second edition only are given as an appendix , one of them being the magnificent '' Nay , but for terror of his wrathful Face , I swear I will not call Injustice Grace ; Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern but Would kick so poor a Coward from the place , '' which no lover of Omar would be willing to spare .

		It would be difficult to suggest any particular in which this `` Bibelot '' edition of the `` tent-maker '' could be improved upon .

		The edition is limited , and we shall be much surprised if it holds out long .

		`` Down East '' manners and dialect . ''

		Danvis Folks '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a neat reprint of a series of New En - gland sketches written for '' Forest and Stream '' by Mr.
Rowland E. Robinson	PERSON	.

		The author attempts not so much to tell a story though there is a slight thread of continuity throughout as to faithfully reproduce the rustic '' Down East '' speech , manners , and customs of fifty years ago ; and in this we should say that he is successful be - yond cavil .

		Some of the chapters are as good as '' Sam Slick '' quaint , racy , bubbling over with dry Yankee fun , and bristling with eccentricities of mind and vernacular .

		We have had rather a sur - feit of dialect in literature of late ; but the stiffest prejudice against it must yield before Mr.
Robin	PERSON	- son 's orthographical ingenuity of which '' julluk '' for just like , `` kwut '' for coat , and '' soddaown '' for sat down , are mild examples .

		M. Andre ''
Lefevre	PERSON	, of the
Paris	LOCATION	An - thropological School , has prepared for the '' International Scientific '' series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- a treatise upon '' Race and Lan - guage , '' written from a strictly evolutionary stand - point , and based upon the results obtained by the latest workers in philological and anthropological science .

		These sciences are making rapid progress , and it was time that someone should go over the old familiar ground with the help of the new light .

		This task
M. Lefevre	PERSON	has accomplished in a highly satisfactory manner .

		His work has three chief divisions : '' The Evolution of Language , '' ''
Geo	PERSON	- graphical Distribution of Languages and Races , '' and '' The Indo-European Organism . ''

		Pen-pictures of `` Vignettes of

		pen-pictures , mild feints at the short 1 story , most of them , of
New York	LOCATION	life and char - acter , by Mr.

		The drift of the papers may be inferred from the titles : '' At a Private View , '' '' Spring in a Side Street , '' '' Be - fore the Break of Day , '' '' The Speech of the Even - ing , '' '' A Vista in
Central Park	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		In drawing his types and echoing their more or less futile chat - ter , Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	is almost grievously accurate ; and his efforts , to say nothing of his patience , should not go unrewarded .

		The volume is a very pretty one externally , and Mr.
Smedley	PERSON	's drawings are clever .

		`` The Pearl of
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is still another book of travels from the indefatigable Mr.
M. M. Ballou	PERSON	.

		In it Mr.
Ballou	PERSON	writes of his recent visit to
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, of which island he says : '' No point presents more varied attractions to the traveller , more thoroughly and picturesquely exhibits equatorial life , or ad - American travellers in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	.

		300 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, dresses itself more directly to the delicate apprecia - tion of the artist , botanist , antiquarian , general sci - entist , and sportsman . ''

		Mr.
Ballou	PERSON	writes in his usual chatty way , freely mingling his own impres - sions with facts culled from the authorities , and affording a very fair general view of
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, its his - tory and traditions , its people , religion , industries , flora and fauna , etc. .

		One is a little surprised to find that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	is made to figure mag - nificently in Mr.
Ballou	PERSON	's pages as Sir
Matthew	PERSON	an accolade rather belated , if merited .

		The pub - lishers issue the book in their usual irreproachable style .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	's '' Five Books of Song '' -LRB- Century -RRB- is a collection , in a single volume , of his com - plete poems , with a few lyrical pieces that we do not recollect to have seen in the earlier editions .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's place among the American poets is now so well assured that this collection will be widely welcomed , although the five booklets whose contents are now incorporated within one set of covers will by no means be displaced from the shelves by this reissue .

		We have on several occasions expressed our appreciation of the high poet - ical quality of Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's work , and need now only chronicle the advent of the new and convenient collec - tion .

		As the holiday gift-book season approaches , the an - thologist is busy .

		The latest collections of verse upon special themes are '' Because I Love You '' -LRB- Lee -RRB- , a volume of love poems collected and arranged by Miss
Anna E. Mack	PERSON	; and `` Poems and Lyrics of Nature '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , edited , with an introductory essay , by Miss
Edith Wingate Kinder	PERSON	.

		The latter vol - ume has a charming '' electrogravure '' portrait of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, although it is not easy to understand just why he , rather than many another , should have been thus distinguished .

		Miss
Rinder	PERSON	's introduction is taste - ful and sympathetic , and her selections are all from con - temporary poets .

		The new '' Cambridge Edition '' of '' The Complete Poetical Works of
John Greenleaf	PERSON
Whittier	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- has all the admirable characteristics of the '' Cam - bridge ''
Longfellow	PERSON	, published a year ago .

		There is a fine portrait , a title-page etching of the poet 's
Ames	LOCATION	- bury home , a full index and collection of notes , and a prefatory memoir by Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	.

		All these things , besides the complete text of the poems , are contained within the covers of a single beautiful volume of between five and six hundred double-columned pages .

		It is a great joy to have our
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Whittier	LOCATION	in this compact and attractive form .

		There seems to be a marked revival of interest in
Henry Kingsley	PERSON	.

		We have already mentioned the new edition of his novels started by the
Messrs. Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, and there now comes to us the first volume of another edition , equally attractive , and more nearly of what may be called library dimensions , bearing the imprint of Messrs.
Ward	PERSON	,
Lock , & Bowden	ORGANIZATION	.

		This edition , we un - derstand , is to be complete , while that of the Messrs.
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	will include only three or four of the novels . ''

		Ravenshoe '' is the volume now at hand .

		Mr.
William Francis Collier	PERSON	's '' History of English Literature '' has long been in use as a school text-book of the subject .

		It now appears in a revised edition -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a brief supplement upon American lit - erature .

		The treatment is essentially biographical .

		While far from being a model text-book , it is not with - out certain merits of arrangement and condensation , and , in its new form , offers a marked improvement upon the earlier editions .

		The '' Advanced Science Manuals '' published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are now made to in - clude a treatise on '' Human Physiology , '' by Mr.
John Thornton	PERSON	.

		Some four hundred pages of text , diversified with many cuts and a few colored illustrations , set forth the elements of the science in reasonably attractive form .

		A book of about half the size is the '' Physiology for Beginners '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which has been prepared by Dr.
Michael Foster	PERSON	and Dr.
Lewis E. Shore	PERSON	.

		The treat - ment is as admirable as might be expected in a book having the great authority of Dr. Foster .

		Under the title of '' Oriental Studies , ''
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a volume of papers read before the
Oriental Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	during the past six years .

		There are a baker 's dozen of the papers , among which we note '' The Physical - Geography of
India	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Morton W. Easton	PERSON	; '' Literature of Chinese Laborers , '' by Mr.
Stew	PERSON	- art
Culin	PERSON	, '' The Alphabets of the Berbers , '' by Dr.

E. W. Hopkins	PERSON	; '' The Aryan Name of the Tongue , '' by Dr.
H. Collitz	PERSON	; and `` The Book of
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Paul Haupt	PERSON	.

		That papers by such men are scholarly goes without saying . ''

		Asolando , '' the last volume of
Browning	PERSON	's poems , has been issued by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	as the sev - enteenth and final volume of their handy edition of the poet .

		More than half of this new volume is devoted to indexes and notes for the complete edition .

		The indexes are of titles and first lines ; the notes are biographical and historical , and form a sort of encyclopaedia explan - atory of the allusions contained in the poems .

		Thus completed , this edition of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	is extremely satis - factory , and is decidedly preferable to any other now existing .

		An
International Congress of Charities	ORGANIZATION	, Correction , and Philanthropy was held at
Chicago	LOCATION	in
June , 1893	DATE	, in connection with the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	of which our readers have been so abundantly informed .

		Of the proceedings of that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	certain sections have been published and heretofore noticed by us .

		A new volume , now at hand , reports the '' General Exer - cises '' at the opening of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and includes the special report on '' The Public Treatment of Pauperism , '' edited by Dr.
John H. Finley	PERSON	, of
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	.

		These reports issue from the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Press .

		Mr.
John Campbell Oman	PERSON	, in a volume of moderate size , has told for English readers the stories of '' The Great Indian Epics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the `` Ramayana '' and the '' Mahabharata . '' ''

		I have written , '' Mr.
Oman	PERSON	says , '' for the benefit of those , whether Europeans or Indians , who may be acquainted with the English lan - guage , the brief epitomes of them contained in the fol - lowing pages ; deriving my materials not from the orig - inal Sanskrit poems , which are sealed books to me , but from the translations , more or less complete and literal , which have been given to the world by both European and Indian scholars . ''

		After this frank admission , there is little to be said , except that the stories are told in fairly finished and readable English .

		THE DIAL 301 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
November 10 , 1894	DATE	.

		Permanent quarters have at last been engaged for the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	of this city , in the newly-erected ex - tension of the
Carnegie Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	in Fifty-seventh street .

		A comfortable suite of rooms has been especially constructed for the club 's purposes , and will be fitted up by the club itself .

		It is now expected that the new rooms will be opened about the first of the year , and , in the meantime , the
Architectural League	ORGANIZATION	has kindly offered the use of its assembly hall for the fortnightly meetings .

		It will be remembered that the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	was organized in
October , 1882	DATE	.

		At first the mem - bers met at each other 's homes , then for a time at the
Tile Club	ORGANIZATION	hall , and afterward , until last year , at the Twenty-fourth street rooms so familiar to members .

		The club has now passed its twelfth anniversary , and is more prosperous than at any period in its history .

		A large portion of its '' Liber Scriptorum '' has been sub - scribed for , and it is proposed to place the remaining siibscriptions at once .


Herbert P. Home	PERSON	's '' The Binding of Books , '' Bras - sington 's `` History of the Art of Bookbinding , '' Miss
Prideaux	PERSON	's '' Historical Sketch of Bookbinding , '' and sev - eral other recently published works of the same charac - ter , have stirred up an unusual degree of interest in their subject .

		The
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	's exhibition of commercial or edition bindings was of great value .

		During the next fortnight there will be on exhibition at Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ' new building a collection of about two hundred and fifty books in fine bindings for amateurs .

		These books , old and new , have been selected as handsome specimens of the printer 's art , or for their rarity , and have been sent within the past few months to the best binders of
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	.

		They thus represent the ultimate skill of the binders of to-day .

		Among American bindings there are especially handsome specimens from the establishments of Messrs.
Blackwell	PERSON	,
Bradstreet	ORGANIZATION	, and
Stikeman	PERSON	.

		Some of the French bindings in which the decorative design is cut out with gravers from the surface of the leather are quite remarkable .

		All of these finely-bound books are for sale , and will be - distributed to purchasers at the close of the exhibition .

		The local political upheaval is not without its interest from a literary point of view .

		Among the Congressmen elected from this city is Mr.
Lemuel Ely Quigg	PERSON	, whose '' Tin Types Taken in the Streets of
New York	LOCATION	, '' pub - lished some years ago , contains several remarkable sketches dealing with machine politics of the baser sort .

		Something more elaborate in the line of fiction , and deal - ing with the same subject , has been looked for from Mr.
Quigg	PERSON	, who has long been a member of the '' Tribune '' editorial staff ; but it has remained for Mr.
Paul Leices	PERSON	- ter
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, the editor of
Jefferson	PERSON	's works , to write a po - litical novel pure and simple .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	has varied his historical studies with considerable study and experi - ence of local political methods and men . ''

		The Hon - orable
Peter Stirling	PERSON	'' is based on actual occurrences in this city , and the characters are partly drawn from life .

		This is notably the case with the hero , who is evidently the
August Personage	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- to use an eighteenth century expression -RRB- now most prominent in the affairs of the nation , although many incidents connected with others are assigned to his career .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's novel is longer than the ordinary American story , and , indeed , this length is required for the proper development of the plot to which , of course , the political atmosphere is incidental .

		; Announcements of books to appear in time for the Christmas season have practically all been made .

		The holiday catalogues of the great publishing houses will perhaps be more elaborate and decorative this year than ever before , those of the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	and of Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	particularly so .

		The latter firm , by the way , will issue an American edition of the
London	LOCATION	''
Bookman	PERSON	, '' under the editorship of Professor
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	and Mr.
James MacArthur	PERSON	.

		Pro- fessor Boyesen , Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	, and Professor
Charles F. Richardson	PERSON	will be among the American contributors .

		Mr.
Melvil Dewey	PERSON	is also to have charge of a depart - ment devoted to library economy and giving general news of the libraries of the world .

W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, is to edit for Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	the '' Contemporary Writers '' series , of which the first volume , ''
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, '' by Miss
Annie MacDonnell	PERSON	, will shortly appear . ''

		Three Score and Ten Years , '' the recollections of the veteran poet and engraver , Mr.
William James Lin	PERSON	- ton , appears this week from the Scribner press , and is interesting not only for its contents but on account of the picturesque personality of its author , who is still frequently to be seen at the
Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, so warmly spoken of by him in his book .

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	, who was born in
1812	DATE	, had already lived out an ordinary man 's life in
England	LOCATION	, before coming to this country in
1866	DATE	; but he seemed as full of life and energy , when I called on him at his cottage near
East Rock	LOCATION	,
New Haven	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	,
last winter	DATE	, as most men of half his age .

		He has a pleasant way of putting his own books of poetry in type and printing them at his house , where he has a press and printer 's materials .

		Some of these little vol - umes , printed at the ''
Appledore Press	ORGANIZATION	, '' as he calls it , and daintily illustrated with his own engravings , are much in demand among collectors .

		Another picturesque figure , much seen about the city of late , is that of Dean Hole , whose '' More Memories '' will be issued this com - ing week by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The poems of
Richard Realf	PERSON	, edited by Colonel Rich - ard
J. Hinton	PERSON	, and announced for publication this au - tumn in

		BRYANT DAY AT
KNOX COLLEGE	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		j The centenary of the birth of
Bryant	LOCATION	,
Nov. 3	DATE	, was made the occasion of a celebration in the poet 's honor by the faculty and students of
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The citizens of
Galesburg	LOCATION	joined heartily in the spirit of the occasion , and thronged the historic old
First Church	ORGANIZATION	beyond the limits of its capacity .

		Upon the pulpit platform sat representatives of three
Illinois	LOCATION	colleges .

		The presid - ing officer was the venerable
Newton Bateman	PERSON	, LL.D. , for many years superintendent of public instruction in 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, this state , now president emeritus of
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Prominent in the group , and the figure of chief interest during the day 's events , was the only surviving brother of the poet , Mr.
John H. Bryant	PERSON	, of
Princeton	LOCATION	, 111. , hale and hearty still , and bearing with notable vigor the burden of his eighty-seven years .

		The centennial address was delivered by Mr.
E. R. Brown	PERSON	, of
Elmwood	LOCATION	, 111. , a native of
Cummington	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and a life-long friend of
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	, and of the
Bryant	PERSON	family .

		In the now famous celebration held in
August	DATE	last at the poet 's birthplace , Mr.
Brown	PERSON	de - livered a similar address ; and as in the earlier commem - oration , so in the later one , the speaker achieved a happy and notable success .

		Tenderly and sympathetically he told the story of the poet 's life ; with warm appreciation , and yet temperately , he offered his estimate of the poet 's labors .

		He gave much emphasis to the sincerity and genuineness of
Bryant	PERSON	's inner life , and claimed for the poet a more tender and responsive nature than was ap - parent to the outside world .

		Mr.
John H. Bryant	PERSON	recited his own pathetic '' Mon - ody , '' written in memory of his last visit with his brother at the old homestead in
Cummington	LOCATION	.

		`` My heart to-day is far away ; I seem to tread my native hills ; I see the flocks and mossy rocks , I hear the gusli of mountain rills . ''

		There with me walks and kindly talks The dear , dear friend of all my years ; We laid him low not long ago , At Roslyn-side , with sobs and tears . ''

		Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	prefaced the recitation of his poem with a few words of interesting reminiscence ; and elsewhere in the programme he recited by request his brother 's familiar lines beginning , '' The melancholy days are come , the saddest of the year . ''

		The presence of the poet 's brother made the occasion memorable indeed ; and the interest of such an incident was increased to a still higher degree by the fact that Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	was accom - panied by all the members of his immediate family and by representatives of other branches as well .

		Professor
W. C. Wilkinson	PERSON	, of
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	, and the Rev.
John White Chadwick	PERSON	, of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, con - tributed poems , which were read .

		A large number of interesting letters were received from persons at a dis - tance , and the reading of extracts from them closed the ample programme .

		Among the letters received were those from Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	, Professor
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	, Professor
Charles F. Richardson	PERSON	, Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, President
Angell	PERSON	, Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	, Mr.
Eugene Field	PERSON	, and Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	.

		Among the musical numbers of the programme was the singing of `` The Old Friends are the Truest , '' by Mr.
E. L. Brown	PERSON	, son of the orator ; and the hymns by
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	, '' As shadows cast by cloud and sun , '' and '' Oh , deem not they are blest alone . ''

		The exer - cises seemed not unworthy the occasion , and everywhere were heard expressions of satisfaction that such a tribute had been paid to the honored memory of
America	LOCATION	's good first-poet .

Robin	PERSON	Reading Club '' of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, an organization that is doing excellent work in outlining and directing courses of reading by means of correspondence and printed schedules .

		The method has been approved by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Mr.
Hale	PERSON	, and Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	, who also commend this organization .

		The pamphlet referred to may be had by addressing Miss
Louise Stockton	PERSON	, Director ,
4213	DATE	Chester avenue ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Dean Hole , in an interview published by '' The Out - look , '' thus states the main purpose of his visit to Amer - ica : `` I would never have taken this long vacation had I not been able to make arrangements to lecture while here .

		So , while my chief object in coming is to see
America	LOCATION	, I have another object that of raising money by my lectures to complete the architectural restora - tion of the
Rochester Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Cathedral has the oldest Norman nave in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is one of the first specimens of ecclesiastical architecture which one sees after landing at
Liverpool	LOCATION	.

		Some restorations have been attempted and partially carried out , but we need
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 303 much more money .

		Many thousand pounds have been expended in the restoration thus far , and we need to spend many thousand pounds more .

		We have a very ugly tower , which was added to the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	about sixty years ago .

		We hope to bring that into some sort of consonance with the original lines of the Cathedral itself . ''

		From a considerable number of brief tributes to
Holmes	PERSON	, published in '' The Writer '' for
November	DATE	, we select for reprinting the sonnet of Mrs.
Julia C. R. Dorr	PERSON	: '' ' How shall I crown this child ? '

		fair Summer cried . '

		May wasted all her violets long ago ; No longer on the hills
June	DATE	's roses glow ,
Flushing	LOCATION	with tender bloom the pastures wide .

		My stately lilies one by one have died : The clematis is but a ghost and lo !

		In the fair meadow-lands no daisies blow ; How shall I crown this
Summer	DATE	child ? '

		she sighed .

		Then quickly smiled . '

		For him , for him , ' she said , ' On every hill my golden-rod shall flame , Token of all my prescient soul foretells .

		His shall be golden song and golden fame Long golden years with love and honor wed And crowns , at last , of silver immortelles ! ' ''

		THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS .

		EDITED BY < DR.
ALBERT SHAW	PERSON	.

		IN
January , 1890	DATE	, a new magazine , with a new idea in periodical literature , made its appearance in
England	LOCATION	.

		Its name , the '' Review of Reviews , '' was suggestive of its purpose .

		Its aim was to give each month an epitome of current history and a summary of the world 's best thought .

		In a single year it reached a sale of more copies than all the rest of the English reviews combined .

		In
April , 1891	DATE	, an American edition , under the editorial management of Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	, was brought out .

		This American edition was not a reprint of the English magazine .

		On the other hand , it dealt largely with American matters and was edited with perfect independence in its own office .

		The success of the American edition has become an event in the history of periodical literature in this country .

		During the first year it surpassed , in circulation , the most popular of the old and established reviews and before the close of the second year it was in close competition with the leading illustrated magazines .

		The principle on which the '' Review of Reviews '' has been edited , is that a magazine , made bright , timely , and comprehensive in text and illustration , and immediately in sympathy with every movement of social progress , would be considered indispensable .

		This theory has been vindicated in the career of the '' Review of Reviews . ''

		The leaders in the religious and educa - tional worlds , the most prominent literary and professional men and women , have written to express their sense of the extraordinary ability and awakening power of this magazine .

$ 5.00	MONEY	; half calf ,
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		A large proportion of the chapters of the above work ap - peared in the '' Figaro , '' the idea of writing them being sug - gested to the author by the following questions : '' With what women is Napoleon known to have had temporary relations as a young man , as Consul , and finally as Emperor ?

		Had he an absorbing passion for any one woman ?

		and , if so , for whom ? ''

		In his task the author has found many powerful allies , and has distilled the essence of documents that have been accum - ulating for years .

		The result is a narrative of the facts as they appear from these various evidences .

		345 THE CRERAR LIBRARY .

		It is now just five years since the will of the late
John Crerar	PERSON	passed through the
Probate Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		By that will , as is widely known , the wealthy testator left the bulk of his fortune to be applied to the endowment of a public library to be established in the
South Division of the City	LOCATION	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Vexatious litigation has caused the accomplishment of his purpose to be postponed ; but the disputed questions have now been definitely settled by the courts , and executors and trustees are preparing to carry out the wishes of the testator .

		On the whole , the public has fared better than it did with the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, which had to wait twice as long , and with far less excuse for delay , to get started .

		The postponement , in the present case , was unavoidable , and it has had the beneficent effect of permitting opinion to ripen , and of leaving to the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	a fair start , thus avoiding the confusion of aim that would inevitably have followed an attempt to begin the 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, collection of two great libraries at the same time .

		The funds at the disposal of the
Crerar	PERSON	trus - tees now amount , in round numbers , to two and a half
millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		The trustees met on the twenty-third of
November	DATE	, listened to a number of reports and suggestions , and organ - ized for work .

		The only question practically settled up to this point is that of the general character of the library .

		The executors re - ported in favor of a library for reference rather than for circulation , and the trustees seem sub - stantially agreed upon this subject .

		There is no doubt that the decision is a wise one .

		The
City Library	ORGANIZATION	, supported by general taxation , amply provides for the circulation of popular literature .

		Its efficient management makes it a real factor in the educational work of the community , and its thirty-one delivery stations give to all sections and classes of the popula - tion the easy use of its collections .

		An attempt to duplicate this work , already so well done , would be a waste of energy ; and we are glad to note that no such attempt is contemplated by the trustees of the
Crerar	PERSON	foundation .

		The questions immediately confronting the trustees relate to the choice of a librarian , the selection of a site , and the determination of the special lines upon which books shall be col - lected .

		It seems to be the general sentiment of the trustees that the last of these questions is the first to deserve settlement , since the answer given to it may influence the settlement of the other two .

		We are by no means sure that this opinion is well-founded .

		Why the site of the library should help to determine the character of the librarian is not obvious .

		The special trend of the collections to be made should doubtless be taken into account when a librarian is chosen , but does not constitute so large an element in the problem as may at first be thought .

		Suppose that the decision be made to collect mainly in one bibliographical field , it is still far more important that the librarian be a man of broad general culture than a spe - cialist in that field .

		On the other hand , there is a good deal to be said for the view that the professional advice of the librarian is need - ful from the very start , even in such prelimin - ary matters as the selection of a site and the determination of the library 's scope .

		In fact , '' First appoint your librarian '' seems to us a maxim almost as cogent as the more familiar '' First catch your hare . ''

		In making this statement we assume as a matter of course that the trustees are prepared to defer to the expert knowledge of a profes - sional librarian in all matters relating to the special work of the library .

		If they are not prepared to do this , if they intend themselves to assume the direction of the institution in any other than its external and financial as - pects , it matters little when they choose their librarian , or whom they designate for the post .

		An instructive illustration of misconceived du - ties , and of what happens when a board of trus - tees fails to confine its action within its own proper field , is afforded by the history of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps the two greatest mistakes that it is possible for a board of library trustees to make are those which have been made by the
Newberry	ORGANIZATION	directors .

		In the first place , they listened to the enticing voice of the architect , and disregarded the sober wisdom of the librarian , when the question of a suitable building was considered .

		In consequence of this action , an imposing structure , at an enor - mous cost , was planned and erected , while the endowment of the library suffered proportion - ally .

		Yet the problem of a library building is very distinctly one of librarianship rather than of architecture .

		And the income of the New - berry Library will suffer for all time to come from this reckless impairment of the endow - ment .

		The other mistake was that of so limit - ing the powers of the librarian as to make him little more than an agent of his employers , the latter arrogating to themselves the right to con - trol the library management in its smallest de - tails .

		Fortunate enough to secure the services of the most distinguished American represent - ative of the profession , the trustees refused him the powers which are the very sine qua non of efficiency the power of absolute control over his subordinates , and the largest of discretion - ary powers in the selection and purchase of books .

		It is to be hoped that the
Crerar	PERSON	trus - tees will be warned by the example set them , and will at least avoid the mistakes that have so sadly crippled the resources and the service - able efficiency of this sister institution .

		Within the past few years we have had fre - quent occasion to contrast the management of the two great culture endowments of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and never without a feeling of wonder that the same general machinery should have produced , in the two cases , results so different .

		Both the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	and
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	are controlled by bodies of men be - longing to the same general class of society , and having the same general characteristics .

		They are gentlemen of a certain achievement , high social standing , and marked business abil -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 325 ity .

		On the other hand , they are not , as a rule , possessed of expert knowledge in educational or library matters , respectively .

		Each body of trus - tees was able to secure for the executive head of the institution under its control a man of excep - tional ability and experience .

		At this point the cases cease to run parallel .

		The University trus - tees were wise enough , having chosen a president for their institution , to leave its control , as far as all educational questions are concerned , entirely in his hands and in the hands of his faculty .

		The real work of the trustees is the manage - ment of the endowment fund ; all other uni - versity matters are left to the president and faculty , the approval of the trustees being a pure formality .

		The trustees would never dream , for example , of forcing a faculty ap - pointment or of controlling the courses of study .

		On the other hand , the
Newberry	ORGANIZATION	trustees were unwise enough to act in a manner directly op - posed to that above described .

		The discretion - ary powers that correspond , in the case of the librarian , to those that the university president must exercise , are the power to appoint , direct , classify , and promote his assistants , and the power to use his own judgment in the selection and purchase of books .

		These are the funda - mentals of self-respecting librarianship .

		A board of trustees should hardly do more than say to their librarian : '' We find that we can spare so much a year for the library service , and so much a year for the purchase of books ; the money is now placed at your disposal , to be used to the best possible advantage . ''

		This is substantially the position that has been taken from the start by the
University	ORGANIZATION	trustees to - wards President
Harper	PERSON	; it is almost the exact reverse of the position taken by the
Newberry	ORGANIZATION	trustees towards Librarian
Poole	PERSON	.

		It is not difficult , comparing the results , to say which of the two systems has worked the better .

		And it is hoped that so plain a moral will not be missed by the trustees of the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the selection of a site for the new library , the future as well as the present should be con - sidered .

		The division of the city in which the library must be established is fast expanding , and its centre of population is moving swiftly southwards .

		A site somewhat in advance of that centre would seem to be the most desir - able , a consideration which indicates the neigh - borhood of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In fact , the exist - ence of the
University	ORGANIZATION	and of the
Field Museum	ORGANIZATION	in the same region offers a very strong reason why the third great foundation should go there also .

		There is much advantage in the concen - tration of such foci of culture as libraries , uni - versities , and museums .

		While we are not dis - ' posed to say that the situation of the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	should be settled by these considera - tions , it seems as if the argument were stronger for this region than for any other .

		The remaining fundamental question is that of the special field of the
Crerar	PERSON	collection .

		A familiar epigram has it that the well-educated man should know something of everything and everything of something .

		We think that a great library , pending the remote period when it may come to realize the Utopian ideal of containing '' everything of everything , '' should be like the man of the epigram .

		That is , it should have a well-rounded collection of general litera - ture , including all the books likely to be wanted upon any subject by people who are not special - ists , and it should also develope one or more subjects as specialties .

		Upon this question of specialties we understand that the
Crerar	PERSON	trus - tees are practically agreed ; but the question is still open as to what the specialties shall be .

		Among the suggestions made at the meeting of
last week	DATE	, the subjects of science , the industrial arts , and Americana were named , and the lat - ter was particularly favored .

		We should con - sider the adoption of this suggestion unfortu - nate for several reasons .

		In the first place , the late Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, being an ardent student of American history , laid broad foundations for the development of this department , first in the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and afterwards in the New - berry .

		It would be better to carry on the good work in one or both of these institutions than to start it afresh in the new one .

		In the second place , the collection of Americana , important though it be , is even now relatively overdone throughout the country .

		In the third place , such a collection would mean the purchase of many rare and curious volumes at large ex - pense ; and no library should indulge in such luxuries as long as more pressing wants remain unsupplied .

		Lastly , there are other subjects of wider and more permanent interest , yet strangely neglected in our libraries ; subjects which , all things considered , would be more welcome to the constituency of the Crerar Li - brary , and are more deserving the attention of its trustees .

		One of these subjects is that of English literature , in the largest sense ; and we wish to offer , as our contribution to the discussion , the suggestion that this be made the main subject of the
Crerar	PERSON	collection .

		The reasons for this suggestion , if reasons be needed , must be left for future discussion .

		MR.
BURROUGHS	PERSON	ON `` MERE LITERATURE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I add a word to what Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	so finely and nobly says on '' Mere Literature , '' in your issue of
Nov. 1	DATE	?

		A reviewer in '' The Nation '' some time ago used this language : '' To tell the truth ,
Carlyle	PERSON	was not , properly speaking , a literary man .

		He felt that he had a moral message to deliver to the world , and for the purpose of delivering it he invented an extraordinary literary vehicle , which he used with great effect .

		But his interests were all ethical . ''

		The contrast here between ethical interests and literary interests is tolerably plain .

		A man with a message , like
Carlyle	PERSON	, may speak in perfect literary form -LRB- I do not say that
Carlyle	PERSON	did -RRB- , but this form is never an end in itself to him .

		He does not write to please , to delight , but to stir and inspire .

		The '' literary '' man , on the other hand , delights in perfection of literary form for its own sake , and satisfies that delight in others .

		The difference is not in the subject-matter , the content of what is said , but in the point of view .

		Does not Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	seem to be an instance of the man whose interests are mainly literary , who if he produces a work of art is satisfied , and who would find it almost vulgar to have any purpose beyond this ?

		And yet that perfection of literary form need not hinder one from rising out of the rank of '' men of let - ters '' altogether , seems to be proved by the case of the late Dr.
Newman	PERSON	.

		Where shall we find more finish even in his '' Parochial and Plain Sermons '' and yet where more power ?

		Who more entirely wrote to con - vince , to move , to persuade ?

		It was he who in his '' Let - ter to the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	on Occasion of Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- stone 's Recent Expostulation '' -LRB-
1875	DATE	-RRB- , after a great and almost classical passage on Conscience , used this lan - guage : `` Noble buildings have been reared as fortresses against that spiritual , invisible influence which is too subtle for science and too prof ound for literature . ''

		THE SOCIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CRUELTY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I was a little amused at the tone of a recent book - notice in THE DIAL -LRB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, p. 200 -RRB- , headed '' Poultry - killing as a Fine Art , '' in which the character of the British sportsman came in for a sharp scoring .

		With your writer 's humanitarian views I heartily agree ; but to his unfair and thoroughly American intimation that the barbarities of British '' sport '' are confined to the gentry , as contradistinguished from the mob -LRB- or per - haps one should say nowadays the proletariat -RRB- , I beg leave to demur .

		If aristocratic Hurlingham has its pigeon-matches , vulgar Whitechapel has its rat-pits ; and the British tradesman , for all his supposed monop - oly of the national virtues , is certainly quite as prone as his social betters to regard a fine day mainly as the pro- verbial invitation to '' go and kill something . ''

		As a matter of fact the passion for amateur butchery is shared in , in
England	LOCATION	, by all classes alike -LRB- not forgetting the clergy , a distinguished member of whose sporting wing is now lecturing in
America	LOCATION	-RRB- from the peer to the cos - termonger ; and our cis -
Atlantic	LOCATION	habit of mentally as - sociating the vices with '' the classes '' and the virtues with '' the masses '' should not blind us to the truth that it is largely to '' the classes '' that the growing human - itarian movement is due .

		One of its foremost cham - pions , for instance , is Lady Florence Dixie ; and I may say that a letter from her ladyship to the '' Pall Mall Gazette '' on the subject of pheasant-driving quite bears out your reviewer 's estimate of that singularly brutal pastime , in which tens of thousands of tame hand-reared birds are butchered yearly in the name of '' sport . ''

		But is sport-loving
England	LOCATION	, after all , the only fruitful field for the humanitarian propaganda ?

		There is perhaps more than a grain of ugly truth in ''
Ouida	PERSON	's '' charge that '' If in a mob of Londoners , Parisians ,

		WHAT DO WE MEAN BY '' LITERATURE '' ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		After reading the many valuable articles published in THE DIAL on English in the several Universities represented , and looking in vain for someone to tell us just what he means when he speaks of `` literature , '' I am led to wonder whether any well-defined idea exists as to what impression each produces upon the other when the word '' literature '' is used .

		We have had one unbroken succession of wise and willing critics , from Aristotle to men now living , who have told us what lit - erature ought to be , and where it falls short in certain cases .

		The line of march of literary criticism is strewn with the bleaching skulls of innumerable law-givers and dogmatists , but the
Darwin	PERSON	and the Spencer of litera - ture are yet invisibly distant in the future .

		For me to say what literature is , or how it should be studied , places me upon the same dangerous ground upon which wiser ones have stood and have fallen , and would make me no less dogmatic than those I question .

		If I were required to offer a starting-point in the study of literature , it would be a proposition so simple that I believe no one could take exceptions ; and while I should not offer it as a panacea for all the ills that literary study is heir to , I am constrained to believe that it is founded upon safe principles of studentship and may be helpful as a suggestion .

		My proposition is this : The literature of any selection is permanent .

		What - ever of literature is in
Chaucer 's Knight	ORGANIZATION	's Tale now was in it the day it was written , neither more nor less , and there is no literary question in it for me that was not there for the author 's contemporaries .

		The literature 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 of
Browning	PERSON	and Whitman will be in the twenty-ninth century what it is in the nineteenth .

		True , no doubt , future generations must study our ethics , religion , so - ciology , and language , in order to understand our art impulses and tendencies ; but it is to be hoped they will not misname these preparatory studies '' literature , '' as their ancestors did .

		If the proposition set forth is of any value , there is one thought to be emphasized .

		If I am studying the literature of
Sidney	PERSON	to-day , I must deal with the same material which his contemporaries dealt with .

		If his language was to them a problem , it is so to me ; if not to them , it can be only a preparatory study for me only a clearing-away process .

		The religion and sociology of
Piers Plowman	PERSON	is for me a study , but only prepara - tory , for these facts were generally known to his con - temporaries .

		And on the other hand , if sentence struct - ure , figures of speech , mythological references , verse , stanza , and rhyme are art devices now they were cer - tainly art devices when used by an early author , and are therefore appropriate for consideration ; yet they are only devices .

		To the student of literature , looking from the proposi - tion announced , there is one test for each question that he shall consider : Did this question exercise the thought , feeling , or will of the artist ?

		If not , why should it ex - ercise me as a student of the thought , feeling , and will of the artist ?

		Nefo THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF
WHITTIER	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	's '' Life and Letters of
John Greenleaf	PERSON
Whittier	LOCATION	'' meets at all points the pleasant anticipations we had formed of it , and the author is to be credited with perhaps the best and most satisfying piece of literary biog - raphy since Mr.
Cabot	PERSON	's ''
Emerson	PERSON	. ''

		It is a definitive work which all lovers of the laureate of rural
New England	LOCATION	and the anti-slavery cru - sade will receive with gratitude , and one which no American who loves his country and feels a proper pride in the movement which finally erased from the scutcheon its one damning blot should leave unread .

		Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	began his work with the double advantage of an engaging theme and an abundance of correct data .

		Pos - sibly Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	felt the force of
Brougham	LOCATION	's remark that death has an added sting for emi - nence , in the form of lying biography ; for we find that ten years before his death he took the precaution to begin arrangements for the pres - ent Life , authorizing the collection of material for it , freely aiding the author with general sug - gestions , and giving information that led to * LIFE AND LETTERS OF JOHN GREENLEAF

		By
Samuel T. Pickard	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with seven etchings .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		a large collection of letters illustrating every period of his life .

		The work thus not only bears the hall-mark of his express sanction , but it is to some extent the result of his personal cooperation and supervision .

		Every phase of Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	's career is fairly and satisfac - torily shown his boyhood on the ancestral farm , his scanty school-days , his earlier literary and journalistic ventures , his editorial experi - ences at
Boston	LOCATION	,
Haverhill	LOCATION	, and
Hartford	LOCATION	, his excursions into the field of practical politics -LRB- he barely escaped
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
1832	DATE	by being under the Congressional age -RRB- , his anti-slavery apostolate , and the more familiar phases of his later life .

		But little has been known hitherto of the first thirty years of Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	's career a period during which his ambition was clearly political rather than literary , although he was at the same time winning some credit as a poet by verses which the riper judgment of his later years suppressed .

		It was not , indeed , until he was about twenty-seven years of age that he found his true poetical utterance .

		Up to that time the hundreds of poems he had written were mere metrical and rhetorical exercises , jejune enough mostly , and sadly unsuggestive of '' those brave translunary things '' that are born of inspiration and elude effort .

		But after
1833	DATE	, a date marking a spiritual crisis with Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	, a sudden and magic change came over the quality of his verse .

		It was with his resolve to champion the cause of the slave that the long-courted afflatus came ; and he passed at once from poetaster to poet .

		Says Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	: '' His pen was kept busy in advocating the cause he had espoused , and the poems known as the Voices of Freedom ' came rapidly one after another , hammer strokes against flinty prejudice .

		Sparks followed each blow .

		Those who are old enough remember how these spirited verses stirred and warmed the young hearts of the North , and prepared the soil from which sprang the great political party which took from him the watch - word , ' Justice the highest expediency . ' ''

		Whatever may be Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	's title to purely literary fame , it is his true distinction to have been the Tyrtseus of the only war in history spontaneously waged by a great people to vindicate a moral principle .

		The story of Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	's boyhood and early youth is interesting in itself and in its bearing upon his after life .

		It tells of a pretty constant struggle with the stony acres of the
New England	LOCATION	farm , and with the difficulties of getting an education ; yet it is lighted with many a bit of quaint humor , the source of which 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, is unmistakable .

		The Whittiers held a leading social position in the
East Parish	LOCATION	, and their religious views , though shared in by none of their neighbors , were respected .

		Religion was a matter of daily theme and practice in the Quaker household . ''

		A portion of the afternoon was generally spent by the assembled family in reading the Scriptures ... To this faithful teaching in the home may be attributed in large measure
Whittier	LOCATION	's familiarity with Holy Writ and the frequent quotations therefrom in his writings .

		As Stedinan has truly said , ' The Bible is rarely absent from his verse , and its spirit never . ' ''

		Quaker meetings were sometimes held in the great farm-kitchen of the
Haverhill	LOCATION	homestead ; and Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	used to tell with great glee how on one such occasion a favorite ox , known to the family as '' Old
Butler	PERSON	, '' thrust his head in at the window , and benignly yet critically surveyed the assemblage . ''

		While a sweet-voiced woman was speaking , ' Old
Butler	PERSON	' paid strict attention , but when she sat down and there arose a loud-voiced brother , he withdrew his head from the window , lifted his tail in air , and went off bel - lowing .

		This bovine criticism was greatly enjoyed by the younger members of the meeting . ''

		There was another comical incident of his boyhood that Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	was fond of tell - ing .

		When he was nine years old President
Monroe	PERSON	visited
Haverhill	LOCATION	, and it happened that on the same day there was a rival attraction in the shape of a menagerie .

		Both spectacles , it seems , savored of vanity to the elder Whittiers ; and the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	boy was forbidden to see either the wild beasts or the nation 's Chief
Magis	PERSON	- trate . ''

		He did not care much for the former , but he was anxious to see a President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The next day he trudged all the way to
Haverhill	LOCATION	, deter - mined to see at least some footsteps in the street that the great man had left behind him .

		He found at last an impression of the elephant 's foot in the road , and supposing this to be
Monroe	PERSON	's track , he followed it as far as he could distinguish it .

		Then he went home , sat - isfied that he had seen the footsteps of the greatest man in the country . ''

		An altogether stupendous event to the farm - bred boy was his first trip to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		He wore , as he used to relate , on this great occasion his first '' boughten buttons , '' and a special broad-brim that would have credited
George Fox	PERSON	, '' made for him by Aunt Mercy out of pasteboard , cov - ered with drab velvet '' ; and he was rather sur - prised to find that his gala attire failed to im - press those who passed him on the street .

		A notable incident of this visit was his purchase of a copy of Shakespeare .

		That temptation he could not resist as he did one scarcely less alluring . ''

		He had been strictly cautioned by his mother to avoid the theatre , and when he learned that a brilliant lady he met at the table of his hostess , who had been very kind in her attentions to the quaint , shy boy , and who had quite won his heart by her simplicity and grace , was an actress , it was a great shock to him ; but he had the courage to refuse her invitation to the play-house , and cut short his visit to the city to avoid the terrible temptation to which he was subjected .

		He had gone quite too far in buying
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , and fled homeward lest he should bring disgrace upon his Qua - kerism . ''

		It may be inferred from this story that the
Whittier	LOCATION	library was a slender one .

		There were about thirty volumes in all journals and reli - gious disquisitions of the pioneers of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	- ism , most of them , and rather juiceless aliment for an imaginative lad in his teens .

		Yet he devoured them all , and knew them nearly by heart .

		He used to say in later life that he read the journals of Friends so much that he had steeped his mind with their thoughts . ''

		He loved their authors because they were so saintly , and yet so humbly unconscious of it . ''

		For some time , as it seems , these meagre , if pious , productions filled young
Whittier	LOCATION	's ideal and rounded his literary horizon .

		But sud - denly a richer world , a world of matchless song and unpremeditated art , of pathos the tender - est , tears the saddest , and laughter the mer - riest , opened as if by magic before him .

		The Merlin who -LRB- all unconsciously -RRB- wrought the wonder was the district teacher , who , accus - tomed to read aloud to the Whittiers as they sat round the evening fire , brought with him one memorable night a copy of Burns .

		From this copious fount he read many pages , explain - ing the Scottish dialect as he proceeded ; and young
John Greenleaf	PERSON	listened spellbound to the end . ''

		A fire was that evening kindled upon an altar that grew not cold for seventy years .

		The reader had only thought of his older listeners as he read and explained .

		... He recalled the lad to his ordinary senses by offer - ing to leave the book with him , if he was interested in it .

		The offer was , of course , gladly accepted .

		What this little volume thus loaned to him was to young Whit - tier , has since been told in one of the finest tributes to Burns that has yet been written . ''

		Thus inspired , the boy soon began to try his own wings ; but it must be owned his early numbers were perhaps the feeblest poetic flut - terings that ever heralded the upward flight of bard .

		There is a tradition that his first rhymes were written upon the beam of his mother 's loom and the story is not without its symbol - ism ; for there is nearly always a certain sug - gestion of homespun in
Whittier	LOCATION	's verse .

		One of his first effusions , happily rescued from ob -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 livion by the memory of an older sister , ran thus : '' And must I always swing the flail , And help to fill the milking-pail ?

		I wish to go away to school ; I do not wish to be a fool . ''

		A production even more unpromising than the above was an attempt at a rhymed catalogue of his father 's library a theme , however , that must have heavily handicapped a stronger Muse .

		Here are four of the verses : ''
William Penn	PERSON	's laborious writing .

		And a book ` gainst Christians fighting . ''

		A book concerning
John	PERSON	's Baptism ,
Elias Smith	PERSON	's Universalism . ' '

		How
Rollins	PERSON	to obtain the cash , Wrote a dull history of trash .

		`` And Tufts , too , though I will be civil , Worse than an incarnate devil . ''

		It is pretty hard to reconcile these harrow - ing pieces with the boy 's honest admiration for and study of the memorable volume of Burns ; but Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	's talent , as we have shown , was late in flowering .

		Touching the rhymed wish , quoted above , '' to go away to school , '' it is interesting to note that its fulfilment was brought about partly through the intercession of
Whittier	LOCATION	's future co - laborer ,
William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	, then -LRB- 1826 -RRB- editor of the weekly '' Free Press , '' in New - buryport .

		Whittier had contributed a poem -LRB- probably a vast improvement upon the above productions -RRB- , entitled `` The Deity , '' to this journal ; and
Garrison	PERSON	thought so well of it that he not only drove out fourteen miles to see his new contributor , but introduced his poem editorially as follows : '' The author of the following graphic sketch , which would do credit to riper years , is a youth of only six - teen , who we think bids fair to be another
Bernard Bar	PERSON	- ton , of whose persuasion he is .

		His poetry bears the stamp of true genius , which , if carefully cultivated , will rank him among the poets of his country . ''

		It would seem from this that
Garrison	PERSON	, the destined hero of the anti-slavery agitation , was the first to point out the poetic promise of its future bard .

		Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	's second volume is largely made up of Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	's letters ; and these singu - larly frank and unstudied missives enable us better than volumes of labored analysis to see and understand the writer .

		The letters to
Holmes	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Channing	LOCATION	,
Sumner	PERSON	,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, and others , offer a rich field for quotation , but we must limit ourselves to the following , addressed to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	,
Dec.	DATE	.

		17 , 1879 : '' Thy note received the evening before my birthday made me very happy .

		Among the many kind greetings which reach me on this anniversary , thine has been most welcome , for a word of praise from thee is prized more highly than all , though I do not undervalue any one 's love or friendship .

		I have often since I met thee in
Boston	LOCATION	thought of thy remark that we four singers seem to be isolated set apart as it were in lonely compan - ionship , garlanded as if for sacrifice , the world about us waiting to see who first shall falter in his song , who first shall pass out of the sunshine into the great shadow !

		There is something pathetic in it all .

		I feel like clasp - ing closer the hands of my companions .

		I realize more and more that fame and notoriety can avail little in our situation ; that love is the one essential thing , always welcome , outliving time and change , and going with us into the unguessed possibilities of death .

		There is noth - ing so sweet in the old Bible as the declaration that ' God is Love . '

		I am no Calvinist , but I feel in looking over my life double-motived and full of failures that I can not rely upon word or work of mine to offset sins and shortcomings , but upon Love alone . ''

		Dear H. , we began together in
Buckingham	LOCATION	's ' Mag - azine , ' and together we are keeping step in the ' At - lantic . '

		Not evenly , indeed , for thy step is lighter and freer than mine .

		How many who began with us have fallen by the way !

		The cypress shadows lie dark about us , but I think thee contrive to keep in the low wester - ing sunshine more than I can . ''

		Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	's book is likely to meet the wide appreciation it deserves ; for
Whittier	LOCATION	is of all our considerable poets the one nearest the pop - ular heart and understanding .

		He is the most essentially and uniformly native of all ; and in his works if anywhere is found that '' flavor of the soil '' that we read so much about nowa - days and meet so little of .

		He is the true Theocritus of '' stern
New England	LOCATION	's hills and vales '' ; and the voice of her streams , the song of her birds , and the scent of her flowers is in his verse .

		This distinctive home-keeping qual - ity has found touching recognition .

		When the '' low westering sun '' had vanished , and the '' cypress shadows '' were merged in final dark - ness , it was in a grave lined with the native fern and golden-rod that
Whittier	LOCATION	was laid to rest .

		The thought thus beautifully symbolized finds expression in a verse from Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's tribute to his friend : '' The wild flowers springing from thy native sod , Lent all their charms thy new-world song to fill , Gave thee the mayflower and the golden-rod To match the daisy and the daffodil . ''

		E. G. J .

		THE second volume of Mrs.
Garnett	PERSON	's new translation of Tourgue ` nieff gives us '' A
House of Gentlefolk	ORGANIZATION	, '' which title , we need hardly say , corresponds to the more familiar ''
Lisa	PERSON	'' and '' A Nest of Noblemen . '' ''

		Step - niak , '' who contributes an introduction , outlines the his - torical and social significance of this immortal work , and hints once or twice at an esoteric sense in which it should be taken to be fully understood .

		The transla - tion , which we understand to be made directly from the Russian , is excellent .

Dec. 1	DATE	, THE ANTIQUITY OF E VOLUTION .

		* Professor
Henry Fairfield Osborn	PERSON	has ren - dered an important service by the preparation of a concise history of the growth of the idea of Evolution .

		The chief contributions of the different thinkers from
Thales	ORGANIZATION	to
Darwin	PERSON	are brought into clear perspective , and a just esti - mate of the methods and results of each one is reached .

		The work is extremely well done , and it has an added value of great importance in the fact that the author is a trained biolo - gist .

		Dr.
Osborn	PERSON	is himself one of the author - ities in the science of Evolution , to which he has made important contributions .

		He is there - fore in a position to estimate the value of sci - entific theories more justly than would be pos - sible to one who approached the subject from the standpoint of metaphysics or that of litera - ture .

		Dr.
Osborn	PERSON	has endeavored to make clear the fact of the continuity of thought in Evolution : '' Evolution has reached its present fulness by slow additions during twenty-four centuries .

		When the truths and absurdities of Greek mediseval and sixteenth to nineteenth century speculation and observation are brought together , it becomes clear that they form a con - tinuous whole , that the influences of early upon later thought are greater than has been believed , that
Darwin	PERSON	owes more even to the Greeks than we have ever rec - ognized ... The Evolution law was reached , not by any decided leap , but by the progressive development of every subordinate idea connected with it until it was recognized as a whole by
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	and later by
Darwin	PERSON	. ''

		The study of the work of these various thinkers as contained in this book suggests to us , however , that the year
1858	DATE	, before which '' speculation far outran fact , '' does mark a very decided '' leap '' in the history of Evolu - tion as a science .

		The '' leap '' was not that of a change in thought or in theory , but in method of work .

		The pre-Darwinian writers , for the most part , had been engaged with the theory of Evolution and with its factors as determined by the methods of philosophy .

		The facts of nature served them as illustrations of their theories , not as the basis from which their theories must of necessity arise .

		Darwin de - termined to '' collect blindly every sort of fact which could bear in any way '' on what are species .

		On the collection of such facts , in this spirit , by the great biologist of our century and by his successors , the fabric of Evolution as we know it to-day must rest .

		of philosophical deduction has contributed little to its progress .

		Given the facts as we know them now , or even as given us by
Darwin	PERSON	alone , and our chief conclusions could be reached by an automatic logic machine , if such a contriv - ance could be devised .

		The main inductions are plain , and the unsolved problems still re - maining can be solved only by a return to the same methods .

		It is certainly true , I think , that all the known factors in organic Evolution were known to the ancients , and .

		the reality of each individual one of them has been insisted upon by many differ - ent writers before
Darwin	PERSON	.

		Their relative im - portance and their interrelations were less fre - quently recognized .

		It is true , also , that the fact of derivation itself has never been wholly absent from philosophic thought .

		But the fol - lowing considerations seem to mark a break in continuity as a result of
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's method : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The doctrine of Special Creation was never so strongly intrenched , either in the popular mind or in scientific literature , as in
1858	DATE	, in spite of the onslaughts of all the earlier evolu - tionists .

		The minor errors of fact in the illus - trations chosen by
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	and his successors counted for more than the truth in their phil - osophic speculations .

		The errors were tangi - ble , the truths were not .

		In the aggregate no progress had been made toward the reception of these truths .

		But the doctrine of Special Creation crumbled with the advent of the
Ori	PERSON	- gin of Species .

		This was not due to the weight of
Darwin	PERSON	's authority , nor to the boldness of his speculations .

		It was due to the soundness of his method .

		He appears as the interpreter of nature ; and the naturalists who followed him became '' Darwinians '' because their own studies led them to the same results .

		No other conclusions were possible to them .

		At the same time , no one could forecast the conclusions of one who should follow the u method '' of Eras - mus
Darwin	PERSON	, or of Buffon , or of
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	, or of any other writer whose study of details served to illustrate a philosophical conception .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Had
Darwin	PERSON	's studies resulted otherwise , had his collection of facts led us to wholly dif - ferent conclusions , whatever these were , we should still be able to show the continuity of speculation .

		In any case ,
Darwin	PERSON	's indebted - ness to his predecessors would be exactly what it is now .

		In other words , there is probably no philo - sophical conception of the operations of life , whether true or false , that has not been held by someone .

		Every conceivable theory has been

		THE DIAL 331 thought out .

		It is the business of science to test these theories by the slow but certain method of induction , to collect , '' more or less blindly , every sort of fact , '' and to follow whith - ersoever these facts lead .

		THE PROBLEM OF THE UNEMPLOYED .

		* Mr.
Geoffrey Drage	PERSON	, the able secretary of the recent
Royal Commission on Labor	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, has written a suggestive book upon the unem - ployed .

		His facts are those secured by the
Royal Commission	ORGANIZATION	largely through his own efforts , and by the
Board of Trade of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is the best summary of what had been done in
Europe	LOCATION	to help the unemployed prior to the
summer of 1893	DATE	.

		The results of the very interesting municipal experiments to re - lieve the unemployed by work in
the winter of 1893-4	DATE	were not published in time for Mr.
Drage	PERSON	's use .

		The writer well divides the prob - lem into the removal of the causes of the un - employed and into relief for the unemployed who are present with us .

		In the matter of pre - vention , he suggests moral , intellectual , and technical education , better sanitation , factory legislation , the building , by municipalities and private benevolence , of model tenement homes , and some check , if possible , upon the rush of country people to displace the workers in the city .

		These remedies would deal with the pre - vention of a permanent surplus , he thinks , pro- viding the contaminating influence of the exist - ing stock of unemployed could be eliminated by the relief measures which are further re - ferred to .

		As for the temporarily unemployed , our au - thor holds that much of this evil is inevitably caused by the dependence of industry upon the supply of materials from abroad ; by the state of the weather ; by the uncertainty of foreign in - vestments , and lack of confidence in them .

		He suggests that certain of these causes are remov - able , for example , -LRB- 1 -RRB- capricious changes of fashion , for which the public must realize they are responsible ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- fluctuations in demand , due to changes in seasons , a matter for which employers and the public must realize their re - sponsibility , and give their orders more in ad - vance ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- excessive and immoral speculation , leading to loss of commercial confidence , a matter in which he again invokes public opin - * THE UNEMPLOYED .

		ion , holding employers to moral responsibility , but also urges a revision of the laws relative to trade speculation , adulteration , and fraudulent bankruptcy ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- inability to forecast fluctua - tions of trade , a partial remedy for which is reliable government trade statistics ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- trade disputes , demoralizing industry , his remedy being more of conciliation and arbitration ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- immobility of labor , his remedy being the development of trade-union and voluntary em - ployment bureaus , nationally and locally con - ducted without an eye for profit .

		But the remedy urged by the socialist for disorganized labor , he dismisses as not immediately prac - ticable .

		As regards the relief measures for the pres - ent unemployed , our author thinks we must divide the problem into relief for the perma - nently and for the temporarily unemployed .

		For the former , he suggests a rigid execution of the English poor-law and the use of chari - table and religious agencies .

		Labor colonies , he thinks , have been shown in
Germany	LOCATION	to be of little value for the mass of workers , but they are most useful for discovering those who are reclaimable among the permanently and chron - ically unemployed .

		Mr.
Drage	PERSON	would have the labor colony located in country districts to which .

		the permanently unemployed might be sent .

		If , after awhile , they do not earn their maintenance , they should be handed over to the harsher treatment of other agencies .

		It is in the treatment of the temporarily unemployed that Mr.
Drage	PERSON	has written most at length .

		He believes in voluntary relief works , main - tained locally , but national in application , and conducted in harmony with a central voluntary office or bureau , to prevent a rush of the un - employed to the districts where relief work is given .

		Employment bureaus should be both local and central , and voluntary , not state .

		The men given work should earn the wages paid , but should work but half time , in order to have time on their hands to seek permanent situa - tions , and in order to prevent sufficient earn - ings to draw a man from regular industry .

		In case the unemployed are concentrated in a few places and there is work in other places , they are to be forced to remove to where the central employment bureau showed that there was work , on penalty , Mr.
Drage	PERSON	probably means , of losing all relief .

		Only in times of excep - tional distress does Mr.
Drage	PERSON	believe in local public relief works , because he greatly fears that such relief will foster the idea that the
State	ORGANIZATION	ought to find work for its citizens , and 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, because public authorities can not so easily in - vestigate the character of applicants as can pri - vate agencies for their relief .

		Despite these weaknesses of public relief work , it seems sure to grow , and to be necessary where private re - lief work proves insufficient .

		Amid growing democracy and socialistic feeling among the masses , private charitable agencies can not con - trol the field unless they seek the cooperation on their committees of labor leaders .

		Even then , public relief work will make much pro- gress .

		In considering Mr.
Drage	PERSON	's suggestions , we must judge them with reference to what is im - mediately practicable , since the suggestion of such remedies is all he means to give .

		Looked at in that light , his book has great suggestive - ness and value ; though as a keen study of the permanent causes of the unemployed , it is not equal , by any means , to certain chapters in
Hobson	PERSON	's '' Evolution of Modern Capitalism , '' and some other economic discussions .

		This book of Mr.
Drage	PERSON	should be read in connec - tion with the clear and concise article in the
July	DATE	'' Annals of the American Academy '' on '' Charity and the Unemployed , '' by
J. G. Brooks	PERSON	.

		also by the increasing number of volumes into which the better of these stories are thought worthy of collection .

		We fancy that the symptom is not unrelated to the tendency which , in our newspapers , is condensing editorials into paragraphs , and which , in our popular entertainments , is substituting '' acts '' and '' features '' for presentations of sustained and coherent art .

		We do not object to the short story per se , but it is possible that we have something too much of it , even allowing for all the refinements and the subtleties that so many writers are lending it nowadays .

		The last few weeks ' output of fiction , for example , includes no less than a dozen collec - tions containing , in all , close upon one hundred stories of such merit , or signed with such names , that they can not pass unnoticed , besides many oth - ers that we have not space to discuss .

		One of the latest of these collections presents our recent visitor and old friend , Dr.
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	, in a new light .

		The title , '' Round the Red Lamp , '' covers a multitude , numbering no less than fifteen , of stories and sketches based upon , or suggested by , the author 's professional experience as a medi - cine man .

		There is a great deal of '' shop '' in this volume , and a zest not altogether pleasant is given by the grewsome incidents with which the tales are provided ; but the most difficult situations are car - ried off with the literary cleverness that makes of the
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	series so much more than a string of mere detective stories , and invests seem - ingly unpromising material with fascination , grim though it may be in the present instance .

		This sort of thing is not , any more than the detective series already mentioned , representative of Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	's real powers , and , skilful as it is , we can not help grudging the time thus spent by the author of such noble historical fiction as ''
Micah Clarke	PERSON	'' and '' The White Company . ''

		Some three or four years ago , the readers of '' The Fortnightly Review '' were regaled with a peculiarly nauseating compound of piety and im - morality in the shape of `` A Modern Idyll , '' a story by Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	, the editor of the '' Review . ''

		It introduced to us a Baptist clergyman of Kan - sas
City	LOCATION	, in love with the wife of one of the deacons of his church , the affection not unrequited .

		Other delineations of American society in the far West appeared in later issues of the '' Review , '' and the astonishment of its readers was not permitted to subside .

		Presently the '' Revue des Deux Mondes , '' always on the watch for queer American things , translated one of these stories , '' Elder Conklin '' by name ; and the sapient Frenchman , as he read of the extraordinary doings of ''
Conklin	PERSON	1 ` Ancien , '' doubtless opened his eyes very wide , and said to himself : `` This is surely the real thing ; now we see ces Americains as they actually are . ''

		There are six of the stories in all , and they form a volume to which '' Elder Conklin '' gives his name .

		As tran - scripts of American life , even in
Kansas	LOCATION	and other remote localities , they are grotesquely inadequate ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 333 and their very crudity is doubtless what recom - mends them to the foreigner unacquainted with our civilization .

		Many an Englishman , we fancy , will take them very seriously as seriously , for example , as he took Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's '' Story of a Country Town '' a few years ago .

		To us , who can make the neces - sary allowances and supply the missing links , they are merely amusing ; but it is not to be denied that they are that , in a marked degree .

		It is instructive to compare these stories with Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	's masterly treatment of similar ma - terial , and opportunity for the comparison is just now afforded by the eight stories which '' The Bell - Ringer of Angel 's '' leads off .

		In place of the baldness of Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's superficial delineations , we have equally dramatic incidents , interpenetrated with humor , and set against a richly romantic back - ground .

		Will Mr.
Harte	PERSON	never exhaust his imag - inative resources ?

		A few years of early manhood spent in contact with the civilizations of the West the new civilization of the American pioneer and the old mellow civilization of the Spaniard and behold , a supply of incident available for a lifetime of production .

		Besides the novels of more ambi - tious scope , Mr.
Harte	PERSON	must have penned something like two hundred sketches and stories of Western character , and there is hardly a trace of weariness in the newest of the collections .

		The present vol - ume is , however , diversified by some Scotch consu - lar experiences , by the fascinating '' Johnnyboy , '' which simply can not be described , and by a humor - ous reminiscence entitled `` My First Book . ''

		The book in question was an anthology of
California	LOCATION	poets , and the humor is in the depiction of the `` woolly '' journalism of the
Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	, the unreconstructed , displays his usual strength , penetration , and feeling in '' The Burial of the Guns , '' which , with five other numbers , makes up his latest volume .

		They are studies of character rather than stories , and breathe the warmest devotion to the
State	ORGANIZATION	and the Cause already so many times celebrated by the author .

		Whatever one 's attitude towards the Southern Con - federacy , he can hardly fail to be moved by the purely human quality of these sketches , some of which do not even touch upon the debatable ground , and all of which are written straight from the heart .

		The story of `` Little Darby , '' in particular , is one of those tales of unrequited humble heroism that are irresistible in their appeal to the sympa - thies .

		As for '' My Cousin Fanny , '' with its soupqon of irony , and its gentle humor , it is a delineation masterly in every stroke .

		The good work of observing and recording the evanescent phases of local civilization upon this vast American continent goes steadily on .

		The army of workers is a large one , and the future student of our shifting life will find few nooks and corners of the land that have not had their artist .

		If noth - ing more can be said of the majority of these work - ers than that they are painstaking and truthful , it will be enough to entitle them to the thanks of those who come after .

		Miss
Anna Fuller	PERSON	's thir - teen transcripts from a
Colorado	LOCATION	sketch-book , col - lectively named '' Peak and Prairie , '' are certainly both truthfully and carefully wrought .

		They reflect the stir , the freshness , and even the crudity of the pioneer region with which they deal .

		Hardly elab - orate enough to deserve the name of stories , they are , within their limits , singularly engaging , and their interest , although quiet , is none the less gen - uine .

		A more romantic background than the mining camps of
Colorado	LOCATION	can supply relieves the eleven stories for they are stories , this time told by Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	, of
Old California	LOCATION	in the days '' Be - fore the Gringo Came . ''

		The stories more than verge upon the melodramatic , and their passion seems a little too theatrical to be justified even by the hot-blooded race of which they are told .

		Nor is the language any more restrained than the senti - ment .

		Those which deal with the actual arrival of the '' gringo '' are the best , and we get from them some vivid glimpses of the fascinating history of the place and period concerned .

		The four somewhat inconclusive tales or sketches that make up ''
Marsena	PERSON	and Other Stories of the Wartime '' are by no means to be reckoned with Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's best work , but they contribute an acceptable mite to our knowledge of what men were thinking and doing in the rural districts dur - ing the four years of our great civil convulsion .

		Most of us who were boys at that time have suffi - ciently vivid recollections of the period to enter with close sympathy into the feeling of these homely episodes , typical as they are of what was going on in thousands of other Northern hamlets .

		It is well that even boyish impressions of the period should be fixed before time has faded or effaced them , and Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	here , as well as elsewhere , has done his full share of the work .

		The special field of
Mrs. Catherwood	ORGANIZATION	's labors lies far back of the reach of recollection , but she is one of the few writers who can really project them - selves into the remote past , and whose sympathies can find in the mustiest of records the palpitating life that most of us can find only in the memory of what we have personally known .

		To praise her new volume of seven stories , headed by `` The Chase of Saint-Castin , '' is but to repeat what we have said upon many earlier occasions , for the touch is still delicate and firm , the charm unfailing .

		The
Illi	PERSON	- nois country is the field of two of these tales ; the others lie about the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, one of them ''
Wolfe	PERSON	's Cove '' casting a side light upon the momentous scene upon the Heights of Abraham that fixed the destinies of two nations .

		In the excellent company of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	and Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, and in the tasteful form of the series known as ''
Harper	PERSON	's American Story Tellers , '' there come to us two volumes fathered -LRB- or mothered -RRB- respectively by Mr.
John	PERSON	334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Kendrick Bangs and Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spof	PERSON	- ford .

		Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's book , `` A Scarlet Poppy and Other Stories , '' comes as a reminder - that the younger generation is not yet to be permitted a monopoly of story-telling , and , indeed , as an exam - ple of work so artfully conceived that most of the younger generation would do well to profit by its example .

		These seven tales , with their shrewd and gentle humor , their unquestionable hold upon hu - man life , and their touches of the fantastic , make us regret that we hear so little of late from the Merrimac island-home of their writer .

		They do new honor even to Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's already honor - able place in our literature , and may be read with unalloyed satisfaction from the first page to the last .

		If there is a touch of fantasy in Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's volume , there is hardly anything but the fantastic in `` The Water Ghost and Others . ''

		In these eight stories by Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	, the freakish humor known to readers of `` Mr.
Toppleton	PERSON	's Client '' dis - ports itself unchecked .

		The old ghost story took the supernatural too seriously ; the new , as exem - plified by Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	and the present writer , makes it chiefly a .

		vehicle for fun , and we may add that the new is a great improvement upon the old .

		Anything more delicious in their way than '' The Ghost Club '' and '' The Spectre Cook of
Bangle	LOCATION	- top '' is not often met with .

		So delightful a com - mingling of the prosaic with the weird as the story of the '' Psychical Prank , '' which filled a
New York	LOCATION	street-car with astral bodies , or the tale of the too material spoons which the ghostly King Ferdinand presented to the too-confiding nephew of a conser - vative uncle , deserves more than passing mention .

		To imagine such things at all is a gift ; to set them forth with their present verisimilitude is an art in its kind almost incomparable .

		Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	is indefatigable in trans - lating into English the works of
Henryk Sienkie	PERSON	- wicz .

		Just now he offers us a volume of relatively trifling worth , containing four stories or sketches .

		They will not lack an audience , for the name of their author claims attention for anything he may have written ; but they hardly suggest the genius that conceived the great Polish trilogy of love and war , or even the keen analyst to whom we owe `` Without Dogma . ''

		Only one of the sketches is Polish in subject ; another describes a Spanish bull-fight ; the remaining two ''
Lillian Morris	PERSON	'' and '' Sachem '' are fruits of the author 's sojourn in the regions of our own pioneer civilization .

		In dealing with American themes , the author is not quite dans son assiette , and his descriptions are not altogether in touch with American feeling .

		Still , there is a certain impressiveness , particularly in the longest story of all , which tells of a band of forty - niners who took the overland route to the Califor - nian El Dorado , and endured grim hardships in their quest .

		It is curious to find the
Chicago	LOCATION	of
1849	DATE	described as a '' poor , obscure fishing village , not found on maps . ''

		This is one of many trifles which go to show that the author does not know his subject as well as , say , seventeenth - century Polish history .

		The collection of translated stories just mentioned may be coupled with the volume of '' Tales from the JEgean , '' by
Demetrios Bike	PERSON	` las , which the Mar - quis de
Queux de St. Hilaire	ORGANIZATION	translated from Greek into French , and which have been turned from French into English by Mr.
Opdycke	PERSON	.

		These facts , and many others of interest concerning the author of the tales , may be gleaned from the interesting introduction written for this translation by Major
H. A. Huntington	PERSON	.

		As for the author , he is already known to English readers by a translation of ''
Lou - kis Laras	PERSON	, '' his tale of a modern Greek merchant , who started in life as a shop-keeper , and who re - mained a shop-keeper at heart through all the stir - ring times of the Revolution .

		His literary activity has also been marked in several other directions , and he has a distinct claim upon our English grat - itude as the Greek translator of six of the plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		This translation is into colloquial Greek , and the iambic metre of fifteen syllables is employed .

		As Major
Huntington	LOCATION	puts it , he has '' lent to the strongest and sweetest voice in the English choir almost the accents of JEschylus . ''

		This were a feat indeed , but doubts as to the pos - sibility of its accomplishment need not lessen our thankfulness to the man who has attempted it .

		Certainly , the reader of the eight tales now pub - lished will be prepared to share in any moderate enthusiasm for their writer . ''

		Simple in motive , pure in sentiment , sometimes enlivened with humor , but oftener pervaded with ideal melancholy , '' they come to us as a joyful surprise , and invite compari - son with the great masters .

		Particularly do they suggest Tourgue ` nieff , whose method and whose re - straint they exhibit in a remarkable degree .

		We should be much surprised to learn that the author had not carefully studied , and been profoundly in - fluenced by , the work of the great Russian .

		Hun - dreds of little touches reveal the spiritual kinship of the two men , although the deep tragic note seldom missing in the analyst of the steppe becomes muted in the pages of our .

		ZEgean analyst .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		MR.
WALTER BESANT	PERSON	has this to say of the workings of our Copyright Act : `` It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the Copyright Act has given a great im - petus to American work .

		While English work could he had for nothing , the American author in every branch was fatally overweighted .

		This obstacle removed , we begin to see what we expected the great bulk of the literature of the States written by their own people , and only the exceptionally useful and popular authors of this country being published there .

		This proportion we may expect to find every year greater in favor of American writers .

		At the same time there will be found on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	a great and always increasing demand for the work of the first and best . ''

		THE DIAL 335 HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		i. Pursuant to our custom , the
Holiday Publications	ORGANIZATION	received for review by
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	will be noticed in two instalments the earlier arrivals in the pres - ent issue , the later ones in that of
December 16	DATE	.

		Priority of mention does not necessarily imply pri - ority of importance , some of the more notable of the season 's books often being late in making their appearance .

		The output of the season promises to be a fairly good one surprisingly good , in fact , when one considers the uninspiring commercial con - ditions that prevailed six months or more ago , when the works that are now appearing were being planned .

		The publishers have wisely pursued a somewhat conservative course in their holiday un - dertakings .

		There is a lack of the gorgeous quarto and folio volumes , representing enormous outlays to the publisher and costing the purchaser from fif - teen to fifty dollars , which have been so marked a feature of former years ; and in place of these we have the modest but attractive reprints of standard works , which are always unexceptionable for the purposes of holiday gifts .

		A book costing more than ten dollars excepting works in sets is , indeed , something of a rarity this season .

		A few ambitious and costly volumes have appeared , and there are other less expensive works representing the best ef - forts of our artists and publishers , and presenting to us some old favorite or newly-found friend decked in winning and irresistible charms .

		Among them all , those tastes and wishes must be hard to suit which do not find their due account .

		Our list may be suitably headed with a sumptu - ous four-volume edition , limited to 1000 copies and re-edited by Mr.
G. F. Russell Barker	PERSON	, of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's '' Memoirs of the Reign of
George III	PERSON	. ''

		-LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		In the material features of these beau - tiful volumes the most captious will find little to cavil at .

		With their moderate-sized yet clear type , elegant hand-made paper , fair margins , and sub - stantial covers of crimson buckram stamped in gold with the
Walpole	LOCATION	arms , they present an ensemble which the finical owner of the
Strawberry Hill Press	ORGANIZATION	might himself have approved of .

		Like almost every - thing
Walpole	LOCATION	wrote , the Memoirs are immensely readable .

		They cover a period of great political importance ; and while their life and piquancy are patent , their serious historical value is sometimes lost sight of .

		They belong to the good old-fashioried type of history which aims to be a narrative , and little else ; and history , as
M. Scherer	PERSON	says , `` is first of all a narrative . ''

		If
Walpole	LOCATION	is seldom deep , he is never dull ; if he is seldom weighty , he is never pedantic .

		He had to a rare degree the gift of making his dramatis personce live and act out their parts before us .

		They are people of flesh and blood not the mere names or abstract arithmet - ical units of more philosophical historians .

		Says Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	: '' Turn over any of the proper decorous history books , mark every passage , where for a moment we seem to be transported to the past to the thunders of
Chatham	LOCATION	, the drivellings of
Newcastle	LOCATION	, or the prosings of
George Grenville	PERSON	, as they sounded in contemporary ears and it will be safe to say that , on counting them up , a good half will turn out to be the reflections from the illuminating flashes of
Walpole	LOCATION	. ''

		Gossipping Hor - ace will live long after many a more pretentious historian has been relegated to the dust-bin ; and the present holiday edition of his best historical work will doubtless continue for some time to be a model one .

		The term '' holiday gift-book '' is necessarily a somewhat elastic one , and can by no means be lim - ited to the elegant specialties that are designed pri - marily for Christmas sales .

		Any good book is of course a suitable gift-book , especially when embel - lished with attractive illustrations and clad in hand - some dress .

		Foremost among the season 's elegant editions of standard books is the
Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	's reprint of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	's great historical works , '' History of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	and the Empire of
France	LOCATION	under Napoleon '' and '' History of the French Revolu - tion , '' the former in twelve volumes and the latter in five , uniform in typography and binding , and in illustrations from steel plates .

		The sets are sold separately .

		Of the works themselves it is of course not necessary to speak ; they are among the most standard of historical works , and indispensable for the field they cover .

		The translations are the au - thentic ones of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	and Stebbing for the '' Consulate '' and of
Frederick Shoberl	PERSON	for the `` Rev - olution . ''

		The works are printed from new type , and purchasers of the more substantial sort of gift - books will thank the enterprise of Messrs.
Lippin	PERSON	- cott for providing these really sumptuous editions .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a new and en - larged edition of Mr.
Joseph	PERSON	PennelPs standard treatise on '' Pen Drawing and
Pen Draughtsmen	PERSON	, '' a study of the art as practiced to-day , with techni - cal suggestions .

		There are over four hundred illus - trations from originals by Sir
F. Leighton	PERSON	,
Messrs. J. E. Millais	PERSON	,
F. Burne Jones	ORGANIZATION	,
Abbey	LOCATION	,
Holman Hunt	PERSON	,
A. Parsons	PERSON	,
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	, and many others , the value of which to the art-student can scarcely be over-estimated .

		Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's book , at the date of its first appearance in
1889	DATE	, met with the cordial and general approval of those best qual - ified to judge of it ; and it is safe to pronounce it hors concours in its class .

		As an art-work of actual and solid value , nothing on our list surpasses it Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's recent articles in '' The Century Magazine '' on '' The Reign of Queen Anne '' have , very fittingly , been formed into a fine gift-book one of the best of the season by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The theme is perennially attractive , and Mrs.
Oli	PERSON	- phant treats it with her usual freshness and anima - tion .

		The characters of the Churchills ,
Harley	PERSON	,
Godolphin	LOCATION	,
St. John	LOCATION	, Swift ,
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Defoe	PERSON	, Addi - son ,
Steele	PERSON	, and other more or less brilliant satel - lites of that comparatively rayless primary the stupid 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, and all too trusting
Anne	PERSON	, are admirably drawn .

		For the Queen herself '' the church 's wet-nurse ,
Goody Anne	PERSON	, '' as flippant
Walpole	LOCATION	styled her Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	has some words of judicious kindness .

		Anne has been roundly snubbed and laughed at by everybody , from
Macaulay	LOCATION	down ; but the fact re - mains that she was one of the few sovereigns who may without hyperbole be said to have been loved in her day .

		She was a good wife , a good woman , a good friend , and what was then politically very much to the purpose a good Protestant .

		Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's book is pleasant reading , and it makes a goodly show outwardly , with its fine print and pa - per , its richly tooled binding , and its thirty-three sound wood-engravings .

		Among the latter are por - traits of
Anne	PERSON	,
John Evelyn	PERSON	,
Defoe	PERSON	,
William III.	PERSON	, the Marlboroughs ,
Burnett	PERSON	, Swift , ''
Stella	PERSON	, '' and
Addison	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's dainty holiday edition , with illustrations by Messrs.
George Whar	PERSON	- ton
Edwards	PERSON	and
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	, of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's `` The Last Leaf '' appears with a melan - choly opportuneness .

		In the touching letter , dated
July 12 , 1894	DATE	, prefixed in facsimile to the volume , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	says : '' I am one of the very last of the leaves which still cling to the bough of life that budded in the
Spring	DATE	of the nineteenth century '' ; and now this leaf too has fluttered to earth , and the bough is indeed forsaken .

		Walt Whitman draws somewhere a fine and just distinction between '' lov - ing by allowance ' ' and '' loving with a personal love ' ' ; and in the limited class of authors whom we love as we do Lamb and
Goldsmith	PERSON	with '' a personal love , '' and not , as it were , by convention , the cheery Autocrat surely takes his place .

		The little book forms a timely and charming souvenir of its author .

		The poem is printed entire on the opening pages ; after which follow separate lines and stanzas , with decorative designs and illustrations interspersed .

		A history of the poem , written by Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	in
1885	DATE	, is appended .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's inexpensive two - volume edition of '' The Count of Monte Cristo '' brings a neat , well-printed , fairly-bound copy of
Dumas	PERSON	's kaleidoscopic romance within range of all purses .

		There are eighteen illustrations by Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	, and commendable pains have been taken to secure a good text , ordinary English versions of the story having been tinkered into shape from some strange original that must itself have been bad enough in all conscience .

		Omissions have been supplied , additions expunged , solecisms corrected , nautical terms '' exported , '' and , in short , the English `` Monte Cristo '' has been , to quote
Sid	PERSON	-
ney Smith	PERSON	, metaphorically washed , shaved , brushed , and forced into clean linen , by the present editors .

		The publishers are to be credited with more than one praiseworthy deed in the way of making good editions of good books popularly accessible .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' luxurious '' Van Tassell '' edition of Irving 's `` Sketch Book '' is gen - erally similar in style to the '' Agapida , '' the `` Darro , '' and the `` Van Twiller '' editions of `` The Conquest of
Granada	LOCATION	, '' '' The
Alhambra	LOCATION	, '' and the '' Knickerbocker 's History of
New York	LOCATION	, '' respect - ively , of former seasons .

		To our thinking the lat - est publication is even more attractive than its pre - decessors .

		The border designs this time are dainty festoons of leaves and berries , etc. ; and there are thirty-two illustrations by
Messrs. Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Barraud	PERSON	,
Rackham	PERSON	,
Rix	PERSON	, and
Van Deusen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Van Tas - sell '' edition should prove one of the marked suc - cesses of the season .

		Little need be said in characterization of form or matter of
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	' superb two volume edition of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	's ''
Hypa	PERSON	- tia . ''

		The work is generally uniform with the same firm 's well-known editions of `` Ben Hur '' and `` The Cloister and the Hearth '' bindings of sea-green silk , lightly glazed paper , dainty typography , and a profusion of full-page and marginal drawings by Mr.
William Martin Johnson	PERSON	.


Kingsley	PERSON	's master - piece ranks with the classics of fiction ; and it is , to our taste , worthier of its present sumptuous set - ting than either of its popular predecessors assur - edly than the earlier of them .

		As an example of an art work resulting from the union of ripe learn - ing and forceful imagination , `` Hypatia '' has few rivals in its class in any language .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's drawings are for the most part well done , and form a running pictorial exposition of the text at once ornamental and instructive .

		A very taking and desirable edition , in two trim volumes , illustrated with fifty small drawings and eight full-page photogravures by Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	, of
Dickens	PERSON	's '' A Tale of Two Cities , '' is issued by
Messrs. Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like Thack - eray 's ''
Esmond	PERSON	, '' this novel is , when viewed with the body of its author 's works , something of a book apart ; and the publishers have done well in select - ing it for a special reprint .

		Good critics have pro- nounced it the author 's greatest novel ; and , consid - ered as a piece of pure constructive art , it probably is so .

		If he nowhere in it quite touches his highest level , there is certainly no other work of his in which the level reached is so well sustained .

		In his more characteristic books ,
Dickens	PERSON	sinks all too often into a bizarrerie of style , and a commonness , even a mawkishness , of sentiment , that offend his discriminating admirers .

		But in `` A Tale of Two Cities '' his taste seldom lapses , his inspiration sel - dom flags . ''

		There is , '' says
Forster	PERSON	, '' no other in - stance in his novels of a deliberate and planned departure from the method of treatment which had been preeminently the source of his popularity . ''

		The present edition is handy , sightly , and , style con - sidered , inexpensive .

		The true stories of '' Three Heroines of New En - gland Romance , ''
Priscilla Mullins	PERSON	,
Agnes Surriage	PERSON	, and
Martha Hilton	PERSON	, are gracefully set forth by Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	,
Miss Alice Brown	PERSON	, and Miss
Louise Imogen Guiney	PERSON	, in a tasteful volume

Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book about a book , or , better , about the illustrators of a book that is , of the Tennyson quarto pub - lished by
Moxon	PERSON	in
1857	DATE	, and soon to be repub - lished by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- And we may add , en passant , that we hope the latter firm will note Mr.
Ruskfn	PERSON	's statement that the original wood - cuts were in a few cases '' terribly spoiled in the cutting , and generally the best part , the expression of feature , entirely lost . ''

		These designs should cer - tainly be re-engraved . -RRB-

		In his appreciations of the quarto of
1857	DATE	, '' the most intrinsically valuable , '' he thinks , of all Tennysonian volumes , Mr.
Layard	PERSON	devotes himself mainly to the work of the three more prominent pre-Raphaelites
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Millais	PERSON	, and
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, to each of whom a separate chapter is given .

		There are a few interesting pages on the origin of the
P. R. B.	PERSON	; and here the au - thor joins issue with Mr.
Quilter	PERSON	, crediting the movement to
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, rather than to Ros - setti 's first master , the eccentric
F. Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tennyson , who was as insensible to pictorial art as
Shelley	PERSON	was to music , seems to have left his illus - trators to their own devices ; though in one or two cases he raised rather captious objections for in - stance , to Hunt 's noble , if rather dishevelled , '' Lady of Shalott . '' ''

		My dear Hunt , '' he exclaimed , on first seeing this plate , '' I never said the young wo - man 's hair was flying all over the shop ! ''

		`` No , '' calmly replied the painter , '' but you never said it was n't '' and , happily , the design stood .

		Mr.
Lay	PERSON	- ard 's book is interesting and critical in tone , and the nine illustrations -LRB- including two after water-color drawings by Mrs.
Rossetti	PERSON	-RRB- are well chosen and well reproduced .


Jane Austen	PERSON	illustrated by
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	forms a combination that discerning book-buyers should find hard to resist .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new edition of `` Pride and Prejudice '' offers these joint attractions ; and to round off the volume there is a capital introduction by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		Touching the friendly strife among Miss
Austen	PERSON	's adherents as to the relative merits of her books , Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	unhesitatingly awards the primacy to the present work .

		He finds it '' the most perfect , the most characteristic , the most eminently quintessen - tial '' of them all ; its hero is '' by far the best and most interesting of
Miss Austen	LOCATION	's heroes '' ; while as to its heroine he concludes , after calmly weigh - ing the competing charms of her rivals in his affec - tions , that '' to live with and to marry , I do not know that any one of the four can come into com - petition with
Elizabeth	PERSON	. ''

		The volume is uniform in make-up with the same firm 's well-known editions of ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' '' Our Village , '' etc. .

		In her '' Schools and Masters of Sculpture '' -LRB- Ap - pleton -RRB- ,
Miss A. G. Radcliffe	PERSON	essays to tell `` clearly , vividly , and accurately '' the story of the progress of plastic art from archaic times down to the pres - ent day a pretty difficult task in a moderate-sized 12mo volume of 560 odd pages .

		The author con - fines herself closely to facts , and these have been carefully and judiciously winnowed .

		Successive schools of sculpture the Egyptian , Assyrian , Greek , Roman , Mediaeval , and Modern are shown by the flash-light of single chapters , and the personality of the great masters is briefly set before us .

		Miss
Radcliffe	PERSON	has evidently '' got up '' the authorities carefully ; and her book , like its companion volume on painting , affords a useful and accurate birdseye view of the subject , and it should prove serviceable as a larger guide-book to European and American galleries and museums .

		There are thirty-five full - page plates in half-tone .

		Mr.
Laurence Hutton	PERSON	's `` Portraits in Plaster '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a vastly interesting , attractively mount - ed work though not , to our thinking , one exactly suggestive of Christmas cheer .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	, as the readers of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' have been made aware , is the happy possessor of the largest and fullest collection of death-masks in the world ; and the present volume contains photographic repro - ductions of seventy-two of them .

		The earliest casts are those of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Tasso	LOCATION	; the latest one is that of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	.

		They range from Sir
Isaac Newton	PERSON	, the wisest of men , to
Sambo	LOCATION	, the lowest type of the American negro ; from
Cromwell	LOCATION	to Clay ; from
Bonaparte	LOCATION	to
Grant	LOCATION	; from
Keats	PERSON	to
Leopardi	LOCATION	; from Pius IX .

		to
Tom Paine	PERSON	; from
Ben Gaunt	PERSON	, the pugilist , to Dr.
Chalmers	PERSON	, the light of the Scotch pulpit .

		Marat ,
Robespierre	LOCATION	,
Burke	PERSON	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Tom Moore	PERSON	, Mme.
Malibran	PERSON	, Swift ,
Brougham	LOCATION	,
Sherman	PERSON	, and other celebrities , stare stonily at us from Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's pages with an effect , as '' Mr.
Wegg	PERSON	'' delicately said of the home of his friend , '' Mr.
Venus	PERSON	, '' '' rather ghastly , all things considered . ''

		The nucleus of the collection was a half-dozen plaster casts found by a boy in a dust-bin .

		They came into Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's possession by chance , and from that time on he has been a collector , an amateur , of death-masks .

		Some would have chosen a more cheerful line of connoisseur - ship ; but , as
Yorick	ORGANIZATION	says , `` there 's no disputing about hobby-horses . ''

		The tale of Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's researches in the museums , studios , plaster-shops , and curiosity shops of half the capitals of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	would , he tells us , fill a fair volume ; 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, and he has traced and identified his trophies with much care .

		He is sure , for instance , that his is the actual death-mask of
Aaron Burr	PERSON	, because he has the personal guarantee of the maker of the mould ; he is equally certain of another cast , because he saw it made himself ; while as to a third , he has no manner of doubt , because , he frankly admits , '' I know the man who stole it . ''

		Mr.
Button	PERSON	's book is unique , and it has a decided -LRB- albeit rather grew - some -RRB- fascination .

		The value of the masks as por - traits is beyond question , and the descriptive text is chatty and informing .

		It seems a pity that so exquisitely artistic a set - ting should be lavished on so nonsensical a produc - tion as Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	's '' An Imaged World '' -LRB-
Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		What Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	is really driving at in his '' Poems in Prose , '' as he calls them , must , for the most part , remain a secret be - tween himself and his Maker ; but his illustrator , Mr.
William Hyde	PERSON	, has wrestled manfully with the problem , and has produced some pretty , if pardon - ably vague , drawings that partly redeem the text .

		The `` poems '' consist largely of rhapsodic addresses to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, mingled with amatory caterwaulings ad - dressed to no one in particular , of which the follow - ing may serve as a sample : '' Flower of my heart , would thou wert here on the hillside this dark eve of grey and windy autumn , and the dim greyish heavens and fleeing clouds were over our two heads .

		Girl , the sad wind is rising , O Girl ,
this night	TIME	that is falling will bring desolation into the heart of the world .

		I would thou wert by my fireside
this night	TIME	; ah , Girl-flower '' and so on for over a hundred pages .

		That a man should be willing to rush into print with this sort of thing in the age of Spencer , and
Darwin	PERSON	, and
Huxley	LOCATION	, and common - sense generally , passes understanding .

		A neat illustrated edition of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's `` Their Wedding Journey '' the inimitable account of the bridal tour of a couple '' no longer very young , but still fresh in the light of their love , '' in which the author takes occasion to '' talk of some ordinary traits of American life ... to speak a little of well-known and easily accessible places , to present now a bit of landscape and now a sketch of char - acter , '' is issued by
Messrs. Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is essentially a series of Ameri - can travel pictures and character sketches , thrown off with the author 's usual photographic and phono - graphic accuracy , and it is one of his crispest and cleverest works .

		Mr.
Clifford Carroll	PERSON	's drawings are acceptable , but hardly equal the snap and verve of the text .

		A second series of Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's '' Eight - eenth Century Vignettes , '' that will doubtless repeat the success of its popular predecessor of last year , is issued by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are twelve papers in all : '' The Journal to
Stella	PERSON	, '' '' The Topography of '
Humphry Clinker	PERSON	, ' '' '' Rich - ardson at Home , '' ''
Johnson	PERSON	's Library , '' ''
Rane	PERSON	- lagh , '' etc. themes in which Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	is very much at home , and which he handles with his usual piquancy and lightness of touch .

		The portraits of Swift ,
Dodsley	LOCATION	,
Richardson	PERSON	,
Garrick	PERSON	,
Smollett	PERSON	, Rou - billiac , and others , are notably good , and the volume altogether is a choice piece of book-making .

		Mr.
Mowbray Morris	PERSON	's compact edition of Bos - well 's `` Life of Johnson '' is issued in a neat two - volume reprint by
Messrs. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The type is new , bright , and open , the paper is good , the thirty-four full-page portraits are well chosen and well executed , and the price -LRB- three dollars -RRB- is low enough , certainly , for a sound copy of one of the richest works in any language .

		In annotating his work , Mr.
Morris	PERSON	did little more than to cull from his editorial predecessors , and he left
Boswell	PERSON	's notes intact .

		The present American editor has added some judicjkms selections from Dr.
Hill	PERSON	's notes , and he has wisely followed the latter 's exam - ple in restoring the original spelling of Dr.
John	PERSON	- son 's and his friends ' letters .

		The edition is , we should say , decidedly the best to be had for any - thing like the money .

		Another desirable reprint of standard literature from the press of
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is an edition in two octavo volumes of '' The Complete Poetical Works of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	. ''

		By printing the poems in double columns , compactness has been secured without unduly sacrificing size and clear - ness of type ; and the volumes , like other similar publications of this firm , challenge comparison with editions considerably more costly and pretentious .

		The text is carefully edited ; there is an admirable Introduction by Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, and a Biographical Sketch by
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.

		The frontispiece portrait of Sir
Walter	PERSON	is one of the best plates of the kind that we remember to have seen .

		The charm of ''
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	'' is perennial , and older readers who have experienced its delights , and desire their younger friends to share them in their turn , will welcome the new edition of the French classic issued by
Messrs. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translation includes a brief memoir of Saint -
Pierre	PERSON	, and the pretty but inexpensive volume is profusely illustrated with the drawings of
Leloir	PERSON	.

		Cost considered , we know of no comelier and handier shelf edition of Irving 's ever - charming '' Sketch-Book '' than the one now issued in two vol - umes by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes throughout are models of quiet tastefulness and sound workmanship .

		They are printed from new type , and contain the familiar wood-cuts of the '' Artists ' Edition . ''

		The desiderata of good taste and inexpensiveness are happily blended in
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	's tiny book - lets , `` Writing to
Rosina	LOCATION	, '' a novelette by Mr.
W. H. Bishop	PERSON	, and `` P'tit Matinic , '' a sheaf of thumb - nail sketches by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	.

		Both volumes are prettily illustrated and daintily bound in embossed sheep , and either may be slipped into the waistcoat pocket .

		THE DIAL 339 BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		I .

		This season 's publication of books for young readers is not only unusually large , but on the whole may be said to be of rather unusual interest and value .

		Some of our best writers , alive to the importance of this field , are sharing in the production of books of information , useful but by no means dry ; and in a few cases juveniles combining attractive narrative with a pure literary in - terest are offered .

		Even the fiction work with the ex - ception , possibly , of that of
Jules Verne	PERSON	and a few of the more trivial books for girls , has , it would seem , to assume an air of seriousness in order to get itself into no - tice .

		While there is good fun and plenty of it among the season 's publications for the young , such books as '' The Story of Alexander , '' `` Czar and Sultan , '' and `` The Century Book for Young Americans '' have a quality that makes for usefulness in any developing mind ; and there is this year rather less than the usual amount of that '' writing down '' to young readers which does so much harm .

		There is , of course , no real necessity for lowering artistic standards in order to reach the com - prehension of children , as their uncorrupted taste is ca - pable of enjoying the best art , provided it be simple ; and the recognition of this fact is improving the quality of children 's books .

		The reproduction of the great works of the older writers , in suitable form for the chil - dren of to-day , is much to be commended .

		Why should not certain stories from Homer , following closely the Butcher and
Lang	PERSON	translation , be edited and illustrated as superbly as is that narrative of old , '' The Story of Alexander '' ?

		And that tale of the middle ages , the friendship of Amis and Amile , to whose exquisite charm Mr.
Pater	PERSON	calls attention , would also , edited for children , have great literary value , to say nothing of its ennobling power .

		The tenderest age is none too early to begin setting before the child the simpler elements of literary beauty .

		The unexplored charm of new books is enhanced by illustrations which stir the fancy and train the eye .

		Those pictures which do not really illustrate detract from rather than aid the printed page , for most children have plenty of imagination of their own , and the great value to them of illustration is in properly directing their imagination and familiarizing them with good models in art .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's annual '' Fairy Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- has not always been so well illus - trated as it is this year by Mr.
Ford	PERSON	, and even now a timid child might well be alarmed at the frightful witches who have smuggled themselves between the covers .

		In his preface , which is really only a familiar talk with his young readers , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	pays his respects to Mr.
Laurence Gomme	PERSON	, President of the Folk-Lore Society , who '' does not think it very nice to publish fairy books , and above all , red , green , and blue fairy books . ''

		Though Mr.
Lang	PERSON	takes the liberty of mis - quoting Mr.
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	, his quiet sarcasm redeems him .

		Anyone who reads his grave assurance that the existence of fairies is a difficult question , that Profes - sor Huxley thinks there are none , though the Reverend Mr.
Baring-Gould	PERSON	saw several when he was a boy trav - elling with the Troubadours , and that '' probably a good many stories not perfectly true have been told about fairies , but such stories have also been told about
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon ,
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, and
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , all of whom certainly existed , '' may feel he would rather hear Mr.
Lang	PERSON	mis - quote than to hear other people recite volumes . ''

		The Enchanted Swans , '' the source of
Reineke	PERSON	's cantata , is in this '' Yellow Fairy Book , '' and also a Chinese tale , rescued from oblivion , from which the expression '' A little bird told me '' probably took its origin .

		Though the tales are gathered from many lands , and from such accomplished writers as
Andersen	LOCATION	,
Grimm	LOCATION	, and
Madame D'Aulnoy	PERSON	, none are more poetic or spiritual than those from the Red Indian , one from the Iroquois strongly suggesting , in its pathetic ending , the story of Orpheus and
Eurydice	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new edition of '' Tales from
Hans Andersen	PERSON	'' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- is illustrated by Mr.
E. A. Lemann	PERSON	, who has endeavored to embellish the tales more fitly than has been done before .

		This is , however , rather like paint - ing the lily ; since the chief interest remains in the tales themselves .

		Though Mr.
Lemann	PERSON	has been moderately successful , the illustrations are on the whole common - place .

		Mr.
Palmer Cox	PERSON	, inimitable as ever , has this year sent `` The Brownies around the World '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Poor sprites !

		They look dreadfully ill on their demo - cratic raft , but they learn the sage lesson that '' You ca n't through foreign countries roam And have the comforts of a home . ''

		They scale the Alps , they ride the crocodile ; they mor - alize soberly on the follies of idol-worship while toying with the gold ear-ring of Buddha ; but in the end they reach home safely , after having made the world their own .

		Adventures like these are sure to please the chil - dren .

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	, as usual , furnishes his own capital illus - trations .

		Though Mr.
Lang	PERSON	believes the successful invention of new fairy stories is rare , two at least are brought out this season .

		They are quite different in style , however , one by the
Countess of Jersey	ORGANIZATION	, entitled ``
Maurice	PERSON	, or the Red Jar '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , having an air of reality which makes it fascinating .

		It contains the conven - tional ingredients of fairy tales an enchanted castle , nixies , old dames , and the spirits of earth , water , and fire .

		These are combined in so novel a manner that one hardly regrets the absence of a princess .

		The cen - tral idea that expiation through suffering is the only cure for disobedience is very well worked out .

		No serious purpose , only amusement pure and simple , is the object of Mr.
Tudor Jenks	PERSON	, whose '' World 's Fair Book '' was among the more interesting of last year 's publications for boys and girls . ''

		Imaginotions '' -LRB- Cen - tury Co. -RRB- is likely to prove very popular , as it is a clever combination of wit and fancy , fact and fable .

		It would seem as though Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	must have had a prelim - inary view of all the fairy books of the season , for he has burlesqued them all . ''

		The Sequel , '' which is one of the best of the stories , describes the woes of the Hero after he marries the Princess , and tells how he lived unhappily ever after until he succeeded in throwing off the shackles of royalty .

		It is difficult to say which is funnier , '' The Sequel '' or the ''
Kaba ben Ephraf	PERSON	, '' the latter being a matter-of-fact individual who succeeds in life through a free use of the simple motto , '' If you do n't see what you want , ask for it . ''

		The comical idea of the Professor , who is convinced by the scientific rea - soning of the
Patagonian Giant	LOCATION	that it is his duty to let himself be eaten by that eloquent monster , is carried out with a dash and humor which '' Mark Twain '' himself has scarcely excelled .

		The book is worthily illustrated by
Messrs. Birch	PERSON	,
Drake	PERSON	,
Bensell	PERSON	,
Dan Beard	PERSON	, and Oli - ver
Herford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the stories have previously ap - peared in '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	. ''

		340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, '' The Story of Alexander , Retold from the Originals by
Robert Steele	PERSON	, Drawn by
Fred Mason	PERSON	and Published by
Macmillan	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' is the imposing title of what is probably the most marked departure from the conven - tional juvenile book of the present season .

		With pic - tures in black and white suggestive both of Mr.
Elihu Vedder	PERSON	and Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	, a rich and artistic bind - ing , and unexceptionable paper and print , the traditions that gathered round the figure of Alexander the Great have here received a truly noble setting .

		The tale is told with Homeric simplicity a tale of conquest and love , and of an unconquerable spirit .

		The bibliography of the story is of such interest that eight pages of the author 's '' Afterwords '' do not suffice to tell all the forms it has undergone .

		Probably many of the tradi - tions grew up soon after the death of Alexander , and since that time it has received additions from many tongues in many ages .

		But young readers are advised not to annoy their teachers in Greek history by putting any of it into their examination papers and , indeed , such a course would be dangerous , since the book con - tains no dates .

		Perhaps its purpose is best told in these lines from the '' Open Letter '' which takes the place of a preface : `` If it pleases you and shows you who were the heroes of our ancestors , and what were the stories they delighted in , it will have reached the object of your loving liegeman , R. S. '' The full-page illustra - tions , noble in design and execution , are worthy of se - rious study , and the head and tail pieces are rich in alle - gorical meaning .

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's fortunate auditor in his ''
Wagner	PERSON	Story Book '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a little girl ; though these enno - bling tales , like all folk-lore , are no less suitable for boys .

		The author 's style , in dealing with stories some - what involved , is clear , and while there is a certain awk - wardness in the use of the present tense throughout the book , another form would require the sacrifice of the conceit that the stories are being enacted in the burn - ing coals , an idea which gives life to the whole , and is always well sustained .

		A delicate fancy plays about the immortal German myths , and in the flames are seen
Wotan	PERSON	and the river nymphs , Parsifal and
Elsa	PERSON	, while the '' Magic Fire Scene '' glows again before the reader .

		The text is so picturesque that the illustrations might have been dispensed with , especially as their workman - ship is often indifferent .

		A curious contrast to the German myths , with their powerful human interest , is formed by the no less at - tractive Pueblo Indian folk stories written out for boys and girls by Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	in '' The Man who Married the Moon '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Great friendliness has sprung up between Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	and this interest - ing Indian tribe , about whom he knows and tells us much .

		Tales of craft abound , though the one which gives the book its title is full of poetry , and a keen sense of humor is everywhere apparent .

		The many predicaments of the coyote , in his domestic and social relations with other animals , are particularly laughable ; and the stories many of which are much older than the Spanish invasion of
North America	LOCATION	have also an ethnological interest .

		Altogether , the book , with its good drawings from photographs by the author , is full of charm both for young people and their elders .

		The adage '' Too many cooks spoil the broth '' is well illustrated in '' Bible Stories for the Young '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , where various scraps of scriptural meat are served up for young readers .

		Several well-known divines have assisted in the task , with the result that the flavor is by no means uniform .

		The stories of ''
David	PERSON	and
Jona	PERSON	- than '' and of '' Mary in the Garden of Gethesemane '' perhaps suffer less in the telling than the others ; but the Rev. Mr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	has wholly destroyed the sim - ple sweetness of the '' Story of the Nativity . ''

		The Bible story of
Isaac	PERSON	and
Rebekah	PERSON	, too , gains nothing from its writer 's suggestion that ''
Rebekah	PERSON	knew more than we are told about
Isaac	PERSON	, when she said so readily ' I will go , ' and started right off . '' ''

		The Century Book for Young Americans '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is issued under the auspices of the National So - ciety of the Sons of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purpose of the book , its scope and thoroughness of treat - ment , entitle it to a prominent position among the more serious juvenile publications .

		Under the guidance of a well-informed and kindly-disposed uncle , a party of young people visit
Washington	LOCATION	, to study the workings of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		The conversation of the tourists introduces , without effort , the historical cause for the creation of the different governmental departments , and the functions of each .

		The book is enlivened by glimpses of the social life of the capital , and by excursions to
Mount Vernon	LOCATION	,
Arlington	LOCATION	, and other points of romantic interest .

		The comments of the young visitors should excite the patriotism of every youthful American .

		Ex - cellent portraits of men who have distinguished them - selves as statesmen , soldiers , and citizens , as well as charming pictures of
Washington	LOCATION	itself , embellish the work .

		It may be mentioned , in passing , that an un - mistakable picture of the Woman 's
Temple	ORGANIZATION	is entitled '' One of
Chicago	LOCATION	's tall Buildings the Masonic Tem - ple '' ; an error which the author , Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	, should not have allowed to pass into print .

		Of books about foreign countries , '' The Land of Pluck '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in its dress of '' Dutch pink , '' is one of the most attractive .

		An idea of life in
Holland	LOCATION	, and of the determination and patience of that brave lit - tle country , is given with much picturesqueness , and with that simplicity of style which contributes so greatly to the success of its author , Mrs.
Mary Mapes Dodge	PERSON	, in writing for children .

		The text is ably supported by the pictures , which , in addition to several by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	, number several reproductions of the old Dutch masters , chiefly pictures of children .

		The se - ries of Dutch sketches is an amplified form of an arti - cle which appeared in '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' some years ago ; but the short stories that make up the second part of the volume , though not entirely new , have never before been published in book form .

		They are very sweet and wholesome in tone , in every way suitable for children . ''

		Czar and Sultan '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a. large volume of several hundred pages , is written with that fondness for circumstantial detail and love of anecdote which so facile a war correspondent as Mr.
Archibald Forbes	PERSON	would be apt to display .

		Though the author assumes the modest part of the young son of a Scotch grain mer - chant in
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	, it is plain that the book is largely one of personal reminiscences of the
Russo	PERSON	- Turkish campaign .

		Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	says as much in his preface , at the same time acknowledging his indebtedness to his colleagues , MacGahan and Mr.
Frank Millett	PERSON	, as well as to other sources .

		Of Mr.
Millet	PERSON	he says that his let - ters always read as if they had been written with a paint brush .

		In spite of his Russian sympathies , Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	is not slow to recognize the brave spirit of
Osman Pasha	PERSON	, as well as the splendid fighting powers of his subjects .

		A thrilling account of the dreadful suffering of the rem - nants of both armies after the fall of Plevna sufficiently
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 indicates that the Russians , if less inclined to butchery than their enemies , were yet capable of the passive cru - elty of neglect and an indifference to human distress of which it is difficult to conceive outside of barbarism .

		Just at this time the work is of especial interest , even beyond the circle of readers for whom it is intended , as the recent death of the Czar greatly enhances the value of anecdotes concerning him and
Nicholas II	PERSON	.

		Clearly , as seen through Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's eyes ,
Alexander III	ORGANIZATION	.

		was a monarch who took very much to heart the anxieties of the campaign , while
Nicholas	PERSON	displayed a moody coldness which won him no love .

		General Sko - beleff denounced
Nicholas	PERSON	with vigor . ''

		I 've a good mind , '' said he to MacGahan , '' to desert and join the Turks I am so mad with our idiots of the headquar - ters staff .

		I do n't speak of the Grand
Duke Nicholas	PERSON	; he is a mere figure-head , and has about as much notion of conducting a campaign as I have of the differential cal - culus . ''

		Nevertheless , in his salutation of
Osman Pasha	PERSON	, after the fall of
Plevna	LOCATION	,
Nicholas	PERSON	showed that he could be both just and gracious .

		The book contains a number of illustrations , of indifferent merit , most of them from portraits in the possession of Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	.

		The fifteenth volume of the time-honored '' Boy Trav - ellers '' series -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is devoted to the adventures of the '' Boy Travellers in the Levant . ''

		Colonel
Knox	PERSON	has , as usual , spared no pains to make this volume both in - teresting and instructive .

		The pictures are not all new ; in some cases they appear to be from worn plates , and are lacking in clearness .

		After the difficulty of its peculiar jerkiness of style is overcome , the book of travel '' To
Greenland	LOCATION	and the Pole '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- proves very interesting .

		It is full of the fresh atmosphere of the northern countries , and de - scribes faithfully the ice-fields of virgin snow and the dangers of Polar travel .

		There is no straining after effect , only a straightforward narrative , which , while it has its lighter phases , touches also tragic cords .

		Its author is Mr.
Gordon Stables	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	,
R.N.	LOCATION	, whose pro- totype for the chief hero is
Nansen	LOCATION	, while several of the other figures are sketched from living models .

		Much of the interest of the narrative centres , however , in the two brave lads ,
Colin	PERSON	and
Olaf	PERSON	, whose northern birth makes them susceptible to the awful fascination of '' dead nature in her winding-sheet , '' and endows them , also , with something of its austere charm .

		Another book by the same author is a tale of a seafaring lad and his love , called '' As We Sweep through the Deep '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Kirk Monroe	PERSON	's story of The Fur Seal 's Tooth '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is more conventional than that of Mr.
Stables	PERSON	, and at the same time more improbable .

		The scenes are in and about
Alaska	LOCATION	, and the plot is loosely woven around an Alaskan charm carved from the tooth of the fur-seal .

		The cruelty of the slaying of mother-seals is clearly impressed on the mind of the reader .

		Mr.
J. Macdonald Oxley	PERSON	's In the Wilds of the West Coast '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is another story of sea and land in and about
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		Professor
John Trowbridge	PERSON	, in '' Three Boys in an Electrical Boat '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , describes the adventures of three boys on board an American warship , where they make themselves useful in navigating a submarine boat .

		Two of them , the real heroes , have run away from school to embark ; and their virtue is rewarded by their finding in the Governor-General of
Bermuda	LOCATION	their father , who had supposed them drowned in infancy .

		The details of the story are very exciting , but the plot is improbable and the moral questionable .

		Nearly all the distinctively boys ' books have this year an historical foundation , by far the most inter - esting of them being those of Mr.
G. A. Henty	PERSON	, who appears with three good books -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , each sure to delight the '' dear lads '' to whom he addresses himself .

		Two of the books are historical , '' Wulf the Saxon '' rather surpassing in interest '' When
London	LOCATION	Burned , '' though the latter is very entertaining .

		But the primi - tive simplicity of the life of the Saxons before the battle of
Hastings	PERSON	has a charm which the story of the Restora - tion period lacks , and
Wulf	PERSON	is rather more human than
Cyril Shenstone	PERSON	, who almost is too bright and good for human nature 's daily food .

		But Mr.
Henty	PERSON	's lads are all brave and manly .

		He has placed one of them '' In the Heart of the Rockies , '' and there , as elsewhere , dur - ing the hardships of a winter on the frontier , courage and integrity win love and respect .

		It shows the sound - ness of boys ' hearts , that they respond to the note Mr.
Henty	PERSON	strikes , and they freely testify that he writes the best boys ' stories published .

		The strongest feature is their direct simplicity .

		Each phrase contributes vigor to the whole , and the dramatic element is never over - done .

		His characters are decidedly alive .

		Old fires are stirred and the embers live again in the pages of Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	's '' The Patriot Schoolmaster '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		That `` Father of the Rev - olution , ''
Sam Adams	PERSON	, is its hero , and a brave boy marches boldly by his side to the tune of '' Yankee Doodle '' the interesting history of that good old air being completely set forth .

		The adventures of the '' four cannon which constituted the whole train of field artillery possessed by the
British Colonies of North America	ORGANIZATION	at the commencement of the war , '' form the motive of the book .

		Mr.
Butterworth	PERSON	has performed a good deed also in telling the curious history of
Phillis Wheatley	PERSON	, the first American colored poet , whose bust was made for the World 's Fair through the influence of the colored women of
Alleghany County	ORGANIZATION	,
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania .

		A certain disconnectedness of style throughout the book is easily forgiven , for it is fabricated of good stuff ; its heroes live and are full of interest .

		The illus - trations , by Mr.
R. Winthrop Peirce	PERSON	, are so excellent as to make one wish they were more numerous .

		A period which is conceded to have received less at - tention than it deserves that of the War of
1812	DATE	is the subject of '' The Search for Andrew Field '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	describes the adventures of boys with smugglers at the outbreak of the war .

		Another war story is contributed by '' Ol - iver Optic , '' who writes for the lads of to-day the first of a series of six books to be called '' The Blue and the Gray on Land and Sea . ''

		The boys for whom he wrote forty years ago are long since gray , but ''
Oliver	PERSON	Optic '' is still popular .

		The scene of his present book , '' Brother Against Brother '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is laid in
Kentucky	LOCATION	; and the thoroughness of the work is attested by the au - thor 's account , in the preface , of his preparatory study of the subject .

		The same author completes the second series of the '' All-over-the - World Library '' in the vol - ume on `` Asiatic Breezes '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The exterior of the biographical romance of '' Olaf the Glorious '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is not prepossessing , but Mr.
Robert Leighton	PERSON	has imparted a living interest to its Viking hero .

		The book might be improved by the omission of many names , so briefly mentioned that their enumera - tion somewhat cumbers the narrative ; but the stirring and bloody battle scenes would doubtless compensate most boys for uninteresting details , which they would 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, be likely to skip anyway .

		The picture of the life of the
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	in the tenth century is at once interesting and instructive . ''

		The Sons of the Vikings '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are the heroes of an Orkney story by Mr.
John Gunn	PERSON	, which describes the daring , in modern warfare , of two brave descendants of more primitive men .

		The time is that of the great na - val war with
France	LOCATION	; and though the plot is slender , the events are not without interest and the tone of the book is wholesome .

		A third and somewhat different book about still younger
Norsemen	ORGANIZATION	is Mr.
H. H. Boyesen	PERSON	's '' Norseland Tales , '' which relates the adventures , often pathetic , of Norwegian boys in other countries and of foreign chil - dren in
Norway	LOCATION	.

		They are bright and simple tales , The Feud of the Wildhaymen '' and the '' Sun 's Sis - ters '' having the Norse atmosphere more clearly than the others .

		The ten stories form a pleasing but not ex - citing volume .

		A truly delightful book , racy of the sea , is Mrs.
Molly Elliot Seawell	PERSON	's '' Decatur and Somers '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Its style is vigorous and free , its atmosphere bracing , and a rich humor abounds .

		A brave , sad life was that of
Somers	PERSON	, and his tender friendship for his comrade touches the heart .

		With so many authors who introduce treacherous unwholesome characters into books for boys , it is refreshing to read a story which is full of noble thoughts and deeds , yet loses none of its exciting inter - est. .

		The company of heroes such as these , and the interest centring perpetually about the frigate '' Con - stitution , '' combine to make this a particularly attract - ive book .

		The writings of
Miss Charlotte M. Yonge	ORGANIZATION	are so well known that '' The Cook and the Captive '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- requires no detailed description .

		It is a story of the
Franks	PERSON	in the sixth century , and of the introduction of Christianity ; and it is eminently safe and appropriate for Sunday-school libraries .

		A continuation of Mrs.
Sarah K. Bolton	PERSON	's '' Famous Leaders among Men '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- contains sketches of
Bonaparte	LOCATION	,
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	,
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	,
Beecher	PERSON	,
Spurgeon	PERSON	,
Bunyan	PERSON	, Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	,
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, General
Sher	PERSON	- man , and
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	.

		The group seems perhaps incongruous , but the fact that each fought a good fight , either in church or secular warfare , gives the collection a certain uniformity .

		The illustrations in Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's `` The Farm - er 's Boy '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- are very attractive .

		They are from photographs , and tell the story of farm-life with more skill than the text itself , which is somewhat com - monplace .

		Boys and girls would probably take but a mild interest in the rambling narrative , which would leave them with the impression that a farm is a good place to keep away from .

		The same vein of sentiment that runs through her past work lends attraction to
Miss Plympton	LOCATION	's little story of '' Rags and Velvet Gowns '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , a taste - fully bound book with illustrations by the author .

		It lightly touches on the social problem of rich and poor , a little child at
Christmas	LOCATION	- time leading her father to re - member the responsibility which his wealth entails .

		It is a sad story , with a death as its climax ; but out of sadness grows sympathy for sorrow .

		Like Miss Plymp - ton 's story of '' Dear Daughter
Dorothy	PERSON	, '' however , the more delicate touches , such as the misunderstood na - ture of the little heroine , would be apt to escape young readers .

		DEDICATION AND INAUGURATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-


Thursday	DATE	,
November 15	DATE	, was an important day in the history of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		The occasion was the inauguration of the newly-elected President , Dr.
Andrew S. Draper	PERSON	, and the dedication of the handsome new Engineering Hall .

		Very seldom has more enthu - siasm been manifested by either the students or friends of the
University	ORGANIZATION	than was then shown .

		It was a per - fect
November	DATE	day ; the buildings everywhere were gay with orange and blue , the
University	ORGANIZATION	colors ; and prominent men were present from all over the country .

		Governor
John P. Altgeld	PERSON	presided , and twelve college presidents lent dignity to the occasion .

		The programme was in two parts , that in the after - noon consisting of short addresses from members of the Faculty , of the
Alumni Association	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	, and of the student body , who all welcomed the President to his new work .

		These were followed by the inaugural address of President
Draper	PERSON	, who dis - cussed at some length the relation of
the State	ORGANIZATION	to the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The dedication programme in the evening consisted of introductory remarks by President
Draper	PERSON	, a short talk by General
William Sooy-Smith	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and an able address on
University Ideals	ORGANIZATION	, by Dr.
Charles Kendall Adams	PERSON	, President of the
University of Wiscon	ORGANIZATION	- sin .

		Dr.
Adams	PERSON	made suggestions which
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	might well adopt in its relations with the
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Excellent music was furnished for both programmes by the various musical organizations of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Military Battalion	ORGANIZATION	had charge of the movements of the four thousand people present , and a more suc - cessful management of the large assembly could not be imagined .

		At the close of the evening programme , the
Presi	PERSON	- dent and
Deans	PERSON	of the Colleges , with their wives , held a reception in the new Engineering Building , which was attended by at least two thousand people , who were , for the first time , given an opportunity to examine the inte - rior of the new hall .

		The new building is probably the largest and best equipped of any in the country used exclusively for engineering purposes .

		It was designed by an alumnus of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	, and was built at a cost of
$ 160,000	MONEY	, the sum having been appropri - ated by the Legislature for that purpose .

		The building is 200 feet front , with wings at each end 76 feet long , while the central part extends back 140 feet .

		It is four stories in height .

		The new President , Dr.
Andrew Sloan Draper	PERSON	, is too well known among educational people to need an intro - duction .

		Coming from his recent successful career as State Superintendent of the schools of
New York	LOCATION	, and head of the
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, schools , he is even at this early date beginning to show what he will do for
Illi	PERSON	- nois .

		He is a man of remarkable diplomacy and execu - tive ability , and has quite captivated the hearts of all connected with the
University	ORGANIZATION	, both students and fac - ulty .

		During his brief connection with the institution he has displayed excellent judgment in adapting him - self to his new surroundings , and the friends of the Uni - versity feel that his coming will mark a new era in the progress of the institution .

		The entire success of the recent exercises seems to point in that direction .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
November 26 , 1894	DATE	.

		It was a pleasant thought to gather in one volume the romances of the three
New England	LOCATION	heroines , Pris - cilla ,
Agnes Surriage	PERSON	, and
Martha Hilton	PERSON	; and Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	has faithfully and tastefully illus - trated the little book in quite an Abbey-like vein .

		If he had rested there , I should have no quarrel with him ; but he has added some notes to the volume , in which he does a real injustice to one of the most commendable performances in the way of preserving historic antiqui - ties which have taken place in
New England	LOCATION	.

		In speak - ing of the old
Wentworth	LOCATION	house at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	har - bor , Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	refers to its former appearance as venerable , and to its present appearance as '' spick - span in yellow and white paint , and set back in a well - groomed lawn , '' with a flout at this latter condition of things .

		No doubt there was much spick - spanness about the house when
Martha Hilton	PERSON	lived there as the wife of Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	, and no doubt , too , the '' venerable '' grayness of some ten years ago was picturesque enough in its way .

		It is a question , how - ever , as to how long the old house would have lasted be - fore falling to pieces , had it not been taken in hand by its last purchaser , Mr.
J. T. Coolidge	PERSON	, the
Boston	LOCATION	art - ist .

		Having been a witness of the restoration of the old mansion during three or four summers , I can truth - fully declare that never was a similar task more lov - ingly carried out .

		Without doubt , the house in shape and appearance is precisely what it was in colonial days .

		To reproduce the old shutters , a few specimens of which remained , it was necessary toforge certain carpenter 's tools now no longer in use ; and this detail is given as an example of Mr.
Coolidge	PERSON	's fidelity to old traditions .

		He bought the house for his summer home , and so he has made it inhabitable and incidentally has put it in order for another hundred years .

		As to the color of the outside , now and formerly , Mr.
Coolidge	PERSON	and Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	both being artists , it is useless to dispute about tastes ; but for my part , since so many brand-new cot - tages by the sea are made to look '' venerable '' and '' weather-beaten '' before their fires of chemically man - ufactured '' driftwood '' are lighted for the first time , it is something of a relief to see a last-century mansion restored to its original splendor .

		This little discussion is based on a copy of ''
Three Heroines of New England Romance	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which , as I have already intimated , will repay more than a passing glance .

		The
Bryant	PERSON	centennial celebrations and memorial meetings have now all been completed , separate affairs having taken place at different dates in
Cummington	LOCATION	and
Great Barrington	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	and this city .

		A volume containing an account of the memorial exercises which took place at
Cummiugton	LOCATION	, the poet 's birthplace , together with the speeches and poems that were delivered on that occasion , will soon be issued by the committee in charge .

		It will be illustrated with portraits and views , and will be sold in two bindings to suit purchasers .

		Mrs.
Henrietta S. Nahmer	PERSON	, secretary of the memorial committee , may be addressed at Cum - mington ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in the matter of subscriptions .

		Literary readings and lectures , and meetings of social - literary clubs , are more frequent than usual this season .

		Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the Shake - spearean scholar , has just given a reading and interpre - tation of '' As You Like It '' before a dramatic club of this city .

		Mr.
L. J. B. Lincoln	PERSON	's '' Uncut Leaves '' so - ciety listened this week to readings from Mr. Cable , Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	, and others .

		This society , which meets monthly , has now reached a membership in this city alone of some six hundred .

		Mr.
Paul Blouet	PERSON	-LRB- '' Max O'Rell '' -RRB- arrived a week ago for a lecture tour which will embrace this country and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		He was put down by his manager for a lecture on the very day his steamer was due ; and he was able to fulfil the engage - ment .

		Mr.
Blouet	PERSON	, who has been renewing old friend - ships here , thinks that this tour will complete his ca - reer as a lecturer .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have on sale a number of interesting manuscripts of the late
Dante Gabriel Ros	ORGANIZATION	- setti .

		The same firm will follow up
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	's suc - cessful volume of Scottish tales , '' Beside the
Bonnie Brier Bush	PERSON	, '' with a novel of
Somerset	LOCATION	life , '' Love and Quiet Life , '' by
Walter Raymond	PERSON	.

		Both these volumes were recommended for publication by Dr.
Nicoll	PERSON	, who is said to have discovered
Barrie	PERSON	and
Jane Barlow	PERSON	.

		The differentiation of English fiction according to the sev - eral shires goes merrily on .

		Somersetshire seems to be a new field and a new dialect , at least as far as the present year is concerned .

		The book in question is a pleasant study of English rural life .

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will soon publish a vol - ume of poems by Mrs.
Sarah Knowles Bolton	PERSON	. ''

		Factors in Organic Evolution , '' by President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, is just issuing from the press of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new edition of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's novels is promised by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We presume it to be the same as that announced in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
William Heineman	PERSON	.


Signor Hoepli	PERSON	, of
Milan	LOCATION	, has begun the publication of Lionardo da
Vinci	PERSON	's '' Codice Atlantico . ''

		There are to be thirty-four parts , and the edition will be limited to two hundred and eighty copies .

		Our statement , in the last issue , that
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	died at
Autun	LOCATION	was a mistake .

		It seems that his death took place at
Boulogne-sur-Seine	LOCATION	, where he has spent much time of late years .


London	LOCATION	has just been having a
Gibbon	PERSON	centenary , and the French have been talking , although to little pur - pose , of a celebration of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's two-hundredth anni - versary , which also falls this year .


Walter Pater	PERSON	's unpublished papers are being pre - pared for the press by Mr.
C. L. Shadwell	PERSON	, the trans - lator of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		One volume will be a collection of `` Greek Studies '' ; another will be similar to `` Imagin - ary Portraits . ''

		During the past year , there have been published in
Russia	LOCATION	-LRB- exclusive of
Finland	LOCATION	-RRB- no less than 10,242 sep - arate works , of which nearly 34,000,000 copies were printed .

		Perhaps the Muscovite is not such a barbarian as some people think , after all .

		The
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	celebration of the
Bryant Centen	PERSON	- nial was described in our last issue .

		We now learn that the proceedings are to be printed in a limited edi - tion , copies of which , numbered and signed by Mr.
John Howard Bryant	PERSON	, may be subscribed for with Mr.
E. E. Calkins	PERSON	,
Galesburg	LOCATION	, 111 .

		344 -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, The seventh annual meeting of the
American Eco	ORGANIZATION	- nomic Association will be held
December 26-29	DATE	at Co -
lumbia College	LOCATION	.

		An attractive list of papers is offered , and all interested in the science of economics are invited to attend the meetings as well as the reception given by President Low on the twenty-seventh .

		The magnificent `` History of Ancient Art '' by MM .


G. Perrot	PERSON	and
Charles Chipiez	PERSON	-LRB-
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , of which past volumes have been reviewed by us , is now con - tinued with a two-volume '' History of Art in
Primitive Greece	LOCATION	, '' which we only mention upon this occasion , as we intend to review it at length in a later issue .

		Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	protests very vigorotisly against the action of the American publishing house which has , without any authorization or even notification , issued an edition of his '' History of Our Own Times , '' with new chapters by an American hand .

		It appears that the author himself had in contemplation the work of bring - ing the history up to date .


Carl Plong	PERSON	, poet and patriot , statesman and journal - ist , died at
Copenhagen	LOCATION	on the twenty-seventh of Octo - ber .

		When we read him twenty years ago , he seemed even then one of the old-timers , and we hardly realized that he existed in the flesh .

		And yet he was not only living , but was destined to survive until the present year , and to the ripe age of eighty-one .

		Mr.
Walter Blackburn Harte	PERSON	's new volume of social and literary papers , '' Meditations in Motley : A Bundle of Papers Imbued with the
Sobriety of Midnight	ORGANIZATION	, '' has a fantastic and curious dedication .

		It runs : '' I com - mend this little book to the Devil and
Dame Chance	ORGANIZATION	, the two most potent deities in literary fortunes as in all other sublunary dispensations . ''

		The book is published by the
Arena Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		We take this bit of information from '' The
Athen	LOCATION	- a3um '' : '' The most important contribution yet published to the biography of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	is now in course of preparation , and is likely to be issued at a not very distant date .

		The book will consist of two sections , 1 , a memoir of some considerable length , on which his brother , Mr.
William Michael Rossetti	PERSON	, is now actively engaged ; 2 ,
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	's family letters , from his boyhood to the latest months of his life . '' ''

		The Tragedies of Euripides in English Verse '' -LRB- Mac - inillan -RRB- , by Mr.
Arthur S. Way	PERSON	, is to consist of three volumes , the first of which is at hand .

		Mr.
Way	PERSON	has previously published translations of both '' Iliad '' and '' Odyssey , '' and hence brings a practised hand to his new task .

		Certainly , a good verse-translation of Euri - pides is much needed , for half of the plays have been untouched since
Potter	PERSON	, and the others have been spor - adically versified in English by a score of hands .

		Mr.
Way	PERSON	's work is excellent , although it may hardly be called brilliant .

		The death of
Froude	PERSON	has set in circulation a half-for - gotten skit , which recalls a passage at arms of many years ago . ''

		While
Froude	PERSON	assures the Scottish youth That parsons do not care for truth , The Reverend Canon
Kingsley	PERSON	cries ' All history 's a pack of lies . ' ''

		What cause for judgment so malign ?

		A little thought may solve the mystery ; For
Froude	PERSON	thinks
Kingsley	PERSON	a divine , And
Kingsley	PERSON	goes to
Froude	PERSON	for history . ''

		Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	, the well-known authority on Copyright , writes as follows to '' The Author '' of Lon - don : `` I have observed with uneasiness , in ' The Au - thor ' and elsewhere , a tendency to revive the high metaphysical theory of copyright as a perpetual and immutable right of property conferred by the law of nature .

		This theory is , in my opinion , unsound , and at all events it has been definitely rejected by English and American law .

		Copyright is property , but not a prop - erty in ideas ; it is a monopoly or exclusive franchise , created for reasons of policy , in particular forms whereby ideas are expressed . ''

		The mortuary record of the last fortnight includes the names of
James McCosh	PERSON	and of
Robert C. Win	PERSON	- throp , both of whom died on the sixteenth of
Novem	DATE	- ber ; of
Anton Gregor Rubinstein	PERSON	, who died on the twentieth , and of
Jean Victor Duruy	PERSON	, who died on the twenty-fifth .

		These four men were born , respectively , in
1811	DATE	,
1809	DATE	,
1829	DATE	, and
1811	DATE	.

		When we sought to enumerate in a recent issue the American men of let - ters yet surviving from the
first quarter of the century	DATE	, the ink was hardly dried before we had to expunge the name of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	.

		Winthrop was another of the veterans , and our list once more shrinks .

		He is best remembered by his orations , filling three large volumes , and by his '' Life and Letters of
John Winthrop	PERSON	. ''

		The death of
Rubinstein	PERSON	emphasizes the loss of Tschai - kowsky ,
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	, and Billow , all of whom have left us within about a year .

		As for Dr.
McCosh	PERSON	, of his three quarter-centuries and more only one has been passed in our midst , but he thoroughly identified himself with our life and institutions .

		His many published works were , with hardly an exception , of a religious or philosophical character .

		Among the works of Duruy the following should be mentioned : '' Histoire de la
Grdce Ancienne	PERSON	, '' '' Histoire des Remains , '' '' Histoire de
France	LOCATION	, '' and ''
Histoire des Temps Modernes	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A translation of the latter work is one of the latest publications of
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE THINNED RANKS OF OLDER ENGLISH AUTHORS .

		In its article on the death of
Froude	PERSON	, the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' thus speaks of the mournful passing of the older group of English authors : `` Last week English literature still had two leaders ; now it has only one .

		Not since that rapid fall of the greatest writers of En - glish which in the early Thirties drew from Words - worth some of the best of his later lines , has there been such a thinning of the ranks of the captains of prose and verse as the last few years have seen .

		Lord Ten - nyson and Mr.
Browning	PERSON	, Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	and Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	, had left us ; Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	and Mr.
Froude	PERSON	re - mained .

		There is no one but Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	now of the first class of veterans .

		The best of those who remain belong distinctly to the next generation and perhaps they are not very numerous ; certainly not more than one or two of them are ever likely to be ranked by posterity with those who have just been named .

		What younger generations still may have in store time will show ; but it is not ungracious to say that the very best man , be he who he may , who has not yet reached fifty , will have to make new and strange progress before he can be ranked with those of whom only Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	survives . ''

		THE HISTORY OF A PUBLISHING HOUSE .

		The romance of business has an interesting illustra - tion in '' The History of a Publishing House '' in the current number of '' Scribner 's Magazine . ''

		The house referred to is that of Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , and the particular occasion of the present history is its
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 occupancy of its fine new building in
Fifth Avenue	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The house is not yet quite fifty years of age , but it has long held its place among the foremost of American publishing-houses , and may well indulge in these reminiscences of its remarkable career and fe - licitations upon its position and prospects .

		Great pub - lishing houses are not built in a day , hardly in a gen - eration ; the real successes seem to come with the sec - ond or later generation of descendants or of partnerships .

		Such is the case with this house .

		Mr.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	, Senior , who founded it in
1846	DATE	, was a man of energy and sagacity , and conducted it for twenty-five years , when he was succeeded by his sons who form the heads of the present firm .

		It was during the elder Mr.
Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's administration that the old '' Scribner 's Monthly '' -LRB- now '' The Century Magazine '' -RRB- was established , in conjunction with Dr.
Holland	PERSON	and Mr.
Roswell Smith	PERSON	; and it is interesting to note that this magazine and the present '' Scribner 's '' -LRB- founded in
1877	DATE	-RRB- were perhaps the two most powerful factors in the growth and prosperity of the firm .

		Of the older magazine the article states that it '' set a virtually new standard for the illustrated pop - ular periodical ; through its artistic side especially it had the chief part in the great progress in American illustration and wood-engraving which has been one of the notable things of our
last quarter	DATE	of a century ; and the way in which it revolutionized all former ideas of the possibilities of magazine circulation was epoch-mak - ing . ''

		The article gives many interesting details of the firm 's career and of the more notable enterprises in which it has engaged .

		Portraits are given of deceased members of the firm , with exterior and interior views of its new home .

		A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES .

		By
ALLEN C. THOMAS	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, Professor of History in
Haver	LOCATION	- ford College ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	. ''

		It is , in its method and arrangement , admirably adapted to the class-room .

		The author lias the right view of history , that is , it is not a series of dates or descriptions of battles , but a revelation of the spirit of the people , their aims and motives and achievements .

		It is a difficult task to write an intelligent , clear history of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	in 400 pages , and yet every student , if he reads no more than this book , will have a clear idea of not only the great events , but the spirit of the people who executed them .

		We mark the book as one of more than usual excellence .

		It is elegant in its English sentences , has no hobbies , and teaches history from the best modem methods .

		The volume is em - bellished with many portraits of the

		GEOGRAPHY .

		LESSONS IN THE NEW GEOGRAPHY , For Student and Teacher .

		By
SPENSER TROTTER	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, Professor of Biology in
Swarthmore College	ORGANIZATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The New Geography is new in the sense that its point of view is essen - tially human .

		The old methods of geography teaching dealt almost exclusively in the hard facts and dry detail of surface features , political divisions , an endless , meaningless collection of names , with little if any reference to the true value of geographical conditions as factors in the development of man .

		As the earth is the theatre of human action , the true study of geography is a study of human life under the varied conditions of existence imposed by the different regions of the earth .

		It is thus synonymous with History .

		One object of these '' Lessons '' is to bring forward this view of the study of Geography , to bring it with a fresh and living interest to the mind of every teacher and student .

		MODERN LANGUAGES .

		A DANISH AND DANO-NORWEGIAN GRAMMAR .

		By
P. GROTH	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, late Fellow of the
University of Chris	ORGANIZATION	- tiana .

		The great interest which has of late been aroused in the Scandinavian literature , and the correspondingly increased demand for instruction in the Scandinavian language in our colleges and universities , has made the lack of a suitable grammar of the Dano-Norwegian language more perceptible .

		At the same time the annually increasing number of tour - ists in
Norway	LOCATION	has also increased the number of those intelligent trav - ellers who wish to familiarize themselves with the customs , traditions , and literature of the country something that can not be done without some knowledge of the language .

		This book can be safely recom - mended to all interested in the subject .

		392 LITER AR Y CENTENNIALS .

		There is no doubt that the human mind in - clines toward round numbers , and takes a cer - tain pleasure in contemplating them .

		Just why this should be the case is a problem for the psychologist ; but we , being now concerned with the fact alone , will not stop to inquire into its antecedents .

		Particularly are most of us attracted by a round number when it happens to be a number of years .

		When a thing is ten , or twenty-five , or fifty years old , we begin to think that we must do something about it .

		And when a full hundred years has been counted , the thing somehow becomes all at once so memorable that it suddenly fills a large arc of that horizon upon which only the year before it was hardly more than a speck .

		As far as our individual lives are concerned , we have to be content with the celebration of silver weddings , semi-centennials , and such-like petty affairs .

		The inexorable reaper cuts us down -LRB- with the exception of a Chevreul here and there -RRB- before we can claim a full century for our own , and thus have real cause for glor - ification .

		As for a wedding centennial , that has not been even thinkable since the Flood .

		Perhaps the nearest approach to such an event is made by the pensioned widows of our Revo - lutionary veterans , some of whom -LRB- that is , of the widows -RRB- still survive .

		But even pensioners are mortal , and then the celebration by a widow of any wedding anniversary would be too mel - ancholy an affair to be seriously undertaken .

		372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, But if we are by nature debarred from the enjoyment of our own centennials , we can at least celebrate those of other people .

		What may be called the craze for the centennial reached its height in this country when we rounded the first hundred years of our national existence .

		But those who fondly fancied that a single big Centennial Exposition would do the business were vastly mistaken , as the event proved .

		For the Declaration of Independence was no sooner out of the way than we found it necessary to indulge in successive jubilations over the anniversaries of a great many other things , and the Revolutionary series was not closed until we had worked our way down to the inauguration of
George Washington	LOCATION	.

		Then we had a bare year or two of respite before becoming engrossed in a bigger celebration than any of the others that of the discovery of
America	LOCATION	by one
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	, a Gen - oese .

		What the future has in store for us is not known ; but a Cabot quadri-centennial for
1897	DATE	should at least be in order , and others are pretty likely to follow .

		The fashion of the literary centennial has spread somewhat alarmingly during the past quarter-century from the time , say , of the Shakespeare celebration of
1864	DATE	and the
Dante	PERSON	celebration of the year following .

		Michelan - gelo had his turn in
1874	DATE	.

		During the past few weeks we have had occasion to chronicle various celebrations in honor of the worthy Nuremberg cobbler , whose shoes , we trust , were better than his songs .

		We have also reported divers gatherings in commemoration of the first - born of our own American poets .

		The
first quarter of the twentieth century	DATE	will , we im - agine , be fairly well sprinkled with occasions like these , for we cherish the memory of the builders of our literature , and delight to do honor to their names .

		Nor is the honor thus done altogether an empty one , or the occasion fruitless , for with each event we furbish up our recollections of a worthy writer , and re-read his books with new interest .

		We are likely , also , to get from the publishers new and im - proved editions , and perhaps new biographical studies , upon such occasions .

		Among the literary celebrations of the pres - ent year we note , not without a touch of alarm , the
Gibbon	PERSON	memorial exercises that Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric
Harrison	PERSON	has so successfully carried out in
London	LOCATION	.

		We would not question the claims of
Gibbon	PERSON	upon the love and reverent gratitude of all English-speaking people ; but a danger - ous precedent is set up by the exercises in ques - tion .

		For the significant fact must be noted that it is the centennial of
Gibbon	PERSON	's death that we now commemorate , not that of his birth .

		Thus the number of possible future celebrations is doubled at a single stroke .

		There seems , moreover , to be some question of taste involved in the celebration of a man 's death .

		If it were
Gower	PERSON	, for example , or almost any one of the early Poets Laureate , there might be a certain appropriateness in the act .

		But the anniversary of a really great writer 's death is a rather poor pretext for a glorification of his life .

		But the pretext , such as it is , will probably be seized upon many times .

		Already the Italians are making great preparations for their celebration next year in honor of the third centenary of the death of Tasso .

		The French might be engaged this very year in commemorating the centenary of the death of
Condorcet	LOCATION	; but as they have neglected the far more obvious opportunity of - fered by the birth of Voltaire in
1694	DATE	, it is not surprising that they should have let slip the memory of the philosopher .

		If they want to make up for the neglect , they may celebrate next year the death of La Fontaine , or the deaths of La Bruyere and
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	in
1896	DATE	, or of
Racine	LOCATION	and Beaumarchais in
1899	DATE	.

		The Germans are not likely to pay at - tention to such mortuary centennials during the present century , as their literary necrology presents no very conspicuous name .

		But the English , following the
Gibbon	PERSON	precedent , may signalize in
1896	DATE	the death of
Burns	LOCATION	, in
1897	DATE	that of
Burke	LOCATION	, in
1899	DATE	that of Spenser , and in
1900	DATE	those of Dry den and
Cowper	PERSON	.

		But the celebrations that have about them no shadow of illegitimacy are those that sig - nalize the secular recurrence of the birthday of some name great in the literature of a country or of the world .

		We have thought it interest - ing to ask what occasions of this sort are offered by the half-dozen remaining years of the nine - teenth century .

		In our own country , no more poets will be ripe for commemoration during this century ; but the historians
Prescott	PERSON	and
Palfrey	PERSON	were born in
1796	DATE	, while
Bancroft	LOCATION	first saw the light in
1800	DATE	.

		England may celebrate the birth of
Carlyle	LOCATION	or
Keats	PERSON	next year if she will , of Hood in
1898	DATE	, and of Macaulay in
1900	DATE	.

		Germany will soon be reminded that
Ranke	PERSON	was born in
1795	DATE	, and
Heine	ORGANIZATION	in
1799	DATE	.

		Possibly , by the centennial of the latter date the worthy Philistines of Diisseldorf may have consented to the erection of a monument to the greatest German since
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The French , in
1896	DATE	, may celebrate the third Descartes cen -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 tennial , and in
1900	DATE	the first centennial of the great master of their fiction .

		Surely the au - thor of the Human Comedy deserves remem - brance , if a writer ever did .

		The Italians will have occasion , in
1898	DATE	, to celebrate both Me - tastasio and
Leopard	ORGANIZATION	born just a century apart , and thus brought into incongruous fel - lowship .

		And finally ,
Calderon	PERSON	, the greatest poet of
Spain	LOCATION	, born in the closing year of the sixteenth century , should not be forgotten by the closing year of the nineteenth .

		We shall be much disappointed if his fellow-countrymen do not contrive to do something for the author of '' La Vida es Sueno '' when the year
1900	DATE	comes around .

		We have one more suggestion to make , al - though it probably comes too late for responsive action .

		On the third of
January	DATE	,
B.C.	LOCATION	106 , there was born near the town of
Arpinum	LOCATION	, in the Volscian hills , a boy who received the name of
Marcus Tullius Cicero	PERSON	.

		A little calculation will show that the third of
January , 1895	DATE	, will be the two thousandth anniversary of that birth .

		When the boy grew up he came to play a con - siderable part in the affairs of the state , and was altogether a man of mark .

		That he is still remembered countless schoolboys and other competent persons will testify .

		Here is surely a chance that ought not to be missed .

		It is not often that the opportunity is offered to cel - ebrate the second millenial of a great writer 's birth , and , beside such an occasion , mere cen - tennials , and even bi - , tri - , and quadri-centen - nials , seem insignificant .

		Here is a round num - ber , indeed , that must appeal to the most wayward fancy ; and we offer to our readers as a Christmas gift the suggestion that some - thing be planned for the coming year to com - memorate the twentieth Ciceronian centenary .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		ENGLISH IN THE SOUTHERN UNIVERSITIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your series of articles on the study of English in American universities , and particularly the general con - clusions of your summary in the issue of
November 1	DATE	, have proved interesting reading to a large constituency .

		Yet I fear the silence as to the work in English in a whole section of our country might seem unintentionally misleading .

		True ,
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	has found a place in your list as a Southern institution , and all her old students know how to praise warmly the work she has done and promises to do for American scholarship .

		But , just in the department of English , there have also been other institutions in the South and
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	which established reputed courses , even before
Virginia	LOCATION	's noble university , and have influenced vitally the tendencies of thought and culture in the Southern half of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		I shall not here reproduce any of the points empha - sized in an article on '' The Study of English in the South '' written for the ''
Sewanee Review	ORGANIZATION	, ''
February , 1894	DATE	.

		The attempt was there made to give the history of the movement .

		But one marked fact was the atten - tion paid to English , by the side of Latin , Greek , and other '' humanistic '' studies , as a full and independent course , in many Southern institutions at very early dates .

		Randolph-Macon and
Richmond	LOCATION	colleges in
Virginia	LOCATION	have had full English courses since
1868	DATE	.

		English was emphasized at
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lee University	ORGANIZATION	from the beginning of General
R. E. Lee	PERSON	's administration , and the present incumbent of the English chair in that in - stitution has been in position steadily to develop his de - partment since
1876	DATE	.


Vanderbilt University	ORGANIZATION	in
Nash	PERSON	- ville , the
University of the South	ORGANIZATION	at
Sewanee	LOCATION	,
Tulane University	ORGANIZATION	in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, have , from their inception , emphasized and strengthened their English courses .

		Some of the smaller colleges , too , have been exception - ally zealous in this field ; e. g. ,
William	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	and Hampden-Sidney in
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Davidson	PERSON	in North Car - olina , and
Charleston	LOCATION	and
Wofford	ORGANIZATION	in
South Carolina	LOCATION	.


Washington	LOCATION	and
Lee	PERSON	and
Vanderbilt Universities	ORGANIZATION	have , moreover , developed valuable post-graduate courses in English looking to the Doctor 's degree .

		The preceding are all cases of private corporations .

		Likewise , many of the
State	ORGANIZATION	universities have shown peculiar sensitiveness to the importance of the English instruction , and have em - phasized its scope and its inspirational and training value .

		The merit of the courses offered in the Universities of
Texas	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	,
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
South Carolina	LOCATION	, North Car - olina , and
Tennessee	LOCATION	, I can readily instance .

		An interesting and noteworthy feature , in these cases , is the attention given to the constant practice in English composition , to criticism , to personal acquaintance with literature , and to the emphasis of library needs and library work .

		The historical study of the language goes hand in hand with the above , yet serves , I think , in most cases , not as an end in itself , but mainly as a means of giving greater power in linguistic knowledge and attain - ment and in literary expression .

		But the greatest gain has been in the fact that more attention is paid each year to the entrance requirements ; preparatory schools are everywhere discarded , independent fitting schools are encouraged in their stead , and the system of special accredited schools is generally extending .

		While much is still to be desired in the country localities , the policy is working well in towns and cities .

		Fair training and ' practice in the elements of the mother tongue may thus - be demanded before entrance , and generally be accepted as already possessed .

		With some ground-work to start with , therefore , a course of four years in the practical application of the rules of composition and rhetoric and in the study of '' literary topics is usually added in college .

		For instance , ,
the University of Tennessee	ORGANIZATION	maps out for the four full years such a course in composition and literary work ; : the philology course of two years is independent and parallel , for advanced students and graduates who de - sire linguistic training .

		All work centres in the library : the library is the workshop of the English classes .

		Prac - tical composition is attained , not only by constant theme - work , but also by reports -LRB- we make them weekly -RRB- based upon work done in the library in connection with class topics .

		From our librarian 's record for the last two 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, months -LRB-
October	DATE	and
November	DATE	-RRB- ,
1351	DATE	slips show that this number of volumes was taken out over-night from the
Seminary Room	ORGANIZATION	alone , where all the important books referred to in class lectures are temporarily placed for general use .

		A total of
1933	DATE	volumes , all told , taken out by the students in only two months , apart from the perhaps still larger number of books used in the library rooms , when there are fewer than three hundred stu - dents altogether in attendance in all departments , is a fair showing for the general interest and the nature of the practical results .

		Most of the Southern institutions , I find , study formal literature by topics or periods .

		Adopting the topical method as most clearly defined for all purposes , in our own case , we have made the serious study of American literary conditions the subject for investigation for one whole year , just because it contains the essence of our nationality and brings the facts and possibilities of Amer - ican life and authorship closer home to the youthful aspirant .

		Similarly , the study of the nineteenth cen - tury English writers , both in prose and in verse , best bears the impress of the modern consciousness and re - produces most closely existing tendencies and habits of thought .

		The prolonged study of Shakespeare by the maturest students is a just recognition of the poet 's su - preme power .

		Necessarily , all the courses in the above-named insti - tutions -LRB- and there are others still -RRB- differ among them - selves ; but nevertheless one general spirit animates them .

		They can not pretend to have solved all the dif - ficulties present and to have met all the needs required ; but , I think , it is not too bold to assert that they are at least doing their share in upbuilding and leavening and spiritualizing the existing conditions of American '' * e <

		THE STUDY OF LITERATURE IN PREPARA - TORY SCHOOLS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is hard to believe that the writer of a recent com - munication to THE DIAL -LRB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, p. 286 -RRB- on The Work of Preparatory Schools in English '' expected to be taken altogether seriously .

		If the picture therein painted is a true one of
New York	LOCATION	, or , still worse , if it represents the
Eastern States	LOCATION	in general , then must we Californians , in pure self-defence , abandon our convic - tions and join heart and soul in a movement toward ex - clusion which most of us have always deprecated , and shut ourselves from all influences that come from the
East	LOCATION	, from all so-called educational reforms that arise there , from everything that we have fondly thought would lead us out of our own provinciality .

		Especially must we beware of teachers who have been educated in those '' helpless '' Eastern schools , the especial merit of which seems to be their '' discipline of coercion and re - straint . ''

		But we will not yet believe the case is as bad as it seems ; all those dismal things were not really meant .

		The writer of the communication referred to of course does not use the word '' appreciation '' in its strict sense of a perfectly just or complete estimate of merit , but rather has in mind such partial appreciation as belongs to the perception and enjoyment of the chief excellences of a work .

		This is said to be secured only in the case of '' exceptional teachers and pupils in exceptional re - lations . ''

		There flashes across my mind a scene in a preparatory school in
San Francisco	LOCATION	a teacher of En - glish , with a class of forty or fifty boys , reading ''
Evan	PERSON	- geline . ''

		I recall the quiet tones , the absorbed attention , of the whole class ; the evident pleasure with which the boys in turn pointed out their favorite lines ; and then the questions of the teacher , put so naturally and easily , by which one passage after another became richer in meaning and beauty to his pupils .

		I will grant that here may have been the '' exceptional teacher '' ; but one can hardly say the same of the many teachers of gram - mar , secondary , and country schools , who have borne glad testimony to a general love of literature among their pupils .

		Recently , after a class in a preparatory school had read , somewhat hastily but with apparent enjoyment , two long poems , its members were called upon to give some reason for their preference of one of these poems to the other .

		Among the answers given were the fol - lowing : '' It is a poem of deeper feeling . '' ''

		The inter - est is centred in one character . '' ''

		I like the language better ; there are so many beautiful similes , and many of these make the meaning clearer . '' ''

		I enjoyed the metre so much ; the other was too jingling . ''

		`` It is more pathetic . '' ''

		The characters are noble . '' ''

		It is more sympathetic . ''

		Now , however little value these answers may have from a purely aesthetic point of view , they certainly show the beginnings of literary apprecia - tion .

		In this case there could hardly have been any exceptional conditions .

		Nay , rather , the conditions must be unusually adverse that can crush out the simple healthy instincts of the young , their natural attraction toward what is beautiful and good the basis of literary appreciation .

		Moreover , I believe that nowhere can these natural instincts be so easily guided as in the sec - ondary schools , provided the literature offered is thor - oughly within the intellectual grasp of the pupils .

		That the artistic sense is slow to develop in American youth I will admit ; but I believe that it is seldom either alto - gether absent or perverted .

		In few secondary schools can composition be robbed of all its terrors especially when the work begins there , but at least the pupil can generally be led to attack it boldly and cheerfully ; and when he has learned to frame a good sentence or paragraph , even if he goes no further , he can not escape a certain satisfaction in it , a pleasure no different in kind from that of the great lit - erary artist .

		This impels him to greater effort , and he no longer looks upon his work in composition as an ar - bitrary requirement of his teacher .

		He knows now that it is for his own good , for he does really enjoy it a little , loth as he is to acknowledge this .

		The relation existing between the preparatory school and the college must be very different in the
East	LOCATION	from what it is here .

		Is it the examination system that is at fault ?

		When
the University Examiners	ORGANIZATION	visit our schools , as they do every year , they do not present them - selves as rigid censors , but rather as helpful and sym - pathetic friends .

		They say that they have learned by their visits to understand our difficulties as they could not otherwise have done .

		They do not always find much to praise , but they give encouragement when they can , and offer very practical suggestions .

		The uplifting in - fluence of the Universities on the secondary schools is everywhere acknowledged among us , and teachers of English at least have found great inspiration from this source .

		THE DIAL 375 AMERICAN M AXXERS .

		* Nearly sixty years ago a book was published in
England	LOCATION	called '' Domestic Manners of the Americans , '' which raised a storm of indigna - tion throughout this country .

		The author was Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	, mother of the now famous nov - elist ,
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	; and she had gained the materials for her book during a three years ' residence in this country , spent mostly in
Cin	LOCATION	- cinnati ,
Ohio	LOCATION	, then a little town of some twenty thousand inhabitants .

		The refined and luxury - loving woman , fond of social pleasures and accustomed to the best associations of literary and social
London	LOCATION	, found the manners of the small raw backwoods settlement extremely un - congenial and repulsive , and described them without fear or favor .

		She spent but little time in the older and more settled portions of the country , passing through them only on her journey home .

		The
New England States	LOCATION	she never visited at all .

		But with a woman 's fond - ness for generalizations , she labelled what had come within her vision '' American , '' and set it down as the necessary outcome of democracy .

		Naturally , a picture so one-sided and un - favorable was greatly resented by the

		dulness of our so-called festivities ; she con - siders
Jonathan	PERSON	a very dull boy , and says : '' Compared with Americans , we are whirligigs and teetotums ; every day is a holiday and every night a festival . ''

		And the descriptions of the social gatherings she attended certainly war - rant her judgment .

		It is hard to realize that anywhere or at any time American society has been notable for reticence and withdrawal of the sexes from each other ; yet this is some - thing continually noted here .

		Evening parties are thus described : '' The women invariably herd together at one part of the room , and the men at the other ; but , in justice to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, I must acknowledge that this arrangement is by no means peculiar to that city , or to the western side of the Alleghanies ... The gentlemen spit , talk of elections and the price of produce , and spit again .

		The ladies look at each other 's dresses till they know every pin by heart ; talk of
Parson Somebody	ORGANIZATION	's last ser - mon on the day of judgment , on Dr. T'otherbody 's new pills for dyspepsia , till the ' tea ' is announced , when they all console themselves together for whatever they may have suffered in keeping awake , by taking more tea , coffee , hot cake and custard , hoe cake , johnny cake , waffle cake and dodger cake , pickled peaches and pre - served cucumbers , ham , turkey , hung beef , apple sauce , and pickled oysters , than ever were prepared in any other country of the known world .

		After this massive meal is over , they return to the drawing-room , and it always appeared to me that they remained together as long as they could bear it , and then they rise en masse , cloak , bonnet , shawl , and exit '' Still more surprising is it to learn that mixed dinner-parties of ladies and gentlemen were very rare , and that the gentlemen were seated at one end and the ladies at the other , while , unless several foreigners were present , but lit - tle conversation took place at table .

		At large balls , the gentlemen were served to a sump - tuous repast at table in one room , while the ladies had each a plate put into her hands as they pensively promenaded the ball-room dur - ing the absence of the favored lords of crea - tion , or seated themselves at the sides of the room , while sweetmeats , cakes , and creams were passed .

		This division of the company was not owing to absence of room , but simply because the gentlemen liked it better !

		The '' lamentable insignificance of American women '' is another cause of frequent remark , and her description of the '' day '' of a
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia lady of the first class reads like a bit of ancient history , so entirely removed is it in all respects from the life of the '' new woman '' of to-day .

		Its chief event was attendance upon the Dorcas Society an assemblage of ladies provided with parings of broadcloth , ends of rib - bon , gilt paper and minikin pins , out of which 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, they manufactured pin-cushions , ink - wipers , and watch-cases . ''

		Their talk is of priests and missions ; of the profits of their last sale , of their hopes from the next ; of the doubt whether young Mr. This or young Mr.
That	PERSON	should receive the fruits of it to fit him out for
Liberia	LOCATION	; of the very ugly bonnet seen at church on
Sabbath morning	TIME	, of the very handsome preacher who performed on
Sab	ORGANIZATION	- bath afternoon , and of the very large collection made on Sabbath evening .

		This lasts till three , when the car - riage again appears , and the lady and her basket re - turn home ; she mounts to her chamber , carefully sets aside her bonnet and its appurtenances , puts on her scal - loped black silk apron , walks into the kitchen to see that all is right , then into the parlour , where , having cast a careful glance over the table prepared for dinner , she sits down , work in hand , to await her spouse .

		He comes , shakes hands with her , spits , and dines .

		The conversa - tion is not much , and ten minutes suffice for dinner ; fruit and toddy , the newspaper and the work-bag suc - ceed .

		In the evening the gentleman , being a savant , goes to the
Wister	PERSON	society , and afterwards plays a snug rubber at a neighbour 's .

		The lady receives at tea a young missionary and three members of the Dorcas so - ciety .

		And so ends her day . ''

		No wonder that the cultured Englishwoman found the women of
America	LOCATION	, although the handsomest in the world , the least attractive , if this was a fair sample of the occupations and interests of a woman of wealth in a large city !

		But of all the customs of the country , the one to which she alludes of tenest and with great - est repugnance is '' the incessant and remorse - less spitting of Americans . ''

		Alas , that this should also be the one respect in which Amer - ican manners can claim to have made the least improvement !

		That men who profess to be gentlemen who are , in fact , gentlemen in all other respects can permit themselves the indulgence of a habit so disgusting , is a matter for continual surprise to the feminine mind .

		Not only smokers and chewers , not only the ill - bred , but refined and otherwise cleanly gentle - men do still , in cars , at theatres and public places , and even by the fireside , consider it per - missible to indulge in so objectionable a prac - tice ; and it is almost the one direction in which Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	could to-day note scarcely any gain in propriety and decency .

		Tobacco-chewing and whiskey-drinking must certainly have been much more common then than now , since Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	makes the sweep - ing assertion that , except among literary men , she never met any man who had escaped these degrading habits .

		But , also , she never met a literary man who had acquired these habits , which seems to indicate a greater distinction between men of different pursuits than any now existing .

		The native literature , however , did not elicit much praise ; the American reviews contained some clear-headed articles , but they were lacking in the playful vivacity and keenly - cutting satire which , in that day of the reign of '' The
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' and '' The Quarterly , '' was the standard of fine criticism .

		Neither in the writings or conversation of Americans was there any trace of that graceful familiarity of learned allusion and general knowledge which in
Europe	LOCATION	is to be heard in festive halls and gay drawing-rooms , as certainly as in the clois - tered library or student 's quarters .

		Perhaps even to-day there is room for the same criticism and comparison with respect to conversation in polite circles .

		This subtle tone of a cultured so - ciety , which is as distant from pedantry as from ignorance , is not learning itself , but the effect of it .

		It is the last finish of highly finished soci - ety , and the conditions are seldom encountered .

		Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	was almost the first of the tribe with which we have since become so fa - miliar the tribe of English travellers , who , having spent a longer or shorter period in
America	LOCATION	, go home to make a book out of their '' impressions . ''

		But , notwithstanding the lim - itations of which we have already spoken , she was better prepared than most of her succes - sors have been .

		Her knowledge of the country was gained by residence and personal contact ; she had spent almost as many years in the
United States	LOCATION	as some of her followers have spent months ; she was not a literary lion like
Charles Dickens	PERSON	and
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	; and for her , therefore , the people whom she met were not her entertainers , and the society that she found was not consciously on show .

		She described what she saw with a woman 's passion for detail , with all a woman 's keen appreciation of personal description , and with a wealth of anecdote and illustration carefully garnered in the daily intercourse of nearly four years .

		Gifted with a singularly vivacious and pungent style , her book is still better worth reading than many of the newer works on the same subject .

		THE OLD IJIGHT ON THE NEW PATH .

		* A monumental work on the history of owner - ship in primitive society comes from a woman , Miss
Edith J. Simcox	PERSON	.

		In two large volumes of more than 1100 pages , she has presented , in terse style and orderly arrangement , the results of studies and researches that are almost ap - * PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATIONS ; or , History of Ownership in Archaic Communities .

		By
E. J. Simcox	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	: Ma em ill an
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 palling in their magnitude .

		The author mod - estly claims , in the preface to her work , that its aim is simply '' to enable the economic stu - dent to utilize the crumbs that have fallen already from the explorer 's table . ''

		That eco - nomic facts should have significance , it is neces - sary that the student should know the society from whose workings the facts are educed .

		We have in these books a study of society as it ex - isted in that great domestic race which early reached civilization in
Western Asia	LOCATION	and in
Northern Africa	LOCATION	, and which still exists , a mighty power , in the Chinese Empire .

		The work is a marvel of condensed state - ment .

		In a review of reasonable length it is impossible to discuss either subject or treat - ment in any detail .

		At best we can only sketch the outline pursued , and aim to suggest its character and style .

		Miss
Simcox	PERSON	starts from the proposition : ''
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Babylonia	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	are the three great seats of archaic civilization , and the ancient history of each is absolutely free from European influence .

		Two of them are remarkable for the permanence as well as for the antiquity of their national greatness ; and all have left authentic records from which we are able to reconstruct , to some extent at least , the outline of their social and industrial life , and to understand upon what principles they regulated that portion of it which had to do with possessions , or the instruments by which life is maintained . ''

		Recognizing thus the importance of the ma - terial we possess for studying archaic civiliza - tion among these three nations , our author characterizes the people composing them : '' The nations belonging to the group of which
Egypt	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	are representative are for the most part easy - going , pleasure-loving , and pacific , somewhat anarchic , in the strict sense of the word ; that is to say , private life in them is little controlled by government or legislation ; they are liberal in the sense that public opinion always praised giving more than getting , and required a free distribution of family property amongst the members of the household and of the
State	ORGANIZATION	among such members of the
State	ORGANIZATION	as were in need ; and they were also very strongly conservative , since all classes valued their life just as it was , feeling and believing that any change at any point must be a change for the worse .

		If we have to find a single word to describe the points in which these States resemble each other and differ from the modern world , which traces its intellectual parentage to
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, it may be said that the civilization of the great civilized States of Antiquity was domestic , and the civilization of the European States political . ''

		To gain a clear idea of the economic condi - tions of Ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Miss Simcox	PERSON	investi - gates the governmental structure ; the relation of ruler and officials to the people ; the condi - tions of commerce and industry ; class , religion , and priesthood ; and a wide range of kindred subjects .

		Some curious and suggestive thoughts are thus brought out . ''

		The reason that there was so little progressive ac - cumulation of wealth in
Egypt	LOCATION	seems to have been that each generation spent its own savings on its own tombs and temples ; and this habit of dedicating surplus income to a comparatively disinterested , immaterial purpose helped to keep the greed for accumulation at the tem - perate point required for national security . ''

		On the whole , we must believe that the old Egyptians were a happy folk . ''

		v The little people in the city are like the great ones , ' i. e. , have leisure to take part both in religious festivals and in the season 's feasts . ''

		Honesty seems to have been prevalent , and , `` failing other evidence , the solemn oath of an inter - ested party was admitted even in support of his own claim , and accepted as conclusive by the other side . '' ''

		They are certainly the first of all the nations in the world to put on record the existence , and their appreciation of the ex - istence , of love in marriage . ''

		Woman was her husband 's equal , and had remarkable free - dom of action .

		The Nile fertilized land was ever-productive , and native ingenuity had de - vised better irrigation systems than some which modern science has constructed in that same region .

		The ideas underlying such business contracts as antechresis are more humane and kind than those underlying our modern mort - gages . ''

		The essence of an antichretic bargain is the exchange of use .

		The capitalist does not lend his money at interest , nor the landowner sell or let his land , but they exchange their two possessions pro tern. , the use of the money being set against the use of the land .

		In this way the idea of ownership as distinct from use grew up easily and nat - urally , for the ownership might , and often did , continue for generations to belong to one family , while its use remained with another , without the right of the former , to reclaim the land by repaying the money , lapsing . ''

		Our author believes Egyptians ,
Babylonians	LOCATION	, and Chinese to be scattered fragments from one primitive stock .

		Much of their character - istic civilization was acquired before their sep - aration .

		This went with them in their mi - grations .

		In their new homes , with varying conditions of life , further development went on independently , but the common fundamental portion lived on among all .

		Sumer ,
Akkad	PERSON	,
Babylonia	LOCATION	,
Assyria	LOCATION	, show much in common with
Egypt	LOCATION	, with much that is independent and original .

		A wonderful trading people , their weights and measures , the sexagesimal counting , and their science , influenced pro- foundly the ancient world .

		Their financial operations and business transactions were of the most varied kinds , and hundreds of their 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, records are preserved on clay tablets .

		We may read contracts and agreements , records of lawsuits , leases , mortgages , and gain a clear notion of their legal ideas .

		Antichresis sim - ple , or complicated with other forms of con - tract is found here also , as in fact wherever the domestic civilization was at home .

		As to domestic life , it seems to have been much like that of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Society was thoroughly devel - oped , conservative , healthy .

		The people were contented and happy . ''

		This framework -LSB- of society -RSB- had been so patiently elaborated and coordinated , it was so elastic and at the same time so full of resistance , that even a foreign mas - ter found it more politic to preserve it and fall in with its ways than to destroy it ; he was content in most cases to step into the place of the prince he had ousted .

		Af - fairs then fell into their accustomed groove , as soon as the conquest was complete ; classes were reconstituted on their old bases ; property and people took up their former conditions ; the only difference lay in the fact that a new group of privileged individuals shared the wealth created by agricultural , industrial , and commer - cial activity .

		The sovereign and his chief officers might be of foreign race , but the social machine rolled on over the same road and with the same wheels as before . ''

		Our author presents evidence , drawn from monuments and inscriptions , as well as from curious survivals in modern culture , of the for - mer existence of the ancient domestic civiliza - tion over an area extending from
Massalia	LOCATION	to
Malabar	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Phoenicians , Carthaginians ,
Etruscans	LOCATION	,
Lycians	LOCATION	, Rhodians , Cretans , Spar - tans , old Arabians , Indians , and others , are either referred back to the old black-headed race or shown to have been influenced by it .

		Miss
Simcox	PERSON	's second volume is devoted to the Chinese .

		It is a thoughtful study of the life and achievements of that mighty people , tracing the gradual evolution of ideas regard - ing property , society , and government .

		A na - tion which has existed for four thousand years , with authentic historical records for much of that long period , has much to teach the world .

		There are few problems in life but have pre - sented themselves to these '' black-heads , '' and been solved to their satisfaction by them .

		In the solution no class in society has been sacri - ficed .

		Nowhere else is there so great a degree of comfort for all ; nowhere else is ideal society so nearly reached .

		Not that they are social - ists : every man seeks the best for himself , but in the seeking never forgets the rights of oth - ers .

		Property and labor have set values , and to underbid or overcharge to gain a personal advantage are equally reprobated .

		Opportu - nity for rational enjoyment is within the reach of all .

		Never warriors , seldom undertaking great military enterprises , they conquer their conquerors by civilizing and assimilating them .

		Paternal affection and filial respect prevail .

		Admiration for scholarship is universal , and a chance to attain the highest position through learning lies open to the meanest .

		Confucius says the essentials of government are '' ` Sufficiency of food , sufficiency of mili - tary equipment , and the confidence of the peo - ple in their ruler ' ; if one of these must be done without , let it be the military equipment ; if two must be sacrificed , part with the food , ` from of old death has been the lot of all men , ' but the foundation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is in the people 's faith . ''

		Proverbs give the best hints of a people 's inmost thought .

		A Chinese proverb runs : '' When swords are rusty and spades bright , prisons empty and granaries full , the steps of the temples covered with mud and the courts of the tribunals filled with grass , doctors on foot and bakers on horseback , when old men and children abound , the empire is well gov - erned . ''

		The old black-headed race worked out the first known civilization , first built mighty cities , invented writing , made the great discoveries , solved the great problems of life , society , and human relations .

		From its story we might learn a lesson .

		That we should do things just as it did is as unnecessary as that we should try to compel its remaining fraction to do things in our way .

		But to have its life brought before us as
Miss Simcox	PERSON	has presented it , may help us ; for that life has happily attained to many of the best things for which we strive .

		THE DIAL 379 had many intellectual and moral qualities in common .

		The one was the military leader in the first serious attempt to divide the English - speaking world politically , and the other in the only serious attempt to divide that world still farther .

		This is no identification of the causes for which the two men fought ; nor is it to say that
Washington	LOCATION	would have been called a rebel if he had failed , and that Lee would not have been so called had he succeeded .

		A further point of contact is that the two books are written by generals who won their titles in the
Confederate Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two authors are further alike in this : that they make the chap - ters relating to the ancestry of their heroes too long ; and in this : that they lose no opportun - ity ,
Johnson	PERSON	as well as Lee , to say a good word for the cause in which they once hazarded their lives .

		General
Johnson	PERSON	approaches his subject with the diffidence that is natural to a modest man who attempts such a task , when he reflects that '' there are about five hundred biographies of
George Washington	LOCATION	, original and translations , published in almost every language of modern times , as well as Greek and Latin versions of them . ''

		Still , he plucks courage out of his be - lief that his own biography is '' the first at - tempt to consider the military career of Wash - ington , and to write his life as a soldier . ''

		On the whole , it must be said that his attempt is very successful .

		There are not lacking features that deserve criticism .

		Ill sense of proportion is shown in the undue compression of some parts of the story , and the undue expansion of other parts .

		We have a very good account of
Braddock	PERSON	's expedition ; but when the remnants of that expedition are brought back to the set - tlements , the writer passes immediately to the treaty entered into at the close of the war , and then adds to his chapter eight pages of mat - ter , all of it more or less interesting , but some of which should have made room for a rapid sketch of the later fortunes of the struggle , thus avoiding the abrupt transition experienced in passing from
1755	DATE	to
1763	DATE	.

		This may serve as an illustration of the defective sense of pro- portion that is sometimes shown .

		We are not even told why
Washington	LOCATION	did not farther par - ticipate in the war .

		But , all defects aside , the author has made a careful study of his subject , and shows a clear and strong grasp of the mili - tary career and character of
Washington	LOCATION	, which he also presents in a plain , sensible , and vigor - ous style of composition .

		The book is a valuable contribution to the literature of its subject .

		General
Fitzhugh Lee	PERSON	, as might be expected , writes of his hero , not only con amore , but con magna amore .

		To the high estimate in which
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	's abilities , character , and achieve - ments are universally held , he adds the pride of a nephew , of a Confederate soldier , and of a Virginian .

		He dwells on his ancestry , re - counts the story of his life down to the Civil War , shows him to us as he stood deprecating the act of secession but resolved '' to go with his
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' and follows him through the four years ' struggle , and then to the close of his life .

		Only a specialist could pronounce with confidence on the military aspects of the work , point by point ; but , on the whole , it is an interesting and valuable account of the great Confederate commander , doing full justice to his intellec - tual , moral , and professional character .

		Nearly every page , however , bears witness that the writer is less familiar with the pen than he is reputed to be with the sword .

		Rhetorical in - felicities abound , and grammatical errors occur .

		He dedicates the book to the memory of '' the soldiers who fought and fell under the wave of
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	's sword , '' etc. .

		Generally , the narrative is clear and continuous ; but when , on the battle-field , the author sees '' the red - crested wave of assault , '' beholds battalions '' marching into the jaws of death '' or re - coiling from '' the mouth of hell , '' and hears the Southern guns '' raining metallic tons '' on the Northern infantry , while the cavalry are '' stormed at with shot and shell , '' he becomes confused in his story and grows lurid in lan - guage .

		He has a habit of tagging out his sen - tences with bits of striking quotation .

		Gettys - burg was lost because Lee 's orders were not obeyed .

		The official head of the offender , how - ever , did not '' drop in the basket , '' owing to Lee 's '' great heart , or habit of self-denying for himself , self-suffering for others . ''

		The author does not apparently think whether so great a captain as he holds his hero to be would allow himself to be governed by such considerations .

		The last chapter , which is devoted to Lee 's mil - itary character , we can not think very satisfac - tory .

		Eminently worthy of being read is the portion of the book that deals with
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	's connection with
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lee University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The facts stated in connection with the trustees ' tendering him the presidency , and his acceptance of the office , show clearly the financial condition of the institution at the time and also the financial condition of the whole Southern country at the close of the War .

AMERICAN HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.
Gold win Smith	PERSON	, in referring to
Washington	LOCATION	, says : '' His form , like all other forms of the Rev - olution , has no doubt been seen through a golden haze of panegyric . ''

		The statement suggests a marked weakness in our methods of study of the formative days of the republic .

		When a writer tries to discuss ante-revolutionary times with cool consid - eration , looking at each question raised with the eye of the critic , there is a consciousness of uneasiness on the part of the readers , who are impatient of such methods in telling the life of people who have been surrounded so long with this halo of glory .

		Some of the suggestions of Professor Sumner in his chapters on '' Social Features before the Revolution '' in his little book on
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	, or of
William B. Weeden	PERSON	in his '' Economic and Social History of
New England	LOCATION	, '' certainly appeal with strength to the iconoclast of modern scientific meth - ods ; but the heresy creates no end of comment among those who have read only to glorify , and who can not be brought to the point of believing that many of the heroic figures which loom so grandly in the twilight of the century are but images of com - mon clay .

		Americans have been trained to glorify , to cherish the memory only of that which appeals to the sentiment ; and , as a consequence , catch - phrases and high-sounding expressions have been incorporated into our history , to the exclusion of much that is fact .

		Putnam galloping down a hill , or Lawrence crying '' Do n't give up the ship , '' or
Francis Marion	PERSON	eating sweet potatoes from off a log , or
Thomas J. Jackson	PERSON	standing like a stone - wall , these are the pictures we have been encour - aged to preserve ; while the great mass of mankind , those who have had no fortune to make them par - ticularly conspicuous , have been almost entirely for - gotten .

		Mr.
Greene	PERSON	, in his '' Historical View of the American Revolution , '' gives lists of the general officers of the American army at various times dur - ing the Revolutionary War .

John Paterson	PERSON	would pass entirely into oblivion .

		There was real worth in a man of whom it could be said upon a memorial tablet placed in the meet - ing-house in Lenox : `` He graduated at
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	in
1762	DATE	, represented
Lenox	LOCATION	in the
Provincial Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
1774	DATE	and
1775	DATE	, raised a regiment on his return in
1775	DATE	, and was one of the first in the field with it after the battle of Lex - ington .

		He crossed the
Delaware	LOCATION	with
Washington	LOCATION	, and narrowly escaped death at
Saratoga	LOCATION	; he was at the council of Monmouth in
1778	DATE	, and fought in most of the battles of the Revolution , serving during the whole war , and was one of the founders of the society of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		His love of country was unbounded , his patriotism unflinching , and his public spirit untiring . ''

		The life of General
Paterson	PERSON	, written by his great - grandson , tells many incidents of value to our early history ; and there would be wonder at the neglect of so good a leader , if the '' haze of panegyric '' were not remembered .

		If indices are to be trusted , this general is mentioned neither by
Bancroft	LOCATION	nor
Hildreth	PERSON	.

		There are several chapters which will be read more carefully than those that tell of the military life of the hero , the one on
Shay	PERSON	's Rebellion being particularly valuable .

		Many features of social life find mention ; and despite the first impression , that it is only an offering of family love , the book will repay quite careful examination .

		It used to be said that a colonial Virginian would go ten miles any day to catch a horse to ride to town a mile dis - tant .

		General
Paterson	PERSON	was somewhat different in temperament , apparently , because he used to walk eighteen miles to court , when he was county judge , rather than take the trouble to go to the pasture to catch his horse .

		He did not have a lazy bone in his six feet of frame , and seems to have been a good type of the stalwart pioneer of early days .

		If our historians have erred in allowing sentiment to get the advantage of fact in many instances , they just as certainly have been unfortunate in coloring with prejudice their accounts of some early religious troubles .

		It is results that tell ; and when the in - vasion of the Quakers , the anxiety about
Ann Hutchison	PERSON	, and the banishment of
Roger Williams	PERSON	are considered in the light of subsequent develop - ments , the student is forced to take different views than those that have prevailed so long , owing to the provincialism of the
New England	LOCATION	makers of our history .

		Mr.
Straus	PERSON	shows
Roger Williams	PERSON	in the true historic setting .

		In his earlier production , '' The Origin of Republican Form of Government , '' he had declared of
Roger Williams	PERSON	: `` To him rightly be - longs the immortal fame of having been the first person in modern times to assert and maintain in its fullest plenitude the absolute right of every man to a ' full liberty in religious concernments , ' and to found a state wherein this doctrine was the keystone of its organic laws . ''

		This thought , elaborated , makes up Mr.
Straus	PERSON	's new book , ''
Roger Williams	PERSON	, the Pioneer of Religious Liberty . ''

		There is , of necessity , a good deal of religious controversy in the several chapters ; but the author presents many very
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 interesting facts to support his thesis , and these soften the asperities and make the volume readable and suggestive .

		There are many words of praise for the hero , but not too many .

		Unless one is very much biased by former historic training , there will be agreement with these two sentences : '' We call those great who have devoted their lives to some noble cause , and have thereby influenced for the better the course of events .

		Measured by that standard ,
Roger Williams	PERSON	deserves a high niche in the temple of fame , alongside of the greatest reformers who mark epochs in the world 's history . '' ''

		The Making of the
Ohio Valley States	LOCATION	'' is the fourth in the series of illustrated books in which Mr.
Samuel Adams Drake	PERSON	is telling the story of the de - velopment of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It follows the lines laid down in the former numbers , discussing subjects topically , and aiming to afford supplement - ary material to teachers and other readers who de - pend for the main facts upon ordinary school histo - ries .

		The arrow-head upon the cover is typical of the illustrations , which are very helpful in giving impres - sions of the varied features of life in the early days .

		The story is divided into three parts , descriptive of `` The Conquest of the West , '' `` The Advance into the West , '' and '' The Progress of the West . ''

		The familiar tales of pioneer life are presented in pleas - ing form , and many matters to which it is not easy to refer in the ordinarily accessible books are ex - plained with sufficient clearness and completeness .

		Mr.
Drake	PERSON	is always entertaining , and even the dull episodes of history reflect brighter colors when he paints - them .

		The motto of his series is , '' Tell the Truth . ''

		Romancers have filled our histories with wonderful tales ; truth reveals many things stranger than any fiction .

		For the class of readers intended to be reached , there are no popular histories better than these ; because , by reference to authority , by supplementary foot-note , by illustration from local environment , Mr.
Drake	PERSON	has stamped his narrative with the certificate of truthfulness .

		When Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	, and other writers about
Puri	PERSON	- tan days , attempt to lessen the measure of oppro - brium resting upon the people of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	for their share in the witchcraft delusion , mention is always made of the `` pirates who had begun to in - fest the coast and disturb commerce . ''

		The pirates were everywhere in colonial times , the line of de - markation between a privateer and a pirate , a licensed fighter and a freebooter , being a very faint one indeed .

		Mr.
Hughson	PERSON	, in his account of '' The
Carolina Pirates	LOCATION	and
Colonial Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, '' has made an exhaustive study of the situation along the coasts of the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, searching in many a nook and corner for facts , and making an apparently trivial part of American history seem quite important in the light of his interesting narrative .

		He rightly lays the blame for the existence of pirates upon the Navigation Acts .

		When the mother country at - tempted to compel the colonists to sell in a market where competition was prevented , the temptation was strong to cultivate the friendship of those who dared to risk violation of the law for the sake of possible gain .

		The conscience of the individual be - came stilled in the presence of commercial interest ; and if a violator were caught and brought to trial , it was more than likely that the solemn-faced jurors who heard the testimony were themselves gainers from the illegal trade .

		The richness of the Span - ish trade proved another very strong temptation to piracy , and there was little opposition to be feared from the mother country , because the downfall of Spanish supremacy on the sea meant the advance of
England	LOCATION	.

		The pirates were free livers ; they had many ways of scattering their ill-gotten gains , and public sentiment easily became corrupted , until many were perfectly willing to support the bucca - neers on the ground that piracy was a necessary evil which might as well as not be made to pay trib - ute to the community .

		Mr.
Hughson	PERSON	offers us a curious study , especially if one think of it in con - nection with the words of Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	, '' The most serious evil of the colonies was the number and the force of the influences which were impelling large classes to violence and anarchy , brutalizing them by accustoming them to an unrestrained exercise of power , and breaking down among them that salu - tary respect for authority which lies at the root of all true national greatness . ''

		Piracy and smuggling Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	regards as in - fluences of this kind ; and he classes with them the corrupting power of slavery and with the treat - ment of the Indians by the colonists .

		The stand - point of the pioneers on the border was always vastly different from that of those remote from the .

		presence of the redskins .

		In '' General
Joseph Mar	PERSON	- tin and the War of the Revolution in the West , '' Professor Weeks tells the story of the fighting with the Cherokees , who , instigated by the British , made life a burden to the people of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Gen - eral
Martin	PERSON	was especially skilled in Indian diplo - macy , and rendered very effective service to the American cause , quieting the savages on many oc - casions when their added opposition would have been disastrous , as , for example , in the
King 's Mountain	ORGANIZATION	campaign .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	gives a good ac - count of the organization of the
State of Franklin	ORGANIZATION	, in which matter
General Martin	ORGANIZATION	opposed Sevier and the other so-called commonwealth-builders .

		He was a sturdy upholder of the authority of the gov - ernment at all times , and only one versed in
West	LOCATION	- ern lore can appreciate all that is meant by such a statement .

		If , as
George Washington	LOCATION	used to de - clare ,
Lord Dunmore	ORGANIZATION	made treaties with the In - dians , in
1775	DATE	, with the possibility of independence of the colonies in mind , hoping in the wilderness to set up obstacles in the way of the new govern - ment , the work of a pioneer leader like
Martin	PERSON	is to be more praised , when tested by the true rule of results .

		A man six feet in height , weighing over two hundred pounds , never sick in his life , he was a type of the hardy pioneer , to whose indomitable perseverance and unflinching bravery the
United States	LOCATION	owes so much .

		382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, For the adequate tribute to these pioneers , mate - rial is being gathered by many hands .

		Their study is in more than one way peculiar .

		There was a restlessness about them which made them impatient of restraint ; they were men of great strength , of will as well as of sinew ; they feared no foe ; they were absolutely essential to the winning of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	has few equals in delineat - ing their character .

		His volume on `` The Found - ing of the Trans - Allegheny Commonwealths '' covers the seven years immediately following the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion .

		Many people are inclined to put so much into the idea of '' manifest destiny '' that they have ex - treme difficulty in understanding writers who show how the West had to be won .

		Writing to
Benja	LOCATION	- min
Harrison	PERSON	in
1784	DATE	,
Washington	LOCATION	declared his be - lief that `` The Western States stand , as it were , upon a pivot .

		The touch of a feather would turn them any way . ''

		Jefferson saw the same thing , when he informed
Madison	PERSON	, in
1787	DATE	: '' When we consider the temper of the people of that country , derived from the circumstances which surround them , we must suppose their separation possible at every moment . ''

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	shows us what these circumstances were . ''

		North and south of the valley lay warlike and pow - erful Indian confederacies , now thoroughly alarmed and angered by the white advance ; while behind these war - rior tribes , urging them to hostility , and furnishing them the weapons and means wherewith to fight , stood the representatives of two great European nations , both bitterly hostile to the new
America	LOCATION	, and both anxious to help in every way the red savages who strove to stem the tide of settlement . ''

		There were three tasks to be done by the winners of the West , tasks to be accomplished under pain of utter failure . ''

		It was their duty to invade and tame the shaggy wilderness ; to drive back the Indians and their
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean allies ; and to erect free governments which should form parts of the indissoluble Union . ''

		In showing how these three results were brought about , Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	deals with the important ques - tions connected with the inrush of settlers , the In - dian wars , the navigation of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, the state of
Franklin	PERSON	, the development of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, the organization and settlement of the
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	, and the Indian troubles in the South - west .

		One has difficulty in commenting where there is so much good , but there certainly is a great deal of value to be attached to the characterizations of the pioneers who came into the West in such num - bers after the Revolution , at first the hunter - trapper ; then the hunter-settler , who soon became cramped for room as population increased , and so moved on to a more remote part ; then the perma - nent pioneer , who came resolved to stay and make a home ; and , here and there , a fourth class , com - posed of sons of prominent families , the gentry of the new territory .

		These pioneers were not gifted with much learning of the books , but they spoke with authority .

		One wrote to the Indians : '' You will compell ous to retaliate , which will be a grate pridgedes to your nation . '' ''

		He did not spell well , '' remarks our author , '' but his meaning was plain , and his hand was known to be heavy . ''

		The British come in for well-deserved criticism for their holding of the Western posts so long , and for the part they played in trying to check the advance of civilization , the sinister influence of the fur-trade being again brought to notice .

		The importance of the waterways is clearly shown , the navigation ques - tion , with its various accompanying schemes , being fully discussed .

		The reader rather enjoys the clear statement of the truth about General
James Wilkin	PERSON	- son , who usually has had the good fortune to get off too easily , when handled by our writers . ''

		In character he can only be compared to
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	, though he entirely lacked
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's ability and brilliant courage .

		He had no conscience and no scruples ; he had not the slightest idea of the meaning of the word honor ; he betrayed his trust from the basest motives , and he was too inefficient to make his betrayal effective .

		He was treacherous to the
Union	LOCATION	while it was being formed and after it bad been formed ; and his crime was aggravated by the sordid meanness of his motives , for he eagerly sought opportunities to barter his own infamy for money .

		In all our history there is no more despicable character . ''

		There is enough of the romantic in the stories which are scattered through Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's volume to keep up the interest of the careless reader ; while the clear statements about controverted questions of our Western history will attract the student , who is sometimes bewildered , as he tries to work his way through the labyrinth , confused by the persuasive - ness of the descendant of this hero or that , who would keep him from the silken thread that would lead him to the centre of the maze .

		A vindication of anyone has few charms to Amer - ican readers .

		Truth can not easily overtake a lie , and popular biographers have a great influence in creating general impressions .

		Mr.
Charles Henry Lee	PERSON	, the author of ''
Arthur Lee	PERSON	as seen in History , '' had therefore an unpleasant task in undertaking to refute certain charges made by influential writers against a member of his distinguished family .

		It was unfortunate that
Lee	PERSON	did not get along with
Franklin	PERSON	, for the position of our ministers abroad during the Revolution at best was anything but enviable .

		The strictest harmony would have been desirable .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	endeavors , by quoting from official documents and extensive correspondence , to show that the career of
Arthur Lee	PERSON	was creditable to himself and to the government , and that after his return home he remained a distinguished and trusted citizen of the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		With one exception , each of the books that have been mentioned deals in some way with the Revo - lution , thus calling our attention again to the many - sided nature of that great struggle for American independence .

		THE DIAL HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		ii .

		Resuming , and concluding , our necessarily gen - eral survey of the current
Holiday Publications	ORGANIZATION	, we may begin with a notably elegant and artistic publica - tion Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's quarto vol - ume containing twelve favorite '' Border Ballads , '' illustrated with twelve etchings by C. 0 .

		Murray , and prefaced with an Introductory Essay by -LRB- why say it ? -RRB-

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	's designs are equally well conceived and executed , showing a finish and feeling , and a conscientious effort to catch and render the finer spirit and distinctive aroma of the several pieces , that lift them out of the level of ordinary book-illustration .

		While every ballad-lover will necessarily miss in the present col - lection a prime personal favorite or two , the selec - tions are well made , and are fairly representative of the more serious and romantic order of ballads .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's Introduction is sober , pithy , and to the point .

		He has treated his subject from the anti- quarian and historical side , abstaining from `` sign - post criticism , '' and judiciously leaving to the artist the pictorial aspects of the text .

		Another notable art-book is
Messrs. Porter & Coates	ORGANIZATION	's new two-volume edition of Miss
Zimmern	PERSON	's translation of De Amicis 's `` Holland . ''

		The pic - torial feature of the work is forty-four full-page photogravures , after views taken in
Holland	LOCATION	espe - cially for it by Dr.
Charles L. Mitchell	PERSON	, who has , as usual , shown no less skill with his camera than taste in his choice of subjects .

		The volumes are finely bound in red cloth stamped with the national tulip , and each is encased in a stout slip-cover .

		An excellent map is a feature for which careful readers will be truly thankful .

		De Amicis 's work is one of the most fascinating books of travel ever written , and as a familiar pen-picture of
Holland	LOCATION	and the Hollanders of to-day it has no peer in any language .

		Apart from its literary charm , it may serve as a larger guide-book ; and , in short , no judicious trav - eller nowadays visits
Holland	LOCATION	without first resorting to De Amicis .

		The one thing lacking in the pres - ent edition is an index .

		A work that will doubtless prove a favorite with seekers of the more substantial and elegant gift - books is
Canon Farrar	ORGANIZATION	's fine volume on '' The Life of Christ as Represented in Art '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The scope and aim of the work are well indicated in the title .

		Canon
Farrar	PERSON	disclaims in his preface the intention of intruding '' upon the functions of the art critic , '' or even of attempting an art history , in the stricter sense of the term . ''

		This book has not , '' he says , '' been written from love of art , deep as my love of art is , but because I wished to illus - trate the thoughts about religion , and especially about our
Saviour Jesus Christ	ORGANIZATION	, of which art has eternized the ever-varying phases . ''

		Touching his theme but secondarily on its technical and purely aesthetic sides , the author has regarded the works of Christian art mainly as spiritual documents which show the religious tone and attitude of different periods , and indicate the great phases of religious thought which have changed and are changing from age to age .

		At the same time ,
Canon Farrar	ORGANIZATION	shows himself deeply penetrated with a sense of the beauty and majesty of the masterpieces he describes , and of the gifts and acquirements of their makers ; and his readers will not fail to find their own art en - thusiasms and appreciations enhanced and refined by his eloquent pages .

		The examples are drawn largely from the great Italian works of the four - teenth and fifteenth centuries the Dutch , German , and Flemish schools being referred to less frequently , and the Spanish painters , except
Velasquez	PERSON	, scarcely at all .

		The volume , a large , beautifully printed octavo , is profusely and artistically illustrated with one hundred and sixty engravings in the text and twenty-three full-page plates , thus presenting a com - plete pictorial history of the changing conceptions of Christ and of the central incidents in his life .

		Lovers of athletics -LRB- and their name is now legion in
America	LOCATION	-RRB- will find their special holiday account in Mr.
Caspar W. Whitney	PERSON	's liberally-illustrated volume , '' A Sporting Pilgrimage '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	went to
England	LOCATION	, the athlete 's Mecca , ex - pressly to watch the Britisher at play on his own soil , study his sporting systems and traditions , and report thereupon for the behoof of ambitious ama - teurs at home .

		The present volume the text of which has already , we think , appeared serially in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' and ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' is the literary outcome of the trip .

		Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	seems to have seen in
England	LOCATION	about everything worth seeing in the line of out-door sports hunt - ing , golf , cycling , university and club rowing , track athletics , football , cricket , etc. ; and he describes what he saw with the zest of an enthusiast and the point and clearness of an expert .

		Touching the prevalence of the sporting spirit in
England	LOCATION	, Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	quotes the following curious challenge from the advertisement columns of a
London	LOCATION	daily paper : '' Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	will sing a linnet against a linnet , one in the mouth , an home-and-home race , for 2 a side .

		A match can be made by calling at the Elephant and
Castle	ORGANIZATION	,
Orchard Street	ORGANIZATION	,
Westmin	ORGANIZATION	- ster , any evening after eight
P.M.	LOCATION	'' The publishers have made the volume a very attractive one artist - ically and mechanically .

		We shall congratulate in advance those who shall find among their holiday gifts the two bound vol - umes now ready of '' European Architecture '' -LRB- Chi - cago :
Smith & Packard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a really artistic monthly publication of ten photogravure illustrations , that bids fair to become as well known to cultivated peo - ple generally as it already is to professional archi - tects .

		The views in the present volumes are drawn almost entirely from
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	; and for prospective tourists to those countries they form the best possible pictorial preparative for an intelligent enjoyment of their architectural treasures .

		Profes - 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, sional taste and judgment have , of course , been em - ployed in the choice of subjects ; and these comprise a great variety of buildings and sections of build - ings , interiors and exteriors , fine facades , doorways , capitals , and architectural details generally , tombs , monuments , bas-reliefs , wrought-iron work , etc. .

		Col - lectors of this class of foreign photographs will thank the present publishers for a royal road , easy , short , and comparatively inexpensive , to the object of their desires .

		The plates , each about 7x9 , are finely printed on 9 ^ x12 bond paper , and bound in soft covers .

		A stout tied portfolio encloses both volumes , making an ensemble at once elegant and convenient , and suitable for library or parlor .


Hilda Gamlin	PERSON	's '' Life and Art of
George Rom	PERSON	- ney '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an interesting account of that admirable artist , of whom little has been generally known hitherto , save that he was a contemporary of
Reynolds	PERSON	, and once bade fair to share the honors of the town with that prince of portrait painters . ''

		There are , '' said Lord Chancellor
Thurlow	PERSON	, '' two factions in art , and I am of the Romney faction . ''

		Strange to say , Sir
Joshua	PERSON	, who , as
Johnson	PERSON	said , '' hated no one living , '' seems to have at least dis - liked Romney .

		He used to speak of him slightingly as '' the man in Cavendish square '' though prob - ably this only recorded lapse of a courtesy that was proof even against
Johnson	PERSON	's bearishness was really due not so much to personal jealousy as to
Romney	ORGANIZATION	's persistent refusal to exhibit at the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		In one respect
Romney	PERSON	had an undeniable advantage over his great rival , and over
Gainsborough	LOCATION	: in the durability of his pigments .

		Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's '' flying colors '' were proverbial in his own day ; and a hundred years ago it was com - plained that he made his pictures die before the sitter .

		`` Reynolds filled the halls of
England	LOCATION	, '' says Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, `` with the ghosts of her noble Squires and Dames , '' but , alas !

		one may add , they are now too many of them the ghosts of ghosts .

		Romney 's colors , on the contrary , seem as fresh and solid to-day as when they were laid on ; and that he was not hopelessly behind
Reynolds	PERSON	in grace and invention , in the art of making his portraits true pictures as well as mere likenesses , is attested by the many charming plates in the present volume .

		Miss
Gamlin	PERSON	's book is a timely one .

		There is just now a revival of
Romney	ORGANIZATION	's popularity ; and we learn that at a recent exhibition at the
Grafton Gallery	ORGANIZATION	of portraits of fair women there were twenty-one of his canvasses , against nineteen of Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's .

		Again , as in their own day , is
London	LOCATION	divided on the question of their rival merits , the scales of pop - ularity being pretty evenly balanced .

		The volume is produced in fairly good shape , and the eighteen full-page illustrations lend it the conventional hol - iday flavor .

		It is surprising that so piquant and tempting a book as the '' Memoirs of the Duchesse de Gon - taut '' should have so long escaped the translators .

		The French original was published in
1853	DATE	; and the first English version is now issued in two rather elaborate volumes by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mme. de Gontaut 's reminiscences range from the clos - ing days of the old regime , through the revolutionary and Napoleonic eras and the first and second res - torations , to the reign of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	.

		Born in
1773	DATE	, she saw as a child the waning splendors of Old
France	LOCATION	quenched in the chaos that heralded the drama of the Terror the courtly gayeties of
Versailles	LOCATION	merging with startling swiftness in her earlier memories into the mad carmagnoles and orgies of revolutionary
Paris	LOCATION	.

		`` Les aristocrates h la lanterne ! ''

		was a familiar and terrifying cry in her childish ears ; and she recalls , as some grim night - mare , the raging mobs from the
Faubourg Saint Antoine	ORGANIZATION	pouring through the
Paris	LOCATION	streets , shouting , dancing , and singing , reeking with blood and wine , the men disguised as nuns , the women as Capuchin monks , '' loaded with booty , and in a state of ex - citement and intoxication frightful to witness . ''

		In
1792	DATE	Mme. de Gontaut 's parents joined the ranks of the emigres , and she accompanied them to Hol - land , and , a year later , to
England	LOCATION	, where they re - mained until the first restoration .

		After the acces - sion of Louis XVIII .

		she was appointed governess to the royal children ; and from that time up to
1836	DATE	, where the Memoir closes , she was in close touch with the reigning family and its immediate entourage .

		The book is entertaining throughout , light , pleasantly discursive the retrospect of a bright and cheery old lady of eighty , who has seen the great world and been of it , and yields to the entreaties of her friends to tell the story of her long and eventful life . ''

		One can hardly be expected , '' says Mme. de Gontaut , '' to write well at eighty . ''

		Certainly not so well , the reader is likely to add , as Mme. de Gontaut has written .

		The publishers have issued the work in good shape , and the twelve por - traits are attractive and interesting .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons publish , in form generally similar to their small folio editions of ''
Marse Chan	PERSON	'' and '' Meh Lady , '' Mr.
Thomas Nel	PERSON	- son Page 's '' Polly , '' with six illustrations by
A. Cas	ORGANIZATION	- taigne . ''

		Polly '' is a sentimental tale of rural life in
Virginia	LOCATION	'' befo ' the wah , '' a literary province in which the author reigns supreme .

		The story has the usual local flavor of mint juleps , bluster , '' darkey '' dialect , pinchbeck chivalry , and the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	generally , and Mr.
Page	PERSON	paints his characters with a fidelity that makes one wonder the more at his predilection for their uncouth and unlovely proto - types .

		Mr.
Castaigne	PERSON	's drawings range from fair to indifferent .

		The drift of Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	's little book , `` Childhood in Literature and Art '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is manifest in the title .

		Beginning with the classic prototypes
Astyanax	PERSON	and the young Ascanius , Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	traces the long line of childish figures in the art and letters of different times and peoples , down to the
Paul Dombeys	PERSON	and little Pearls of our own day .

		The theme is gracefully treated ; and Mr.

		THE DIAL 385
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	adds some useful observations on literature for children a topic on which he is specially qual - ified to speak . ''

		Hoofs , Claws , and Antlers '' -LRB-
Frank S. Thayer	PERSON	,
Denver	LOCATION	-RRB- is the sufficiently striking title of a novel and interesting publication which is throughout a product of the Far West , and a very creditable one .

		The book , a flat quarto , full gilt , printed on thin boards , contains thirty-six large half-tone pictures of wild game in their native haunts , reproduced from photographs taken by Mr. and Mrs.
A. G. Wallihan	PERSON	.

		The unique merit of these plates lies in the fact that the creatures are shown each in its normal state and habitat ; Mr.
Wallihan	PERSON	, in taking his '' snap shots '' simply substituting the
Kodak	ORGANIZATION	for the deadly Winchester .

		The following account of one of his minor photographic `` bags '' may serve to indicate his modus operandi in securing the neg - atives -LRB- at best a most ticklish undertaking -RRB- , as well as the peculiar value of the finished results . ''

		I had , '' says Mr.
Wallihan	PERSON	, '' waited long and patiently one morning , when I saw the gleam of the sun on a pair of horns through the cedars .

		With nerves all of a tremor I waited to see if he -LRB- the deer -RRB- would keep on the trail he was on , which passed about sixty feet from me ; but no he turns directly toward me and comes panting down the trail until within sixty feet , when I bleated like a fawn , at which he instantly stopped , with his mouth wide open , as he had evidently been running and was very fat .

		The click of my shutter told me that I had his shadow hard and fast , so when he had looked and I had admired him as much as I liked , I moved my hand and he was gone almost like magic . ''

		The picto - rial result of this operation is a really noble bit of realism .

		At the foot of a gentle declivity , ridged with rocks and scrubby cedars , stands the stag with upthrown head and branching antlers , alert , startled , snuffing danger and quivering with sudden alarm a true lord of the glen .

		Landseer or Rosa Bon - heur never chose a finer motif .

		Other plates show us as in a mirror picturesque groups of deer , ante - lope , and bison ,
Rocky Mountain	ORGANIZATION	goats , many of them taken near at hand , a treed cougar , a brace of bears foraging in a berry-patch , a bull elk , a lone coyote '' out for a breakfast , '' a colony of prairie - dogs and owls , a monstrous rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike , etc. , the realism of each picture be - ing enhanced by the stretch of wild
Colorado	LOCATION	scenery which forms its setting .

		The book contains portraits of Mr. and Mrs.
Wallihan	PERSON	, together with their own brief and modest account of their lives , and of the way in which some of the more notable negatives were obtained .

		Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	furnishes a warmly commendatory preface ; and we join him in wishing so fresh and informing a work the suc - cess it deserves .

		The elaborate and cumbersome edition of
John Anster	PERSON	's metrical translation of Part I. of Goethe 's '' Faust , '' with illustrations by Mr.
Frank M. Greg	PERSON	- ory and an introduction by
Burdett Mason	PERSON	, first issued in
1888	DATE	, is now reprinted , with some changes , in a convenient octavo by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		All of Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	's main designs , thirty - eight in number , are given , considerably reduced , in the new edition the original eighteen colored aquarelles being replaced by tinted photogravures .

		The text is clearly printed on moderately-glazed paper , and the volume altogether makes a good ap - pearance .

		Dr.
Anster	PERSON	's version is one of the good ones that of the Second Part almost the best ex - tant .

		Some of Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	's drawings , notably the frontispiece and '' The Fountain , '' are graceful and pretty ; but he is , on the whole , plainly over - weighted with his theme .

		A beautiful and instructive art-work that should find especial favor with holiday buyers is ''
Raphael	PERSON	's Madonnas '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Karl K ^ roly , author of `` A Guide to the Paintings of
Florence	LOCATION	. ''

		The pictorial features of the work comprise fifty-three illustrations , including nine photogravures , after
Raphael	PERSON	; and these have been in all cases made directly from the paintings themselves , and not from reproductions .

		Each plate is concisely de - scribed and characterized , and the author has added a brief life of
Raphael	PERSON	and an index to his works .

		An attractive little volume of '' Old English Songs '' -LRB- `` old but choicely good , '' as
Walton	PERSON	said -RRB- , illus - trated with much humor by
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	, is issued by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each verse is printed by itself , and is faced by the illustration it suggests .

		There are ten titles , including ''
Coridon	PERSON	's Song '' and '' The Angler 's Song '' from '' The Complete Angler , '' '' Come Sweet Lass , '' '' A Journey to Exe - ter , '' `` Sir Dilberry Diddle , '' etc. ; and Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	furnishes an introduction , which he felici - tously describes as '' somewhat invertebrate and inconclusive . '' ''

		A Girl I Know '' -LRB- Knight -RRB- appears at first sight a book of verses and illustrative drawings of the con - ventional type .

		But closer examination reveals the fact that the pictures are not fanciful sketches , but photogravure reproductions from actual negatives , made by Mrs.
N. Gray Bartlett	PERSON	.

		They all repre - sent the same maiden , but her surroundings are widely varied , and show many aspects of rural life .

		Mrs.
Bartlett	PERSON	's standing as an amateur photog - rapher is a sufficient warrant for the taste displayed in pose and setting , and the result is , in many cases , strikingly artistic .

		As for the verses by Miss
Marian L. Wyatt	PERSON	, they are evidently written up to the pic - tures , and will serve , although in no way remarkable .

		The new six-volume edition of the novels of
Susan Edmonstone Ferrier	PERSON	is a welcome addition to the series of exquisite reprints sent to us from time to time by
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
R. Brim	PERSON	- ley
Johnson	PERSON	writes the introduction , and Miss
Nelly Ericksen	PERSON	prepares the drawings , reproduced in pho - togravure , three to a volume .

		A group of
Miss Ferrier	ORGANIZATION	's letters acceptably supplements the bio - graphical and critical introductory matter .

		Thus equipped for a fresh career , these novels of the lesser 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	ought to take a fresh lease of life , and they are , on the whole , worth the pains that have been taken , by publishers , editor , and artist , to make them attractive . ''

		Marriage , '' '' Destiny , '' and '' The Inheritance '' are the titles .

		Our readers are already sufficiently familiar with the form and merits of Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	's excellent
Library Edition of Victor Hugo	ORGANIZATION	's Romances , which now reaches an opportune con - clusion with two new volumes `` Hans of
Iceland	LOCATION	, '' and '' ' Bug-Jargal , ' '
Claude Gueux	PERSON	, ' and ' The Last Day of a Condemned . ' ''

		Thus complete , the set will commend itself to seekers of the more sub - stantial and standard class of holiday gifts .

		We have previously referred to the completion of the `` Ariel '' Shakespeare -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , in forty volumes , but should add that it is published not only in the full-leather style of our description , but also in garnet cloth , at a very moderate price .

		In the latter form it closely resembles the `` Temple '' Shakespeare -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to the nine volumes of which already mentioned there are now added two others `` As You Like It '' and `` The Taming of the Shrew . ''

		Either of these editions would make a holiday gift of the most acceptable sort .

		Few as have been the books issued by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, they have been so artistically planned and so distinctive in their individuality as to win for their publisher a warm place in the affections of the book-lover .

		Not long ago we had occasion to praise the two new volumes of the `` Bibelot '' series , and we now have .

		occasion to give thanks for a still choicer gift the sonnet-sequence of Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- ert Bridges on '' The Growth of Love . ''

		Practically inaccessible hitherto -LRB- only one hundred copies hav - ing been privately issued from Mr.
Daniel	PERSON	's Oxford press -RRB- , the four hundred copies of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's ex - quisite reprint quintuple at one stroke the poet 's audience .

		An essay on the poetry of Mr. Bridges , by that rising English critic Mr.
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	, here serves as an introduction , and is reprinted from the '' Century Guild Hobby Horse '' of Octo - ber ,
1891	DATE	.

		We may also , in this connection , refer readers wishing further critical aid to Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's appreciation of the poet in '' The Fort - nightly Review '' of
last July	DATE	.

		The reprint now be - fore us is uniform in style with Mr.
George Mere	PERSON	- dith 's '' Modern Love '' and
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's '' The City of Dreadful Night , '' for the latter of which volumes we expressed our gratitude nearly two years ago .

		A person of scholarly and artistic tastes com - bined would find gratification in the volume , at once substantial and elegant , entitled '' Life in Ancient Egypt '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a translation , by
Helen Mary Tirard	PERSON	, of
Adolf Erman	PERSON	's '' ^ gypten . ''

		The need of a popular yet accurate and fairly comprehensive work on the manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians has long been felt by English readers ; and the present volume supplies it .


Herr Erman	PERSON	confines himself to the historical periods known as the Old , the Middle , and the New Empires , draw - ing freely upon Lepsius 's '' Denkmaler '' and `` The
London	LOCATION	Select Papyri '' for his text , and upon Wil - kinson 's '' Manners and Customs , '' the '' Denkmaler , '' and Perrot-Chipiez 's '' L'Histoire de L'Art , '' for his illustrations .

		Of the latter , there are four hundred cuts set in the text and eleven full-page plates ; and these , studied in connection with the animated and minutely-graphic narrative , serve to convey a good impression of the way the ancient Egyptian , of whatever degree or occupation , pursued his daily round .


Herr Erman	PERSON	informs his English readers that while certain alterations might be wrought into his work to bring it into nicer accord with the re - sults of later research , he feels that such changes would only affect details , and not the general scope of his book .

		Students of special topics of
Egypt	LOCATION	- ology will of course need to consult special text - books ; but for readers who desire to pursue the study as a branch of general culture ,
Herr Erman	PERSON	's work should prove all-sufficient .

		There is a good map , an abundance of notes and references , and an index ; and the volume altogether is an excellent piece of book-making .

		The scholarly work of the translator calls for special praise .

		Those who desire to gain a good general knowl - edge of astronomy without going too deeply into the science will find in Mr.
J. Ellard Gore	PERSON	's translation of
M. Camille Flammarion	PERSON	's '' Popular Astronomy '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- a work precisely suited to their needs .

		It is handsomely produced , and liberally , and with one or two exceptions satisfactorily , illustrated .

		M. Flammarion is the most popular scientific writer in
France	LOCATION	, and no fewer than a hundred thousand copies of the present work have been sold there .

		The book gained the Montyon prize of the French Acad - emy , and it has been selected by the
Minister of Education	ORGANIZATION	for use in the public libraries a good test of its suitability for popular reading .

		Mr.
Gore	PERSON	's translation is as idiomatic as it was possible to make it without sacrificing accuracy , and he has added notes as to recent researches and discoveries , which fairly bring the text up to date .

		Mr.
J. Hampden Porter	PERSON	's `` Wild Beasts '' -LRB- Scrib - ner -RRB- presents in separate chapters , with a photo - graphic plate in each , studies of the characters and habits of the elephant , lion , leopard , panther , jaguar , tiger , puma , wolf , and grizzly bear .

		Mr.
Porter	PERSON	is well up in the literature of his subject , and he has made a good and readable compilation of facts in natural history , hunting stories , illustrative anec - dotes , etc. .

		Hair , as
Thomas Howell	PERSON	observes , '' is but an excrementitious thing . ''

		It has been , nevertheless , a prime object of female solicitude from the re - motest ages ; and the late Mr.
Theodore Child	PERSON	, in his treatise on the coiffure , '' Wimples and Crisping Pins '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , places hair-dressing at the head of the decorative arts , '' inasmuch as its function is to adorn the most perfect of nature 's works , the head of woman . ''

		Mr.
Child	PERSON	disclaims in his pre - face any notion of competing with the technical 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 treatises of practical professors of this great art .

		He is simply the gentleman amateur who has made a study , from the outside , of its history and chef - d'ceuvres ; and he writes with the `` special object of calling attention to the wealth of example and suggestion contained in the paintings and sculptures of past ages , and of thus setting forth indirectly the principles and conditions upon which beautiful coiffure and ornament depend . ''

		With this view , he has studied -LRB- from the hair-dresser 's standpoint -RRB- the bas-reliefs , statues , and pictures of different times and countries ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, classic
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, mediaeval
Florence	LOCATION	and
Venice	LOCATION	, the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The text is liberally strewn with illustrations from these sources ; and these offer a rich variety of suggestions as to the arrangement of the hair and its ornamentation , which ladies of an adaptive turn might put to good account .

		`` A Hilltop Summer '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the collective title of a sheaf of clever newspaper sketches of village life , by
Alyn Yates Keith	PERSON	, re - printed from the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		Hill - top is a very out-of-the-way place indeed ; and the author seems to have been the first `` summer boarder '' to exploit its bucolic attractions , set the tongues of its gossips a-wagging , and startle its sleepy little postoffice out of the rural repose of a-letter-a-week into the metropolitan activity of a letter daily .

		The papers show a pleasant vein of humor , and a touch of literary quality that warrants their appearance between covers .

		The text is in - dented with a number of pretty vignettes .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's modest and tasteful volume of ''
Faber	PERSON	's Hymns '' contains about all this favorite religious poet 's noteworthy pieces .

		The hymns are established favorites of the whole
Chris	PERSON	- tian world without distinction of sect ; and the pres - ent collection is a representative one .

		There are fifty illustrations , of varying degrees of merit , by Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	, and a biographical sketch by Mr.
N. H. Dole	PERSON	.

		The cover of white and gold is especially attractive and delicate .

		Tennyson 's '' Becket '' is published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a rather showy duodecimo volume , with a cover of pale green cloth richly stamped with episcopal emblems .

		The text is clearly printed on rather thick glazed paper , and there are a number of clever drawings and decorations in wash , by Mr.
F. C. Gordon	PERSON	.

		The same publishers issue in four tiny volumes , boxed together ,
Paul Heyse	PERSON	's ever-popular ghost tales , '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	of the Unbelieving Thomas , '' '' Mid-Day Magic , '' `` The Fair
Abigail	PERSON	, '' and `` The Forest Laugh . ''

		The translator is
Frances A. Van Santford	PERSON	, and the illus - trator is
Alice C. Morse	PERSON	.

		The little set makes a tempting show and should not go begging .

		An attractive little book for young readers or old is `` The Fables of ^ Esop '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , selected , re-worded , and historically traced by
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, and illustrated by
Joseph Heighway	PERSON	.

		It is pretty difficult to say just what are and what are not the fables of ^
Esop	ORGANIZATION	almost all the fables that have ap - peared in the Western world having at one time or another found shelter under the shadow of that am - ple name .

		Indeed , the great fabulist himself is so spectral a personality that one might almost be for - given for holding , in respect to him , the shocking heresy of Mrs.
Betsy Prig	PERSON	.

		Among the apologues attributed to him , however , a certain number stand out as the most telling and familiar ; and these Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	has brought together in the present volume , re-wording them as compactly and pointedly as pos - sible , and tacking to the end of each its appropriate moral .

		A short history of the JEsopic fable is pre - fixed to the volume , and there are abundant notes .

		The volume is a pretty one outwardly , and Mr.
Heighway	PERSON	's drawings are strong , bold , and quaintly humorous .

		Scottish sympathies , American sympathies , and Scottish - American sympathies will equally find their poetical account in the pretty and freely illustrated volume of `` Wayside Poems '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by that pleasant versifier , Mr.
Wallace Bruce	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	is already known to readers on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	through his '' Old Homestead Poems , '' a work that will doubtless pave the way to popularity for its successor .

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's themes are mostly fa - miliar , his sentiment rings true , and his numbers are easy and fluent .

		Many of the pieces in the pres - ent collection were inspired by the incidents and as - sociations of the author 's consular life at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, others are born of home memories , and several are occasional poems , a style of composition at which Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	is unusually happy .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	add
Byron	PERSON	's Childe Harold '' to their pretty and convenient series of '' Handy Volume Classics . ''

		The little volume , with its daintily-tinted title-page and numerous photo - gravure views of scenes mentioned in the poem , makes a suitable yet very inexpensive gift-book .

		Messrs.
Fords , Howard & Hulbert	ORGANIZATION	re-issue , in a cloth cover and with an added feature in the shape of a photographic print of the
Sistine Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, their last year 's booklet entitled '' The
Sistine Madonna	PERSON	, a Christmas Meditation , '' by the Rev.
Amory H. Brad	PERSON	- ford .

		Dr.
Bradford	PERSON	treats his theme from the usual clerical standpoint , shedding about it a cloud of pious sentiment , and reading into
Raphael	PERSON	's canvas hidden meanings and symbolisms which that simple and sensuous painter who marks the dawn of simple and sensuous art would have been the last of his day to attempt .


Raphael	PERSON	, a true child of the Renascence , was no painter of theological riddles but one need not look for sober art criticism in a popular
Sunday	DATE	evening lecture , which Dr.
Bradford	PERSON	's work origin - ally was .

		The first shelf edition , we think , of
Eric Mackay	PERSON	's '' Love Letters of a Violinist '' is issued in attractive form by
Brentano 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	's illustrations are pretty , but show at times a lack of refinement which is a pity , as the book is a very comely one generally .

		388 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		u .

		A vigorous search among the girls ' books of this sea - son yields but little substantial reward .

		In place of subjects to nourish the growing mind , girls are given soporific doses of everyday romance , or mixtures of so - cial reforms and emotional sensations whose entire com - position is faulty .

		A few lessons in courtesy are doubt - less desirable ; but they might be interwoven with more heroic warp , and real vigor of treatment made the rule rather than the exception .

		A bevy of clever but conventional girls and their ex - periences at an exclusive boarding-school occupy Miss
Nora Perry	PERSON	in her first long story for girls , '' Hope Ben - ham '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Some good lessons in self - control , and in the art sufficiently rare among young girls of maintaining silence as to the faults of others , are pleasantly inculcated ; but the social ostracism of one high-spirited girl who was guilty of flirting , seems a somewhat severe climax for the book .

		Miss
Perry	PERSON	's girls are refined to the point of being over-nice , and they analyze themselves too closely .

		In '' Another Girl 's Experience '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , Mrs.
Leigh Webster	PERSON	tells the story of a minister 's fledgling , who , leaving the home-nest , ventures on a career as companion to a
New York	LOCATION	woman , wealthy but eccen - tric .

		The fledgling has her wings clipped all too soon ; and after various mortifying and even tragic experiences , she is only too glad to return -LRB- with thirty dollars in her pocket -RRB- to her home duties in the estate to which it pleased
Providence	LOCATION	to call her .

		The chief merit of '' Witch Winnie at Shinnecock '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , a sequel to '' Witch Winnie in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' is a cer - tain vigor of style .

		The love-story , with its unfortu - nate termination , is not sufficiently neutralized by the attempt to introduce an art-atmosphere ; and the fraud - ulent trick which constitutes the plot has not force enough to form the backbone of a story . ''

		Sirs , Only Seventeen '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the odd title chosen by
Miss Virginia Townsend	PERSON	for her book portraying the mutual love of a brother and sister .

		The climax is attained when the heroine -LRB- who , since her mis - understanding with her brother , has been threatened with brain fever -RRB- overhears his apologetic account of their difficulty , and straightway recovers .

		Possibly the title is apologetic ; for the heroine , with her `` graceful - molded '' features and '' beautiful-shaped '' head , seems rather morbid and high-strung .

		Her brother is more attractive , but only one or two minor characters are really natural .

		Miss
Beatrice Harraden	PERSON	has drawn upon personal ex - perience in '' Things will take a Turn '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , where the change in the fortunes of two little girls , widely separated by circumstances , yet brought close together by chance , forms the motive of a mildly at - tractive book .

		The reader will be apt to tire of the in - cessant praises of '' Childie '' which gre'et him on every page , and even the humor of the red-nosed bird-fancier will not altogether relieve him .

		The illustrations are by Mr.
J. H. Bacon	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Molesworth	PERSON	's praise for her heroine '' Olivia '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is not always justified by the conduct of the latter , who , though very conscientious , lacks charm .

		The love episode is more marked than is desirable , but the book has an ingenious plot and contains a stern moral on the evils of the practical joke .

		A pretty story of a little English girl , by the same author , shows how morbid a child may become through misunderstanding the motives of those about her . ''

		My New Home '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is for younger girls than `` Olivia . ''

		Young children will be interested in Miss
Eliza Orne White	PERSON	's `` When Molly was Six '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which comes in daintily-tinted covers from the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is illustrated by Miss
Katherine Pyle	PERSON	, and contains twelve realistic studies of red-letter days in a child 's life , one for each month .

		They teach no special lesson , but are written with skill and sympathy .

		The short stories which are compiled in '' Not Quite Eighteen '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Susan Coolidge	PERSON	, are wholesome and attractive , though the title is mislead - ing , as the children described are all of different ages and but sixteen stories are told .

		Four stories by
Miss Plympton	LOCATION	are collected in a pretty illustrated volume which takes its title from the first of them , `` Penelope Prig '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Though their construction is artificial , a note of real pathos is occasionally struck .

		Other books for girls are '' The Little Lady of the Horse '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Evelyn Raymond	PERSON	; `` Two Girls '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Amy Blanchard	PERSON	, illustrated by Miss
Ida Waugh	PERSON	; and `` Six Little Australians '' -LRB- Ward ,
Lock & Bowden	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Ethel S. Turner	PERSON	, who warns us from the first that Aus - tralian children are never good .

		This is reassuring . ''

		Toinette 's Philip '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is among the best of the books intended to please boys and girls alike .

		Mrs.
Jamison	PERSON	takes her reader at once into the picturesque '' old quarter '' of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, where he makes the acquaintance of a number of romantic figures .

		The boyish hero , ''
Philip	PERSON	, '' whose spice of roguishness gives him a more human interest than '' Little Lord
Fauntle	PERSON	- roy , '' divides the reader 's attention with a no less charm - ing heroine .

		At last everybody proves to be related to everybody else , their families having been divided by the complications of the Civil War .

		It is a very fasci - nating if somewhat improbable tale , and readers already familiar with it through the pages of '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' will doubtless welcome its publication as gladly as those to whom it is new .

		The book is prettily illustrated .

		Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Burnett	PERSON	's graceful style makes everything from her pen agreeable reading , but the col - lection in '' Piccino and Other Child Stories '' -LRB- Scribuer -RRB- is not so well adapted for young readers as some of her former writings have been . ''

		Two Days in the Life of Piccino '' is a fresh and amusing sketch of a cherub-faced Italian boy ; but `` The Captain 's Youngest '' contains a picture of domestic misery which no child should be able to understand , and its termination is entirely too tragic .

		Though '' How Fauntleroy Occurred '' smacks strongly of maternal pride , it is written in a playful vein , and contains Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's consoling assurance that the original of the famous '' Little Lord '' -LRB- now six - teen years of age -RRB- no longer wears black velvet doublets and broad collars of lace .

		Mr.
Birch	PERSON	's illustrations have their usual charm .

		The quaint humor with which Miss
Jeanne Schultz	PERSON	tells the story of '' Madeleine 's Rescue '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- marks it with an originality that is wanting in the theme itself the healing of an old feud through the efforts of children .

		The author is thoroughly in sympathy with childhood , and at the same time takes older readers into her confidence .

		The marriage with which the book closes seems a natural sequel to the good comradeship which has gone before ; and these French children , Mad - eleine and her four loyal boy friends , are sure to appeal
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 to American readers , who might profit by the lesson in chivalry which their conduct teaches .

		Mrs.
Mary P. Wells Smith	PERSON	follows the pastimes of '' Professor Strong 's '' children in '' Jolly Good Times To-day '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , which is intended to illustrate the difference in the atmosphere surrounding children of the present time from that at '' Hackmatack '' or else - where fifty years ago .

		There are practically no restric - tions placed upon these lively boys and girls , who , when the size of their bonfire becomes alarming , are approached with deference by Mrs. Strong , with the request that they will put it out as a personal favor to her .

		They are certainly jolly children , and the account of their act - ive gayety proves pleasant reading .

		A conscientious historical study is introduced in the romance of ''
Kensington Palace	ORGANIZATION	in the Days of Queen Mary '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , whose author , Mrs.
Marshall	PERSON	, feels that this Queen 's character has been frequently misun - derstood .

		She is certainly attractive in this book , as is the heroine , a young country girl of good birth , who becomes lady-in-waiting to her majesty .

		The love story is simple and sweet , though another episode , in which the heroine is subjected to indignity , is in questionable taste for young readers .

		The story has a decided charm , and a sketch of the child-life of the
Duke of Gloucester	ORGANIZATION	gives it additional interest .

		Somewhat sketchy in character , though not devoid of interest , are the '' Stories from English History , from
Julius Caesar	PERSON	to the Black Prince '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the Rev.
A. J. Church	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	.

		The story of the
Roman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	is told in the form of a dialogue , the later period being described in a series of sketches .

		The whole book is relieved from a suspicion of dryness by the numerous illustrations from old casts and engravings .

		Very artistic in binding and illustration is the volume of `` More Celtic Fairy Tales '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, who in his two volumes of English fairy stories has practically exhausted that field .

		This is not the case in the last two volumes of the series , in which he says , '' I have done little more than spy the land and bring back some specimen bunches from the Celtic vine . ''

		These are certainly fragrant of the region whence they sprung , gay , rollicking , dramatic , and not without a touch of melancholy in one of the three sorrowful tales of
Erin	PERSON	.

		It is with surprise that one finds in '' The Russet Dog '' a resemblance to one of Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's Indian folk-stories that of the bear and the coyote .

		There is also a story bearing traces of Japanese origin , though Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	hints that the case may be reversed .

		Mr.
Batten	PERSON	's illustrations are worthy of their interest - ing subjects , and students will find the notes very com - plete .

		Two beautiful little gift-books bound in pale olive and gold cloth , are of the ''
Banbury	LOCATION	Cross Series '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , prepared for children by
Miss Grace Rhys	ORGANIZATION	, and suitably illustrated by
R. Anning Bell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each volume has a brief preface giving a history of the two good old tales forever new which it contains , wherein '' Well - ington and his Cat '' and '' The Sleeping Beauty , '' '' Jack the Giant Killer '' and '' Beauty and the Beast '' are in - vested with a new charm .

		The educative value of the excellent illustrations and workmanship of these vol - umes can not be too highly commended .

		The realm of the fantastic is invaded by Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	, whose '' Little Mr.
Thimblefinger	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- introduces his young friends to the mys - teries '' under the water in the
spring	DATE	at precisely nine minutes and nine seconds after twelve o'clock . ''

		Our old acquaintance , Mr.
Rabbit	PERSON	is found chatting socia - bly with Mrs. Meadows ; and their reminiscences of Mr.
Bear	PERSON	, Mr.
Wolf	PERSON	, and Mr.
Billygoat	PERSON	, of the Pumpkin-Eater and the Talking-Saddle , form the substance of the book .

		The folk-lore of '' Uncle Remus '' does not provide the material for these stories , some being purely inventions , and others owing their origin to
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's full-page illustrations contribute greatly to the success of the volume .

		Mr.
George Manville Fenn	PERSON	, author of '' First in the Field '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , does not tell us whether or not he has founded his story on experience in the Polar Seas .

		It has , however , a true ring , and the mystic charm of most stories of Polar exploration , of which it is among the best .

		There are the usual experiences with terrible gales , ice-floes , and that dreadful depression of spirits which becomes almost a disease , though the book as a whole is not sad .

		The illustrations are numerous .

		The painstaking quality of Colonel
Knox	PERSON	's writings for boys in itself assures the authenticity of his new war story , `` The Lost Army '' -LRB-
Merriam	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Its subject is a portion of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the West in the Civil War , which at a critical period excited grave fears at headquarters because communications from it were so infrequent .

		But an army which engaged in the battle of
Pea Ridge	LOCATION	could not be lost to history , as events showed ; and the adventures of the two boys from
Iowa	LOCATION	who accompanied it prove entertaining reading .

		Two books by Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	are of very unequal merit , '' Chris the Model Maker '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- being by far the most attractive .

		It is a touching story of the life of a cripple in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The book has considerable local color , a quality which is decid - edly lacking in `` The Captain 's Boat '' -LRB-
Merriam	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Though possessed of a denouement and several hair - breadth escapes , the story is incoherent and not gen - uinely interesting .

		An unusual amount of all-around information is stored in a book of travel by Mr.
Eugene Murray-Aaron	PERSON	. ''

		The Butterfly Hunters in the Caribbees '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is written with an enthusiastic love of nature as a field for scien - tific study , and is entirely drawn from an exploring nat - uralist 's personal experience .

		Two bright boys are con - ducted by an experienced scholar through
Jamaica	LOCATION	and
Haiti	LOCATION	-LRB- which the author says should be pronounced Haw-ee-tee * -RRB- , in search of rare butterflies though inci - dentally they encounter some larger game , like the wild boar .

		A careful account of the tropical fruits , com - merce , and customs of the region contribute greatly to the interest of the book , and its readers will doubtless be glad of the hint , at its close , that a similar journey to
Spain	LOCATION	will be undertaken .

		The illustrations are at - tractive .

		Another book of out-door sport and scientific study , the `` Boys ' Own Guide to Fishing '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has illustrations conspicuous for usefulness rather than beauty .

		The diagrams , with the text , furnish ample directions for the making of good fishing-tackle at home , which the author , Mr.
John Harrington Keene	PERSON	, regards as very attractive work for young anglers .

		Fly-fishing for trout , and the winter breeding of fish , are carefully treated ; while directions for the proper cleansing and cooking of fish render the book useful for campers , as well as to many others .

		Very little boys and girls will enjoy with equal relish the text and pictures in Mrs.
Dodge	PERSON	's collection of rhymes and jingles , '' When Life is Young '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Some of them have already appeared in `` St. 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Nicholas	PERSON	, '' but they hear repetition , as they are full of humor and sweetness , and are now collected in a dainty and serviceable form .

		The well-worn subject of the settling of old feuds through the loving simplicity of a child is freshly treated by Miss
Julia Magruder	PERSON	in '' The Child Amy '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Amy seems to be a very human little girl , not without a temper , and possessed of a decided genius for loving .

		The pleasing illustrations are by
Miss Helen Maitland Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Adelaide F. Samuels	ORGANIZATION	publishes a nonsense-book for children , called '' Father Gander 's Melodies '' -LRB- Rob - erts -RRB- ; but it is hardly a fit companion for our time - honored '' Mother Goose '' neither illustrations nor rhymes being very successful .

		A few charming little poems are included in the forty - two '' Love Songs of Childhood '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Mr.
Eugene Field	PERSON	.

		Some are in the dialect which he has made familiar , and a few are humorous , as '' The De - lectable Ballad of the Waller Lot '' ; but in most cases the humor is that of middle-aged retrospect rather than of childhood .

		`` Kissing Time , '' with its reiteration of a familiar childish joke , is full of a child 's pure joy in living ; but one finds it difficult to sympathize with '' The oogling and the googling Of my little Googly-Goo . ''

		Four books published in
London	LOCATION	by the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge and in
New York	LOCATION	by Messrs.
Young	PERSON	, vary widely in merit , though none of them can be numbered among the best of children 's books .

		An exciting story of the recovery of a buried treasure is told with considerable vigor in the '' Cruise of the Esmeralda , '' by Mr.
Harry Collingwood	PERSON	. ''

		Mid - shipman Archie , '' by Miss
Annette Lyster	PERSON	, relates in wholesome fashion the story of an Irish family of good birth .

		The author of '' The Dean 's Little Daughter '' tells of a drunkard 's reform in ''
Jenny Dear	PERSON	, '' and Mrs.
Isla Ditwell	PERSON	contributes '' Farmer Golds worthy 's Will . ''

		A good edition of ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' published for the '' Children 's Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains a num - ber of quaint illustrations by Mr.
George Cruikshank	PERSON	.

		The frontispiece is particularly interesting by reason of its old-fashioned quality ; and the text has been mod - ernized and adapted for children in a commendable man - ner .

		The binding , in blue and white , is rather dainty for hard service .

		A new edition of Miss
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	's ''
Tim	PERSON	- othy 's Quest '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is likely to meet with the success which attended the first appearance of that pop - ular book .

		The same firm issues a captivating new edi - tion of the inimitable '' Story of a Bad Boy , '' in which Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's humor proves itself delightfully fresh in spite of many readings .

		The season brings the usual substantial array of bound volumes of standard serials . ''

		St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is filled with the good things of the past year , plenty of solid food for children , garnished with '' sugar and spice and everything nice . ''

		The names of many of the writers for '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' also appear in '' Har - per 's
Young People	ORGANIZATION	, '' which will possibly be more inter - esting to older children .

		The past success of '' Chatter - box '' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- doubtless ensures that of this year 's volume , containing articles about birds and fishes , sketches of foreign children , and also short stories of famous men .

		A series of papers on British field-sports is of interest , but it is be regretted that the illustrations are so inferior .

		NEW YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
December 12 , 1894	DATE	.

		Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's pleasant remarks concerning the work - ings of the Copyright Act , quoted in the last number of THE DIAL , do not represent the situation as closely as they might have done six months ago .

		At that time many were under the impression that the result of the Act of
1891	DATE	had been directly beneficial to American authors by removing from the market the cheap reprints of current English books with which it was then flooded .

		It was supposed that American books would then com - pete on even terms with those of foreigners .

		But Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	cables to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' that , '' as this month 's '
Bookman	PERSON	' says , it seems as if English fiction were almost entirely supplanting the American .

		This remark is echoed by other papers , which dwell pleasantly on the anomalous fact that although the copy - right agreement was expected , by making foreign books dearer , to help the American novelists , its actual result has been to give the British novelists a vastly bigger vogue in
America	LOCATION	than they had in the former piratical days . ''

		Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	also declares , in a recent interview , that there is much competition among American pub - lishers for British authors , and expresses his wonder thereat .

		When the Copyright bill was passed , however , nearly four years ago , a number of those active in put - ting it through understood thoroughly that the chief benefit would accrue to the British author .

		At the din - ner given in honor of the passage of the bill , one of the speakers said : '' The road to publication for an American work has been easy almost too easy for some trashy American works since the manufacture of unauthorized reprints became unprofit - able .

		So far as respects the Author 's
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, its efforts have been , to use a hackneyed word , altruistic , except for the satisfaction derived from a sense of honor , dignity , right .

		For what have we dared to do ?

		We have doubled at a stroke the list of our competitive writers .

		All British authors are now American authors .

		All will now compete on nearly equal terms in the market of this ' Greater
Britain	LOCATION	' of what must be the greatest bookmart of the world . ''

		So Mr.
Besant	PERSON	and some others will have to revise their impressions of the workings of the Copyright Act .

		Some weeks ago I promised to consider a few of the reasons for the overshadowing of our home novelists by the rising school of British romancers .

		The reasons for the overshadowing have meanwhile been so fully ex - ploited iu various directions that there is now no need of an additional word on the subject .

		It was
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, by the way , who first commented on the success of these writers as a group .

		It should be remembered that the framers of the Copyright bill , while anticipating the temporary disadvantages to American authors which have arisen , looked for permanent benefits to all con - cerned in the future .

		I trust they will not be disap - pointed .

		At present the outlook for American books in the British market does not seem particularly encour - aging .

		With the exceptions of Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's and Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	's books , full lists of which are occasionally to be found , the '' Athenaeum '' advertising pages rarely contain the titles of more than a dozen American books , while a search of the review columns iu the issue for
November 24	DATE	failed to disclose a notice of even one American book .

		A delightfully reminiscent article by Mr.
A. V. S. Anthony	PERSON	, the veteran engraver and art-editor , on '' The Making of Illustrated Books , '' appears in this week 's
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 '' Independent . ''

		It recounts some of his successful ex - periments in illustrating the books of
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Long	LOCATION	- fellow at a time when the art of illustration had not reached its present perfection .

		The few anecdotes given will suggest to many of Mr.
Anthony	PERSON	's friends that a volume of reminiscences from his pen would be a gen - uine addition to the literary and artistic history of the time .

		The Order of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	, a juvenile society formed by readers of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Young People , '' is hold - ing a very successful fair in behalf of one of its char - ities here .

		There will be an authors ' reception at which a number of writers for both young and old people have promised to be present and meet their young friends .

		Mr.
William Hamilton Hayne	PERSON	, the Southern poet , is paying his annual visit to the city , and Mr.
George W. Sheldon	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	, is here for a few days .

		Provence and the
Riviera	LOCATION	are the attractions which have induced Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	and Mrs.
Anna Bow	PERSON	- man
Dodd	PERSON	to spend the winter in
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Alex	PERSON	- ander Black 's '' picture play , '' ''
Miss Jerry	PERSON	, '' is meet - ing with gratifying success wherever presented .

		This form of entertainment is the particular invention of Mr.
Black	PERSON	, who is literary editor of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	'' Times , '' and an expert in photographic matters .

		While he reads the story , dissolving views of the characters and scenes are thrown upon a screen , changes being made twice or thrice a minute as the story progresses .

		A most absurd notice of the illustrated edition of Dr.
Hohnes	PERSON	's '' The Last Leaf , '' which recently appeared in the
London	LOCATION	''
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' has caused much amuse - ment here .

		The writer says among other things that `` the poem is supposed -LSB- in
America	LOCATION	-RSB- to be a classic ; it is supposed to be unique in kind and excellence ; sup - positions which lead one to inquire whether Americans have ever heard of
Austin Dobson	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	un - doubtedly will enjoy this , inasmuch as he dedicated the first American edition of his poems to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, and may fairly be said to look on the latter as one of his masters .

		Why not ask whether Americans have ever heard of Mr.
Frederick Locker-Lampson	PERSON	, whose best - known poem is almost a parody of '' The Last Leaf '' ?

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	will publish in
March	DATE	a new novel by Mr.
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	.

		The fourth volume of Professor
McMaster	PERSON	's '' History of the People of the United States '' will be ready for publication at an early date .

		We regret to learn that '' The Southern Magazine , '' of
Louisville	LOCATION	,
Ky.	LOCATION	, has suspended publication .

		The mag - azine was a credit to the South , and deserved a better fate .

		With reference to the contemplated Life and Letters of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, his son and executor requests that any persons having letters of the poet will send them to his publishers ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		These letters will be carefully returned to their owners after copies have been made of such as are found to be available for publication .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are to publish a series of '' European Statesmen , '' similar to the '' Twelve English Statesmen '' series .

		The editing is in the hands of Pro- fessor J. B. Bury . ''

		Charles the Great '' ; by Mr.
Thomas Hodgkin	PERSON	; `` William the Silent , '' by Mr.
Frederic Har	PERSON	- rison ; '' Richelieu , '' by Professor R. Lodge ; and '' Maria Theresa , '' by Dr.
J. Frauck Bright	PERSON	, are among the vol - umes promised .

		Apropos of our recent communications and comments on the
San Francisco Vigilance Committee	ORGANIZATION	, attention may be called to a series of articles on the subject in the '' Overland Monthly '' for
October , November	DATE	, and
December	DATE	, of the current year .

		The writer of the arti - cles , Mr.
Almarin B. Paul	PERSON	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, was a mem - ber of the famous
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and his account has value as coming from an eye-witness of and a participant in the strange scenes and events described .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons make the following an - nouncements of their forthcoming publications : `` The Women of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, `` by Dr.
Lewis Lewes	PERSON	; '' Three Men of Letters '' -LRB-
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Dwight	PERSON	,
Barlow	PERSON	-RRB- , by Pro- fessor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	; '' Personal Recollections of War Times , '' by Mr.
Albert Gallatin Riddle	PERSON	; `` King
Arthur	PERSON	, '' a comparative study of the Arthurian epic , by the Rev.
S. H. Gurteen	PERSON	; and In the Heart of the Bit - ter-Root Mountains , '' an account of the
Carlin	PERSON	hunting party of
1893	DATE	.

		A project was formed some time ago at
Aquila	ORGANIZATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	to erect in that town a monument to the Roman historian Sallust , whose birthplace ,
Amiternum	LOCATION	, was near by .

		President
Gilman	PERSON	of
Johns Hopkins Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity and Professor
Tarbell	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, having been requested to secure subscriptions for this object in the
United States	LOCATION	, have received and sent to the
Aquila Committee	ORGANIZATION
seventy dollars	MONEY	, contributed in equal sums by the following universities :
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Princeton	LOCATION	,
Yale	LOCATION	.

		Subscriptions have been made in various parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, and the fund must now amount to nearly or quite thirteen hundred francs .

		M.
Ernest Lavisse	PERSON	has succeeded the late James Dar - mesteter in the editorship of '' La Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' and a happier substitute could hardly have been found .

		The note on Darmesteter supplied to the '' Revue '' of Nov - ember 15 by his colleague ,
M. Louis Ganderax	PERSON	, is fol - lowed up , in the issue of
December 1	DATE	, by an appreciative study of the deceased scholar from the pen of M. Gas - ton
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The cultured circles of
San Francisco	LOCATION	have been con - siderably stirred by an address lately delivered in that city by Prof.
M. B. Anderson	PERSON	of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, in which , while saying some very pleasant things of the city , he ventured upon a few criticisms that proved de - cidedly unpalatable , and for which he has been duly '' roasted '' by the local press .

		That spirited and strong - headed journal , '' The
Argonaut	ORGANIZATION	, '' thinks a part of the city 's vulgarity , of which Professor
Anderson	PERSON	complains , is due to the occasional visits of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	students , who are turbulent and unruly , especially just after winning football games .

		But , with the fullest allowance for the exuberance of even a victorious foot - ball team , this does not seem a complete answer to Pro- fessor
Anderson	PERSON	's strictures .

		By a curious coincidence , in the same issuse of '' The Argonaut '' a contributor is permitted to call attention to the fact that '' in no other city in this country are the disgusting sights thrust be - fore one 's eyes that in
San Francisco	LOCATION	can be seen , if one glances to the left or right , in passing along respect - able thoroughfares in the very heart of the city . ''

		But the
San Franciscans	LOCATION	may rest in peace .

		No one sus - 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, pects them of possessing a monopoly of the vulgarity of American cities , and the criticism which they find so hard to bear could be made , and has been made , upon most large places .

		Even
Chicago	LOCATION	has had its expe - rience of similar chastenings from friendly critics , and has lived to look back with a smile at its own hyper - sensitiveness .

		It is probable that both
San Francisco	LOCATION	and Professor
Anderson	PERSON	will survive the recent episode .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Memorial Ode on the Death of Leconte de
Lisle	LOCATION	, '' which appears in '' The
Saturday	DATE	Re - view , '' is such a noble commemorative tribute as its au - thor alone of living men could have written .

		It is a lyrical structure in three sections , of which we quote the first entire , and add the closing strain of the last . ''

		Beside the lordliest grave in all the world A singer crowned with golden years and fame Spake words more sweet than wreaths of incense curled That bade an elder yet and mightier name Hail , for whose love the wings of time were furled And death that heard it died of deadlier shame . ''

		Our father and lord of all the sons of song , Hugo , supreme on earth , had risen above
Earth	LOCATION	, as the sun soars noonward : grief and wrong Had yielded up their part in him to love : And one man 's word came forth upon the throng Brief as the brooding music of the dove . ''

		And he now too , the praiser as the praised , Being silent , speaks forever .

		He whose word Reverberate made the gloom whereon he gazed Radiant with sound whose song in his we heard Stands far from us as they whose souls he raised Again , and darkness carolled like a bird .

		`` Now the lyre whose lord 's wise mastery gave its notes re - verberate skill Whence to give again the grace of golden gifts of hands long dead , Now the deep clear soul that all the lore of time could scarce fulfil , Now the sovereign voice that spake it , now the radiant eye that read , Seem to sleep as sleeps the indomitable imperishable will Here , that haply lives and sleeps not , though its word on earth be said .
