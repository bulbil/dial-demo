		OVER THE TOP By
ARTHUR GUY EMPEY	PERSON	An American Soldier who went
The New York Tribune	ORGANIZATION	says : `` For the very spirit of the strife , and all the unspeakable and unimaginable lp : ana fear , horror and exaltation , of the struggle for life and death , no book that has writ - ten in this war , if indeed in any war , surpasses this simple and unpretentious * an American soldier boy who himself went `` over the top '' and `` gave them hell . ''

		He has an irrepressible sense of humor , and humor there is in even some of n - mest scenes of war ; and he has a sense of pathos and of tragedy as well .

		`` Torrii ic - tionary of the Trenches '' which concludes the volume , is an anthology of mingled and wisdom .

		Perhaps , after all , we should not call this a book about the war : It is a hot , throbbing , vital section of the war itself .

		Erapey was wounded seven times lived for a year and a half with mud , rats and shells went `` over the top '' in bayon - et-charges through gas a t - tacks was en - tangled in barbed wire , with machine guns working a few yards away and lay for 36 hours , wounded and unconscious , in `` No Man 's Land .

		The War and
the Labor Programme Between March	ORGANIZATION	,
1913	DATE	and
June , 1916	DATE	two hundred and ninety-six industrial dis - putes are recorded as having taken place .

		Between
June 30 , 1916	DATE	and
May 30 , 1917	DATE	, in the course of eleven months cur - rent , there have been two hundred and forty-four such disputes .

		To dispose of them , the
Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	had here - tofore employed a body of conciliators , twenty-one in number .

		Of these , seven - teen have recently been dismissed , because the
Congressional Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Appro - priations , of which
Fitzgerald of Tam	ORGANIZATION	- many is chairman , refused to report any appropriation for the service of media - tion and conciliation in labor disputes for the coming fiscal year , beyond the sum necessary to maintain the skeleton of an organization .

		Meanwhile federal soldiers were used in
Newark	LOCATION	against pickets of a branch of
the International Molders Union	ORGANIZATION	there on strike , and were called off through the intervention of a civilian ad - visor to the Secretary of War .

		These data are significant .

		Take them together with the astounding assault on the social and labor legislation of the state of
New York	LOCATION	, with the remarkable declaration of surrender of the indispen - sable right of labor to strike attributed to Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	, and they have an implica - tion , patriotic or noble or self-sacrificing as their original intention may have been , sinister in the extreme for their ultimate result .

		We are in a war , we have been told again and again , which is to `` make the world safe for democracy . ''

		In numbers and in technique it is an unprecedented war ; and in the fact , so often repeated and underscored , that it is a war to be won on the fields and in the factories at home far more than in the trenches abroad , it is a unique war .

		This means that upon the workingman falls the re - sponsibility of losing or winning this war for our country .

		Consequently the atti - tude of the government and of employers toward labor and its needs and desires be - comes of even greater moment than the government 's attitude toward the constitu - tional rights of freedom of speech and conscience and person .

		Now , that governmental interference in labor disputes should be necessary may be natural , but it is not desirable and it is not inevitable , and where enlightenment and intelligence exist among employers , it does not occur , because the situations that require it do not arise .

		However one may think of the class-war , labor and capi - tal have certain common interests which in the long run are more fundamental than their antagonisms .

		Modernism in industry has meant the relatively rapid realization of this community by some en - trepeneurs and the relatively slow realiza - tion of it by the forces of labor .

		The common interest is the end for which an industry exists the production of a work of a certain type and character .

		Every - thing else in the organization of a produc - tive agency is secondary to that ; mere means .

		The administrative , the financial , the distributive and other concerns of an industrial organization are means , and means only .

		Effectively to employ this means , however , requires human personal - ity .

		And the human units of an industrial organization can be human only in so far as they find in their work opportunity for the free play of their spontaneous ener - gies , their initiative , their creative imagi - nation , their intelligence only in so far , in a word , as their work is itself not to be regarded as a means , but as an end , not labor but art .

		If the laboring classes have been slow in realizing the community of themselves with the employing classes , it is because the latter have dealt with them in impersonal , non-human terms , have treated them as means , as `` hands , '' as `` operatives '' instead of human beings .

		Denied acknowledgment of the partner - THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	ship which exists in fact between all the human units engaged in an industry , the la - borer has accepted perforce the status im - posed upon him the status of earner , as against that of craftsman and creator , and has taken his work as the necessary evil involved in earning a living , a thing quite apart from the making of a life .

		He has accepted the uncertainties of the future the dangers of unemployment , of ill-health , of penniless old-age and death , and has followed blindly the uncontrolled operation of what the economic pundits miscall `` the law of supply and demand . ''

		His attitude toward the employing classes has sprung inevitably out of his accept - ance of this unnecessary situation as neces - sary .

		Similarly , the tool-possessing em - ployers , dealing with labor as a commod - ity to be bought and sold in open mar - ket , became and largely remain , inimical to labor-force and hence to themselves .

		Only in recent years have they discovered that the acknowledgment of the de facto part - nership with labor , the spread and intensi - fication of the consciousness of it , the recognition and encouragement of the hu - manity of the laborer , the provision of op - portunity for the exercise of his creative energies , the establishment for him of a proprietary interest in the works and the abolition of his fundamental uncertainties concerning the future , not only avert dis - putes , but improve the output , increase profits and turn a slave-gang into a team .

		As the experience of the
Ford	ORGANIZATION	and other industrial companies shows , the saving in money and quality of work that comes from the elimination , by this means , of the mobility and restlessness of labor is enough to pay the added costs over and over again .

		In a word , to make the partner - ship of labor with capital conscious and conspicuous in the organization of indus - try is not to venture on untried ground ; it is to make general a form of organiza - tion which in numerous observable in - stances has shown itself to be not merely common decency but good business and genuine democracy .

		They have demon - strated the actual harmonization of democ - racy with efficiency which the conditions of warfare have made so central a prob - lem among nations with free institutions .

		It is the duty of an intelligent patriotism to extend this condition to all fields of in - dustrial endeavor where disputes are likely to arise .

		It is the duty or labor .

		It is the duty of capital .

		It is the duty of the government , which represents the common interests of both and has become the ar - biter of their differences .

		Capital , so far as it has spoken , has , however , shown it - self blind and greedy ; labor , so far as it has spoken , has shown itself flabby and sentimental , and the government as un - intelligent as usual .

		Responsibility falls therefore upon the more far-sighted lead - ers in the labor organizations , upon the wise entrepreneurs who have already achieved something in industry in the di - rection of efficient democracy , and upon intelligent public opinion , whose hands more than any other , can mold the world into the form `` safe for democracy . ''

		The foundation upon which rests `` de - mocracy efficient '' is a proposition which President
Wilson	PERSON	has recently given wider publicity than it has had in a thousand years .

		It is the proposition that labor is not a commodity .

		Labor is not a thing that can be detached from a man and sent out into the market to be bought and sold like coal or iron or flour or books or guns .

		Men sell themselves in selling their labor .

		And it is hence that the rights of labor can never be separated from the rights of man , while the rights of property not only can , but must .

		The right to strike , it follows clearly , is not a right involving property ; it is a right involving person .

		So is the principle of unionism , which alone can make the right to strike opera - tive .

		It is the use of both these rights by labor which has won the grudging recog - nition of the humanity of labor-force , and a surrender or mitigation of them is sui - cide .

		The proposition that labor is not a commodity implies that there is an irre - ducible minimum below which wages may not under any circumstances go , a minimum not determined by `` the law of supply and demand , '' but by the effective needs of a human being for health , spon - taneous action , and assurance concerning the future .

		In war time , particularly .

		when the will and the power of the hu -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL man organism is at a maximum tension , the minimum necessary to repair waste , to store up the required physiological surplus , to keep up the condition of health and vi - tality of interest is indispensable in all forms of employment .

		This minimum should be set by the standard of living ex - isting in a given society and by such modifi - cations as a scientific consideration of the physiological and psychological conditions of good health and efficacious working would make .

		No production of any sort can begin to be anything but murder , slow or rapid , which involves the employment of labor below such a necessary minimum .

		The minimum wage of labor , in a word , should be a standard item among the fixed charges for the upkeep and repair of the industrial plant .

		The fixed charges of the non-human part of the plant are on the whole irreducible , and the care and up - keep of the human part under anything like human conditions should be even more irreducible .

		.

		In fact the minimum wage should not be regarded as a ' wage at all .

		It relates to that part of a workman 's life that is subhuman , its animal foundation , not the creative impulses which are the nobler part of him .

		Wages proper should begin to be counted at the point where these im - pulses come into action and should be based upon his personal excellence and initiative .

		That is , the most significant form in which they could come is that of a share in the profits proportionate to the workman 's distinction as a workman .

		All net profit over four per cent should be divided in proper ratio between employers and employees .

		The form that such divi - sion might take is various enough .

		Some of it had best take , if experience is any guide , the form of safeguarding the future against disease , old age , and death .

		In this form , as an insurance , it abolishes , on the whole , the problems of changing employees for the entrepreneur and unem - ployment for the laborer .

		The partner - ship of the two becomes explicit , and ex - plicit partnership requires frankness and trust .

		Labor must know the status and problems of the concern of which it is a part , and must have a voice , if only an advisory one , in the conduct of its affairs .

		It should , that is , be represented on the directorate , and should be informed and consulted with regarding fundamental changes in the concern 's affairs .

		The more permanently to establish the human unity of the industry , moreover , the workers within it should have the opportunity , if not the obligation , of progressively acquir - ing shares of its stock .

		They become thus in the completest sense owners as well as workers ; their interest and the interest of the whole enterprise become explicitly , as they had been potentially , identical , and even the most routine and terrible of the mechanical and reflex repetitions of a process in which so much of our industrial endeavor consists , are thrown into an or - ganic whole , fitted into a proper perspec - tive , which eliminates the spiritual isolation of the workman from his tasks , thus conserving his humanity and increas - ing his efficiency .

		The industry becomes in this way progressively cooperative .

		It acquires esprit de corps , is at once dem - ocratic and efficient .

		A perspective based upon practical par - ticipation in the ownership and operation of a works tends , however , itself to be - come mechanized and habitual .

		The sense of unity and esprit de corps it creates tends to get deadened over a long stretch of time .

		To maintain it requires , on the part of workman as well as of adminis - trator , an intelligent understanding of the problems and processes of the industry and its general bearing on the life of the nation .

		Such an understanding can be created only through education , and for this reason an indispensable adjunct to a democratically coordinated industry is a system of education which shall be com - pulsory for all people in the shops under twenty-five years of age , and optional for those over twenty-five .

		The curriculum would vary to some extent with the in - dustry , but on the whole , it would be standard .

		An important part of it would naturally take the form of numerous in - formal conferences between the various grades of craftsmen in the industry , on their own work and the relation of dif - ferent departments to one another .

		It would be easy , but undesirable , to elabor - ate details of a satisfactory educational 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	system .

		For present purposes it is enough to indicate that such a system is indispen - sable , if merely from the fact that men more and more are concerned with the handling of complicated machinery that must be understood if it is to be kept right .

		In sum , here is , in principle at least , a fundamental way , a tested and practical way to make the nation safe for democ - racy .

		We do not need to surrender the spirit of free institutions to win this war : we do not need to Prussiani/e our coun - try in order to defeat Prussianism .

		We need only substitute vision for greed and intelligence for habit-custom .

		We need only take example from what has already been accomplished in this country and take courage to extend it .

		But shall we ?

		It is for labor to de - mand and for capital to offer .

		The alter - native is the disastrous experience of Eng - land .

		Thoreau and `` The Wild '' What differentiates
Thoreau	PERSON	from
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean writers on nature is , primarily , his intense Puritanism ; what differentiates him from other American writers Bry - ant ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and the rest , most of whom share his Puritanism is , pri - marily , his ardent yearning for wildness .

		`` There is in my nature , methinks , a singular yearning toward all wildness , '' he wrote in his first book .

		Later he prepared a lecture on `` Walking , or the Wild , '' and indeed in all of his characteristic work we find what might be termed his doctrine of the Wild .

		`` At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things , '' he writes , `` we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable , that land and sea be infinitely wild . ''

		Close about us lies the friendly world of nature , but whenever we make our way into it , suddenly it grows strange and wild , the explored becomes unexplorable , and we are aware of contact with a life `` pastur - ing freely where we never wander . ''

		That is the Wild .

		If we were only alive enough , we should be able to enter upon that larger , freer existence which the Wild leads : `` The most alive is the wildest . ''

		The Wild , then , is living Nature , the inscrutable personality that animates the flux , resembling in some respects the elan vital of our day , yet really very different because static .

		Not a systematic specula - tive thinker , Thoreau seems to have had a somewhat odd notion that the physical world is inhabited by a personality with -LRB- perhaps -RRB- a spiritual universe of its own , while we , inhabiting the same physical world , have -LRB- perhaps -RRB- a different -LRB- and higher -RRB- spiritual universe .

		Sometimes he would breathe the humane air of his proper spiritual order ; sometimes , more rarely , the wilder air of the spiritual or - der of nature .

		When the latter impulse dominated him , it seemed to him that at - tainment meant no less than some kind of actual union , or transfusion , with nature .

		He would `` eat the brown earth . ''

		On another day he records a curiously gross - spiritual emotion ; he `` worships , '' he says , the brownish light in the sod on certain wet days in
March	DATE	, feels as if he `` could eat the very crust of the earth ; I never felt so terrene , never sympathized so with the surface of the earth . ''

		Later in the same month he could `` stroke and kiss the very sward , it is so fair . ''

		Again , he tells a correspondent that he grows `` savager and savager every day , as if fed on raw meat . ''

		That raw meat had its powerful charms is indicated by the passage in `` Walden '' in which he tells how , one even - ing as he was returning to the hut , chanc - ing to see a woodchuck steal across his path in the gathering darkness , he `` felt a strange thrill of savage delight , and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw . ''

		On one or two occasions while he lived at the pond , he goes on to confess , he found himself wandering through the woods `` like a half-starved hound , with a strange abandonment , seeking some kind of venison which I might devour , and no morsel could have been too savage for me . ''

		The whole chapter , indeed -LRB- `` Higher Laws '' -RRB- , is a study of the dual
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL life he was impelled to lead , one rank and savage , the other spiritual , or to use his own terms , one wild , the other human .

		Thoreau 's lust -LRB- hardly too strong a word -RRB- for rainstorms and swamps is one of the most conspicuous instances of his yearning for wildness .

		He would like to sit in a distant cave throughout `` a three - weeks ' storm , cold and wet , '' to give a tone to his system .

		Better still a swamp ; to have your house abut on a forbidding swamp is to dwell next to
Elysium	ORGANIZATION	.

		Al - though for some reason he failed to select so advantageous a site for his woodland cabin , he visited the swamps of his parish with assiduous frequency , and entered into their life , in a double sense , with the keen - est sympathy .

		Sometimes , as if to be civilized , he aims , ostensibly , to go a-cran - berrying , or to find the kalmia , though what he always relishes is not the cran - berries or the kalmia , but the `` cold and bracing '' wading in the stagnant water and muck , `` amid the water andromeda and the sphagnum , scratching my legs with the first and sinking deep in the last .

		The water is now gratefully cool to my legs , so far from being poisoned in the strong waters of the swamp .

		It is a sort of bap - tism for which I had waited . ''

		Superior , however , to merely wading would be the luxury of standing `` up to one 's chin in some retired swamp for a whole
summer	DATE	's day , scenting the sweet-fern and bilberry blows , and lulled by the minstrelsy of gnats and mosquitoes .

		A day passed in the society of those Greek sages , such as described in the ` Banquet ' of Xenophon would not be comparable with the dry wit of cranberry vines , and the fresh At - tic salt of the moss beds .

		Say twelve hours of genial and familiar intercourse with the leopard frog . ''

		This emotional attachment has its in - tellectual counterpart in that doctrine of the Wild which he preached in season and out of season .

		Briefly stated , it is this : that all civilization refers back to primi - tive nature , derives thence its title to per - manence ^ and ever and anon deliberately reunites itself with its source of vitality .

		If it does not , it is a moribund civilization .

		Thus , in the fable of Romulus and Re - mus ,
Thoreau	PERSON	reads the eternal truth that every state that has attained eminence has drawn nourishment and vigor from alma natura .

		The children of the Roman Em - pire , not being suckled by wolves , gave place to the northern barbarians who were .

		The continent of
America	LOCATION	is the she-wolf of our time , he goes on to say , and the children of the diseased civiliza - tion of
Europe	LOCATION	, responding to her coarse ministrations , are reinvigorated , are en - abled to found here a new
Rome	LOCATION	.

		In time this
Rome	LOCATION	of the West will likewise lan - guish , if the rank soil that sustains it is allowed to become exhausted ; it can be maintained only by ever-recurrent reliance on the Wild .

		`` Surely good courage will not flag here on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	border , as long as we are flanked by the Fur Coun - tries .

		There is enough in that sound to cheer one under any circumstances .

		The spruce , the hemlock , and the pine will not countenance despair . ''

		Never was there a more convinced be - liever in the essential goodness of nature .

		Her rectitude is attested , he asserts , by the uprightness of trees ; and `` Disease and a rain-drop can not coexist . ''

		In her large equanimity and antiseptic purity , she is medicine for body and soul , and no dis - ease is beyond her magical healing power .

		`` They bury poisoned sheep up to the necks in earth to take the poison out of them . ''

		She is completely healthy and innocent , and is an ideal to guide ever erring hu - manity .

		One might regard
Thoreau	PERSON	, on a hasty examination , as accepting the charming myth of a nature of the Golden Age , smiling , tender , artless , not the slimy , hoary , shagged beast of a nature of pre - historic periods .

		But actually he had the modern vision of nature as red in tooth and claw .

		There is a tragedy , he said , at the end of the life of every wild creature .

		His `` innocent '' nature is fond of violence , fond of what a superficial view holds re - pulsive that is one aspect of her inno - cence .

		`` We are cheered , '' he wrote in a significant passage in `` Walden , '' `` when we observe the vulture feeding on the car - rion which disgusts and disheartens us , and deriving health and strength from the repast ... I love to see that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	is so rife with life that myriads can be af - forded to be sacrificed and suffered to 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	prey on one another ; that tender organi - zations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like pulp , tadpoles which her - ons gobble up , and tortoises and toads run over in the road ; and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood !

		The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence . ''

		Thoreau 's outlook on nature , indeed , does not suf - fer from a trace of Transcendental anaemia .

		He looks the facts in the eye , even the ugliest , sees the struggle for ex - istence no less than the inspiriting sunset , and gives us , in the end , something like a whole view .

		That view was , of course , predestined to be favorable .

		Even so dread a word as
Necessity	ORGANIZATION	he stripped of its terrors by regarding it as `` only an - other name for inflexibility of good . ''

		Nature was bound to be good .

		No aspect of nature 's wildness could repel him .

		Everywhere he looked for the Wild .

		`` In literature , '' he asserted , `` it is only the wild that attracts us , '' though here the term means little more than spontaneity , the absence of conscious technique and conventional thought and feeling .

		Eng - lish literature as a whole , the best of it included , he pronounced `` essentially tame and civilized , '' imitative of the Classics .

		Grecian mythology had its root in a fertile ` nature , but even the Classics fall short of a perfect wildness .

		Again , he peered into the past of his American civilization to see what primitive vigor lay behind the mod - ern culture .

		He had more than his share of the romantic absorption in the remote , in the primitive , in sources .

		`` Strange spirits , demons , '' he says of the Indians , `` whose eyes could never meet mine ; with another nature and another fate than mine . ''

		The old warfare , waged in the very fields he walked on , seemed to him unreal , shadowy , and yet he loved to muse over it , with a still intensity , hoping now and again to obtain a true vision of the life or those far days .

		He would know `` what manner of men they were , how they lived here , their relation to nature , their arts and their customs , their fancies and superstitions .

		They paddled over these waters , they wandered in these woods , and they had their fancies and beliefs con - nected with the sea and the forest , which concern us quite as much as the fables of Oriental nations do '' ami that means a good deal when said by so devout a lover of the Bhagavat - -LRB- jita .

		Foolish indeed , our poets and philoso - phers , who regret that we have no an - tiquities , no ruins to remind us of our past , for everywhere is our soil laden with relics , arrowheads , implements , stone chips the wind can hardly blow away the surface , he says , without bringing to light the chips made by some aboriginal fletcher .

		> He looked for such relics incessantly .

		It was actually his habit , he states , when , in the fall , some sandy field had been plowed , to `` take note of it , '' and next
spring	DATE	to pay a visit as soon as the earth began to dry .

		Often he spent whole afternoons , especially in the
spring	DATE	, in pacing back and forth over such a sandy field .

		Indian relics were the gold which the sands of
Concord	LOCATION	yielded , and indeed he often thought at night `` with an inexpressible satisfaction and yearning of the arrow - headiferous sands of
Concord	LOCATION	. ''

		He trained his eye for an arrowhead to an astonishing keenness , so that , in compari - son , his walking companion , if he had one , was virtually blind .

		There is a familiar story that suggests this .

		His companion remarking , `` I do not see where you find your Indian arrowheads , ''
Thoreau	PERSON	stooped to the ground , picked one up , and gave it to him with the remark , `` Here is one . ''

		Luck , in such matters , is always on the side of the sharp eye .

		Why did Thoreau admire the Indian ?

		First , perhaps , on account of his relation to nature .

		The Indian was fitted to see and understand the wildness of nature as no white man could , because he was really at home in the woods .

		`` The charm of the Indian to me is that he stands free and unconstrained in Nature , is her inhabitant and not her guest , and wears her easily and gracefully . ''

		He envied the Indian this familiar , off-hand relation , and re - produced it remarkably well when one con - siders how introspective he was .

		If he was at home anywhere , it was in the woods and meadows of
Concord	LOCATION	.

		And next he admired the Indian 's reticence and stoi - cism .

		Though doubtless inborn in Thor - eau , these traits were almost certainly
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 greatly strengthened in him through emu - lation : had there been no Indian back - ground , one suspects that his Indian traits would not have flourished .

		In `` Walden '' he relates with gusto the story of Win - slow 's reception by
Massasoit	ORGANIZATION	and his tribe .

		`` They had nothing to eat them - selves , and they were wiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of food to their guests ; so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing about it . ''

		Surely that is as typical of
Thoreau	LOCATION	as it is of
Massasoit	LOCATION	's Indians he went through life forever tightening his belt and saying nothing about it .

		It is mainly for these traits an easy relation to na - ture , reticence , and stoical endurance that
Thoreau	PERSON	admired the Indian , aside , to be sure , from the misty picturesqueness of his life in aboriginal
Concord	LOCATION	.


Noth	PERSON	- ing suggests better the intensity of his ad - miration than his death-bed words `` moose '' and `` Indian . ''

		To the
Maine	LOCATION	woods he made two ex - cursions to satisfy his appetite for wild - ness and to study the Indian at first hand .

		He succeeded in learning a great deal , and in satisfying his appetite for wildness , to the point of nausea .

		He did not go to the woods , he complains , for moose-hunt - ing , and he condemns the Indian 's savage - ness a very genuine type of wildness ` roundly .

		`` What a coarse and imperfect use Indians and hunters make of nature !

		No wonder that their race is so soon ex - terminated .

		I already , and for weeks afterward , felt my nature the coarser for this part of my woodland experience . ''

		He returned to the `` smooth but still varied landscape '' of
Concord	LOCATION	with manifest re - lief .

		Wildness and the wilderness are a very good thing , no doubt , but they are not all of life ; for a place to spend one 's years in , it seemed to him ,
Concord	LOCATION	was immeasurably superior to the wilderness , `` necessary as the latter is for a resource and a background , the raw material of all our civilization . ''

		He goes on to remark that it is the partially cultivated country that has been the source of inspiration to the poets of the past , and will be to the poets of the future .

		The logger and pion - eer precede the poet eat the wild honey , perhaps , but the locusts also ; remove the decaying wood and the spongy mosses of the rank forest , and build hearths and hu - manize nature for the poet .

		It is well for the poet , at proper intervals , to visit the logger 's path and the Indian 's trail ; but let him dwell where `` art and refinement '' have altered the face of nature by making it more expressive , not only of man , but also to man .

		Literary Affairs in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		There are many signs that internationalism is destined to play a large part in the world 's affairs when the war closes and that literature and lit - erary matters are to share in the new activities .

		Two evidences of this in the French periodical field have just come to my attention .


M. Georges-Bazile	PERSON	, a
Paris	LOCATION	translator and re - viewer , tells me that he has decided to revive the plan of the defunct `` Revue Britannique '' in a somewhat different form and with a broader title `` Revue de
France	LOCATION	, de Grande-Bretagne et d'Amerique . ''

		It will be remembered that the old `` Revue Britannique '' flourished at
Paris	LOCATION	during the
last half of the past century	DATE	and ac - complished among magazines much what the `` Tauchnitz Edition '' did in the book-reading world on the European continent ; it presented to the foreign public what was best in the English and American monthlies .

		But the anti-British feeling which ran riot in
France	LOCATION	during the clos - ing years of the nineteenth century undermined this venerable periodical , and the present
M. Amedee Pichot	PERSON	was forced , much to his regret , to bring to an end a publication which the en - ergy and broad-mindedness of his father had made almost an institution in Parisian intellectual circles .

		In regard to the new `` Revue Britannique , '' M. Georges-Bazile writes me : My aim is to make known in
France	LOCATION	, liberal , liter - ary , and artistic
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, especially the latter , and to profit by the triple friendship now strengthened on the battle field by propagating throughout the world sane ideas concerning a sen - sible pacifism .

		The review would also tend to de - velop the friendship and the present good relations existing between the three nations .

		Why does n't
France	LOCATION	become the European university country of
America	LOCATION	, taking the place of
Germany	LOCATION	in this re - spect ?

		This is one of the first campaigns the new periodical will enter upon ; and there are others , many others , to follow .

		International , too , but in another way , is `` La Revue Contemporaine , '' which was founded in
Paris	LOCATION	at the beginning of the fifties to promote monarchy and reaction as an off-set to the pop -
12	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	ular commotions of
1848	DATE	, but which long ago abandoned ideas on the wane in modern Frame and , last year , as a direct result of the war , came out as the organ of the `` union nationale '' and the `` entente latine . ''

		M.
Henri Ch	ORGANIZATION	.

		d'Osmos .

		the indefatigable editor of this reformed month 1 \ , writes me as follows concerning the meaning of these two phrases : The union nationale is the union sacree of the war continued after the war , and the entente latine will be developed and transformed into an `` occidental union , '' which will prepare the way for the future `` congress of Anglo-Latin intellectuals . ''

		Our pages stand for these things and it is in this direction that our minds are now turned ; here is the aim of all our efforts .

		A peculiar feature of this periodical is the utilization of notes and material which , when the war broke out , were being collected by a well - organized body of writers and editors who were publishing an important series of biographies of living celebrities `` Les Archives Biographiques Contemporaines . ''

		It was destined to supply a long-felt want in
France	LOCATION	, where `` Qui Etes - Vous ? ''

		the French `` Who 's Who , '' lasted but two years , and where `` Vapereau '' seems to have died with its editor .

		Each number of this monthly devotes a section to a dozen brief sketches of living men and women .

		It is to be hoped that these scattered notices will finally be brought together in volumes and added to the eight or nine in the series already mentioned .

		The lack of contemporary biography in
France	LOCATION	is also partially supplied by the four little vol - umes of the `` Anthologie des Ecrivains Frangais Morts pour la Patrie '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Larousse , each volume 75 centimes -RRB- , edited by
M. Carlos Lar	PERSON	- ronde , with a stirring preface by
M. Maurice Barres	PERSON	.

		In these volumes appear notices of over forty young French writers , killed at the front , along with selections from their works .

		One of these biographies is that of Major
Joseph Vidal	PERSON	de la
Blache	PERSON	, a military historian whose reputation was rising rapidly when he fell at the beginning of
1915	DATE	.

		M.
Ernest Lavisse	PERSON	has brought out the correspondence `` Lettres '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Imprimerie Pochy , 25 centimes -RRB- sent from the trenches during the first six months of the war .

		It is no ordinary collection .

		The ec - centric mental and physical personality of
Charles Peguy	PERSON	appears in the anthology ,
Peguy	PERSON	having been one of the first writers to fall , and perhaps the most famous .

		Oddly enough , how - ever , no place has been found for
Joseph Lotte	PERSON	,
Peguy	PERSON	's close friend , who was killed less than
four months later	DATE	.

		But this omission is made up for by
M. Pierre Pacary	PERSON	's `` Un Compagnon de Peguy '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Gabalda , 4 fr . -RRB-

		, a book which , besides limning two strange lives , throws much light on the struggle in
France	LOCATION	between the
Republic	LOCATION	and the Catholic church .

		In fact , I know of no contemporary work which brings out more picturesquely the Catholic side of this contest .

		These pages also offer an odd example of a Johnson-Boswell episode , though of course on a much smaller scale than the famous proto - type
Lotte	LOCATION	playing the part of the
Laird of Auchinleck	ORGANIZATION	and
Peguy	PERSON	that of the Great Bear .

		As to the renewal of the old conflict in
France	LOCATION	between church and state ,
M. Maurice Barres	PERSON	thinks that the hatchet has been buried .

		His latest book , `` Les Diverses Families Spirit - uelles de la
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Emile-Paul , 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- , would seem at least to imply this conclu - sion .

		Or , perhapsj we have here a case of the wish being father to the thought .

		Anyway , it is a fine picture that he paints of the superb youth of
France	LOCATION	, united in the trenches in mind ami heart ; and some of the extracts from the home letters of these young men bring tears to the eyes .

		M. Barres is always an artist , and the subject lends itself magnificently to his delicate touch .

		Besides the Vidal correspondence just men - tioned ,
M. Lavisse	PERSON	has collected in a small vol - ume the series of `` Lettres a Tous les Francois '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Colin , 1 fr . -RRB-

		, which originally appeared as separate tracts .

		These letters , written for the most part by professors of the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, were issued in the
summer of 1915	DATE	, when
Russia	LOCATION	's weakness first began to cause misgivings in
France	LOCATION	.

		They urged upon the country , to quote the motto of the volume , `` Patience , effort , courage . ''

		Scattered by hundreds of thousands all over the land , they must have done their part , and a large one , in preserving the fine morale of the nation , a morale which is the basis of
M. Barres	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		Another recent volume of French biography is the `` Anthologie du Journalisme '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Dela - grave , 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- , edited by
M. Paul Ginisty	PERSON	, tin - well-known man of letters and theatre manager .

		He opens the book with an excellent essay on journalism in
France	LOCATION	, which is followed by short sketches of the leading journalists from the time of the first Revolution down to the Revolution of
1848	DATE	, each sketch being accompanied by selec - tions from the best work of the journalists .

		These pages well illustrate the truth of the French saying that journalism leads to e \ thing , provided only that you get out of it earlv enough .

		Thus we find such great poets , orators , philosophers , and novelists as the following classed here as `` newspaper men '' : Mirabeau ,
Condorcet	LOCATION	,
Chenier	PERSON	,
Guizot	LOCATION	,
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	.


Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
George Sand	PERSON	, and the Abbe Lamennais !

		Another curious list of names , though of quite a different sort , is found in the book by
M. Henri Welschinger	PERSON	, of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, `` La Mendicite
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL Allemande aux Tuileries '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Berger-Lev - rault , 1 fr . -RRB-

		, in which appear scores of Germans of all classes and of all intellectual conditions who asked favors and even money of
Napoleon III	PERSON	, or who fawned upon him during the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The list was drawn from the official records of the Tuileries and extends over a period of eighteen years .

		Nobles , so-called , professors and poets from over the
Rhine	LOCATION	abound ; and scattered among them are the names of several mfnor Hohenzollerns , a relative of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, the historians ,
Hiiffer	PERSON	,
Sybel	PERSON	, and
Mommsen	PERSON	, Pro- fessor
Helfferich	PERSON	, a relative of the present im - perial minister of finance ,
Prince William of Baden	PERSON	, and
Hans von Billow	PERSON	.

		May not such a lamentable list as this have suggested to
M. Welschinger	PERSON	this reflection , which appears in the note accompanying his book ?

		This world-war will have the best effect on French literature .

		It will strengthen and clarify the spirit of the country .

		It will lift up our hearts and souls .

		It will rid us of the literary vermin who have done so much harm in leading foreigners to believe that we were degenerate .

		The novel , history , criticism , and the theatre will then be worthy of a country which has displayed to the world its real heroism and its true spirit of generosity .

		A book of reference unlike those already men - tioned is
M. Joseph Reinach	PERSON	's `` Histoire de Douze Jours '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Felix Alcan	PERSON	, 12 fr . -RRB-

		, which gives the history of the diplomatic origin of the present war and covers the period from
July 23	DATE	, to
August 3 , 1914	DATE	.

		We have there , ar - ranged in twelve chapters , each chapter embrac - ing the dispatches of a single day , all the diplomatic correspondence exchanged by the fu - ture belligerents during this short and fatal period .


M. Reinach	PERSON	admits that `` it is pretty certain that these dispatches are only selections chosen from among those really sent at that moment , and that the text of the dispatches is not always complete ... But just as they stand , the aggressive spirit of those of German origin comes out on every page of this volume .

		.

		.

		If a German or Austrian publisher were to translate this book , he would n't be allowed to put it on sale . ''

		Here is the place , perhaps , to say a word of a pamphlet , `` Leurs Crimes '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Berger	PERSON	-
Levrault	PERSON	, 25 centimes -RRB- , published in popular form for propaganda purposes under the patron - age of the mayors of more than a score of towns of the invaded regions of northern and eastern
France	LOCATION	which have suffered from Teutonic ex - cesses .

		It was sent to me by the mayor of Ver - dun , who is installed at
Paris	LOCATION	as a result of the ruined condition of `` our dear city . ''

		It is a dreadful picture of war made unnecessarily hor - rible .

		Of course
Verdun	LOCATION	is also the scene of
M. Gaston Jollivet	PERSON	's `` L'Epopee de
Verdun	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- , which traces in detail the history of that nine months ' memorable defence .

		But I mention this book largely to call attention to the significant state of mind of its author , a veteran
Paris	LOCATION	journalist of the old school , who up to
August , 1914	DATE	was an uncompromising enemy of the republican regime in
France	LOCATION	, but who now says to me : `` After this war , we must all unite in a loyal effort to make this the best possible republic . ''

		He then asks for the titles of the principal books on democratic government in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We have another instance of in - creased interest in our country and its institu - tions in the
May	DATE	number of the `` Journal des Economistes , '' to which the editor ,
M. Yves Guyot	PERSON	, contributes `` La Formation Politique des Etats-Unis , '' an article which precisely meets the demand of
M. Jollivet	PERSON	and his friends .

		The killing and the bloody anguish , the de - struction of lovely and valuable things , the hor - ror and sorrow in the hearts of those who remain are disasters immeasurable ; but the greatest dis - aster of all is spiritual , intellectual ; it is the stupefied brain , the soul that has been bludgeoned and stunned .

		It is not to be wondered at that English men of letters have lost their inspira - tion , that war has smashed the lips of poetry and that philosophy has fled from her seat .

		Per - haps the greater wonder is that in the midst of conflict men have courage to write at all .

		Of the English writers to whom we were once accustomed to look , if not for ultimate wisdom , at least for helpful correlations of current thought , few have kept their wits undeafened by the din , unblinded by the smoke .

		The most notable are
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	,
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, and
H. N. Brailsford	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , such capable commentators on the human being as
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	and
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	give us second-rate journalism .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, stand - ing on his head , announces every week that no German is standing on his feet .

		And the sad - dest case of mental degeneration is that of
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		The direction of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's decadence is a normal result of war .

		When men lose control of their lives and fortunes and the whole world seems to be plunging to hell , they take refuge in mysticism and superstitious consolations .

		An earthquake sends them screaming to the skirts of the gods .

		On a sinking ship men fall upon their knees who have never learned or have long 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	forgotten how to pray .

		Bewildered Britlin ^ cease to trust themselves and society ; their old philosophies and sciences crumble ; they cast about for something they can trust and turn to reli - gion .

		It is more than likely that after this war , no matter how impotent the churches seem to be , there will be a recrudescence of religion , a period of mysticism , of reactionary thinking which will last until people recover self-con - fidence and stability .

		Wells 's belated discovery of religion is normal and natural ; the only ab - normal thing about it is that he seemed not to be the sort of man who would lose his grip on reality and find satisfaction in religious common - place .

		And yet
Wells	PERSON	has always shown a fundamen - tal weakness of which his latest book is one ex - pression .

		He is an incurable romantic , and his imagination is muddled .

		For all the brilliancy of his thought and his electric lucidity of phrase , he seldom keeps his ideas pure .

		He adulterates studies of society , novels , with sociological the - ory , and he corrupts his discussions of social and political problems with sheer fiction .

		He mixes stories of contemporaneous life with what he calls fantastic and imaginative romance .

		`` In the Days of the Comet '' is spoiled by a love story which is lugged in by the heels or the heart ; without it that interesting book would have suc - ceeded even with a love-loving public .

		`` Tono Bungay , '' which should have been an excellent story of modern life , is damaged by an unneces - sary expedition to
Africa	LOCATION	in search of `` quap , '' a mysterious metal which does not exist and which ought not to be invented in that kind of book .

		In the phrase of the day ,
Wells	PERSON	gets his wires crossed .

		In `` God , The Invisible King , '' the crossing of wires produces irritating crackles , occasional flashes of light , but no steady flame .

		Wells dis - cusses vast uncertainties in a tone of cocksure cer - titude .

		He writes of God as he once wrote of flying machines .


Bill Nye	PERSON	, of genial memory , said that he had been reading an interesting book by the Reverend
Joseph Cook	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, called `` A Bird 's - eye View of God . ''

		Wells in his air - plane sweeps over the universe at terrific speed , cutting figure eights and looping the loop just to show off and enjoy the power of his wings , surveys the Almighty , drops bombs into the camp of the orthodox believer and into the camp of the atheist , sees at a glance that neither can shoot straight , and comes back with a triumphant flour - ish of discovery to tell us all about it .

		To be sure he does not pretend to invention or dis - covery ; he disclaims it .

		`` I have been but scribe to the spirit of my generation . ''

		God only knows , his God only knows , who gave him his credentials as authentic scribe to the spirit of a generation which is a confusion of many spirits and which is so diversified , such a contest of physical ami spiritual forces , that no man can see it whole even from an airplane .

		He says that he has `` at most assembled and put together things and thoughts '' that he has come upon , and `` transferred the statements of ` science ' into re - ligious terminology . ''

		-LRB- That transference is a perfect example of crossed wires . -RRB-

		Wells has put together with a good deal of skill the things and thoughts that he has come upon ; he has arranged them in his habitually neat chapters and sections ; he has ticketed and pigeonholed aspects of the True God and the false gods , or , since pigeonholes are not toler - ated in modern business , he has filed his thoughts and things in a steel filing-cabinet ; and this in spite of his own adjuration `` that you try to set no nets about God . ''

		`` Chapter the Second : Her - esies ; or the Things That Are Not God .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- Heresies Are Misconceptions of God ... -LRB- 3 -RRB- God Is Not Magic . ''

		And so on , all in clear , compact literary method .

		There is much ad - mirable phrasing , now and again a vivid met - aphor .

		But I wish to the Lord -LRB- I believe that prayer is allowed by the Wellsian theology -RRB- I knew what the old-fashioned Almighty thinks about
Wells	PERSON	's Finite God and what
Wells 's Finite God	ORGANIZATION	makes out of
Wells	ORGANIZATION	's presentation of him .

		Not having the advantage of that intimacy with God which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	seems to be favored with , I must confine myself to things and thoughts that are human and mundane and cap - able of some sort of verification .

		Not only does
Wells	PERSON	fail to content me with his report of the thoughts and things of my generation , but he seems to be ignorant of thoughts that were com - monplace a generation ago .

		Oddly enough , he is not in the forefront of thought but is behind the times .

		Much that he has to say was stale -LRB- not old , for the age of a thought does not damage it , but stale -RRB- before
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	wrote his once lively and perturbing heresies .

		We got all that long ago , accepted it , took it for granted , and stopped worrying about it .

		We could have got most of it at about the same time or a little earlier from
Kenan	PERSON	, and much of it a long , long time ago from
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is as if
Wells	PERSON	had come upon an airplane of ten years ago , had mended it himself , and learned to navigate with skill and daring , but was all the time sublimely unconscious that that type and many later im - provements had been sent to the scrap-heap .

		He seems not even to have understood
William James	PERSON	, whom he calls his friend and master ; certainly he has missed
James	PERSON	's spirit and fine manners .

		For when
James	PERSON	developed the idea of a finite God and laid before us the consoling
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 idea that there may be forces in the universe more or less on our side , he said , `` may be , '' not , `` absolutely are , and if you do n't believe it you 're wrong . ''

		James wooed the idea of God ;
Wells	ORGANIZATION	violates it .

		James was magnificently hospitable ' to other people 's gods and no-gods .

		The central theme of `` Varieties of Religious Experience '' is the reality of the other man 's experience ; let us try to understand what other people have been through , accept their testimony about something they know better than we do , before we attempt to assess the value of that testimony and assemble conclusions from the statements of many wit - nesses .

		If you do not accept
Wells	PERSON	's God , you not only miss heaven but are wiped off the earth , ruled out of its warm living human contacts .

		Listen to this egregious intolerance : The benevolent atheist stands alone upon his own good will , without a reference , without a standard , trusting to his own impulse to goodness , relying upon his own moral strength .

		A certain immodesty , a cer - tain self-righteousness , hangs like a precipice above him ... He has no one to whom he can give him - self ... His exaltation is self-centered , is priggish - ness ... He has no source of strength beyond his own amiable sentiments , his conscience speaks with an unsupported voice , and no one watches while he sleeps .

		He can not pray ; he can but ejaculate .

		He has no real and living link with other men of good will .

		As an atheist , I hope a benevolent one , I can assure Mr.
Wells	PERSON	that the foregoing propositions are the cheekiest buncombe that I have read since I read a report of a sermon by the
Reverend Billy	ORGANIZATION
Sunday	DATE	.

		The old theologians consigned us to hell fire , a problematic punishment which is still in the future for those of us who are left on the earth .

		The Reverend Mr.
Wells	PERSON	denies our humanity and falsifies psychology .

		If I had time I should lay him out , Chapter the First , Section 1 .

		But it is not worth while .

		I will only suggest that he is the last man in the world to charge other men with immodesty , that there are other modes of expression besides prayer and ejaculation , and that the links that we have with other men of good will -LRB- and of ill will -RRB- are as real and living as anything in the human breast .

		And one thing more : Mr.
Wells	PERSON	wishes to im - press his ideas upon the world , to make converts .

		If so , he goes at the task in exactly the wrong way .

		His facile dethronement of the old gods will not disturb their votaries .

		His insolent attitude toward the godless , whom he might win to a new and living conception of God , if he had one , alienates them , arouses their intellec - tual contempt -LRB- if he likes , their pride and prig - gishness -RRB- , incites them to say over again the line from the `` Hymn to Proserpine '' : I kneel not , neither adore you , but standing , look to the end .

		A more varied collection of volumes than this it is indeed difficult to imagine .

		But , with the exception of
Prince Biilow	ORGANIZATION	's book , they have in common the single characteristic of being quite painfully unimportant .

		Mr.
Ossiannilsson	PERSON	shows us that one Swede , at any rate , is not pro- German , but the rest of his thought is entirely unilluminating and utterly unimportant .

		Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	's patriotism must indeed be ex - treme if it could so far obscure his usually alert intelligence as to make him publish these dull platitudes .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	is one of
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	- cliffe 's young men ; and he has his patron 's fac - ulty of making our flesh creep with quite exceptional hideousness .

		The book he has writ - ten will tell any reader what Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	says he saw inside the German empire ; but I think that he will conclude that his author has still to learn the value of historic and psychological light and shade .


M. Bainville	PERSON	has written a straightforward and simple narrative of the case for
Italy	LOCATION	, and he usefully makes plain the diffi - culties of the baffling campaign she has had to fight .

		The exact purpose of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's book I have not been able to discover .

		It tells us a good deal about Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	.

		One learns that he is very sensitive and that he loves a certain impossible attitude which he calls impar - tiality .

		But , as a whole , the book is evidence that the expert had better stick to his province .

		In the interpretation of literature many of us are anxious to hear what Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has to say .

		As a publicist , he is quite frankly third - rate .

		His book is a rehash of old material and new comment which has no permanent value of any kind .

		Mr.
Gleason	PERSON	has performed an ex - tremely able journalistic feat .

		His volume is a very skilfully composed encyclopaedia of English thought to-day .

		Everyone is there Mr.
Lansbury	PERSON	, Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	, Mr.
Lionel Curtis	PERSON	, Mr.
Webb	PERSON	.

		Labels of identification are attached to them all .

		An ordinary Englishman like my - self may again and again have real difficulty in recognizing some of the portraits .

		Mr.
Glea	PERSON	- son works rapidly , and he is a little naive .

		But his book has a real interim value as a cinemato -
16	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	graph and it is extraordinarily pleasant reading .

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	keeps a large pair of scissors by his side .

		He has industriously gone through the files of immense numbers of European newspa - pers .

		These he arranged territorially , and any - one who wants , for debating purposes , a kind of campaign-book of public opinion will find his book useful .

		But it is quite without critical value .

		Of very different calibre is
Prince Billow	ORGANIZATION	's volume .

		A new edition of a book published first some five years ago , it is , I imagine , among the half-dozen most significant productions of the work .

		It is admirably translated , and the new material is bracketed so that it can be dis - tinguished from the old .

		Written as it is by one who , with the single exception of the German Emperor , is more responsible than any other man for the present catastrophe , it is little less than a public duty for everyone who wishes adequately to understand the present situation to read it .

		It is a realistic book .

		Prince
Biilow	PERSON	does not becloud his thought with fine phrases or pious aspirations .

		He is perfectly clear as to what he wants , and his frank belief in the rectitude of his demands is refreshing .

		He is convinced that
Germany	LOCATION	is the natural leader of the world .

		Culturally , industrially , socially , she is far in advance of any other nation .

		It is then fitting that the political situation should give expression to her aptitude for leadership .

		He does not doubt that the object of world politics is power , and he explains how that power is to be attained .

		England stood in the way of German domina - tion , and while his building of the German navy was not intended as a threat against
England	LOCATION	, it was intended that henceforth
Germany	LOCATION	should have no reason to fear the control of her actions on sea or land by the superiority of any other nation .

		He regards himself as the successor of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, and it is the same policy of Wtltmacht that he claims to have pursued .

		His whole con - ception of international relations is based upon the terrible chimera of the balance of power , and he obviously considers concerted European action of any kind a fantastic dream .

		He is entirely uninterested in effort after European organization , so that neither the Hague confer - ences nor proposals for international disarma - ment even make an appearance in his pages .

		He simply conceived that foreign policy could be summed up in the desire of
Germany	LOCATION	to grow strong , and the desire of
England	LOCATION	to prevent her from being strong .

		In his view , the fatal mis - take of English statesmen was not to strike against
Germany	LOCATION	before she had become too dan - gerous for attack to be lightly undertaken .

		Of the irreconcilability of
France	LOCATION	he was convinced ; for the friendship of
Russia	LOCATION	he cared little .

		The
Triple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	he felt sure of
Italy	LOCATION	made him feel that the domination of
Germany	LOCATION	could be secured before the other powers realized that it had in fact been achieved .

		If there seems some - thing sinister in this conception of a frank mer - cantilism in foreign affairs , he will merely shrug his shoulders and argue that it is the way of the world .

		He builds the life of the state around its army , and he is clear that its activity and organ - ization must not be subject to political inflm-ncr .

		Indeed , he feels the more certain of that be - cause , in his view , the one deficiency in the Ger - man character is the lack of a political instinct .

		That , of course , leads him to insist that the thor - oughgoing parliamentarism of
England	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	is unsuited to German conditions .

		He dislikes the tendency in
Germany	LOCATION	to create a multiform and complex group-life , which we are coming more and more to recognize as , in fact , the condition of liberty , and he urges that some modification is essential to German needs .

		He deprecates the party system on the ground that it subordinates national interests to separatist interests a foreigner can hardly read this criticism of German parties without amaze - ment and he insists that it breeds a dangerous opposition to government .

		He believes that the real object of domestic policy is simply tranquil - lity and the best means those which most easily secure that end .

		He has the Bismarckian hatred of the Social Democrats and the Bismarckian suspicion of the
Catholic Centre	ORGANIZATION	.

		He does not doubt that the moral centre of the German na - tion is built round the Hohenzollern dynasty , and he insists that upon it the successful future of
Germany	LOCATION	depends .

		Such was the attitude of Prince
Biilow	PERSON	when his book was first published in
1913	DATE	.

		The tragedy of this new edition is the fact that not even the terrible experience of the
last three years	DATE	has led him to modify a single conclusion .

		Rather , on the contrary , does it seem to have for - tified his outlook .

		He believes , of course , in the invincibility of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But what is re - markable in his added reflections is the absence of any of the bitterness which distinguishes , for example , the writings of Professor von
Meyer	PERSON	or Count von Reventlow .

		He looks at the war with the cold detachment of an observer \ vho watches a predetermined , logical process .

		He has no room for moral considerations of any kind .

		Causes and results he does not even ex - press in the language of a democratic commu - nity .

		The only point for his consideration is whether
Germany	LOCATION	will emerge stronger or weaker from the war .

		What she has done has been justified in his view by the conviction that it was either in her hands or in that of some other power that the key to world control had to lie .

		He is of course convinced that it would be better for
Germany	LOCATION	to secure domination .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 17 It is difficult not to be convinced in our turn that only the shock of complete defeat can change so amazing an attitude .

		When Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	in - sisted that the world must be made safe for democracy , the ideal which underlay his words was in fact the precise antithesis of this grim and sinister materialism .

		Whatever may have been our failure in this crisis , the splendor of ideals has been made clear to us .

		We have seen very definitely that the old terms of international existence have become obsolete .

		Prince Billow 's book is the last defiant challenge of an order that can be tolerated no longer .

		We have done with the civilization of dynasties and commercial oligarchy .

		We must attach the instruments of power to new purposes that have richer promise .

		It is , indeed , a long and difficult task .

		But it is exactly therein that we find its splendor .

		The Renaissance in
Spain	LOCATION	SPANISH ARCHITECTURE OF THE SIXTEENTH CEN - TURY .

		By
Arthur Bryne	PERSON	and
Mildred Stapley	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 7.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In obedience to that good law by which civ - ilized life is periodically cleansed of its accumu - lated corruptions , we are to-day in presence of tidal changes the nature and effects of which are difficult to understand .

		To our amazement we find not only that the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	has become infinitely distant , but that a past more remote has become suddenly and thrillingly near .

		The sense of this is particularly present in reading such a book as `` Spanish Architecture in the
Sixteenth Century	LOCATION	, '' for it is concerned with the last great epochal reversal of consciousness before the one now under way .

		For the
Renais	PERSON	- sance was a reaction from Mediaevalism to those humanistic and scientific engrossments and en - thusiasms which have persisted even up to the present time .

		The Renaissance , `` that first transcendent springtide of the modern world , '' came later in
Spain	LOCATION	than in
Italy	LOCATION	, where the mildness was first felt .

		Enrique de Egas , the earliest prac - titioner of the new architectural art the obra del romano , as the Spanish began by calling it was spelling out a word here and a word there in the new vernacular , at a time when
Peruzzi	PERSON	and
Bramante	PERSON	, men of the Golden Noon , were producing finished masterpieces in an already transformed
Milan	LOCATION	,
Siena	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Egas , unlike
Brunelleschi	ORGANIZATION	, the great precursor , w r as a Gothic architect , not alone by training and experience but in the very complexion of his mind .

		He did not aim , as did
Brunelleschi	ORGANIZATION	, to revolutionize structure by reverting to that of the Romans , but only to introduce a new note , borrowed from Lombard craftsmen , into orna - ment .

		This lesser ambition proved a happy thing for
Spain	LOCATION	.

		It meant that her great in - herited tradition remained unbroken : she put on , not a shackle , but a bracelet wondrously chased .

		Spanish architecture is free , in the main , from certain vices resultant from the zeal of the convert and from the pedantry of too great knowledge , such as the fretting up of noble walls with meaningless pilasters , and the inter - position between a column and an arch of an isolated entablature .

		Moreover , the Moorish influence , with its gift of color and romance , lends a note which makes the architecture of the Renaissance in
Spain	LOCATION	totally different from its manifestation in other times and places , worthy of the sympathetic and serious treatment it has received at the hands of these authors , in this truly admirable work .

		Spanish Renaissance architecture until , un - der
Philip II	PERSON	and his architect , Juan de Her - rera , it relapsed into that pedantry which - lay like a dead hand on all
Europe	LOCATION	was clearly differentiated from that of any other country , possessing characteristics well marked and there - fore easily described .

		Its most obvious and admirable merit consisted in a constant observ - ance of that polarity which always ought to exist between the wall and its penetrations and termination doors , windows , cornice , and the like .

		That is , the wall was treated as a wall ; its weight , mass , and extent of surface were duly respected .

		String courses marked , as they should , the major internal horizontal divisions , and the eye was duly prepared for the inevitable end by high arcades surmounted by sumptuous cornices .

		Entrances were accented and given due importance by frontispieces delightfully free and rich .

		Windows were similarly framed in ornament and further embellished by balconies and iron grilles of superb design and craftsman - ship .

		But the crowning glory of these buildings is seen in their patios , or interior arcaded courts .

		It is doubtful if this feature has ever elsewhere received more logical and inspired treatment by architects .

		Compared with the best of them
Bramante	PERSON	's famous Cancelleria court seems stiff and monotonous , and the Moorish court of the
Alhambra	LOCATION	looks sugary and thin .

		They are usually in two stages , an upper and a lower , exhibiting a well-marked difference of propor - tion , the upper sometimes doubly divided , with an intermediate column over the centre of the lower arch .

		The mouldings of the architraves of the arches were often delicately interlaced , and where a lintel replaced the arch it was sup - ported by fancifully shaped consoles projecting between the column 's necking and abacus .

		The 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
June	DATE	JS stairways leading off these courts were aim .

		.

		-- always noble in proportion , of easy slope , the balustrade ornamented with almost Gothic lux - uriance and freedom .

		Another fine and charac - teristic feature is seen in the wooden ceilings , of geometrical design , richly carved and highly colored , showing the persistence of Moorish in - fluence .

		Taken all together , it may be said that Span - ish Renaissance architecture , particularly in its first phase , is a style as distinctive and dis - tinguished as that of
Italy	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	, and elo - quent , like them , of the time , the race , the place in which it budded , bloomed , and faded into this `` winter of our discontent . ''

		The authors of `` Spanish Architecture in the Sixteenth Century '' have performed their work well so well that the book must take an hon - ored place in every architectural library with any pretense to completeness .

		Not only does the volume contain more than two hundred illus - trations , but many of these are carefully meas - ured drawings , the value of which , to an architect , is greater than any photograph , how - ever good .

		The text is historical as regards the style , biographical as regards its most famous practitioners , and critical in the discussion of the more famous buildings .

		It is written in an authoritative , interesting way , from full knowl - edge and deep love of the subject .

		The authors , the publisher , and the public to which the book makes its appeal -LRB- a public unfortunately small -RRB- are alike to be congratulated .

		The worst service a reviewer can perform is to make his review so exhaustive as to deceive the interested reader into the belief that it relieves him of the necessity of buying and reading the book .

		Fortunately the imposed limits of this re - view make such a thing impossible .

		Let me rather , in the little remaining space at my dis - posal , sound a warning to the young designer seduced by the beauty of the
Sixteenth Century Spanish Architecture	ORGANIZATION	into an attempt to play `` the sedulous ape . ''

		If he is content to copy the style without understanding the social , political , and psychological forces which gave it birth , he will fail unutterably : if he copies it with a full understanding of all these things , he will still fail ; for that betrays in him a graver ignorance an ignorance of the social , political , and psy - chological forces which move us now .

		It is for him not to copy , but to create .

		A book like this book is a stimulant to the creative faculty .

		Let him nerve himself to the production of a dif - ferent but not inferior beauty , one consistent with modern life , modern conditions , and mod - ern building methods .

		Few things in the perplexing poetry of to-day are clearer to the unprejudiced reader than it - usual fineness and delicacy of technique unless , indeed , its occasional and sporadic , nearly always deliberate , badness .

		The tiniest poeticule in the remotest environs of
Parnassus	LOCATION	can warble forth a stave that would not have shamed
Herrick	PERSON	or
Campion	PERSON	.

		In spite of the fact that verse-making in English has grown steadily more difficult from the time of Chaucer to our own , in spite of our recent rejection of specialized poetic diction and all the easy-going poetic licenses and padding ex - pletives of earlier days , we are actually writing better verse , qua verse , it would seem , than any but the best men in their best moments wrote a century ago .

		The situation is precisely that of which
Tenny	PERSON	- son illogically and ungratefully complained `` Most can raise the flowers now , for all have got the seed . ''

		Much of the deliberate badness of contemporary versifying ` is due to the feeling a well-known sign of over-cultivation that re - finement has been carried to its ultimate limits .

		A case in point is that of Mr.
W. W. Gibson	PERSON	, who began his career by writing long narrative poems in the most `` precious '' and exigent stanza structures and who later turned to what one sees .

		Without implying that vers libre is in any sense bad versification , it may be pointed out that its vogue is partly due to the same sort of poetic atavism .

		These considerations , whatever truth or faUit \ they may contain , are far more charitable to cur - rent tendencies than those which Mr.
Watson	PERSON	presents in his recent volume of criticism in verse , `` Retrogression . ''

		A perfectionist in verse of the direct Tennysonian lineage , he attacks with all his powers of epigram this contempo - rary delight in the intentionally crude and crabbed .

		For example , in the poem `` Nature 's Way , '' which is a more compact versified vade mecum of classicism that
Boileau	PERSON	's or Roscom - m < Hi 's , he makes a direct drive at the school of the `` barbaric yawp . ''

		`` Faultily faultless im \ be ill , '' he says , but `` Carefully careless is worse still . ''

		He correctly traces the `` loose-lipped
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 19 lingo of the street , '' which he finds characteristic of present-day poetry , to a pretended worship of `` Art 's uncorrupted mother , Nature . ''

		Somehow Mr.
Watson	PERSON	manages to make this sort of thing at once thrilling as attack , trenchant as crit - icism , and beautiful as poetry .

		With this poem and much else in his book that is sound in thought and brilliant in phrase , Mr.
Watson	PERSON	will find more sympathizers than he may realize or even desire for he seems to enjoy thinking of himself as a sort of `` lonely an - tagonist of destiny , '' a last survivor of the giants before the flood .

		It is a pity that this mood of haughty isolation has grown so strong in his work of late , and a misfortune that he has not been content to go on writing such noble things as the `` Hymn to the Sea '' and `` To the Un - known God , '' but has become more and more feverishly concerned , it would seem , with his own reputation .

		The man who has successfully challenged
Keats	PERSON	in `` Ode to Autumn '' and Arnold in ``
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Grave '' and
Milton	PERSON	himself in `` Lachrymas Musarum , '' might well afford to let alone all really ignorant or merely spiteful criticism of his work .

		That he has been unable to do so is lamentable evidence that this sole or at least supreme living representative of the classic mode in English poetry has fallen into the deepest and darkest of romantic pitfalls egoism .

		It is just because one feels so deeply the truth of what he says about himself and his work that one wishes another pen than his had traced the painful lines entitled `` Confidence . ''

		When criticasters of a day Seem to have sneered me quite away ; When with a pontiff 's frown Some dabbler puts me down ; When up from out the nursery start Sages to teach me mine own art Guides in that field my share Ploughed long before they were ; When guests of fashion brief as vain Sow wide a tasteless taste inane ; When Folly , night and morn , Scatters on me her scorn ; When they who could bestow , refuse With deathless spite the admitted dues ; When slanderous lips aver I am the slanderer ; Then , draining mine appointed cup , In patience do I gird me up , Knowing that
Time	ORGANIZATION	, one day , All his arrears will pay .

		There is some danger that the poetry of Flecker , like that of his friend
Brooke	PERSON	, may be rated higher for a time than it deserves .

		Con - sidering the inevitability of the recoil , there is no kindness to the poet 's memory in helping on this sentimental tendency .

		He should be judged , as he would have wished , by what he actually ac - complished .

		He left a fairly large amount of work for a man who died at thirty , and most of this was carefully revised before his death .

		Ex - cept for those distinctly marked as early , few of his poems are clearly experimental or immature .

		Everywhere in them one sees an alert and manly mind moving easily and habitually upon high levels .

		His achievement in verse is consistently high , but no single poem stands out as specially memorable .

		One catches many a glint and glim - mer of the full moon of poesy , but these are no - where gathered into a single broad beam .

		His best things are not in the best places but seem of the texture rather than of the design .

		In passing from the poems of Flecker to those of Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	, we move from the
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	dawn albeit a modern
Hellas	PERSON	, a Hellas of the Parnassians into that Celtic Twilight wherein no
Saxon	PERSON	mind can long know North from South or the right hand from the left .

		Vague shapes , which we can easily imagine beautiful because they are so dimly seen , move toward us through the floating vapor of this poetry and re - cede into it again , with muffled words and un - intelligible gestures .

		I must disregard the two long odes which take up more than half the book .

		The second of these is a mystic poem of serene beauty and deep significance .

		The first is more like
Whitman	PERSON	's `` Children of Adam '' than any - thing else in American poetry which I have read , and it is marred by the same lack of humor , judgment , self-criticism .

		The poet has not tried to imagine how his successive aves to the various portions of his anatomy would sound to an im - partial listener .

		He has forgotten that even poetic composition contains some social element .

		He has not considered the possibility that poetry may be even overheard .

		While a careful and sympathetic reader will certainly find a high in - tention in this first ode , he will almost cer - tainly be sorry that it was written in such a com - plete social vacuum a feature sufficiently signalized by the fact that the poet while com - posing it , as in the case of other poems in the book , was presumably nude .

		Perhaps
John Keats	PERSON	would have admitted that half-heard melodies are sweetest .

		The melodies in the second part of Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's book are half-heard .

		He gives us little more than snatches of lovely themes , and these we elaborate to our own liking .

		Frequently the result is a quintes - sential poetry from which all dross of special meaning is purged away .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	is a lover of pouring light .

		He cares little for sharply defined form or for color witness his overuse of `` white '' and `` gold . ''

		His poems abound in delicate fancy and his words have `` elvish music in the weave . ''

		No more rarified and ethereal poetry is to be found than he has given us in the small group of lyrics at the end of his book .

		If , to the fine Celtic qual - ities already so clear in his verse , he could but 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	add humor , restraint , poise , clarity why then he would cease to be an Irish poet , and that thing not to be thought of .

		Yet , if he could only follow up the frequently thrilling and won - derful first stanzas of his better lyrics , such , for example , as that of `` Magic , '' he would have taken a long step away from the vague , nymph - oleptic longing which makes so much of his work merely obscure toward the always desirable qualities of structure , form , design .

		As illustration of some of the things 1 have said about Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's work , I shall quote `` Off Chatham Bars '' rather than `` The Whisper of
Earth	LOCATION	, '' which I prefer , but which has been more frequently reprinted .

		Light , and the cry of the wild dove flying Over the pathless sunset home , Out of the mist of sighing waters Into the silent dying foam .

		Nightfall slowly hushing to stillness , Murmur of shingle slipping down , Throbbing pulse of the passionate spirit Brooding over the sleeping town .

		The veins of the world are flooding inward , Earth-flame curls in the running blood , And flesh , an island in chartless oceans , Scourged by the lash of the flying scud .

		Flowers in stars of adoration , Chaunting loud to the singing tide , Wind and moon and waters obeying , Bridegroom flaming unto the Bride .

		It must have taken courage to put together the little anthology of Oxford poetry for
1916	DATE	.

		Many voices from that `` nest of singing birds '' have been stilled of late some of which we had heard , and there is a sober hush over all this poetry which one does not find it hard to ac - count for .

		The collection is small , extending to only sixty pages , but it is very good through - out and has nothing to fear on the score of beauty or maturity from comparison with any anthology that has been or may be made of con - temporary poetry in English .

		Among the names that one hopes to meet again are those of
A. L. Huxley	PERSON	, of
Balliol	LOCATION	, whose powerful though crabbed `` Mole '' reminds one a little of
Fulke Greville	PERSON	, and
Sherard Vines	ORGANIZATION	, whose strangely beautiful `` Song of the Elm '' reminds one of nothing else in the world .

		But there is power and beauty on nearly every page .

		One can not help wondering whether any American univer - sity , or , to make the comparison fairer , any group of American universities , could do as well .

		The recent anthology of American college verse would seem to indicate a negative answer .

		The sort of `` western verse '' one finds in
Arthur Chapman	PERSON	's volume has been familiar since the days of
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		It was carried to its highest level which , after all , was rather low by
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	many years ago .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	phrases the old facile philosophy of `` God 's Out - of-Doors '' in a manner not very novel or very attractive in itself .

		The title poem is said by the publishers to be `` perhaps the best-known bit of verse in
America	LOCATION	.

		It hangs framed in tin - office of the Secretary of the Interior at Wash - ington .

		It has been quoted in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and printed as campaign material for at least two governors . ''

		After this recommendation , one is hardly surprised to discover that it is merely an inept and sentimental phrasing of the braggadocio of the far West .

		In Mr.
Squire	PERSON	's `` Tricks of the Trade '' we have one of the most diverting books of parody in recent years .

		Its range is wide from Pope to
Davies	PERSON	and almost as many styles of pa rod u writing are exhibited as there are styles parodied .

		In the first half are ten imitations of the work of contemporary writers , mostly poets .

		In the second are ten duplex parodies which keep two balls in the air at once in a bewildering but often brilliant fashion .

		These burlesques are fre - quently criticism of no mean order .

		The best of them , and one which deserves to live , like the `` Rehearsal , '' long after the object of its at - tack is forgotten , is the one entitled `` If Gray Had Had to Write His Elegy in the
Cemetery of Spoon River Instead	ORGANIZATION	of that of Stoke Poges . ''

		I can quote from it only a few stanzas .

		The curfew tolls the knell of parting day , The whippoorwill salutes the rising moon , And wanly glimmer in her gentle ray , The sinuous windings of the turbid Spoon .

		Here where the flattering and mendacious swarm Of lying epitaphs their secrets keep , At last incapable of further harm , The lewd forefathers of the village sleep .

		For them no more the whetstone 's cheerful noise , No more the sun upon his daily course Shall watch them savouring the genial joys Of murder , bigamy , arson , and divorce .

		Here they all lie ; and , as the hour is late , O stranger , o'er their tombstones cease to stoop , But bow thine ear to me and contemplate The unexpurgated annals of the group ... Full many a vice is born to thrive unseen , Full many a crime the world does not discuss , Full many a pervert lives to reach a green Replete old age , and so it was with us .

		Doubtless in this neglected spot is laid Some village
Nero	PERSON	who has missed his due , Some Bluebeard who dissected many a maid , And all for naught , since no one ever knew .

		Some poor bucolic
Borgia	PERSON	here may rest \ Vlmse poisons sent whole families to their doom , Some hayseed Herod who , within his breast , Concealed the sites of many an infant 's tomb .

		Types that the
Muse of Masefield	ORGANIZATION	might have stirred , Or waked to ecstasy
Gaboriau	PERSON	, Each in his narrow cell at last intern - .

ODELL SHEPARD	PERSON	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 21 The Swinburne Legend THE LIFE OF
ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE	PERSON	.

		By
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		It is probably wise for poets to die young .

		They are saved the ignominy of becoming fat and stolid , deaf and silent , self-centred and impolite .

		Their biographers escape the trouble of disinter - ring the good they did as well as of burying the immortal evil that lives after them .

		Young poets are personified romance ; all their deeds wear the enchanting garments lent by distance and legend .

		Byron , despite the aching hearts dangling on his watch chain , will always be the idol of Youth ;
Shelley	PERSON	's unquenchable idealism not only covers his few sins but actually explains the affair with
Harriet	PERSON	;
Keats	PERSON	's ashes rest in a Grecian urn , and already from the present chaos emerge the radiantly godlike figures of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	and
Alan Seeger	PERSON	.

		Each has his legend and no amount of scholarship can dim its ra - diance .

		Swinburne , too , had his legend , based , for lack of a biography , almost entirely upon his poetry .

		To his youthful worshippers , beyond the sacred pale of
London	LOCATION	literary circles , the author of `` Dplores '' and `` Faustine '' and `` Laus Veneris '' was the most frankly sensual of all English poets , pagan , unorthodox , and uncon - ventional ; a bit given to emphasizing the rap - tures and roses of vice rather than the languors and lilies of virtue .

		In spite of
Buchanan	PERSON	's ac - cusation of more than spiritual plagiarism from
Baudelaire	LOCATION	, in his articles labelling the Pre -
Raphaelites	PERSON	`` The Fleshly School , ''
Swinburne	PERSON	could not have lived a model Mid-Victorian ex - istence , said the youngsters .

		To his older , and perhaps wiser admirers , the author of `` The Hymn of Man '' and `` The Garden of Proser - pine '' was the poet of satiety and heresy , not pointing his moral , 't is true , but adorning his tale most seductively .

		The greybeards could hardly argue that he had depended entirely upon vicarious experience for the genuine feeling of worldweariness in the latter and the blasphemies shouted from the former .

		But to both , old and young , the man was dangerously synonymous with the poet .

		It was even mouthed about , especially at the time of
Watts-Dunton	ORGANIZATION	's death , that
Swinburne	PERSON	's muse was not wholly indepen - dent of stimulants somewhat more worldly than the nectar and ambrosia of
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	; and that only when the fires of youth had cooled and been most effectively banked by this very
Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	did babies ' feet and sea shells assume their famous fascination .

		There was no unim - peachable authority for all this gossip , nor for the insistent hypothesis that the author of `` Her - maphroditus '' was not so angelic as his Pre - Raphaelite brothers had painted him .

		At any rate , it all kept
Swinburne	PERSON	's legend alive , and his life tantalizingly interesting .

		Now comes Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's `` Life of
Algernon Charles Swinburne	PERSON	, '' pathetically at - tempting at one and the same time to invalidate our legend , or the profane legend evolved from the poetry , and to establish what to us is a new legend , the sacred legend of those who knew and loved
Swinburne	PERSON	the man .

		It is no strain on one 's mind or heart to appreciate Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's difficult position .

		He must serve God and
Mam	ORGANIZATION	- mon. .

		He was and is of those who wish Swin - burne were the `` young Apollo '' he looked , `` if only the weak mouth and the receding chin could be ignored . ''

		And yet , as biographer , he feels he must serve Truth , this time unhappily , it seems , on the side of the profane legend .

		For despite all his honorable efforts ,
Swinburne	PERSON	, `` our sad bad glad mad brother '' peeps through , elfin and human .

		The sacred legend it was that made it possible for
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, in his
Tokyo University	ORGANIZATION	lectures , about
1902	DATE	, to say : `` Swinburne is al - together an incomparably stronger character than
Shelley	PERSON	.

		He kept his radicalism for his poetry , and never in any manner outraged the conven - tions of society in such matters as might relate to his private life ...
Shelley	PERSON	, for example , is a very chaste poet , there is not one improper line in the whole of his poetry ; but his life was decidedly unfortunate .

		Exactly the reverse hap - pens in the case of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, who has written thousands of immoral lines . ''

		-LRB- The italics are mine ! -RRB-

		And the contented and reassured re - viewer of this present volume , in the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' puts on the finishing touch : `` To treat Swinburne in an official manner would be like breaking a bird of Paradise on the wheel ; and never for a moment has Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	attempted to do so .

		There is a
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	legend which would have been killed -LSB- again the italics are mine -RSB- by an official biography , but Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	authenticates it for us ; he convinces us that our most delightful dreams about the poet were true , and that the truth is even better than the dreams . ''

		Wherein we see the Mid-Victorian still stalking abroad in our land .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's volume is chronological and anec - dotal , there is hardly a page that is not enriched by some delightful incident or jest concerning
Swinburne	PERSON	's time and associates .

		The famous controversies are all recorded ;
Algernon	PERSON	's child - ish recantation of his early admiration for Arnold ,
Whitman	PERSON	, and
Whistler	LOCATION	, is regretfully admitted and in the two latter cases successfully shifted to
Watts-Dunton	ORGANIZATION	's shoulders ; and his notorious worship of Hugo ,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, and
Maz	PERSON	- zini is faithfully described and explained .

		There is , however , little or no criticism of the poems and no attempt to supply what many readers 22 mi : DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	would have expected and wished for , a psycho - logical analysis or at least commentary on the poet 's personality , such as might be used for a more complete understanding of his work .

		He skips and twitches , red-headed , through the pages , alternately raging mad and angelically quiet .

		But he does not live again .

		The reason for this , I think , will be found in Mr.
Gossc	PERSON	's determination to maintain the con - spiracy of silence , at which he is only half successful .

		It is , for example , rather deadly to be assured that
Swinburne	PERSON	was `` largely intellec - tual in his rebellious attitude to society '' and that `` his attitude of complacency with even what might be called British prejudice '' went so far as to deserve the term `` Jingo patriotism . ''

		And interest or curiosity is goaded into irritation by the
Muse of History	ORGANIZATION	`` drawing a veil '' whenever the biographer feels that the sacred legend is in danger .

		From
Eton	ORGANIZATION	to
Putney	LOCATION	one comes upon these shiftings .

		At
Eton	ORGANIZATION	`` Swinburne had in - creasing trouble with
Joynes	PERSON	-LSB- his tutor -RSB- of a rebellious kind and in consequence of some rep - resentations he did not return to
Eton	LOCATION	. ''

		`` Re - bellious '' is an innocent word , specific enough , but `` representations '' sounds strangely euphem - istical .

		One wonders .

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	`` On one occasion when Dr.
Acland	PERSON	was so kind as to read a paper on sew - age -LRB- ! -RRB-

		there was a scene over which the
Muse of History	ORGANIZATION	must draw a veil '' ; `` Swinburne 's conduct became turbulent and unseemly , he was looked upon as ` dangerous ' '' ; `` his extravagances were the cause of much annoyance to the au - thorities '' ; and he himself said : `` My Oxonian career culminated in total and scandalous fail - ure . ''

		But as to what his conduct or extrava - gances even might have been one is left with hardly a hint .

		With his departure from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and arrival in
London	LOCATION	the veil becomes an as - bestos curtain , retaining , however , the fatal peep-hole .

		Once the poet completely vanished ... but on this occasion and on others of a more or less dis - tressing kind the prodigal was found and restored to his lodgings ... but
Swinburne	PERSON	fell into the hands of other and later associates whose company was not ` always of advantage to him ... He seemed unable to resist succumbing to the most de - bilitating irregularities ... Unfortunately , during the
summer of 1870	DATE	, in circumstances which were widely related at the time , he had a difference with the
Committee of the Arts Club	ORGANIZATION	and he was asked to resign ; ... for from this time forth the dis - crepancy between his behavior in
London	LOCATION	and in the country became more remarkable than ever .

		It is not necessary to dwell on much that was distressing and even alarming , in his town habits ... In the
early summer of 1871	DATE	his extravagances reduced him to such a state of health that his father carried him off to
Holmwood	LOCATION	.

		When he meets
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	and records him as a `` harmless young nobody '' Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	remarks : nlniTiH-N life at the time little can be recorded , and less that is agreeable , '' and the
London	LOCATION	record closes with the report that the ` Months of
August	DATE	and
September 1879	DATE	were the most deplorable in his whole career . ''

		These admissions , vague though they are and scattered through the volume , unfortunately leave the sacred legend a little porous .

		No morbid curiosity is needed , and were it needed Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	himself excites it , to warrant the suspicion that
Swinburne	PERSON	knew enough of wine , women , and song to supply him with at least part of the local color so lavishly and ac - curately used in his first `` Poems and Ballads . ''

		One reads `` Laus Veneris '' and `` Dolores '' with quickened interest if with no more intimate knowledge .

		The feeling that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has * < > nsciously eliminated many details that seemed to violate the sacred legend is further justified by one or two items which might otherwise have passed unnoticed .

		On page 319 , in the first Ap - pendix , in a letter from Lord Redesdale one reads : `` his hair was red , violent , aggressive red it was , unmistakable , unpoetical carrots '' !

		On page 12 Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	quotes the letter as reading : `` red , violent , aggressive red it was , unmistak - able red , like burnished copper '' !!

		Now the sacred legend has it that
Swinburne	PERSON	's hair was an `` aureole '' ; obviously aureoles are not made from unpoetical carrots .

		That was a faux f > as on the part of
Lord Redesdale	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a characteristic letter from
George Moore	PERSON	, in Appendix III , one also finds an incident , and several lively comments on
Swinburne	PERSON	and his work , which one instantly recognizes as not worthy of a place in the body of the book .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	quotes Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's `` guarded and ironic sketch '' in `` The New Statesman '' of
March 25 , 1916	DATE	, and remarks that it `` deserves close attention '' ; but he seems himself to have read it somewhat hastily , for he neglects , in a very witty and amusing description of a visit to `` The Pines , '' this vivid and perhaps all too human picture of Swinburne : This , my first sight of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, I am not likely to forget , since various other preconceptions instantly crumbled away .

		For one thing , though he was as short as I had supposed , his body was by no means the inconsiderable affair that , from many testimonies , one had thought it .

		On the contrary , it was marked by solidity , and below the waist-line was not less ethereal than that of many a trencherman ... His face , too , which was highly colored , bore further signs that materialistic interests were not outside his scheme of life ... his whole person was in - formed by prandial intentions .

		It had neither vivac - ity nor spiritual suggestion ... What added the ultimate touch of unexpectedness was the fact that in his hand was a bottle of either beer or stout I forget which .

		Grasping this firmly in front of him the author of `` Atalanta in Calydon '' advanced to his chair at the dining table ... From the careful way in which he poured the fluid from his cherished
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 23 bottle , I gathered that that was his allowance and must be husbanded .

		And there will be few readers indeed who will finish this whole volume , and find , without surprise , that with the exception of one brief and unfortunate affair there is not one mention made nor hint given of love having entered Al - gernon
Charles Swinburne	PERSON	's life !

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's work speaks from the atmosphere of .

		intimacy , and in that position one can sym - pathetically understand the instinctive `` reticence , tact and diplomacy '' for which the English re - viewers are so heartily praising him .

		But as .

		an `` authentication '' of the sacred legend the vol - ume is not wholly successful .

		For , in spite of biographer and reviewers ,
Swinburne	PERSON	wrote and was unashamed of that unique volume , the first series of `` Poems and Ballads . ''

		The Zemstvo SELF-GOVERNMENT IN
RUSSIA	LOCATION	.

		By
Paul Vino	PERSON	- gradov .

		-LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Americans were unprepared for , and surprised by , the Russian Revolution of last
March	DATE	.

		Then they were skeptical as to its success , for they imagined that disorganization must follow the overthrow of an autocratic government that had held a monopoly of the administration of the vast country for many generations .

		How could the peasants get along without their Lit - tle Father ?

		Who would run the country now ?

		The
Duma	ORGANIZATION	had selected a Provisional Govern - ment from among its own members .

		The sol - diers and workmen of
Petrograd	LOCATION	had organized a
Council of Delegates	ORGANIZATION	to control and assist the new administration .

		But what would happen in the rest of the country ?

		Unfortunately the reports we have received of the progress of the Revolution have been con - fined for the most part to
Petrograd	LOCATION	and the sur - rounding districts .

		Moreover , the news from other parts of the country has touched par - ticularly on those elements working for disrup - tion which inevitably came to the surface at such a moment .

		But the predicted `` breakdown '' has not actually come .

		The Russian leaders themselves constantly spoke of impending dis - aster ; they were speaking , however , to their own people in an effort to secure greater unity and to discredit irresponsible agitators .

		But their statements seemed to justify the gloomiest ap - prehensions .

		Very quickly , however , and with remarkably little serious friction , the readjustment from au - tocratic rule to popular government took place .

		Within three months the food problem , which was the immediate cause of the Revolution but which was a question of distribution and not of actual supply , had become less acute .

		Within three months one heard that the army had been well equipped and that a Russian offensive was to be expected .

		The political crises that natur - ally accompanied the Revolution were safely weathered and a coalition cabinet was formed that united politically all classes .

		Only the workmen of factories in and around
Petrograd	LOCATION	were slow to fall into line , but
Petrograd	LOCATION	has always been the centre of intrigues .

		Americans wondered how the readjustment had been accomplished , for they had heard little of the ancient self-governing institutions of Rus - sia , which have been concealed by the bureau - cracy with its police and
Cossack	ORGANIZATION	methods of governing .

		Americans knew little of the village system of
Russia	LOCATION	, by which the peasants , even in the times of serfdom , enjoyed a considerable measure of self-government .

		We were only vaguely aware of the existence of
Zemstvos Russia	LOCATION	's - elected local councils , which had been gradually taking over the functions of govern - ment .

		When the Revolution was announced from
Petrograd	LOCATION	, the Municipal Councils in all the large cities arrested , and then assumed the functions of , the local bureaucrats .

		As a matter of fact those functions had been little more than that of maintaining order , the local government bodies having already assumed government func - tions several months before the actual Revolu - tion .

		In the country districts the provincial councils formally announced what had been a fact for some time that they were the local authorities .

		By a simple order from the new Premier the five hundred Zemstvo presidents , the elected governors , replaced the `` police '' gov - ernors and their subordinates .

		In the villages the peasants simply drove out the police and as - sumed responsibility for public order , acting through their village assemblies and their elders .

		Within three months the peasantry of
Russia	LOCATION	was assembled in a representative
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, reg - ularly elected through tlje already existing peas - ant self-governing bodies .

		Last
summer	DATE	I had occasion to show to an American visiting and studying
Russia	LOCATION	some - thing of the work of `` self-governing ''
Russia	LOCATION	.

		We went out to the rural districts , using the well-paved Zemstvo roads , visiting Zemstvo schools , inspecting model farms established by the
Zemstvo	PERSON	of the district , and noting par - ticularly the hospitals equipped and conducted by the Zemstvo .

		We stepped into a cooperative store organized by the peasants on their own initiative , with some slight encouragement from the
Zemstvo	LOCATION	.

		The idea of cooperation is very strong among the peasants ; for many years a communal system of land tenure was the pre - vailing tradition among the peasants of Great THE DIAL -LSB-
June	DATE	2S
Russia	LOCATION	.

		After he had seen rural
Russia	LOCATION	and
Zemstvo Russia	LOCATION	, my friend was more ready to believe that another
Russia	LOCATION	would soon emerge .

		Until that trip he had known only bureaucratic
Russia	LOCATION	and the official
Russia	LOCATION	of
Petrograd	LOCATION	.

		The Revolution of last
March	DATE	was the work of
Zemstvo Russia	LOCATION	, supported by
Municipal Russia	LOCATION	and by the soldiers , workmen , and peas - ants .

		The soldiers were organized in their reg - iments .

		The peasants could act and speak through their village assemblies and also through the Zemstvo , on which they have their elected representatives .

		The workmen of
Russia	LOCATION	had suffered most under the arbitrary , bureaucratic police regime , and they had not been able to train themselves in local self-government .

		Con - sequently they have been slower to realize the responsibilities involved in the Revolution .

		The
Zemstvo	PERSON	is the most vital of the self-government bodies of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It was not by accident that the man selected to head the new government was Prince
Lvov	LOCATION	, the elected leader of
Zemstvo Russia	LOCATION	, the President of the `` All-Russian Union of Zemstvos . ''

		In his short but excellent account of `` Self - Government in
Russia	LOCATION	'' Professor Vinogradov , writing before the Revolution , prophesies that ``
Russia	LOCATION	is emerging from the background of
Europe	LOCATION	through self-government . ''

		Had we more generally known the facts given in this book , we should have understood how the Rev - olution came about and why it was so orderly and effective .

		The last phrase of the author has particular force just now .

		After summariz - ing what
Russia	LOCATION	has accomplished in the field of local self-government , he says : `` No one will have the right to speak contemptuously hence - forth of the lack of initiative or the inability of the Russians to manage corporate affairs . ''


SAMUEL N. HARPER	PERSON	.

		The Immanence of Dostoevsky THE ETERNAL HUSBAND .

		By
Fyodor Dostoevsky	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		It is impossible not to think of Dostoevsky as a living author when his books come regularly , as they are coming , to the American public every few months .

		Our grandfathers sixty years ago are said to have lived their imaginative lives in anticipation of the next instalment of Dickens or
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		I can feel somewhat of the same excitement in this Dostoevsky stream , though I can not pretend that the great Russian will ever become a popular American classic .

		Yet in the progress from
Dickens	LOCATION	to Dostoevsky there is a symbol of the widening and deepening of the American imagination .

		We are adrift on a far wider sea than our forefathers .

		We are far more adventurous in personal relations , far more aware of the bewildering variousness of human nature .

		If you have once warmed to
Dostoev	PERSON	- sky , you can never go back to the older classic fiction on which we were brought up .

		The lack of nuance , the hideous normality , of its people begins to depress you .

		When once you have a sense of the illusion of `` character , '' when once you have felt the sinister , irrational turn < > t human thoughts , and the subtle interplay of impression and desire , and the crude impinge - ment of circumstance , you find yourself unless yeu keep conscious watch feeling a shade of contempt for the
Scott	PERSON	and Balzac and
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	and Trollope who were the au - thoritative showmen of life for our middle-class relatives .

		You relegate such fiction to the level of `` movie '' art , with its clean , pigeonholed cate - gories of the emotions , and its `` registering '' of a few simple moods .

		You will , of course , be wrong in any such contempt , because these novelists show a bewild - ering variety of types and a deep intuition of the major movements of the soul .

		Dickens teems with irrational creatures , with unconventional levels of life .

		But you can scarcely contradict me when I say that neither
Dickens	PERSON	nor his readers ever forgot that these human patterns were queer .

		His appeal lies exactly in the joy - ful irrelevance with which we take all these lapses from the norm , in the pitiful tears which we can shed for human beings done so obvioush as they should not be done by .

		In reading these familiar novelists we never lose our moral land - marks .

		No matter how great the deviations a character shows , we are alwa \ ^ conscious or could be conscious if we liked of the exact amount of that deviation .

		The charm of that nineteenth-century fiction , as in the work of be - lated Victorians like Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, lay in that duality between the sane and the insane , the virtuous and the villainous , the sober and the mischievous , the responsible and the irrespon - sible .

		There was no falsification in this .

		These novelists were writing for an epoch that really had stable `` character , '' standards , morals , that consistently saw the world in a duality of body and spirit .

		They were a reflection of a class that really had reticences , altruisms , and religious codes .

		Dostoevsky appeals to us to-day because we arc trying to close up that dualism .

		And our appreciation of him and the other modern Rus - sians is a mark of how far we have actually gone .

		It is still common to call this fiction unhealthy , morbid , unwholesome .

		All that is meant by this is that the sudden shock of a democratic , unified , intensely feeling and living outlook is so severe to the mind that thinks in the old dual terms as to be almost revolting .

		What becomes more
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 25 and more apparent to the readers of
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	, however , is his superb modern healthiness .

		He is healthy because he is not afraid of life as it is actually lived , in its unsatisfactoriness and its aspiration and its queer blindnesses .

		He is healthy because he has no sense of any dividing line between the normal and the abnormal , or even between the sane and the insane .

		I call this healthy because it is so particularly salutary for our American imagination to be jolted out of its stiltedness and preconceived notions of human psychology .

		I admit that the shock is somewhat rough and rude .

		`` The Idiot , '' which I have read only once , remains in my mind as a stream of fairly incomprehensible people and un - intelligible emotional changes .

		Yet I feel that when I read it again I shall understand it .

		For
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	has a strange , intimate power which breaks in your neat walls and shows you how much more subtle and inconsequent your flowing life is than even your introspection had thought .

		But for all his subtlety he is the reverse of any - thing morbidly introspective .

		He is introspection turned inside out .

		For self-analysis is only tor - turing and unhealthy when you are conscious of an I which analyzes a Me .

		But suppose you can merge the I and the Me so that you get the full warm unity of emotional life without losing any of the detail of the understanding analysis of the soul .

		This astounding mergence
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	actually seems to achieve .

		This is what gives him the intimate power which distinguishes every story of his from anything else you ever read .

		Again he contrasts with the classical novelists .

		For they are quite palpably outside their subjects .

		You are never unaware of the author as telling the story .

		He has always the air of the show - man , unrolling his drama before your eyes .

		His characters may be infinitely warm and human , but the writer himself is somehow not in them .

		`` Wuthering Heights '' is the only story I think of that has something of this fierce , absorbed in - tensity of
Dostoevsky 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the great Russian you lose all sense of the showman .

		The writer is himself the story ; he is inextricably in it .

		In stories like `` The Double '' or `` A Gentle Spirit , '' in this volume , immanence could go no further .

		The story seems to tell itself .

		Its strange , breathless intimacy of mood follows faithfully every turn and quirk of thought and feeling .

		Its tempo is just of that inner life we know , with its ceaseless boring into the anxious future and its trails of the unresolved past .

		These stories fol - low just that fluctuating line of our conscious life with its depressions and satisfactions , its striving always for a sense of control , its uneasi - ness .

		In
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's novels it is not only the author that is immanent .

		The reader also is absorbed .

		After reading `` Crime and Punish - ment '' you are yourself the murderer .

		For days the odor of guilt follows you around .

		The ex - travaganza of `` The Double '' pursues you like a vivid dream of your own .

		All of
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's qualities are in this latest volume , `` The Eternal Husband . ''

		But so con - centrated are they that the Dostoevsky novice would better begin with that poignant , but less extravagant , story , `` The Insulted and Injured , '' or that epic of frustrated aspiration , `` The
Brothers Karamazov	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The first story in this new volume is about a man who is eternally doomed to be a cuckold , and is told by one of the dead wife 's lovers .

		The poor husband has neither the strength of revenge nor the stolidity of adjustment , and pursues a frantic course be - tween them .

		He is so much a victim that his utter debasement takes on a pathetic irony which is the more vivid for the impersonal , reliant scorn of the narrating lover .

		Mr.
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	is said to find humor in the book , but it is only the mirthless humor of irony that is all through
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		The second story , `` The Double , '' is an amaz - ing record of the feverish rush of a mind on * the borderline of insanity .

		Yet it is so human in its subtle tracing of the weary mind trying to catch up with a world which ever grows too much for it , that we take it not as a pathological incident but as a deep poem of the human spirit .

		This is somehow ourselves in our uncomfortable col - lisions with the world .

		We understand anew that sanity is merely a matter of keeping our vagaries hidden .

		The third story , `` A Gentle Spirit , '' tells of a sinister marriage and the de - struction of a girl 's soul by a man , not through malice but through sheer ineptness .

		The analysis is amazing , the husband 's clutching justification of his attitude , which he knows is wrong , the fatal conflict between his habit-will and his generous inclinations .

		Such stories , however fantastic the problems of the soul , get deeply into us .

		We can not ignore them , we can not take them irresponsibly .

		We can not read them for amusement , or even in detachment , as we can our classics .

		We forget our categories , our standards , our notions of human nature .

		All we feel is that we are tracing the current of life itself .

		Dostoevsky is so much in his stories that we get no sense of his attitude toward his characters or of his crit - icism of life .

		Yet the after-impression is one of rich kindness , born of suffering and imperfec - tion , and of a truly religious reverence for all living experience .

		Man as a being with his feet in the mud and his gaze turned toward the stars , yet always indissolubly one in feet and eyes and heart and brain !

		If we are strong enough to hear him , this is the decisive force we need on our American creative outlook .

		26 TIIK DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	CASUAL , COMMI v i THE COMMENCEMENTS OF
1917	DATE	have taken on a tone of their own .

		Previous Junes ha \ r brought forth conventional essays and orations about the `` struggle '' and the `` conflict '' from students , and perfunctory expressions of good will and good hope from presidents , principals , and headmasters .

		This season our youths have been taking their degrees and diplomas in khaki or other significant uniform ; and the observa - tions and admonitions of their instructors have exhibited both the actuality of the familiar struggle and the scant lapse of time between the departure from the academic atmosphere and the entrance into conflict in real and literal earnest .

		Elder men have set forth the gratitude due the country for opportunities and privileges enjoyed , and younger men have soberly acknowledged the obligation and have promptly set about to dis - charge it .

		Education , whatever its previous shortcomings in regard to a coordination of the nation 's energies and aspirations and to a revival of the ancient pieties and immemorial decorums , has * advanced greatly toward the goal during the month just ending .

		A NEW IDEA IN BOOK-SELLING comes from a department-store is
Des Moines	LOCATION	, which , in or - der to render its staff of salesmen more alert and better informed , has prepared for their study a list of two-hundred-and-odd questions relating to their stock in particular and to the literary sit - uation in general .

		A dozen of these items , taken decimally , will serve to indicate what the Per - fect Salesman should know : Name three famous cartoonists , and state what works of each of these we have in stock .

		What was
Booth Tarkington	ORGANIZATION	's last book ?

		How does Hugo differ from
Balzac	LOCATION	and
Dumas	PERSON	?

		Name an important book by each .

		What have you in stock for a child three years old ?

		For a child twelve years old ?

		How many books in the Elsie Series ?

		Name three books in stock for children about five years old , costing from
$ 1.50	MONEY	to
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		What is blank verse ?

		Is
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	still living ?

		What did he write ?

		Has Lord Dunsany a forthcoming book ?

		What is the latest edition of
Holt	PERSON	's `` Care and Feeding of Children '' ?

		Have you a medical dictionary ?

		Is it re - cent ?

		Authentic ?

		Have you a book of instruction for wait - resses ?

		And so on , down to items 226 and 227 , which are : `` Can you make five suggestions for the betterment of the department in general ? ''

		and .

		`` Tell what they are and ho \ v thev will improve our service or increase business . ''

		Says the in - genious manager of the book department and author of this new `` booksellers ' school '' : `` Al - though we have been using these questions only about a month , 1 have noticed not only an in - creased alertness on the part of the clerks , but also a desire to know more about the publica - tions they are selling or hope to sell in the future . ''

		Book-buying in
Des Moines	LOCATION	ought to be a real pleasure .

		* THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE READING OF BOOKS receives a side-lighting from an article by an English publisher which recently appeared in the `` Publisher 's Weekly . ''

		The writer is of course young , or he would have remained silent ; and of course successful , or no paean would have ensued .

		He seems to have been successful be - cause he took a sound line and stuck close to it .

		He waived aside the notion that for a time people would not read .

		How , in fact , could a non - reading civilized world be , in any circumstances , conceived ?

		L'appetit vlent en mangeant .

		The mental stomach , distended by the long habit of reading , can not but continue to call for the sus - tenance of the printed sheet .

		It may call for sustenance different in nature , but not less in amount .

		Our publisher chose his books with an eye to current conditions ; the usual demand would be modified in character by the experi - ences through which
England	LOCATION	was passing .

		He printed larger editions , advertised more widely , pushed along his `` travellers '' more vigorously , and won out .

		Reading is the modern refuge and the modern dissipation ; and , with so many of the more elaborate and more expensive forms of indulgence curtailed or suppressed , it is likely , under intelligent guidance , fully to hold its own .

		NEW COMPETITION FOR THE NOVELIST , al - ready harassed and hardpressed , is threatened .

		Time was when he had to struggle only against his contemporaries , native and foreign , against the classics established in previous centuries , and against the creators of recently expired copy - rights with their concomitants of library `` sets '' manufactured and vended as mere merchandise .

		The dead were dead , and save for a too abun - dant reproduction of their words were silent .

		There was a time when , if the brains were out .

		.

		But that condition no longer obtains .

		Even the dead seem to have regained the creative plane and to show a disposition toward acti \ r competition with the living .

		For example , here comes `` Patience Worth . ''

		Once she was content with writing bits of verse and of homily .

		Hut now .

		.

		uvonling to announcement , she is bringing out a novel one of 300,000 words .

		Like her other work , it comes to our mundane circles via
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 27 the ouija board all its vast expressiveness hav - ing been laboriously spelled out by the Mrs. Cur - ran who has acted on previous occasions .

		The ghostly romancer has chosen for her period the early years of our era , and for her title , `` A Sorry Tale '' : her protagonist is the impenitent thief of the Crucifixion .

		It is said also that a second novel , `` A Merry Tale , '' descriptive of life in `` Patience 's '' own period , the
seventeenth century	DATE	, has progressed already beyond 20,000 words .

		But , after all , is the novelty , however great , com - plete ?

		Does it come unique and virginal ?

		There was
Coleridge	PERSON	, who `` did not write `
Kubla Khan	PERSON	, ' > : but only `` wrote it down . ''

		Yet `` Alph , the sacred river , '' however mysterious its course , never `` ran '' to 300,000 words .

		A SIGNIFICANT COMPARISON is drawn by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	in his latest report of the
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	,
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		That library , with its nine branches and its many departments of activity and usefulness , costs its community
$ 150,000	MONEY	a year .

		With this income it puts into circulation more than a million books , receives and , if desired , ministers to more than a million visitors , and provides facilities for the same num - ber of readers in its reference department ; also it buys nearly 30,000 new books in the same annual period , receives 1,200 periodicals , main - tains a clipping bureau and a large picture col - lection , houses the
Newark Museum	ORGANIZATION	, sends out more than three hundred class-room libraries , an - swers seven thousand telephone calls for informa - tion , gives instruction in the use of its facilities , and does much else of a useful nature besides and all , be it noted again , on
$ 150,000	MONEY	a year .

		The public schools , which offer service to a much smaller portion of the community call for an annual expenditure of more than
three million dollars	MONEY	, even though the parochial and other non - public schools of the city care for eighteen thou - sand pupils at no expense to the municipality .

		A striking comparison , or contrast , might also have been drawn between the modest annual sum spent on the library and that required to maintain the police force and the municipal courts .

		Not long ago a city alderman in a west - ern state where strikes had been prevalent urged that the customary library appropriation be used for additional police service , on the ground that abstention from reading would be preferable to a reign of crime .

		Curiously enough , a newspaper of a neighboring city -LRB- where strike riots had actually occurred -RRB- was at the same time urging an increase in the library appropriation because `` books are better than policemen under such con - ditions . ''

		It is safe to say that the public library is in no danger of apoplexy from too generous feeding at the public crib .

		LIGHT FROM THE EAST , and light on the
East	LOCATION	, such is the double promise conveyed by the announcement of the founding of an English weekly review in
Shanghai	LOCATION	.

		The new publica - tion will be known as `` Millard 's Review , '' and will be edited and published by
Thomas F. Mil	PERSON	- lard , known for years as a war correspondent of American newspapers and magazines , and more recently as editor of the `` China Press '' and author of books dealing with questions be - tween the Far East and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The East promises or threatens to loom still big - ger within the next few years , and any aid ex - plaining the Orient to the Occident and tending to bring about better relations between the two can not but be welcome .

		DISCOVERING THE PRESENT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		An unexpected result of this flood of war is our willing confinement to the present .

		Before
August , 1914	DATE	we had a genial interest in the books and men of the past ; for many of us their appeal was so stirring that they constituted our true spiritual life .

		The present had indeed its legitimate place in our hearts .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Wells	LOCATION	,
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	could not fail to fascinate us , and Brieux ,
France	LOCATION	,
Bergson	PERSON	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, d'Annunzio from abroad proved for us the immortal vitality of lit - erature .

		In art futurism shouted rebellion against the primacy of beauty .

		In science improvement followed improvement in the tools and materiel of civilization .

		Political history had its perennial in - terest .

		We read eagerly of
Lloyd George	PERSON	and the lords , of French conservatism hoping much from President
Poincare	PERSON	, of blustering Prussian officers abusing cobblers in
Alsace	LOCATION	who could not forget la
France	LOCATION	, of the scholar-president of the greatest republic and his zeal for democracy , of wretched
Mexico	LOCATION	sunken in feuds .

		This present was ours and we were glad to be alive in it ; but it was not the capital fact in our lives .

		The present was simply a half-century which 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 28	DATE	we beheld in the flesh .

		Our hearts and minds dwelt in the past and drew their nourishment from its great names and achievements .

		The French revolutionists and their forerunners who fought for Reason , the urban literature of the grand siicle , the poetic civilization of the Middle Ages , the human Italians of the Renaissance , the deeps we sounded with
Plato , Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Kant	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the heavenly beauty that Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	,
Saxon	PERSON	, and Arab had put upon earth , the whole treasure of
England	LOCATION	, mother of our culture these , and much else of the past , were our favored inter - ests .

		We meant to be the contemporaries of all humanity , and to choose the time as well as the place of our residence among men .

		But the present has become hypnotically , mag - netically insistent , and the past has gone clean out of our minds .

		It has become a memory , put away from everyday thinking , like early happenings in our lives still possessing some influence but not often the object of our attention .

		We shall never again live and think as we did before
August , 1914	DATE	; our interests have veered too far from where they were .

		Who will read the old books again without this war 's ideas for the guide of his reaction ?

		Who will write again , who will cher - ish and practise culture without the apostasy of
Germany	LOCATION	in mind ?

		The present has conquered us all .

		Whatever we do and think of moment dur - ing this generation will come from this tremendous battle for Right .

		The world is born again , and we are the first who shall speak and act in the new age to be !

		It is a rare privilege thus to live in the youth of a period , and to be something more than its late-born commentators .


GEORGE A. UNDERWOOD	PERSON	.


Smith College	ORGANIZATION	,
June 2O	DATE	,
MR. DREISER	PERSON	AND `` CELESTINA . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I ask for space in your columns to thank Mr.
Louis	PERSON	How for so courteously calling my at - tention -LRB- in THE DIAL of
May 31	DATE	-RRB- to the old Spanish dramatic novel `` Celestina , '' which he thinks offers a parallel to Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's device of shifting the scene from speech to speech in his plays .

		In a review of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's plays I had rashly remarked that , so far as I knew , this de - vice was new even in closet drama .

		In the face of
Solomon	PERSON	and his successors -LRB- among whom Mr. How will surely forgive me for ranking him -RRB- it is always highly indiscreet to say that anything is new .

		When I made the remark , I was not think - ing of mediaeval drama , in which various places were represented simultaneously on the stage ; I was thinking of modern drama , of which Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's plays are very interesting examples .

		If Mr. How wished to attack my obiter dictum on the ground that mediirval dramatists seem to use something like Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's device , he might have found much better examples than `` Celestina . ''

		For , in the first place , it is perhaps worth noting that the classification of `` Celestina '' is doubtful .

		The balance of authority , so far as I can discover , seems to favor classifying it as a novel rather than as a pl ; i \ .

		Thus Fit/mauricc
Kelly	PERSON	-LRB- `` A Histoi Spanish Literature /
Nrw York	LOCATION	,
1902	DATE	, p. 125 -RRB- : `` This remarkable book ... has been classed as a play , or as a novel in dialogue ... Its influence is most marked on the novel . ''


Martin Hume	PERSON	-LRB- `` Spanish Influence on English Literature , ''
London	LOCATION	,
1905	DATE	-RRB- discusses `` Celestina '' in his chapter on the novel , and says -LRB- p. 249 -RRB- , `` It was , to all intents and purposes , a novel in dramatic form . ''

		Professor
Ward	PERSON	-LRB- `` History of English Dramatic Literature , '' I , 232 -RRB- calls it `` a dramatic novel of intrigue and character . ''

		Mr. How need have gone no further than the English miracle plays to find examples of the kind of apparent shifting of scene from speech to spcch which he refers to in `` Celestina . ''

		And these examples would have served his purpose better , because they occur in undoubted acting plays .

		But neither `` Celestina '' nor any other mediaeval drama , so far as I know , really offers a fair par - allel to Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's kaleidoscopic scene shifts .

		The mediaeval stage made use of what is now called `` multiple setting , '' that is -LRB- I quote Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	's `` Shakespeare 's Theatre , '' p. 11 -RRB- , `` in general the medieval performance ... repre - sented different places at the same time by means of properties , and used the neutral unpropertied space to represent all other places . ''

		It is only from our modern point of view that the scene seems to shift from speech to speech as we read these plays ; really the several scenes were all rep - resented simultaneously by the `` multiple setting . ''

		The contemporary reader of a piece like ``
Celes	PERSON	- tina '' would read with this `` multiple setting '' stage in mind , and what seem to us shifts of scene would mean to him merely changes from one `` station '' on the stage to another , such as he had often wit - nessed in acted drama .

		He would have all the scenes before his mind 's eye all the time , so that no mental readjustment would be necessary when the action or dialogue moved to a different `` station . ''

		The reader of closet drama to-day reads with our `` single setting '' stage in mind ; and each shift of scene will involve for him a mental readjustment .

		When Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	takes him in successive speeches from Mrs.
Delavan	PERSON	's kitchen to her front yard , and then to the cab of a locomotive a hundred miles away , he is likely to be confused and wearied by the rapid imaginative readjustments necessary ; at the very least , his attention will be distracted from the action and main business of the play .

		And this , I still believe , is a source of fatal weakness .

		Finally , I can not refrain from remarking that in his anxiety properly to castigate my ignorance , Mr. How extravagantly overestimates the literary value of `` Celestina . ''

		Historically , of course , its importance is very great , and intrinsically its merit is considerable ; but to call it .

		as Mr.
How	PERSON	does , `` one of the few most alive of the supreme works of art
Europe	LOCATION	has produced '' is to give it equal rank with the Iliad , the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, and Hamlet .

		I am sorry to have been the unwitting occasion of anyone 's making so serious a critical blunder .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 29 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS PICTURES OF WAR WORK IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	may always be counted upon to lay his finger upon the significant aspects of what - ever he chooses as subject for his pencil .

		Where most artists have the `` seeing eye '' only for the decorative , Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's sense of selection is of a different order ; with him beauty and human ac - tivity are interdependent , and of recent years he has never given us an impression of beauty as the artist in him sees it , without also giving us a very powerful comment on life as the caustic-witted philosopher in him sees it .

		In the present volume of drawings he has laid his finger upon the one outstanding feature of the present war its indus - trial ramifications .

		Looking over these drawings , all of which have that feeling of `` sociological beauty '' which characterizes his work , one be - comes conscious of the absence of human beings .

		These are drawings of machines , of factories , of furnaces , and wherever human beings appear , they are grimy dregs scattered like coal dust entirely without significance .

		That is his interpretation of the present war a battle of the mechanical Genii which have been evolved by human ingenuity , now become our masters and destroyers .

		This interpretation is borne out by the brusque words commenting upon each drawing .

		There is much in this volume which it would be well for every American to ponder .

		AN UNCENSORED DIARY .

		By
Ernesta Drinker Bullitt	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		JOURNAL OF SMALL THINGS .

		By
Helen Mac	PERSON	-
Kay	PERSON	.

		Duffield ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		Two diaries of the war recently published , both by women , suggest many ideas concerning the art of the diarist , particularly the attitude of the writer toward his record .

		The first of these diaries , `` An Uncensored Diary , '' is intended to be no more than an objective account of incidents , persons , and impressions , written with a definite public in mind .

		As a piece of journalistic record it is interesting .

		The second diary ,
Helen Mac	PERSON	- kay 's `` Journal of Small Things , '' possesses the subtle charm of the diary in its highest form .

		Something of the intimate mood inspiring this record is expressed in the opening lines : `` I have so strange a feeling , a sense of its being the end of things .

		The end of I do n't know what .

		I want to make note of things , not of the great things that are happening , but of the little things .

		I want to feel especially all the little everyday dear accustomed things , to take hold of the moods of them , and gather up their memories , to be put away and kept , and turned back to always after - ward . ''

		It is easy to see , and remember , the big things ; it is not until it is too late that we realize that the small details , the seemingly unessential , were the significant and precious things of bygone days .

		In these pages one follows the changes since
1914	DATE	the first spectral rumors that penetrated the old chateau , the futile attempts to discredit the reports , the clinging to the old , secure serenity of peace , the bewildered abandonment of all that was familiar , the calm acceptance of the unrealities of war , the unconscious adjustments .

		This is the record of a spiritual development , and it is by far the most impressive , the most poignant which this reviewer has yet found in the mass of war litera - ture .

		It is a volume to be read and reread , and always to be kept near at hand .

		INSIDE THE GERMAN EMPIRE .

		By
Herberc Bayard Swope	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		No reader of this excellent book will be sur - prised to know that it has been given the
$ 1000	MONEY	Pulitzer Prize for the best piece of reporting done during the year .

		Mr.
Swope	PERSON	is more than a good reporter .

		He has performed a statesmanlike serv - ice in putting before American readers a fair - minded analysis of the attitude of the German people toward the outside world in this momentous time .

		Especially interesting just now is Mr.
Swope	PERSON	's description of the feeling toward peace .

		He is quite sure that the German people want peace .

		He believes that they are tired of war and ready to forego some of their earlier hopes .

		He does not think , however , that any important class in
Germany	LOCATION	would accept peace on ignominious terms ; and he therefore concludes that few be - lieve it will soon come .

		For instance , the Ger - mans to a man are determined to oppose the cession of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	.

		Regarding
Belgium	LOCATION	there is a divided opinion , but Mr.
Swope	PERSON	believes that the majority of enlightened Germans favors the reestablishment of the neighbor king - dom .

		In this connection , it is a little surprising to find Mr.
Swope	PERSON	declaring that Germans do not underestimate the danger of their position , that they realize that if the war is carried to the end , they must lose .

		Their main hope , he says , lies in two possibilities first , in the defection of
Russia	LOCATION	, and second , in the liberalizing of the German Em - pire .

		The first is the more pleasing prospect to Germans .

		-LRB- This was before the Russian Revolu - tion . -RRB-

		They have an interesting theory that
Russia	LOCATION	may be drawn away from the Entente , and with
Japan	LOCATION	, who is supposed to hate
America	LOCATION	, join
Germany	LOCATION	against the coming Anglo-American alli - ance .

		Mr.
Swope	PERSON	himself , however , seems more interested in the liberal movement already under way among thinking Germans .

		The main objec - tion to its potency as a peace factor , he thinks , is the belief among Germans that it would appear to be forced upon them by a victorious enemy .

		They are therefore careful to state that the change is to come after the war .

		Mr.
Swope	PERSON	feels safe in saying , however , that the movement for a respon - sible popular government may gain ascendency be - fore peace arrives .

		One is tempted to quote freely from such a book .

		It is better , however , to recommend it heartily to the reader .

		It covers much more ground than this review has touched , and it gives Americans a view of the German people , which in vision , lack of bias , and kindly feeling could hardly be surpassed .

Beethoven	PERSON	as a sub - ject to inspire , one expects a great treat .

		After arousing such anticipations , the present volume is rather a disappointment ; of its 244 pages only 54 are given to
M. Holland	PERSON	's sketch of the com - poser 's life .

		As a character study it is far from satisfying , containing nothing new in fact or inter - pretation .

		The rest of the book seems like too evident an attempt to fill up space , good as part of the material is .

		The most interesting section is an analysis of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's symphonies , sonatas , and string quartets , the work of Dr.
Hull	PERSON	.

		The chief value of the book is as an introduction to the study of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and in this respect the copy of his will , a selection of his letters , a bibliography , and the complete list of his compositions are useful .

		GREATER
ITALY	LOCATION	.

		By
William Kay Wallace	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Events of a decade preceding the world war pointed to
Italy	LOCATION	as the European nation whose ambition ran most frankly in the direction of ter - ritorial expansion ; and it was primarily to gain territory that the kingdom , after long wavering , broke with its allies and entered the present con - flict .

		In his `` Greater
Italy	LOCATION	'' Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	traces the Italian expansionist movement from its mid - century beginnings to the year
1917	DATE	, and in doing so he describes the forces working to produce the original unification of the country and sketches the whole sweep of Italian political history since the rise of
Cavour	LOCATION	.

		The
Italy	LOCATION	which the world best knows is the
Italy	LOCATION	of intellect , of art , of re - ligion , of literature , of romance .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	portrays the
Italy	LOCATION	of politics , of diplomacy , of war , of realism .

		His task has been attempted before , with much success by
King	ORGANIZATION	and Okey and by Un - derwood .

		But the developments of the past two years afford excellent opportunity to paint the pic - ture afresh and on a larger canvas .

		For
Italy	LOCATION	's part in the present struggle , the author finds pe - culiar historical justification .

		The Italians , in his opinion , are the people who `` blazed the trail of national , racial unity , and set the world thinking along the lines of nationality '' ; and the European war `` is a struggle for the preservation of this principle . ''


Italy	LOCATION	's own immediate object is to gain for herself the Trentino ,
Trieste	LOCATION	, and every re - maining * part of Italia irredenta , so that she may attain a fulness of national and racial unity which the events of 1859-66 denied her .

		This is not materialism or sordid aggrandizement .

		It is not merely square miles of land , larger resources , more material for armies , and more taxpayers that the kingdom is fighting for ; she is fighting for the right of the large Italian populations on her bor - ders to become again a part of their own people , and for equivalent rights for Poles and Serbs and every broken and divided people of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	has spent some time with the troops on the various Italian fronts , and he describes in lucid and restrained manner the difficulties and triumphs of the operations against the Austrians .

		His book IN well written , although there is an occasional in - exact statement .

		It would be truer , for example , to say of the papal Non Expedit that Pius X made provision for occasional suspension of the decree rather than that he `` withdrew it . ''

		THE PUBLIC DEFENDER .

		By
Mayer C. Gold	ORGANIZATION	- man .

		Putnam ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		One of the many points at which we have awakened to the inadequacy of our historic in - stitutions reveals itself in the growing conscious - ness of the need for reform of our criminal laws .

		Their roots lie far back in mediaeval history , and there has been too little overhauling of them in recent times to meet the growing needs of our complex social , economic , and political life .

		One of the more promising attacks upon the problem of criminal procedure within the last few years has been the growing demand for a public defender , whose duties would be complementary to those of the public prosecutor .

		That the old system of leaving the defendant to depend wholly upon paid or assigned counsel is unfair to those with limited means is made quite clear by Mr.
Goldman	PERSON	.

		Equally well does he make his point that , con - trary to the opinion of some enthusiasts , the public prosecutor is not in a position to perform ade - quately the functions of attorney for the prosecu - tion and for the defence .

		Besides the benefits which should accrue to the defendant from the services of the public defender , there are also some conspic - uous civic advantages .

		Mr.
Goldman	PERSON	calls attention especially to the fact that chicanery and manu - factured defences will be decreased .

		Unfair dis - crimination would be eliminated through having the state officially concerned in the defence ; there would be less likelihood of cases dragging out in - definitely on technicalities .

		At the same time in - vestigation of evidence should be facilitated , trial expenses decreased , the morale of the courts im - proved , and popular respect for our machinery of justice increased .

		Mr.
Goldman	PERSON	writes his book as a partisan of the movement .

		In fact , this mon - ograph came out of his practical labors on com - mittees and in other publicity efforts on behalf of the movement .

		A valuable feature of the book is an appendix giving the chronology of the movement in this country and setting forth the most impor - tant facts regarding its present employment .

		THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND
NAPOLEON	PERSON	.

		By
Charles Downer Hazen	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		In this volume Professor
Hazen	PERSON	has brought to - gether , `` for the convenience of those who may wish to review this memorable and instructive pe - riod , '' the chapters dealing with it in his `` Modern European History , '' a book recently prepared for use in college classes .

		For general readers whose interest in history has been stimulated by the Great War , no period of the past is better worth attention .

		The revolutionary and Napoleonic wars not only offer many striking analogies with the present conflict , but they furnish the necessary starting point , unless one is prepared to begin with the Roman Empire , for any historical explanation of the present situation .

		From
1793	DATE	to
1815	DATE	,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 31
France	LOCATION	was almost constantly at war with one or more of the European states .

		When invaded ,
France	LOCATION	professed to be fighting for independence ; when success carried her arms abroad , she often announced herself the predestined bearer of a superior civilization to backward peoples .

		The al - lied monarchies of
Europe	LOCATION	, on the other hand , con - ceiving themselves defending the cause of law and order and the rights of nations , srball and great , professed their intentions to continue the struggle until they had obtained adequate guarantees for the future , until they had destroyed , not
France	LOCATION	or the French people indeed , but the intolerable menace of the French revolutionary spirit .

		For Americans , this conflict derives an added signifi - cance from the fact that for twenty years the
United States	LOCATION	, endeavoring at once to maintain her neutrality and to protect her rights , suffered every humiliation , resorted to every measure short of war , and at last , in
1812	DATE	, waged with
England	LOCATION	the war sometimes called the second war of indepen - dence .

		If the period presents many analogies with the present , the differences were also striking .

		The
United States	LOCATION	was then a weak and divided nation just entering upon the great experiment in democ - racy .

		The civilization which
France	LOCATION	was endeavor - ing alternately to defend and to impose on
Europe	LOCATION	was inspired , in theory if not always in practice , by the democratic ideals of Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity ; while the
Allied Powers	ORGANIZATION	proved in the end to be the champions of dynasties rather than of nations and of autocracy rather than of law .

		The political history of
Europe	LOCATION	in the nineteenth cen - tury issues directly from that great conflict , and centres in the irreconcilable opposition between lib - eralism and reaction .

		Suffering many reverses , the forces of liberalism and democracy triumphed in the main ; so that to-day
France	LOCATION	, still faithful to her ancient faith , stands forth the heroic champion of established ideas ; and the better part of
Europe	LOCATION	, joined at last by the
United States	LOCATION	, has rallied about her for the suppression of Prussian - ism , the last stronghold of reaction and the forces of unreason .

		The great conflict of a century ago , so similar in some respects , yet so different in others , from the present conflict , Professor
Hazen	PERSON	has por - trayed with admirable skill .

		It may be that he has not fully appreciated the emotional and religious spirit of eighteenth century thought , that ideal of civic virtue , the ideal precisely of Fraternite , which inspired in part at least the anti-Christian movement of
1793	DATE	.

		It may be that more space might well have been given to the constructive work of the Revolution and of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, although these have by no means been ignored .

		But on the whole the period is presented in excellent perspective ; the great facts stand out clearly and in proper rela - tion .

		And the story is told in a way that carries the reader along with unflagging interest , in a style distinguished by clarity , movement , and a cer - tain individual quality .

		You feel that the book was written by somebody .

		RECALL that golden day when you first read `` Huck Finn '' ?

		How your mother said , `` For goodness ' sake , stop laughing aloud over that book .

		You sound so silly . ''

		But you could n't stop laughing .

		Today when you read `` Huckleberry Finn '' you will not laugh so much .

		You will chuckle often , but you will also want to weep .

		The deep humanity of it the pathos , that you never saw , as a boy , will appeal to you now .

		You were too busy laughing to notice the limpid purity of the master 's style .

		MARK TWAIN When
Mark Twain	PERSON	first wrote `` Huckleberry Finn '' this land was swept with a gale of laughter .

		When he wrote `` The Innocents Abroad '' even
Europe	LOCATION	laughed at it itself .

		But one day there appeared a new book from his pen , so spiritual , so true , so lofty , that those who did not know him well were amazed .

		`` Joan of Arc '' was the work of a poet a historian a seer .


Mark Twain	PERSON	was all of these .

		His was not the light laughter of a moment 's fun , but the whimsical humor that made the tragedy of life more bearable .

		The Price Goes Up This is
Mark Twain	PERSON	's own set .

		This is the set he wanted in the home of each of those who love him .

		Because he asked it , Harpers have worked to make a perfect set at half price .

		Before the war we had a contract price for paper so we could sell this set of
Mark Twain	PERSON	at half price .

		25 VOLUMES Novels Stories Humor Essays Travel History A Real American
Mark Twain	PERSON	was a steamboat pilot .

		He was a searcher for gold in the far west .

		He was a printer .

		He worked bitterly hard .

		All this without a glimmer of the great destiny that lay before him .

		Then , with the opening of the great wide West , his genius bloomed .

		His fame spread through the nation .

		It flew to the ends of the earth , until his work was translated into strange tongues .

		From then on , the path of fame lay straight to the high places .

		At the height of his fame he lost all his money .

		He was heavily in debt , but though 60 years old , he started afresh and paid every cent .

		It was the last heroic touch that drew him close to the hearts of his countrymen .

		The world has asked is there an American literature ?


Mark Twain	PERSON	is the answer .

		He is the heart , the spirit of
America	LOCATION	.

		From his poor and struggling boyhood to his glorious , splendid old age , he remained as simple , as democratic as the plainest of our forefathers .

		He was , of all Americans , the most Ameri - can .

		Free in soul , and dreaming of high things brave in the face of trouble and al - ways ready to laugh .

		That was
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		Russian Literature : The Quest for Life 's Meaning From the
early years of the nineteenth century	DATE	, Russian literature has been an in - strument barometric in its responsiveness to the political and social conditions of the country .

		It came to close grips with the facts of life .

		The writers of
Russia	LOCATION	's `` golden age '' : Turgenev ,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and the lesser men who wrote before the eighties of the
last century	DATE	, were not idle singers in a dreamy Nirvana .

		Theirs was a robust consciousness , an awakened social conscience that laid heavy responsibilities and exacting duties upon them .

		They had to advance the frontiers of civilization , to deal telling blows for the freedom of man , to arouse and strengthen the powers of the spirit for the stern battle against the hordes of dark - ness .

		Truth , Freedom , Humanity , Beauty were the altars they erected for the wor - ship of men .

		They had not sallied forth on a light and joyous adventure .

		Clear - eyed , sober , in a mood of tremendous earnestness , they set out on their great voyage of discovery .

		The adventure took them to the farthest reaches of the illimit - able plain of life , and they wandered on , impelled by a great spiritual yearning and unrest .

		There could be no boundaries , for an ever-elusive ideal broke the spell of momentary revelations of reality , and beckoned them on to far horizons and dis - tant goals , forever unattainable .


Vica	ORGANIZATION	- rious salvations , provisional salving of the conscience could not content these uncom - promising spirits who , with hands out - stretched for a great faith and with hearts eager for the purgation of the salient truths of life , were embarked on the search for final meanings .

		With rare intuition they knew that the light to illuminate the way could come only from the comprehen - sion of the nature of man , not man dis - guised by romantic pretension or ascetic renunciation , but man as he really is , in his true self and his naked essence .

		They revolted against accidentals and limita - tions , under the inspiration of a passion for the ideal for moral perfection , intel - lectual clarity , spiritual freedom .

		But they never sought to codify life , to reduce it to dialectical schemes .

		The feeling of won - der and reverence for reality was too deep to make them merely thinkers ; they were , first of all , artists bent upon the recreation of life .

		With the death of Dostoevsky and Tur - genev , and with
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's tragic renuncia - tion of art , the period of intense literary effort came to an end .

		Almost synchro - nously , an event occurred in the political life of the nation which exercised a pro- found influence upon literature : Alexander II was assassinated .

		`` Gentlemen , rise , the
Government	ORGANIZATION	is coming back , '' said a noted publicist ,
Katkov	PERSON	, and the prophecy ush - ered in a time of dark reaction when the intellectual energies of the nation were in - creasingly absorbed in the bitter struggle for political freedom .

		The outlook for literature was as bleak as a sudden autumn day near the end of an exuberant
summer	DATE	.

		In Russian literature the period of the eighties is one of grey , unrelieved hope - lessness .

		The time seemed like a great , fallow field strewn with dead hopes .

		The trust in the people , the ardent wish to awaken them from stagnation had proved a dream and a failure .

		It is Chekhov who best reflects the sombre mood of the time .

		All its grey monotony is in his stories , the wistful longings and the nervelessness of the intelligentsia , and their depressing sense of the emptiness and the insipidity of things ; the stale , tinsel culture of the towns , and the hushed , dreary vacuity of provincial life .

		It is under the spell of this spirit in
Chekhov	LOCATION	that
Leon Shestov	PERSON	, the well-known critic , calls him `` the creator from the void . ''

		Chekhov 's works form one long poem the poem of rainy weather .

		And yet , though
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	never attempts to solve life 's riddles , with what wondrous reverence and finesse does he 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	present the bare facts of life !

		With a rare power of lifting the threadbare and the commonplace to the high plane of art ,
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	pays homage to life in the very deference of his artistic reticence .

		For a time the relentless quest for the meaning of life halted , while art under - went a chilling bath in anti-aesthetic the - ories .

		New tendencies were abroad .

		An alien ideology was being assimilated by the eager intellectuals of
Russia Western	LOCATION	ideas and theorizings : positivist , socialis - tic , communistic .

		The intelligentsia swore allegiance to the doctrines of Marxian so - cialism and economic determinism , and fervently discussed hectic problems of Freedom and
Necessity	ORGANIZATION	.

		Art was held in the leash of social values .

		It was not set free until man felt the impulse to a new liberty , the striving upward toward the ultimate perfection of the individual , toward the release of instincts and the liberation of self .

		Dostoevsky had lis - tened , terrified , to the first rumblings of the great revolt against all that he held sacred .

		To him the revolutionary move - ment in
Russia	LOCATION	appeared to be inspired by men who , in seeking God , were denying Christ .

		But the first assertion of the rights of the individual filled him with a great dread .

		He feared that the new force , ris - ing in Diabolonian protest from an abyss of accumulated wrath and vengeance , would hurl down everything traditional , and , like Savva in
Andreyev	LOCATION	's play , would wish to wreck the solid structure of the Past .

		His mind pictured to itself the tre - mendous menace of individuality : all bonds rent asunder , all things holy cut down , a thirst for blood and destruction , deep cynicism and boundless disbelief .

		And in the terrified imagining of all this evil , he sought to stem the tide by throwing broadcast into life texts from the Scrip - tures and bits of Slavophile formulas , like a priest sprinkling holy water over a sin - ning multitude .

		He called upon man to draw within himself , to develop spiritual power and attain inner mastery .

		But the new yearning for the power and the glory of the liberated individual was not to be denied .

		Too long had the intel - lectuals of
Russia	LOCATION	been like `` living corpses , '' will-less , rudderless men , `` sick - lied o'er with the pale cast of thought . ''

		1 hey now began to worship action , force , personality , that compelling strength of character which projects ideas and thoughts into the outer reality of deeds .

		Gorky uttered the hope of an awakened age when he said , `` All of a man 's life may be consumed in the doing of one deed , but that deed must be beautiful , splendid , free ! '

		Here is a stern summoning to bat - tle , a buoyant , robust challenge to life in the very call to spend life 's gathered forces in heroic service .

		For a brief space the morbid spirit of self-flagellation vanished , and the world was conceived as a vast battlefield , sometimes as a clash between the fit and the unfit , between the classes of society , sometimes as a tragic encounter of the individual with the elemental forces of nature , and again as a conflict between the powers of good and evil in man and in the outer universe .

		And what of the new sup - erman who , in the first ecstasy of his in - carnation , had appeared so invincible ?

		Gorky , reawakened to a social conscious - ness , soon tempers the first proud assertion of individuality , and wishes to bind the new-born superman in the firm rivets of human duties .

		And the strong men of Andreyev , at the very moment of their sternest defiance of the unknown , are overcome by the feeling of their real weak - ness ; they become solitary , terrified crea - tures whirled about in a maelstrom of grim and mysterious forces .

		The new ideas served but to bring back the thirst for the quest of life 's mean - ing .

		In a great creation called `` The Book of Life , '' the Russian sculptor Biegass represents a huge , passionless fig - ure with its enormous fists pressed against the Book of Life , wherein is inscribed all that man wishes to know .

		The knowledge would make man great and happy , but the expressionless face of the monster shows that the hands will never be lifted and that man will forever remain ignorant of what the book contains .

		One thinks of the modern writers of
Russia	LOCATION	as men strug - gling to wrest the monster 's hands from the Book of Life , now in a passion of high resolve , now in the dread intensity of terror before death .

		Always the agon - izing weight of the perplexity of life 's
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 49 problems .

		Some seek release in thoughts of an eternal death that blots out every - thing ; a few put their faith in an eternal life beyond death .

		But for the most part , these restless spirits have a deep-rooted instinct for life and a keen zest in the per - ception of reality .

		Together with a rap - turous , lyrical impulse to organize the outer world after the ideal pattern of Beauty , they have the stern obligation to scan crude reality , bitter , misshapen , de - formed .

		The outcome is a tragic clash between emotions of joy and horror in the presence of the actual a clash that finds its catharsis in irony , now mordant , now tender and mellow .

		Before the outbreak of the present war , the Russian writers , conventionally called the `` modernists , '' had no fixed body of critical doctrine .

		Their ideas were in a state of suspension , still uncrystallized .

		Strongly opposed to critical dogmas , their only artistic tenet was that art is concerned , not with morality , but with beauty ; its ap - peal is to the imagination .

		They asserted the intrinsic value of literature , and ac - claimed its liberation from ethical and moral chains .

		Having thrown open the windows of
Russia	LOCATION	to all the intellectual currents of
Europe	LOCATION	, they eagerly re - sponded to the new art movements of the
West	LOCATION	.

		They set out to explore the possi - bilities of their language and ushered in a poetic revival .

		The new poems are rich , tense , and adventurous in spirit and form .

		The poets revelled in sounds and verbal conjurings , and created hitherto unsus - pected harmonies and combinations .

		The abstract became alive with a strange beauty , and in the dim hinterlands of in - stinct , in the borderlands of the emotions , the explorers came upon fresh beauties , fleeting , mystic , ethereal .

		Reality acquired a new elusiveness that could be expressed only in hints , subtle half-tones , and shad - owy evocations .

		The enthusiastic sing - ers formed groups for the discussion of questions of style , metre , rhythm ; mani - festoes and magazines were issued em - bodying the new principles and practice ; and in the artistic unrest , literary schools were generated symbolists , vorticists , ac - meists , futurists .

		It was all a fiery revolt in the name of art .

		For a brief time , in the months pre - ceding the Revolution of
1905	DATE	, the new writers were plunged again into the troubled stream of political and social con - flicts .

		The gospel of the folk returned and the social conscience was stirred to re - newed activity .

		It was in response to the spirit of the revolutionary turmoil that a literary magazine , `` Novy Put '' -LRB- The New Way -RRB- , founded in
1903	DATE	by
Madame Merezhovsky	ORGANIZATION	, was rechristened , toward the close of
1904	DATE	, `` Voprosy Zhizni '' -LRB- Questions of Life -RRB- .

		The `` accursed problems '' came to the forefront once more , and the modernists , in a mood of heroic renunciation , welcomed the onrush of social forces that bade fair to destroy the altars of art they had so recently erected .

		Drunk with the new wine of ap - proaching fulfilment , men like Artsybashev acclaimed once more the divine rights of human personality .

		` And the sanctities of convention became stale and paltry at the moment of the ruthless assertion of indi - vidual freedom .

		But the high hopes aroused by the revolutionary ferment were soon blighted by the return of bureau - cratic tyranny , and men were again thrown back upon themselves , to seek liberty in the unreal realm of hidden thoughts and dreams and aspirations .

		This repeated baffling of man 's desires for himself and for others heightened the tragic note in the new literature .

		In spite of the quest for novel forms , the frequent overemphasis and exaggerations , the cru - dities of style , and the large admixture of the baser metal of naturalism , the mod - ern literature of
Russia	LOCATION	is not a mere pur - suit of the novel and the exotic in theme and manner .

		It is a literature born of heavy hearts , of a consciousness of sin and bitterness , and a dread obsession of evil .

		But with all the prevailing gloom and depression , it does not fail to give an affirmation of life .

		The modern writers ,
Andreyev	LOCATION	,
Kuprin	LOCATION	,
Sologub	PERSON	,
Remizov	PERSON	,
Bunin	PERSON	, and the rest , are still embarked on the quest for truth ; theirs is still the undying resolve to know life 's meaning .

		They are the spiritual heirs of
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like the former , they ex - plore the dark corners of the human soul and trespass in forbidden realms of the 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	subjective and the psychologic .

		And they have
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's keen perception of reality , and something of his dauntless spirit in the pursuit of the ultimate .

		In what manner will the annealing forces of war shape the literature of Rus - sia ?

		Unfortunately , not enough of the work written under the stress of moving events has reached this country to form the bases of sure judgments .

		But the war stories in the Russian magazines , Artsy - bashev 's play , `` War , '' the sketches and tales of
Alexis N. Tolstoy	PERSON	,
Veressayev	LOCATION	, and Chirikov , and especially
Andreyev	PERSON	's `` The Burden of War , '' give promise of a great sobering and spiritual regeneration .

		Perhaps the severe discipline of war will bring to an end the excesses of pre-bellum `` decadence '' : facile pessimism , unre - strained symbolism , shoddy individualism , and erotic and neurotic extravagance .

		The war has brought new revelations , trans - formed reality , and made possible the realization of the dream of a century .


Russia	LOCATION	's mighty autocracy has fallen .

		How the sudden exhilaration of this event will be reflected in literature we can only sur - mise .

		Perhaps the best energies of
Russia	LOCATION	will be increasingly absorbed in guiding the tremendous social readjustments of the future .

		But already it is possible to dis - cern , in their transitional stages , the forces that will bring to Russian literature a saner , richer realism and a surer faith in the spiritual and moral instincts of man .

		The effort to solve the great problems that face the country will help to determine the course of the new literature .

		But it is the release of colossal industrial forces the economic awakening that will lift the dark cloud from the spirit of Russian lit - erature .


Russia	LOCATION	is now passing through the first stages of this awakening .

		Towns have sprung up , especially in
Siberia	LOCATION	, around the yawning mouths of mine-pits .

		More and more the new writers of Rus - sia describe , in the manner of our own
Bret Harte	PERSON	, the stir of life amid fresh and epic beginnings .

		A Russian poet ,
Alexander Blok	PERSON	, has sung of the rise from `` the dim underground '' of his country 's `` new Messiah , the black coal , bride - groom and king '' : 'T is the groan of the coal and the marshes , And the groan of the oar , near and far ; For I see o'er the boundless steppe rising Lo !

		Another
America	LOCATION	's star .

		The imagination of true artists will ever be aroused by the contemplation of new realities , the release of fresh energies .

		With the cheerful sense of fulfilment , there is for Russian literature the promise of a healthier , saner perception , and a more restrained and balanced expression , of reality .

		The writers of
Russia	LOCATION	do not have to go afar for teaching or disci - pline .

		Their own literary traditions are by no means sterile or exhausted .

		Faithful to the great masters , the moderns will scan eagerly all phases of human activity and all manifestations of human emotion , dedicated to the high task by their soul 's need for truth .

		They have known a tragic insufficiency , the savor of sin , and the taste of death , and it will not be easy for them to forget .

		LOUJS s > FRIEDLAND .

		The Poetry of
Ralph Hodgson	PERSON	Readers of THE DIAL are familiar with the view , put forward by Mr.
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	, that the present-day generation of English poets is superior , at least as re - gards distinction of workmanship , to the foremost of the Americans .

		With this view most careful readers of poetry will probably find themselves in agreement .

		The faults of American poetry at the pres - ent day are the obvious faults of a nation which has not yet hammered out for itself a literary tradition , which indeed has not yet created out of its stuff and substance documents numerous enough to give weight and direction to any tradition .

		If we should set ourselves the task of trying to read the most important works of the poets whose names appear in any fairly exhaustive survey of English poetry -LRB- such as , for example , Professor
Saintsburv	PERSON	's `` History of English Prosody '' -RRB- , we should soon find a single lifetime insufficient .

		But it is comparatively easy to read through the work of all the American poets who have in any way distinguished themscKrs .

		The question that requires to be askul and it is a question that affects Fnglarul
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 51 as well as
America	LOCATION	is , what relation does the present-day poetry of
England	LOCATION	bear to the stream of English tradition and cul - ture ?

		Are the English poets of the pres - ent day producing anything worthy to be mentioned in the same breath with the achievements of
Blake	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, Words - worth ,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tenny	PERSON	- son ,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Swinburne	PERSON	, to go no further than the nineteenth century ?

		Can these poets in any sense be said to measure up to the past , or to carry English poetry one step further ?

		This question is vitally important to the future of our poetry , which requires a strong English tradition to guide and balance it .

		And it is equally important to
England	LOCATION	, in view of the great regeneration of the English race which this war is bringing about .

		Among the younger English poets , one of the most recently discussed is Mr.
Ralph Hodgson	PERSON	.

		Since he has just brought out in a small volume the fruits of his Muse fruits somewhat difficult to obtain hitherto , since they appeared under the irritating guise of half a dozen or so pamphlets called `` chap-books '' or `` broad - sides '' and since Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	is a typi - cal example of one tendency in present-day English poetry , we may take him as a con - venient starting-point .

		We do so without disrespect to his elders .

		Youth must be served , and Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	is yet young .

		Of the poems contained in this volume , the ones which have hitherto found most favor are `` Time , You Old Gipsy Man , '' `` Eve , '' `` The Song of Honour , '' and `` The Bull . ''

		Of these the first two may be bracketed together because of their close similarity in metre and technique .

		`` Eve '' is the better .

		Here are its opening stanzas : Eve , with her basket , was Deep in the bells and grass , Wading in bells and grass Up to her knees , Picking a dish of sweet Berries and plums to eat , Down in the bells and grass Under the trees .

		Mute as a mouse in a Corner the cobra lay , Curled round a bough of the Cinnamon tall ... Now to get even and Humble proud heaven and Now was the moment or Never at all .

		This is a very pretty picture a minia - ture , doubtless , but still a pretty picture .

		It is when we come to compare it with certain works of the past that its deriva - tive nature becomes manifest .

		The tone is of the artificial pastoral with which
Herrick	PERSON	has made us familiar .

		But Her - rick is , after all , a minor poet ; and there is nothing here to match `` Bid me to live and I will live thy Protestant to be , '' or `` Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee . ''

		The metre and rhyme scheme recall
Milliken	PERSON	's `` Groves of Blarney '' There 's statues gracing This noble place in , All heathen gods and Nymphs so fair ,
Bold Neptune	LOCATION	,
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, And
Nicodemus	PERSON	, All standing naked In the open air !

		In short , there is nothing of Mr.
Hodg	PERSON	- son himself in these two stanzas but the `` cinnamon tall '' and that , too , is purely literary .

		Later on , Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	speaks of a `` cinnamon bee . ''

		Apparently , he likes the sound of this word .

		`` The Song of Honour '' is a direct transcription of
Christopher Smart	PERSON	's `` Song to
David	PERSON	. ''

		A single stanza of this poem set beside the work of the older poet , will bring this out , and also perhaps show why the latter is preferable .

		I heard the universal choir , The Sons of Light exalt their Sire With universal song ,
Earth	LOCATION	's lowliest and loudest notes , Her million times ten million throats Exalt Him loud and long , And lips and lungs and tongues of Grace From every part and every place Within the shining of His face , The universal throng .

		That is
Hodgson	PERSON	.

		He sang of God the mighty source Of all things the stupendous force On which all strength depends ; From whose right arm , beneath whose eyes , All period , power , and enterprise Commences , reigns , and ends .

		Tell them , I am ,
Jehovah	PERSON	said To Moses ; while earth heard in dread , And , smitten to the heart , At once above , beneath , around , All Nature , without voice or sound , Replied , o LORD , THOU ART .

		This is Smart , writing in
1757	DATE	!

		52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	With `` The Bull '' we come upon the in - fluence that pervades so much of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's work , as well as the work of so many of the poets of the present day in
England	LOCATION	.

		Need it be said that I am re - ferring to
William Blake	PERSON	?

		Here is a stanza of `` The Bull '' : When the lion left his lair And roared his beauty through the hills , And the vultures picked their quills And flew into the middle air , Then this prince no more to reign Came to life and lived again .

		This comes direct from
Blake	PERSON	's `` Tiger '' with its lines , When the stars threw down their spears And watered heaven with their tears ; and in the coloring of the poem there is more than a hint of
Thomas Gordon Hake	PERSON	, that remarkable symbolist whose three fine poems , `` The Birth of Venus , '' `` The Snake-Charmer , '' and `` Old Souls , '' should be , and are not , in every anthology of English poetry .

		In the shorter lyrics , the ghost of Blake stalks rampant .

		`` Stupidity Street , '' `` The Bells of Heaven , '' and `` The Birdcatcher '' all come from `` a robin redbreast in a cage puts heaven in a rage . ''

		And it may be said of all the others that they either de - rive from
Blake	PERSON	direct , or from
Blake	PERSON	di - luted with
Herrick	PERSON	.

		Poetry , like poverty , makes strange bedfellows ; and it would be amusing to show how Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	has grafted upon the sturdy oak of the man who wrote that `` improvement makes straight roads , but crooked roads without improvement are the roads of genius , '' the graceful , trailing vine of `` get up sweet slug-a-bed and see the dew bespangling herb and tree . ''

		But I will spare the reader .

		One more piece deserves to be noted .

		`` The Royal Mails '' is simply a poem of
Wordsworth	PERSON	born out of time .

		Every - body knows that letters are no longer car - ried by courier in
England	LOCATION	, and that the highways are no longer infested with thieves .

		But here we have the tale of a courier robbed by highwaymen , told in the same ballad metre as `` The Complaint of the Forsaken Indian Woman , '' or `` The Thorn . ''

		Let anyone who wishes compare these poems with Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's .

		If the reader has followed me this far , he may now ask what I am seeking to prove by these parallels .

		Am I seeking to impugn Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's honesty , or am I merely displaying the extent of my own reading ?

		I can only answer that I believe Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	to be a conscientious , pains - taking writer who believes he is following the true path ; and that I am not a scholar by profession .

		My aim lies elsewhere .

		In every art , as in every nation that is healthy , the principle of life and growth must manifest itself .

		Thus in Greek liter - ature we get , first of all , the development of the epic ; then follows the development of the lyric ; and finally , the combination of the two in a new art-form , the drama .

		And it is equally possible to take up Eng - lish literature and to show how it has grown and altered .

		Thus in the case of the drama , we get first disconnected scenes from the Bible : the Mystery plays ; then ethical sermons presented by typified ab - stractions : the Moralities ; then , under the influence of the Renaissance , the drama becomes secular and passes through the phases of interlude and farce to chronicle plays , heroic tragedy , comedy , domestic tragedy , etc. , to conclude in tragic-comed - ies of romantic adventure out of which again comes the art-form of the English novel .

		But on the other hand , we know that when a literature ceases to grow , and merely repeats itself , that literature is dead .

		It no longer draws its nourish - ment out of life , but only out of libraries .

		It may indeed for a time continue to dis - play a sophisticated and faded charm , but it is spiritually moribund and mentally in - capable of reacting to altering conditions .

		For such a literature , there is no hope , un - less the influence of some great crisis comes to brace and restore it .

		Perhaps the war is providing that in - fluence .

		In view of the flood of heroic energy let loose by the war , Mr.
Hodg	PERSON	- son 's poetry is merely a well-bred anach - ronism .

1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 53 The Mind of
England	LOCATION	at War ENGLAND AND THE WAR .

		By
Andre Chevrillon	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	. -RRB-


M. Chevrillon	PERSON	has not entered upon the diffi - cult task he has undertaken in this volume with - out important qualifications .

		His studies of
Sidney Smith	PERSON	and of
Ruskin	PERSON	have shown him to be , for almost twenty years , an acute and sym - pathetic observer of English life .

		If he lacks the monumental knowledge and superb insight which makes of M. Halevy the greatest living student of modern
England	LOCATION	, his book yet reveals a mastery of his subject which is sufficiently rare to be stimulating and helpful .

		What he has at - tempted is a psychological study of the English mind in
the first eighteen months	DATE	of war .

		It is an impressionist picture he has striven to paint , which , ignoring detail and circumstance , shall yet concentrate attention upon the fundamental as - pects of his problem .

		The result is in many ways remarkably successful .

		I would hazard the guess that
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	belongs far too closely by temperament and opinion to the Kipling-Lloyd
George	PERSON	school of intense action-at-all-costs to appreciate the exact nuance of men like Sir
John Simon	PERSON	and Mr.
George Lansbury	PERSON	.

		His sym - pathy is too clearly with the present English government to make it possible for him to judge of dissent from its attitude with impartiality .

		But when allowance for the human fact of con - viction is made this is the best interim study of the English attitude the war has so far produced .

		When the history of the war can be written in something like an adequate perspective , there will be few more fascinating chapters than that which records the change in the attitude of Eng - land toward its character .

		It is impossible to doubt that in the first months of the war there were few , even among the experts , who at all appreciated its probable magnitude .

		The extent of German preparation was totally unexpected .

		The greatness of German ambition was barely realized .

		A dull sense , indeed , existed that Ger - many was not friendly ; but on the whole , there were few who understood how profound was her enmity .

		England went to war because
Belgium	LOCATION	was invaded , and it is as certain as things can be certain in the tortuous labyrinth of diplomacy that had the neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	been re - spected , Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	would not have se - cured the willing adhesion of most Englishmen to the attitude of which he was protagonist .

		It was only fitfully that a deeper sense of perspec - tive became possible .

		England parts slowly with her traditional institutions ; and it took her states - men long to realize that much of the old machin - ery could not be adapted to such new and gigantic purposes .

		And when one realizes the magnitude of the change , it is impossible not to excuse the delay .

		The war has taken a ninth of the whole popula - tion of
England	LOCATION	into the fighting line ; she had never before raised an army of more than a quarter of a million men .

		Her industrial system had been based on the theory that the interests of capital and labor are incompatible ; what she was to learn was that somehow from a dual dis - harmony a synthesis of interests must be evolved .

		Her politics , as Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	once said , rested on the assumption that life is an organized quar - rel ; now she had to govern without the aid of parliamentary criticism .

		And she had no time for adjustment .

		She could only learn by actual experience that high explosives and not shrapnel were the right kind of ammunition .

		She could only learn by serious losses that the submarine was a far more potent weapon than any of her experts except Sir
Percy Scott	PERSON	had been will - ing to admit .

		She had to control a vast mechan - ism of credit upon which her allies were in complete dependence .

		She had to maintain in as full degree as possible the ordinary operations of business enterprise .

		New problems arose at every moment the relations of skilled to unskilled workers , the position of women in industry , the rebellion in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Grave fissures were appar - ent in the political system .

		Administrators of every sort and kind had to be discovered and trained ; an army had to be constructed from clerks and teachers , cricketers and engineers .

		If
England	LOCATION	reacted slowly to so novel a situation the fact is surely pardonable .

		She had not the experience of
1870	DATE	to look back upon as a vivid memory .

		She had no invader upon her own soil .

		As a nation , she had always been unin - terested in foreign politics , and the realignment of her ideas required an immense intellectual effort .

		She found it difficult to understand that she was combating a nation which had consciously willed the dominion of the world .

		She herself had strayed into empire ; and it is a matter of record that only since the time of
Froude	PERSON	and Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	has she awakened to its immense and beneficent possibilities .

		It was little less than a revelation to most Englishmen that Ger - many should look upon them as lustful of power , as determined to prevent her attainment of a manifest destiny .

		What would have happened if
Germany	LOCATION	had acted with the honesty that 54 THE DIAL -LSB- Juh 1 '' civilization demands , it is , of course , impossible to say .

		But the treatment of
Belgium	LOCATION	, the pride in cruelty , in injustice , in treachery by which every step in the German campaign was distin - guished , resulted in the stiffening of her pur - pose .

		Slowly and painfully , she came into line .

		She organized herself for the single purpose of defeating the German aims .

		She did it without hate , or pride , or ambition .

		It was the same call of duty to the ideal of freedom which in the sixteenth century had led her to smash the proud and insolent imperialism of
Spain	LOCATION	and in the nine - teenth the crude ambitions of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	.

		That service was her historic mission and she would not fail in her accomplishment .

		It is the analysis of this realization that
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	has undertaken in his book .

		For him , the culminating point in the process he describes is the abandonment of the voluntary principle and its replacement by a conscript army .

		That step he regards as the pledge by
Great Britain	LOCATION	of all her resources to the struggle in hand .

		It is , for him , nothing so much as a national conversion .

		It is the completion of her full and intimate acquaintance with the extent and depth of the German menace .

		When
England	LOCATION	learned what was implied by the German phil - osophy of war , she was at first disinclined to admit that something tantamount to the abandon - ment of what civilization had with such diffi - culty achieved could be attempted by a whole nation ; but the rape of
Belgium	LOCATION	and the sinking of the
Lusitania	LOCATION	drove her unwillingly to that conviction .

		On the whole I do not think
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	's interpretation of the process is much out of perspective .

		Where he is less happy is in his treatment of the dissident strands of opin - ion , which are far more complex than he seems to imagine .

		Things , for example , like Mr.
Lans	PERSON	- bury 's urgent protest against the union of labor with the government are certainly not based on any disbelief in the rightness of the British cause , but on a doubt whether a capitalist state can in fact be the parent of that final democracy of which Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	has constituted himself the apostle .

		He sees the industrial problems of the war less in terms of the achievement in muni - tions which M. Chevrillon so loudly applauds than in the immense profits in transportation and kindred industries , which even the excess-profits tax has failed really adequately to touch .

		He is distressed at the growing strength of bureaucracy , as evidenced in the too often thoughtless treat - ment of the dependents of soldiers and sailors .

		Now it is probable that Mr.
Lansbury	PERSON	is a little prone to attribute to conscious ill-will , what a fact , no more than uncoiiM imi > stupidity .

		But it is important to realize that his general distrust of the state is the result of forty intimate and full years of political experience and not in the least related to the abstract principles of a jejune laissez-faire to which
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	is anxious to ascribe it .

		The criticism of trade-unionism is , similarly , based on a complete misunderstand - ing of its nature .

		If he had been in
England	LOCATION	during the years between
1910	DATE	and the outbreak of war , his observation of the industrial position must have convinced him that its interpretation of the struggle in terms of class was by no means the intellectual chimera he imagines .

		He would have seen that what the war must industrially mean to many of the workers is the completion of an assault upon the very foundations of their strategic structure .

		Their suspicions , in that aspect , may not have been verified ; but so cau - tious an observer as Mr.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	has re - cently pointed out how impossible it is for the agreement between labor and the British govern - ment to be fulfilled .

		Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	's prom - ise of a restoration of trade-union conditions h : is become simply impossible .

		It is obvious that this will lead to serious difficulty at the close of war , and that the state wjll be the main weapon in the hands of capitalists to prevent that diffi - culty from assuming a form popularly called threatening .

		It is in the light of problems such as these that
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	should have analyzed the motives and fears of labor .

		What one can not help hoping is that he will turn from this brilliant journalism to a more permanent and profound study .

		He will trust .

		then , not to the guidance and confidence of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	but to acquaintance with parts of Eng - land too rarely known to the external observer .

		In social experiment he will realize that the future of
England	LOCATION	lies far more probably with effort like that of Miss
Sylvia Pankhurst	PERSON	and Mr.
George Lansbury	PERSON	in the
East End of Lon	LOCATION	- don , than with that of the more blazoned circles of the
West	LOCATION	.

		He will come to understand that the political thought which is going to count in the years that lie ahead is that of Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	and Mr.
Delisle Burns	PERSON	, of
Graham Wallas	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	.

		He will see that the things to examine are experiments like that of guild socialism , of the organization m such un - skilled workers as the dockers of
London	LOCATION	.

		It will be a new
England	LOCATION	that will meet his eyes ; but upon the basis of a victory in this war , it will be the
England	LOCATION	that is going to count .

		The hasty critic who a year and a half ago , when `` Good
Friday	DATE	'' was published , lamented that book as final proof of the decline of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, meets something of a poser in Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's newest volume , `` Lollingdon Downs . ''

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	is of that type of creative artist which is most distressing to the critic with a mania for classifying : he will not remain classi - fied ; he is forever in a process of evolution .

		This is indeed the highest compliment that could be paid him .

		It is not every poet who is capable of growth and change of a creative sort .

		With most poets the only marked modifications from book to book are technical .

		They adumbrate in one book what they achieve in the next .

		They mark out their province , they develop it , they exploit it , and at last they exhaust it .

		Con - sistency , emotional as well as intellectual , rides them as heavily as the Old Man of the Sea .

		They are the one-strain poets , of whom we be - come accustomed to expect always the same sort of tune .

		From a psychological viewpoint this is significant .

		It means that these poets have early in their poetic career achieved what is for them a satisfactory abstraction , or algebra , of experience .

		They have formed crystalline con - victions which will henceforth be hard , clear , and insoluble .

		In so far as we value their view - point , or have experienced it , we enjoy their work and give it a place in the gamut of our perceptions .

		But they have ceased to interest us as individuals , because they inform us obliquely that for them the problems have all been solved and there is no longer any flux in values .

		More interesting , therefore , is the poet who , if he does not always progress intellectually -LRB- a hard thing to determine on any absolute grounds -RRB- , at any rate changes ; he provides us with a personal drama as well as a literary .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	is of this sort .

		If we look back on his career as poet , we see a perspective of ceaseless ' change .

		His first mood , in `` Songs and Ballads , '' was unreflectingly , colorfully lyric : he was preoccupied with sensuous beauty , and with its transience , in the romantic tradition .

		In the group of novels which followed , we see a steady shifting of the attention away from the merely romantic , or decorative , and toward the real and human .

		The romantic attitude is not eliminated , to be sure ; one feels here as later in the four long narrative poems which gave Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	his greatest success , that though the material is often rudely naturalistic , it is still being used to an essentially romantic end .

		It is the romance of the realistic , of the crude and violent ; it is romantic because it is always seen against a back - ground of permanence and beauty .

		This use of the realistic element , the vigor of the common - place , reached its height in `` The Everlasting Mercy , '' `` The Widow in the Bye Street , '' and `` Dauber . ''

		In `` The Daffodil Fields , '' which fol - lowed , one perceives the next change , a distinct relenting of the naturalistic mood , a softening of both material and technique nearly to the point of sentimentalism .

		The hunger for hardness and virility having been satisfied in a brief and magnificent debauch , Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	returned to his more natural taste for the sensuous and lyric .

		The poetic plays which followed were further de - velopments of this .

		In spirit they are closely akin to the three later poetic narratives : the motive force , the emotional compulsion , is an al - most obsessive feeling for the tragic futility of man 's endeavor in the face of an outrageous and apparently unreasoning fate .

		At this everlasting door , Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	says in effect , we beat in vain .

		One perceives in Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, as he says this , an almost pathetic bewilderment that it should be so , but a bewilderment which has not yet reached the intensity of interrogation or rebellion .

		This point was finally reached in the sonnet series which composed the greater part of `` Good
Friday	DATE	. ''

		In these one gets a blind and troubled searching for spiritual comfort , a cry for some sort of assurance that beauty is more than a merely transient and relative thing .

		The tone at its best is tragic , at its worst querulous .

		The oracle is dumb , however , and Mr.
Mase	PERSON	- field implies , though he does not state -LRB- and in spite , too , of his passionate adherence to Beauty -RRB- , that the silence is negative .

		In short Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's evolution as a poet has been cyclic it has revolved through many changes , but always about one centre .

		This centre , which has been at times obscured , and of which Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	himself , like most poets , has been perhaps partially unconscious up to the present , is essentially romantic : it is clearly in the tradition of that romanticism which consists in a pagan love of beauty , on the one hand , and a 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	> profound despair at its impcrmancncr and rela - tivity , on the other .

		The sonnets in `` Good
Friday	DATE	'' showed us that Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	had be - come partly aware that this particular emotional well was the feeding
spring	DATE	of his whole nature : it was his first attempt to dip directly from the source .

		Now , in `` Lollingdon Downs , '' he has completed this process .

		The echo of personal complaint which hung over the former work is practically eliminated .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	has seen himself in a detached way , as he might see a reflection ; the tone has become one of calm and resignation ; like
Meredith	PERSON	he has managed a cer - tain degree of objectivism and can accord without undue desolation when
Meredith	PERSON	exclaims Ah what a dusty answer gets the soul When hot for certainties in this our life !

		This volume has a singular and intriguing unity , a unity broken up by interludes and by a succession of changes in the angle of approach , and in time and place .

		The effect is that of a several-voiced music .

		It is panoramic , rich in perspective , passing all the way from lyric and reflective sonnets to terse poetic dialogues and narrative lyric almost ugly in its bareness .

		It would be idle to pretend that Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	is a philosopher .

		He is not intellectual except in the sense that he is tortured by an intellectual issue ; he is neither subtle nor profound .

		But he feels this issue intensely , and even more than usual he strikes music and beauty from it .

		On the technical side he has few superiors in power to write richly , richly not merely from the im - aginative point of view , but also from the melo - dic .

		He modulates vowels with great skill ; he knows how to temper sensuousness with vigor .

		Best of all , he is preeminently Anglo-Saxon in his speech .

		To pass from Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	to Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- berry is to pass from the emotional plane to the intellectual .

		In `` Ideal Passion , '' a sonnet series celebrating the beauty of super-physical love , one might almost say supernatural , the atmos - phere is of so rarefied an azure as to be almost unbreathable .

		As Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	truly says of himself , No beast within ray flesh his lair doth keep , and , on the whole , we can not help wondering whether it would not be better if a beast did or , at any rate , if Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	could perceive him .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	is an aristocrat , however , and succeeds in ignoring him to the end .

		The result is that these sonnets concern themselves with a world strangely archaic and unreal , an anachronistic world , oddly so in this time of dust and glair .

		This is the Petrarchan and Dantesque tradition , even to small details : the beloved is referred to as M \ I. ; ul \ .

		the land - scape is that of
Perugino	LOCATION	, the language is quaintly and prettily old-fashioned .

		The modernist will be impatient with these things ; he will be of - fended at every turn by Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's nu-t - rical severities with words , by the frequciu \ .

		t such adjectives as `` skyey , '' `` rebukeful . ''

		`` stretched , '' by such a dreadful tyranny as com - pels `` religion '' and `` tradition '' to rhyim - as four - syllabled words with `` done '' and `` upon , '' or tin - shameless use of inversion .

		Thee rather in myself than heaven 's vast light Flooding the daybreak , better I discern This is an extreme instance of the sort of inver - sion Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	is prone to use , and often , as in this instance , it sounds more like a literal translation from the Latin than like English .

		It is hard to ignore such faults .

		In consequence one can not give a serene attention to Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- berry 's development of ideas , a development which is persuasively lucid and sometimes , in a cerebral fashion , beautiful .

		It is even at it - best , however , a cold and remote sort of beaut -RRB- : one soon gets tired of so chill a sanctity , and Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	is not so perfect an artist but that often , even in the most quiet precincts , the reader suddenly and with a start remembers hou long a journey he has come from reality .

		One can not forever contemplate the sky , and even the most steadfast contemplation of it will not eliminate the earth .

		In this respect , as in others , Mr.
Underwood	PERSON	is at the opposite extreme from Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	.

		`` War Flames '' is solid stuff , solidly human , vig - orously kinsesthetic : one feels Mr.
Underwood	PERSON	stretching and thrusting with a rude pleasure among the massed humanities of the world .

		Here are crowds of people , armies in motion , shops , cloisters , hospitals , corners of battlefields , stm-t-v trains , personal anecdotes , effects in historic ; ' !

		perspective , all massed in one book and arranged , a little artificially , according to nationality .

		The defects are , as with most contemporary work in realism , artistic defects .

		Mr.
Underwood	PERSON	lu - aimed at creating an overwhelming panorama of war ; but instead of achieving this , he ends .

		In sheer tireless weight of creative energy - , in over - whelming the reader physically rather than emotionally .

		Once he has set his machinery in mo - tion , it grinds along with a logical momentum almost frightful in its persistence .

		One feels that this book is being manufactured by rule and schedule .

		There is no variety ; one method pre -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 vails throughout : a slow , cumulative prose , monotonous , dogged , inexhaustible .

		In the end , one must break the continuity .

		By turning the pages backward and forward and reading a bit here and there , one is often repaid by finding vivid description , narrative episodes direct and powerful .

		It is , of course , prose , rising now and again to a sort of ordered recitative .

		It fails of being clearly poetic , as so much grand - sired by Whitman fails , through being prodigally wasteful and unselective , through relying on weight rather than on power .

		It is a little dis - appointing to reflect , in this connection , that it is the French rather than ourselves who have known how to appreciate what was valuable in
Whitman	LOCATION	, how to ignore what was weak .

		The principle of freedom , the necessity of inventing form for one 's self , this is what
Whitman	PERSON	has taught many modern French poets , and these poets have gone beyond Whitman in subtle and beautiful adaptations of rhythm to idea .

		In
America	LOCATION	, however , we are prone to mistake Whit - man 's practice for his principle , and his prac - tice was , in the main , unsuccessful because inartistic : Whitman lacked sense of form almost as much as he lacked the gift of melodic line .

		It is precisely these defects which most American followers of Whitman imitate , apparently in the belief that
Whitman	PERSON	wrote in this way because it was better than any other , and not , as is more reasonably to be considered the case , because he was incapable of writing otherwise .

		Mr.
Under	PERSON	- wood is one more adherent to this lost cause and , like many others , provides , when all is said and done , a mass of rich poetic material still in the ore .

		Such work is valuable for its influence on the poetic consciousness of the age rather than for itself .

		It is the material for new poetic coinage .

		At the same time it would be unfair to Mr.
Underwood	PERSON	not to admit that he has writ - ten a vivid and suggestive book , even if it is not entirely successful as poetry .

		Mr.
Samuel Hoffenstein	PERSON	's first book , `` Life Sings a Song , '' has the engaging quality of youth .

		Bad and good are here mixed indiscriminately , and if the bad outweighs the good , there is yet much that is , in a curiously unwarrantable way , very pleasant .

		Mr.
Hoffenstein	PERSON	has a Mozartean touch in melody ; he is lyric and sensuous ; but he still lives in a world of mirage and illusion and can hardly be said to have seen either him - self or the world very clearly .

		There is a good deal too much of the vasty deep , the sweet , the dim , dreams that fade , moonlight , angels , and roundelays the work is perhaps one-third
Hof	PERSON	- fenstein and two-thirds poetic stock .

		At his oc - casional best , however , Mr.
Hoffenstein	PERSON	succeeds surprisingly well in revivifying material which would have seemed rather hopelessly dead .

		The title poem , for example , is a quite delightful specimen of this sort ; and `` The Dreamer , '' `` Que - rella , '' `` A Prescience of Immortality '' are also good .

		There is a precision in these which is elsewhere lacking .

		In the main , like most young poets , Mr.
Hoffenstein	PERSON	is so carried away by the pathos of literary creation -LRB- a subtle intoxicant -RRB- that he forgets to stop .

		Mr.
Hoffenstein	PERSON	will probably write better , to paraphrase one of his titles , `` when all his dreams are cold . ''

		This may seem a desolate outlook , but it is really only
Wordsworth	PERSON	's doctrine of `` emotion remembered in tranquillity . ''

		The poet must quarry not in his present , but in his past ; Mr.
Hoffenstein	PERSON	is still quarrying for the most part in the sweet confusion of his present .

		The Struggle for South American Trade BRITISH EXPLOITS IN
SOUTH AMERICA	LOCATION	: A History of British Activities in Exploration , Military Adventure , Diplomacy , Science , and Trade in
Latin-America	LOCATION	.

		By
W. H. Koebel	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Century ;
$ 4	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
W. H. Koebel	PERSON	who , notwithstanding his German-sounding name , is a thoroughgoing Eng - lishman has added to the fast-growing litera - ture of Latin American affairs half a dozen acceptable volumes .

		Further , he has served as editor-in-chief of the `` Encyclopaedia of
South America	LOCATION	. ''

		He speaks with authority on all mat - ters pertaining to the contact of Europeans with Latin American resources , governments , and peoples .

		His `` British Exploits in
South America	LOCATION	'' covers a period of more than three hundred years .

		It opens with a picturesque account of the old English navigators and buccaneers who sailed the Spanish Main , and goes on to describe successively the work of the English and Irish Jesuits in the Spanish colonies , the British voy - ages of exploration in the eighteenth century , the development of
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	and the
Falkland Islands	LOCATION	, the exploits of the British in
Brazil	LOCATION	, the part taken by Englishmen in the wars of inde - pendence , the early relations of the English with the new republics , and the deeds of innumerable adventurous British travellers , traders , natural - ists , and soldiers of fortune .

		The author gives 58 THE DIAL -LSB- Jul > evidence of an easy command of rich resources of memoirs , diaries , correspondence , and old books of travel and history ; he has a keen sense of character ; and his chapters make interesting reading .

		Three aspects of British operations in
South America	LOCATION	, especially since the
early nineteenth century	DATE	, are emphasized .

		The first is the large part played by capital .

		Within two decades , two or three hundred million pounds passed from Lombard Street to the newly founded Latin American states , and the stream has never ceased to flow .

		British investments south of
Panama	LOCATION	are to-day not far from seven hundred millions , insuring a substantial , though beneficent , finan - cial dominion .

		The second feature is the excep - tional ease with which the Englishman adapted himself to his surroundings and took root in South American countries .

		It is the fashion to accuse the Englishman abroad of the unsocial crime of keeping himself to himself .

		This , I think , must apply in a far lesser degree to
South America	LOCATION	than to any other part of the world .

		There is no doubt that the average Englishman in
South America	LOCATION	entertains an affection for that con - tinent and its inhabitants deeper than the inevitable regard with which the successful man contemplates the source of his wealth .

		Intermarriage has been fre - quent : common interests in sports , games , pastoral and agricultural occupations have led to an intimate understanding .

		A third fact is that almost all of the British achievements in
South America	LOCATION	have been the work of free lances .

		This was true in the ro - mantic days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, `` when on the one hand the Queen gave
Drake	PERSON	god-speed and scarfs em - broidered with well-wishes , and on the other hand condoled with
Philip	PERSON	of
Spain	LOCATION	on the deeds of her irrepressible sailors . ''

		It was true of the British activities which had so much to do with stimulating and guiding the nineteenth century movement for independence .

		It was true , in the main , of British financial and commercial expan - sion in the South American world after
1820	DATE	.

		The portion of Mr.
Koebel	PERSON	's book which will chiefly interest students of international politics is a final chapter entitled `` Today and Tomor - row in
South America	LOCATION	. ''

		The chapter is devoted mainly to a discussion of the commercial situation and outlook .

		It is pointed out that during recent decades , notwithstanding the sentimental advan - tages which the British have enjoyed in
Latin America	LOCATION	over every nationality save the Latins , British trade as compared with the trade of the rest of the world has decreased ; and the author urges a number of expedients to check the de - cline , chiefly the reorganization of the legations at the American capitals so as to include a much larger number of carefully selected commercial attaches .

		The lost ground has gone mainly to
Germany	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The German position in
South America	LOCATION	is analyzed at some length .

		There is no such easy rapprochement between the Ger - mans and the Latin Americans as between the British and the Latin Americans .

		`` An inherent and unquenchable antagonism exists between the arrogance of the Prussian and the easy democracy of the South American . ''

		None the less , by art - ful and dauntless enterprise , the German has absorbed a large proportion of the Latin Amer - ican trade , has planted colonies on Latin Amer - ican soil , and by
1914	DATE	had begun to direct the course of affairs in more than one Latin Amer - ican state .

		Everything has been carefully planned and directed by public authorities , noth - ing left to chance .

		The war has upset the Ger - man calculations and roused the Latin American peoples to a new degree of anti-German feeling .

		The author feels , therefore , that now is the time to overcome the disadvantages which
Great Britain	LOCATION	has suffered , and to prepare against the probable revival of German `` predatory trade '' after the restoration of peace .

		American competition is viewed very differ - ently .

		To forsake the topic of the German trade hostilities for that of the North American competition is to ex - perience the sensations of one emerging from an en - tangled forest path on to an open high-road .

		Yet this affords no reasons for regarding it lightly .

		The North American competition with which we have to contend is straightforward , of a fairly simple order , but very powerful .

		It relies for its success largely on a sheer weight of dollars .

		It enjoys forming a trust and buying up the control of an entire trade .

		.

		.

		In its industrial enterprise , moreover , it has set itself a very high standard if not quite so lofty an ideal of political morality at
Panama	LOCATION	.

		The North American has already given ample proof that he means business very big business in the South .

		But , seeing that no question of imperial aggression is con - cerned , there would seem no reason why his ventures and those of the British should not thrive side by side .

		The main handicap , Mr.
Koebel	PERSON	feels , upon American enterprise in
South America	LOCATION	is unfami - liarity with South American languages , customs , and institutions .

		The newcomer from the
United States	LOCATION	, he very properly says , finds it diffi - cult to realize how many races teem , ami how many rivers run , between
New York	LOCATION	and
Buenos Aires	ORGANIZATION	.

		He recognizes , however , that the Pan -
American Union	ORGANIZATION	and other agencies are doing much to remedy this defect ; and it is probable that the obstacles are disappearing more rapidly than he realizes .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 59 The Vitality of Thoreau THE LIFE OF
HENRY DAVID THOREAU	PERSON	.

		By
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 4	MONEY	. -RRB-

		This book is the offering of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's author - ized publishers in this centenary year , and is announced somewhat tautologically as `` final and definitive . ''

		If this is true ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's name must be added to the list of men whose lives can never be written .

		Fond of paradox and hyperbole himself , he seems to have been the cause of paradox and hyperbole in others .

		Em - erson 's `` Memoir '' and Channing 's rambling `` Life '' abound in striking and epigrammatic statements which whet rather than gratify our curiosity regarding the man whom they would portray , and which , like most epigrams , are not always literally true .

		Salt 's biography and San - born 's earlier volume in the `` American Men of Letters Series '' record the facts of
Thoreau	PERSON	's career , and many critics and essayists have had their say regarding his life and personality .

		The present volume makes some valuable contribu - tions to our knowledge .

		But after all , we are never certain that we fully understand
Thoreau	PERSON	.

		It is not so much that he seems a mystic , in - capable of comprehension , but rather that we feel uncertain as to data and their significance , doubtful whether our informants have inter - preted word and act and gesture as we might have interpreted them .

		It was fitting that
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	should write this book on this occasion , and it is for - tunate that he lived to read almost the final proofs , though not to see it from the press .

		He was the last surviving intimate of
Thoreau	PERSON	and of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's group at
Concord	LOCATION	, and
Thoreau	PERSON	was perhaps the man for whom he had the greatest admiration .

		Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	reports Whitman as saying : `` I asked
Sanborn	PERSON	... who of all men of
Concord	LOCATION	was most likely to last , into the future .


Sanborn	PERSON	took his time in replying .

		I thought he was going to say
Emer	PERSON	- son , but he did n't .

		He said
Thoreau	PERSON	.

		I was surprised looked at him asked ` Is that your deliberate judgment ? '

		and he said very emphat - ically , ` Yes ! ' ''

		One may conjecture that San - born never changed his mind .

		His latest work is a combination of biography , interpretation , and personal tribute .

		The unexpected lapses into the first person , and the autobiographic ref - erences which might seem blemishes in another book only add to its attractiveness .

		It has , how - ever , grave limitations .

		Like the author 's earlier and briefer treatment of the same subject , it is by no means a book for the seeker after ordinary biographical information .

		While it gives a be - wildering amount of family history , and a fairly minute account of some parts of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's life , its omissions are surprising .

		For example , one searches in vain for the date of the residence at
Walden	LOCATION	, or any details regarding that experience .

		It seems to begin on one plan and end on an - other , and is wofully unsystematic .

		Lowell wrote of
Thoreau	LOCATION	in
1865	DATE	: `` We think greater compression would have done more for his fame .

		A feeling of sameness comes over us as we read so much . ''

		At that time six volumes of
Thoreau	PERSON	's writings had appeared , including his `` Letters . ''

		One wonders what
Lowell	PERSON	would say to-day , when admirers and publishers have insisted that every scrap of manuscript that he left should be given to the public .

		The excuse for a great part of this publication is plain .

		Thoreau left journals and commonplace books filled with material , much of which he would surely have prepared for the press had he lived .

		This was too good to be lost , yet no one could say just what selections and revisions he would have made .

		Excerpts by an editor , like the vol - umes published with the titles of the seasons , were bound to be unsatisfactory .

		The publica - tion of the complete journals , though it over - whelmed the reader with a mass of material uneven in quality and filled with endless repeti - tion of similar details , had the justification that it enabled him to make his own selections and do his own editing .

		There seems to be less reason for printing the college essays and the notebook of the trip to
Minnesota	LOCATION	in
1861	DATE	which are made a conspicuous part of the present vol - ume .

		The notebook contains the jottings kept by an overtaxed traveller in the late stages of a fatal disease , and is of little value for content or form .

		The college essays , though interesting as examples of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	themes of eighty years ago , seem less significant than the biographer deems them .

		They show Thoreau to have been an apt pupil , and his progress may well have been a source of pride to his instructor , Professor Channing ; but they throw little light on the de - velopment of his finished style .

		Sanborn makes much of their paradoxical statements ; but love of paradox is not an uncommon trait in college students , and it is undergraduate paradox that we find here , rather than the individual and whimsical sort that appears in
Walden	LOCATION	.

		No - where are there hints of the perfect diction and 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
July	DATE	l' the flowing sentences that linger in our minds when we meet them in the later essays and jour - nals , and that somehow move us like reaches of still and shaded waters .

		Moreover , the pub - lishers tell us that
Sanborn	PERSON	, in dealing with writ - ings which
Thoreau	PERSON	did not himself prepare for publication , `` used the privilege of an editor who is thoroughly familiar with his author 's subjects and habits of thought to rearrange paragraphs , to omit here , to make slight interpolations there , and otherwise to treat the rough and unpolished sentences of the Journals , letters , etc. , much as it may be supposed the author himself would have treated them had he prepared them for the press . ''

		If he has taken liberties like these with the essays and the notebooks , he has destroyed even the slight value they might have had as documents .

		But if the new biography fails to reveal the secrets of personality as we might wish , it still reminds us how vital and important a figure
Thoreau	PERSON	is in American literature a hundred years after his birth .

		The view of his contem - poraries , that he was a mere understudy and imitator of
Emerson	LOCATION	, has disappeared so com - pletely that it is hardly mentioned to be denied .

		He was a man of somewhat eccentric character , driven by his Yankee humor and his innate in - dependence to mystify a gossipy
New England	LOCATION	village and the wider circle of his readers by accentuating the appearance of eccentricity .

		The slight recognition that his works received did not encourage publication in his lifetime , and his career was early cut short ; so that he is known by writings in which he is sometimes guilty of trying to pique attention , and by a mass of post - humously published material which is surely not in the form that he would have given it .

		That such work of such a man should continue for over half a century to give an increasing sense of its importance is proof of qualities that may well be lasting .

		Thoreau has a double hold a fascination for those who love Nature not as a fad or a pleas - ant-day diversion but in all her aspects , and an interest for those who respond to his unsystem - atic but fairly intelligible philosophy of life .

		A book like his `` Week '' might be separated into two works a delightful chronicle of a journey , and a set of moralizing essays .

		A passage of de - scription and a passage of moralizing is the formula , and often there is no close relation between the particular moral idea and the par - ticular scene by the river-bank with which it is associated .

		Stevenson might have attained some - what the same effect if he had interlarded `` Tra \ els with a Donkey '' at random with pages from `` Virginibus Puerisque . ''

		The most devout admirers of the author enjoy both elements equally ; but there are many who are moved chiefly by his sympathetic comment on the homely things of Nature , and by the less striking and erratic of the passages in which he preaches the `` simple life . ''

		To these last , at least ,
San	LOCATION	- born will appeal less strongly than some earlier commentators .

		A feature of the book too im - portant to be ignored is the illustrations , mostly reproductions of old family pictures , which to those who can interpret them are far better than pages of letterpress in giving an idea of the Thoreaus and their kin .

		WILLIAM B. CAI Federalists and Republicans A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES .

		By
Edward Channing	PERSON	.

		Vol .

		IV .

		The Federalists and Re - publicans .

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Professor
Channing	PERSON	goes resolutely forward with his great undertaking , a history of the
United States	LOCATION	to the end of the nineteenth cen - tury , in spite of wars and distractions that mi ^ ht deter a less devoted historian .

		The present vol - ume treats the period from
1789	DATE	to
1815	DATE	.

		The third volume presented the story of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion and the reaction to
1789	DATE	; while the two preceding instalments were devoted to the two centuries of colonial history .

		At this rate \ \ e shall have a new history of the country in eL ` ht volumes , although the proportions of the subjects to be treated must necessarily make it difficult to say how much space should be given to them .

		A new history of the
United States	LOCATION	after this fashion is a formidable undertaking and Mr.
Channing	PERSON	makes it plain that he is fully aware of the fact .

		The materials are abundant , too abundant for any but the most industrious ; the variety of social groups to be described is great ; and the conflicting interests are manifold .

		Thus far the author has apparently devoted fifteen years to his task and has brought out four vol - umes of some six hundred pages each .

		To com - plete his task fifteen more years must be devoted to research .

		Thirty years to a work which must of necessity be antiquated before it is finished !

		That is the problem and the recompense of the historian ; for all the larger histories of our country which have appeared in the
last two 1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 decades were out of date before they were com - pleted .

		Nor is this to be lamented .

		Each generation must have its history anew , and that history must have some bearing on the present , much as some scholars deprecate that demand of the public .

		It is not so only with history proper ; it is so with biography .

		There are less than a dozen biographies in the whole field of American history that can be said to stand on permanent founda - tions .

		Of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Clay	ORGANIZATION	,
Lin	PERSON	- coln , and the rest we have only the frameworks of biographies , not reproductions of the men as they lived and wrestled with men and conditions .

		There is room , then , for all that Mr.
Channing	PERSON	can bring out , even if his work must of necessity be submitted to a generation that runs so fast that it can not read .

		In the volume before us Professor Channing treats with sympathy both
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Jeffer	PERSON	- son , opposite as they were to each other .

		He still adheres to the view that
Hamilton	PERSON	's financial measures composed a magnificent system , perhaps underestimating the fact that union itself made the system necessary and that the tariff , with which
Madison	PERSON	had much to do , was the under - pinning of the whole financial structure .

		While
Hamilton	PERSON	was doubtless a great figure , it must not be forgotten that the social forces already organized would have made even a smaller man great .

		But I must hasten to say that Mr.
Chan	PERSON	- ning is no panegyrist either of
Hamilton	PERSON	or of
Washington	LOCATION	himself .

		He is not afraid of the facts and the facts are duly brought out .

		The Secretary of the Treas - ury is shown to have been the centre of a con - siderable number of petty intrigues of specula - tors and narrow-minded partisans , whose purpose was to exploit their opportunities and the coun - try .


Hamilton	PERSON	's many bouts with
John Adams	PERSON	, his efforts to control
Washington	LOCATION	or to exploit his reputation as against the President 's in
1798	DATE	, are given all due publicity .

		But it may be doubted whether Professor
Channing	PERSON	has read President
Wilson	PERSON	's statement that
Hamilton	PERSON	was a great man , but not a great American .

		Of the arch radical ,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Channing	PERSON	has even more to say than of
Hamilton	LOCATION	; but it may be doubted whether he knows what a `` root and branch '' reformer the Third President was when a leader in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		At least , such knowledge does not appear in this volume .


Henry Adams	PERSON	thinks
Jefferson	PERSON	would rather have seen the world go up in smoke than that
America	LOCATION	should be - come only another
Europe	LOCATION	, a place where poor men are exploited for the benefit of their more fortunate fellows .

		Channing has not been im - pressed by that view .

		He has not pointed out that
Jefferson	PERSON	was so hated by true gentlemen of
Virginia	LOCATION	that prayers were piously said for his demise .

		W 7 hile slaveholders associated with the
Jefferson	PERSON	party , they did it with fear and trem - bling , much as `` malefactors of great wealth '' hold on to the coat tails of
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	.

		Their only alternative was the downright enemy ,
John Adams	PERSON	, or the star-gazing Virginian .

		They took the Virginian , hoping either to con - trol or to confound him .

		While this is not said in criticism of
Channing	LOCATION	, it is suggested that at least one feature of the story has been slurred .

		Of the Alien and Sedition laws the author offers just and adequate treatment .

		He makes it plain that they were a sort of party platform , as indeed were the resolutions of the
Hartford	LOCATION	con - vention .

		The essential weakness of the con - stitution in those early days is made sufficiently plain ; but it is not made quite so plain that , in vital matters , the rights of the states were deemed by able and patriotic leaders always paramount to the rights and interests of the Federal Gov - ernment .

		Any close reading of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, Mad - ison ,
Josiah Quincy	PERSON	, or
George Cabot	PERSON	reveals the fact that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was a union of convenience , which , to be sure , all regarded as of great impor - tance for the building of an American nation , but which few regarded as commanding the ab - solute allegiance of men .

		If the principles of the Federalists are to prevail , then
Jefferson	PERSON	would rather have the
Union	LOCATION	disrupted ; if the country is to embrace all the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley and thus make of
New England	LOCATION	only a province , then Quincy or Cabot would prefer separation from the
Virginia	LOCATION	dynasty and its `` vile dal - liance '' with slavery .

		This is not made so plain in
Channing	LOCATION	that the wayfaring man may see and understand ; and attention needs to be called to the subject , be - cause failure to grip these facts may lead to unhistorical treatment of later and more contro - verted epochs .

		The history of the war of
1812	DATE	is correctly set forth , at least so far as the facts go .

		It was no war for sailors ' rights , successfully waged against the greatest naval power in the world .

		It was a war such as a democracy must of neces - sity wage , one of blunders , of personal disgraces , and brilliant individual exploits .

		It produced the piddling
Henry Dearborn	PERSON	and it brought to 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	'' light the heroic
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	.

		It saw the ignominious fall of
Washington	LOCATION	and the distress - ing incidents which accompanied the
fall	DATE	.

		It also saw the valiant defence of
Balitmore	LOCATION	by citizen soldiers .

		Professor Channing deserves the credit due the honest historian for telling the truth about the militia , which was neither all poltroon nor all heroic .

		In the light of recent so-called military history , one might have been tempted to accept what is in the air and solemnly pronounce verdicts of condemnation upon men whose lives and conduct were as honorable as any of those who died at
Bunker Hill	ORGANIZATION	or
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		The facts of the war are correctly if briefly set forth .

		They are not conducive to a sense of national superiority ; they do not place us below the other peoples in the world who have sought to govern themselves .

		Of the causes of the war the present volume gives an equally truthful and straightforward account .

		It was the westerner who first cried out for a declaration of hostilities , and it was the West that supplied the greatest number of soldiers and the best fighting men .

		The South was next in interest ; in part because there was a bitter popular feeling in that region against
England	LOCATION	on account of the atrocities of the rev - olutionary struggle .

		Still , as we are plainly told , these were not the decisive influences .

		The con - quest of
Canada	LOCATION	and
Florida	LOCATION	was a leading mo - tive for the war ; it was natural that this should be so , for the best way to rid the country of the Indians , who were always ready for a foray into the settlements , was to attack their allies .

		The Indians naturally looked to
England	LOCATION	or
Spain	LOCATION	for arms and for markets for their peltries .

		This made war upon
England	LOCATION	for
Canada	LOCATION	natural ; it made war upon
England	LOCATION	for
Florida	LOCATION	natural , because
England	LOCATION	was the ally of
Spain	LOCATION	against
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Hence
America	LOCATION	became an enemy of
England	LOCATION	and a supporter of Napoleon at a time when the fortunes of the world seemed to be in the balance and when Americans were not admirers of the French emperor .

		It was a fate - ful step to take ; but the conditions in
North America	LOCATION	decreed it .

		Perhaps Professor
Channing	PERSON	will not com - plain if I say that his making of Clay ,
Calhoun	PERSON	,
Grundy	LOCATION	, and
R. M. Johnson	PERSON	southerners is in - consistent with the rest of his story of the war .

		Although these men were born in the South , they were as far from
John Randolph	PERSON	and
Charles Pinclcney	PERSON	in ideal and purpose as
Jefferson	PERSON	was foreign to
Rufus King	PERSON	.

		It was as a westerner that Clay sang his song of ``
Canada	LOCATION	.


Canada	LOCATION	'' in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	till
John Randolph	PERSON	's political stom - ach was turned .

		It was as a westerner that
Cal	LOCATION	- houn thundered nationalism at the East and even talked of the treason of
New England	LOCATION	.

		The West and South had been allies since the adop - tion of the constitution ; but the official spoke - men of the alliance in 1810-11 ,
Madison	LOCATION	, Gal - latin , and the rest , seeking always to get on without war and without alienating the East had got out of touch with common men of the West and the southern up-country .

		Clay and
Cal	LOCATION	- houn and , for that matter ,
Porter	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, undertook to wake them up and restore them to their political base .

		Thus when
Monroe	PERSON	went into
Madison	PERSON	's cab - inet , it was in obedience to a popular demand from West and South and with the purpose of changing the base of the administration , as any one may see who reads the letters of
John Tay	PERSON	- lor of
Caroline	PERSON	, the good angel of
Monroe	PERSON	's career , who brought the wayward Virginian back to his former friendly relation to the Pres - ident .

		The publication of the
Henry	PERSON	letters , at a cost of the exorbitant sum of fifty thousand dollars , was due warning that the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	had changed its mind .

		Then came Clay and
Calhoun	PERSON	and
Grundy	PERSON	and
Porter	PERSON	and drove the war machine into action .

		Some have said that they exacted a declaration of war from timid
Madison	PERSON	as a condition of his reelection to the presidency in
1812	DATE	.

		Channing denies this stoutly and with good documentary support .

		Madison had , indeed , seen the writing on the wall .

		Still , one may doubt very much whether the President could have interpreted the writing but for his hard-pressing western friends .

		The following quotation , pages
15-16	DATE	, from this volume may bring the author some embar - rassment : `` Whether alcohol quickened or dimmed their -LSB-
Madison	PERSON	,
Jefferson	PERSON	, and King -RSB- intellects would probably best be left for decision to others .

		What effect it produced on their bodily health is also an interesting inquiry and one upon which conclusion would be quite as difficult .

		King died at the age of seventy-two .

		Jefferson at eighty-three and Madison at eighty - five , after years of service unsurpassed each in his way . ''

		If the American Liquor Dealers A sociation does not jump at this proof of the good effects of partaking of the `` good tiling ot life , it will be because its press agents do not look to the pages ot irravc and sober historians for support of their cause .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 63 Professor
Channing	PERSON	's work is a little difficult to appraise justly .

		It is substantial , informing , and useful ; one could not well afford to leave it off one 's shelves .

		Yet there is little , if any - thing , new in it .

		Perhaps this is as it should be in such a work .

		Nor are there new interpreta - tions or evidences of very keen insight .

		The mean - ing of Federalism in its later years is overlooked .

		And the election of the Republicans in
1800	DATE	is treated just as one might treat the success of the Democrats in the later decades of the nineteenth century that is , as a mere change of parties .

		The shift of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	from
Federal	ORGANIZATION	- ism to Republicanism in
1807	DATE	, while a personal matter in some respects , was a significant thing , so significant that many people called it the `` great apostasy . ''

		Since
Henry Adams	PERSON	, in all his nine volumes , did not find space to set this matter straight , it might have been made clear in
Channing	LOCATION	.

		A larger and even momentous thing , the purchase of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, is treated as an episode : the significance of
Louisiana	LOCATION	is not made clear , its bearing on slavery and the slave trade , on the development of the
Union	LOCATION	itself is not dwelt upon .

		Nor is the reason for the break between
Jeffer	PERSON	- son and his southern supporters in
1807	DATE	made evident to the reader .

		The reason for the au - thor 's not seeing this is that he regards
Jefferson	PERSON	simply as a party leader and a shrewd statesman , not as a social reformer bent on leaving his coun - try `` in the way of becoming democratic . ''

		The slave trade was prohibited by Federal law in
1807	DATE	, but Professor Channing does not show - that the law was as futile as the more recent
Sherman	PERSON	anti-trust law and that African slaves continued to be sold in southern towns till
1861	DATE	.

		This is not to say that the facts are not well set forth , only the meaning of the facts is not brought out .

		The struggle over the law against the slave trade and the substantial nullification of that law in the provisions for its execution are evidences of things not so well noted as one should expect from so great a scholar as our author is known to be .

		Still , we should not quarrel with those who serve us and the public in general so well as Professor Channing does .

		If his work fails to show , as one might wish , the evolution of society in
America	LOCATION	, the meaning of events , and the influ - ences of ideas , it is a useful reference work , an ever-ready friend in time of need , which all who are interested in American history should hasten to buy .


WILLIAM E. DODD	PERSON	.

		The ^ Dramatist of Psycho-Analysis COMEDIES OF WORDS .

		By
Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Pierre Loving	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Stewart & Kidd	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		A translation of
Schnitzler	PERSON	's einakters has a more than timely interest .

		For fifteen years he has been one of the most-followed teachers to a large school of playwrights who have been sup - plying the intimate playhouses of
Europe	LOCATION	with realistic short pieces , and recently his influence has been extended to the young American dram - atists whose one-act plays are being presented in our own Little Theatres .

		In this volume are collected interesting ex - amples of his recent work , the three plays pub - lished two years ago with `` Literature '' -LRB-
1901	DATE	-RRB- and `` His Helpmate '' -LRB- 1898 -RRB- .

		It is a pity that the excellent translations should have a most un - satisfactory introduction .

		Schnitzler is not so well known in
America	LOCATION	that an intelligent , de - tailed study of his one-act plays is unnecessary , but all that is given the inquiring reader is an elaborately worded jumble of praise and uncer - tain conclusions .

		Mr.
Loving	PERSON	's translations of the plays themselves , however , are capital .

		At times he is unnecessarily free -LRB- as when he trans - lates ist nun einmal zu verachten , `` is n't to be ground down with the heel of one 's foot '' -RRB- , and he makes a few careless mistakes -LRB- kassiererin , a woman cashier , becomes a `` coffee-dispenser '' -RRB- ; but his English is so finely idiomatic and he repro - duces the spirit of the original so well that we can forgive these little slips and even overlook his introduction .

		The first thing to strike the reader of these plays is that the plot of every one has a sexual basis .

		Taken alone each situation is perfectly possible ; taken as a collection they are unnatural .

		I mention this obvious fact because it can be used advantageously in examining the individual plays .

		Each character , w r hen singled out , is a living in - dividual ; but the characters of any play with the possible exception of the trio in `` The Fes - tival of Bacchus '' are an unreal group of human exceptions .

		They are all aberrant , and in spite of the highly realistic style , we feel certain that such erotic persons never found themselves to - gether in such a situation .

		We miss `` the average man . ''

		To comprehend this characteristic of his work we must remember that
Schnitzler	PERSON	is a practising physician , a specialist in psychology , a student of
Freud	LOCATION	.

		He is so keenly interested in patholog - 64 THE DIAL -LSB- Jul > ical psychology that the normal human being does not interest him at all .

		Believing that the sexual instinct is the most powerful impulse man has , he naturally finds it the most available dramatic theme .

		In his study of his characters , however , there is no morbid curiosity , but a scientific spirit of investigation , and this impersonal point of view broadens and raises up all his work .

		In the hands of most European playwrights his farce of moral hypocrisy , `` Literature , '' with its shrewd hits at the proverbial artistic temperament , would be nothing more than a naughty joke ; but he makes it an ironical satire .

		His imitators are often Peeping Toms :
Schnitzler	PERSON	is always the examining physician .

		Nor must we forget that he is a Viennese , deftly clever and gaily cynical , glorying in the worldly wisdom of that most sophisticated of capitals .

		No modern playwright owes more to his environment and training than does
Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	.

		Praise has been lavished upon
Schnitzler	PERSON	's adroit dramatic craftsmanship , but the artistry of his one-act plays rests upon firmer foundations than a clever choice of words , an impressively naturalistic manner , and a mastery of technique .

		The finest effects in his dialogue are due to his uncanny skill in following the quick turns and sudden jumps that the mind makes during con - versation .

		His people are `` always coming out with the most unexpected things , '' and often they think ahead over two or three speeches that a less discerning dramatist would laboriously record .

		The scenes between the two runaways in `` The Festival of Bacchus '' and between
Margaret	PERSON	and her old lover in `` Literature '' are full of examples of these qualities , qualities that give
Schnitzler	PERSON	's dialogue vivid naturalness and brilliancy .

		His fine dialogue is even surpassed by his technical skill , and yet in some of his short plays there is an obviousness in exposition that is quite unex - pected .

		His technical forte is the light handling of the new and unexpected twists to the action , and one can never be certain how the shortest scene will end .

		In that study of disillusionment , `` His Helpmate , '' Professor
Pilgram	PERSON	buries his wife knowing that she has been unfaithful to him ; and he welcomes her lover , prepared to sympathize with a loss keener than his own , onlf to discover that the lover is already engaged to another woman .

		He orders him out , denouncing him as the faithless betrayer of his wife , only to learn that she had known of the engagement and accepted it as a matter of course .

		In `` The Hour of Recognition , '' Dr.
Eckold	PERSON	has for fifteen > r.ir - known of his wife 's affair with a man whom she had loved too well to have any affair with .

		Sophie , in `` The Big Scene , '' decides to leave her husband because he hushes up too skilfully a scan - dal that she wanted to avoid .

		Out of such iron - ical material does Schnit/ler make his best technical device .

		With him , however , these turns in the action are not theatrical tricks , nor is he intentionally cruel to his characters .

		Before he is stylist , before he is technician ,
Schnitzler	PERSON	is a specialist in psychology .

		His specialist 's point of view is at once his strength and his weakness .

HAYNES	PERSON	.

		The Spanking of Transcend en fa list Egotism EGOTISM IK GERMAN PHILOSOPHY .

		By
George Santayana	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
J. M. Dent & Sons	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Egotism , says Mr.
Santayana	PERSON	, is `` subjecti \ ity in thought and wilfulness in morals . ''

		It regards life as a continuous soliloquy , a rhapsody of dis - course ; it is marked by a craving for adventure , an incapacity to learn , a dependence on magic .

		It refuses to pass beyond the relativity of the human mind : for it nothing exists but itselt .

		It is for that reason idealistic , but not concerned with ideals , and progress is for it nothing but `` the vital joy of transition . ''

		Obviously such a way of thinking can not be sincere ; in one or an - other it must acknowledge and defer to the real - ities it denies .

		It has , hence , an inner duplicity .

		and all its terms are ambiguous .

		The effect of such a way of thinking on the German people is to restore them to a primitive and pathetic heathenism , and to inure them to a ludicrous arrogance .

		They are by nature `` simple , honest , kindly , easily pleased .

		There is no latent irony of disbelief in their souls .

		The pleasures of sense , plain and copious , they enjoy hugely , long labor does not exasperate them , sci - ence fills them with satisfaction , music entrances them .

		There ought to be no happier or more innocent nation in this world .

		Unfortunately , their very goodness and simplicity render them helpless ; they are what they are d rationed to he .

		There is no social or intellectual disease to which , in spots , they do not succumb , as to an epidemic : their philosophy i > an example of this . ''

		And their philosophy is a w < > rk having genius precisely because it pierces back through civili/a - tion and history , through all the accumulated
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 65 wisdom of tradition and experience to the blind , primitive instinct , impulse , and imagination which are the aboriginal animal stuff of all hu - man life .

		This it glorifies and exalts and in this glorification and exaltation its heathenism con - sists .

		For to be heathen is to be without `` author - itative wisdom , '' to be without a book or chart of life , to remain untaught of experience .

		Heathen - ism is a `` religion of will , the faith which life has in itself because it is life , and in its aims because it is pursuing them . ''

		The animals are heathen : German philosophy and Germanism are heathen .

		From Luther to
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and from
Goethe	LOCATION	to
Nietzsche	LOCATION	they are heathen .

		Their essence is animal egotism turned into a dogma , hypostatized as a mission .

		In substance , the doctrine of the German mission is Protestant theology rational - ized .

		Individuals give way in it to institutions and nations : so the German people are declared by
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	and
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	to be the chosen people of
Providence	LOCATION	.

		Supernatural personages give way to hypostatized social facts ; Biblical piety is secularized and consecrates social and patriotic zeal .

		God becomes vital energy ; freedom , per - sonality ; immortality , social progress .

		Every - thing goes by two names : one its `` real , '' or transcendental , the other its relative manifesta - tion .

		Consequence : `` the transcendental theory of a world merely imagined by the ego , and the will that deems itself absolute , are certainly des - perate delusions ; but not more desperate or de - luded than many another system that millions have been brought to accept .

		The thing bears all the marks of a new religion .

		The fact that the established religions of
Germany	LOCATION	are still forms of Christianity may obscure the explicit and heathen character of the new faith ; it passes for a somewhat faded speculation , or for the creed of a few extremists , when in reality it dominates the judgment and conduct of the nation .

		No religious tyranny could be more com - plete .

		It has its prophets in the great philoso - phers and historians of the last century ; its high priests and Pharisees in the government and the professors ; its faithful flock in the disciplined mass of the nation ; its heretics in the socialists ; its dupes in the Catholics and the liberals , to both of whom the national creed , if they un - derstood it , would be an abomination ; it has its martyrs now by the million , and its victims among unbelievers are even more numerous , for its victims , in some degree , are all men . ''

		The passages just transcribed and the other passages cited hardly do justice to the brilliancy , the incisiveness , and the cruelty of this remark - able book .

		Surveying as it does in a few pages the whole growth of historic German thought , it can not help , in spite of the evident Tightness of its central theses , working injustice by omissions and dogmatic assertions , such as are surprising from a writer usually so just and urbane as Mr.
Santayana	PERSON	.

		The work is really too sketchy and too abstract and its tone too biting and passion - ate to carry the conviction that is due the truths it expresses .

		These qualities make the truths seem even less than half-truths and the book partisan .

		It should be supplemented with
John Dewey	PERSON	's `` German Philosophy and the War . ''

		The two together will give a fairly adequate idea of the influence of philosophic thinking on the motives and institutions of men .

		Rediscovery and Romance LIMEHOUSE NIGHTS : Tales of
Chinatown	LOCATION	.

		By
Thomas Burke	PERSON	.

London	LOCATION	:

		NIGHTS IN TOWN : A
London Autobiography	LOCATION	.

		By
Thomas Burke	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Allen & Unwin	ORGANIZATION	; 7s . -RRB-

		The two substantial books of tales and sketches of
London	LOCATION	which Mr.
Thomas Burke	PERSON	has collected and published since the war began are of a stuff which the world may find out - moded in the unhappy years to come .

		They are books which might have become only items in the `` new literature '' of the century 's second decade had the revolution of war not prevented , for Mr.
Burke	PERSON	is not only one of those who rediscovered romance ; he is also of those who taste to the full the romance of their own rediscovery .

		Some fifteen tales of
Limehouse	LOCATION	, the Chinese quarter of
London	LOCATION	in `` the thunderous shadows of the great Dock , '' and some twenty sketches of
London	LOCATION	complete Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's present contri - bution .

		To write about
Chinatown	LOCATION	is a repor - ter 's holiday ; to write about
London	LOCATION	, giving yourself no limitations but that of the mystic city itself , and to write with love and care and beauty , is a hard and bitter labor , no matter what talents you may have .

		Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's pass - ing repute comes from the tales of terror which the libraries were compelled to bar from their shelves ; but to those who have some respect for the English tongue and for whom
Walter Pater	PERSON	has not lived in vain , Mr.
Burke	PERSON	will always possess an attraction because he has written well 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	his slight sketches of
London	LOCATION	life .

		In both these books one hears the cry of a great joy .

		At the age of ten the author was taken with the flaring beauty of a fried-fish shop , throwing a warm light and a glamour over the dusky pave - ment of a
London	LOCATION	slum ; and since then he has been passing from discovery to discovery , rejoic - ing that these things , these common and tawdry things , are still in existence for him to discover again .

		He knows well that they were revealed long since , but he makes fresh starts and every - thing is new and beautiful to him .

		Because everything is strange to him , Mr.
Burke	PERSON	never quite succeeds in his tales of
China	LOCATION	- town .

		He writes of Limehouse as
Pierre Loti	PERSON	writes of
Annam	LOCATION	and of
Iceland	LOCATION	, with the heart of a wanderer who will not be consoled for his separation from home .

		Lust and wildness , cruelty , perversion and madness , things unclean to the white man 's heart , make up the themes of his stories .

		He has continually to drive his plots with little daggers of exaggeration because he is always impressed with the uncommonness of the people of whom he writes .

		Will it be the story of a burglar 's wife who tries to betray her husband to the police so that she may be free to love his accomplice , or the story of a girl who loses caste by going with a Chinaman in order to pay her mother 's funeral expenses ?

		The reality of his events does not satisfy the author ; he must try to be convincing by a turn of the plot , so that we get the ten-cent magazine type of sud - den and perverse denouement .

		It is not the hus - band but the lover who is killed by the police ; the girl gets her revenge by a neat trick , revealed in the last line of the story .

		These `` Limehouse Nights '' appeared in three of the most interesting periodicals of
England	LOCATION	: `` The English Review , '' `` Colour , '' and `` The New Witness , '' and I can hardly imagine the editor of any one of them insisting that Mr.
Burke	PERSON	get more punch or pep into his work .

		I arrt afraid he is really to blame for his shortcom - ings .

		He is certainly to be credited with his good things , because he seems a writer with no deriva - tions .


Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	might have written some of these tales , but you can not trace
Burke	PERSON	to
Bierce	LOCATION	, because you are in the presence of a sin - gularly powerful inspiration with which literary affinities have very little to do .

		Mr.
Arthur Machen	PERSON	, the unknown master of the artistic tale of terror , probably returns Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's evident admiration .

		One suggests these names to comcv a bit more clearly the quality of Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's stories ; that is all .

		Strange and terrible stories , one hesitates to retell them , not because it would be unjust , for these are good stories and the outline of a good tale will always bear repetition .

		But they are about things we are none of us too anxious to name , and which Mr.
Burke	PERSON	makes tolerable only by the flooding beauty of his telling and the human kindness of his spirit .

		He knows at least that one must not call down the gods of terror without praying softly to the gods of pity .

		1 take one tale , an artist 's story of those famous Sidney Street murders in which the world was once absorbed , those murderers for whose capture the soldiery of
England	LOCATION	was called out , against whom a street became a barricade and a funeral pyre .

		Mr.
Burke	PERSON	calls it ``
Beryl	PERSON	, the
Croucher	PERSON	and the Rest of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		He starts you with the
Croucher	PERSON	, a slugging prize-fighter , and
Beryl	PERSON	, the girl whom he buys in a fit of drunkenness .

		He tells you how the
Croucher	PERSON	's father broke in upon their assignation with the news that he had killed a man , and how the
Croucher	PERSON	, putting lust aside , makes a barricade in the procurer 's room and fights to the end .

		But what an end when , days later , he rushes from the burning room into
Beryl	PERSON	's arms .

		`` There was talk , curious talk , the talk of a woman of thirty to the man of her life , monstrous to hear from a child to a boy of nineteen .

		There were em - braces , garrulous silences , kisses , fears and trem - blings .

		In those moments the
Croucher	PERSON	awoke to a sense of the bigness of things .

		He became enveloped in something ... a kind of .

		.

		.

		well the situation and , oh , everything .

		The murder , the siege , all
London	LOCATION	waiting for him , and that sort of thing .

		It gave him a new emo - tion ; he felt proud and clean all through .

		He felt , in his own phrase , like as though he was going to find something he had been hunting for years and forgotten .

		One would like to know more , perhaps , for it might help us to live , and teach us something of pity ... '' There are other stories , some too terrible for thought , some cheaply startling , one , at least , lovely and lyrical .

		Yet if Mr.
Burke	PERSON	had writ - ten only these stories justice could only say of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 67 him that he wrote stories which , in the eyes of English critics , were as good as the stories they imported from
America	LOCATION	.

		Our reputation for short-story telling is as marked here as our repu - tation for telling tall stories .

		Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's au - thority comes not from the rediscovery of
Chinatown	LOCATION	; that lay waiting for his step .

		It comes from the rediscovery of
London	LOCATION	.

		`` It is the Call not only of
London	LOCATION	, but of Beauty , of Life .

		Beauty calls in many voices ; but to me and to six million others she calls in the voice of Cockaigne , and it shall go hard with any man who hears the Call and does not an - swer . ''

		So Mr.
Burke	PERSON	pronounces Cockney .

		Because it is the call of beauty he can never be a slummer ; because it is the call of life he can never be a reformer .

		Here , in a book which traverses the fastnesses of conventionality in
Bayswater	LOCATION	, the open streets of hospitality , the commons of sudden friendship , and the mews and alleys of equally sudden violence , Mr.
Burke	PERSON	discloses himself .

		He writes of his early life , the disasters of a Fleet Street apprenticeship , and one under - stands why he has no harsh words for the beastly and the low .

		He has too often partaken of their bread and salt .

		But his precious purity of vision lies in his abnormal ability to write with love and friendship of those whom our novelists are pointedly ignoring , or only dragging forward into shame and ridicule .

		I mean the real middle classes those whom
Dante	ORGANIZATION	rejected and whom
Dickens	PERSON	folded to his heart ; those who make neither great affirmations nor heroic rejections , but live in placid gentleness , Philistine but not tyrannical , with the good heart and a mind kept in its proper place .

		He will take his fling at
Kensington	LOCATION	, `` touched with the temper of
last night	TIME	's soda-water '' because `` there are no girls and no women ; they are all young ladies . ''

		The gilded haunts of virtue can not appeal to him .

		But he will go to
Clapham	LOCATION	, where mothers keep watchful eyes on daughters , and to a whist-drive at
Surbiton	ORGANIZATION	and call these happy nights .

		The wanderings take him to the Scandinavian quarter and to the
Ghetto	LOCATION	, to the black Isle of Dogs with its workers , and to
Hoxton	LOCATION	where gangs of bashers were wont to play with the police .

		Round the halls or to the promenade concerts , into
Soho	LOCATION	with its restaurants from
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		But wherever he is , the Cock - ney remains , rejoicing in his great domain .

		The Cockney for whom ``
Tipperary	LOCATION	'' was false in one thing : `` Good-by Piccadilly , farewell Leicester Square . ''

		Little did the Cockney care about these show-places of
London	LOCATION	; he had his little shrine elsewhere , in Seven Sisters Road , in
Marylebone	LOCATION	, in
Walthamstow	LOCATION	cr Wormwood Scrubs , far be - yond the sound of the bells which make him a Cockney in all accuracy , but part of
London	LOCATION	none the less .

		Wilde wrote once of a great man 's `` shrill cockney cry of delight in discovering
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and rightly , because there were wonders more fair in
London	LOCATION	town .

		To these wonders the new Cockney comes , crying softly and in a likable voice .

		He has discovered that his home is a place of strange enchantments ; he is always finding his way to
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	by way of
Clapham Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Cockney remains in Mr.
Burke	PERSON	.

		Else he might have become a super-guidebook , in the manner of
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	.

		The Cockney demands population ; take Mr.
Burke	PERSON	away from human beings and he is lost ; he will write you all man - ner of lovely things about the luminous streets , but it will not last .

		His ear will hear an organ grinding out `` Let 's all go down the Strand '' and you can not keep him from beating time .

		Then he will go down the Strand and swear softly at the despoilers of its
Sunday	DATE	joys .

		He writes about everything that is human and he is satisfied with humanity as subject-matter .

		I am sure that he has been called a stark realist , but since realist has come to mean one who hates humanity enough to lie about it , the name will not pass .

		Mr.
Burke	PERSON	is , I fear , out of class , be - cause the category for him was just being elab - orated when the war broke out .

		He would be with those who have passed through the gray days of pessimism and hatred and even through the soppy days of pity for everything human and divine .

		He would have been a cheerful compan - ion for the writers who are looking with clear eyes on the world they have discovered for them - selves and who know that the essence of romance is that all things are new .

		We saw the faint beginnings of this romance in such a book as `` Carnival , '' and I fear we have seen its end .

		Our novelists may love the world after the war ; but it is questionable whether the world will have time to return the affection for many years .

		Possibly Mr.
Burke	PERSON	's books , at once vig - orous and wanton , may be respected afterward ; one fears only that they will be found a little purposeless , a little lacking in social direction .

		It is that lack , of course , which makes them so attractive .

		For , it may be mentioned , these are wonderfully good things to read .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	> BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS THE RUHLEBEN PRISON CAMP .

		By
Israel Cohen	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Cohen	PERSON	's book is a substantial and inter - esting contribution to the already vast literature of the present war .

		It is an absorbing story of life in a great concentration camp in which more than 4000 British civilians were interned by the German government soon after the outbreak of the war .

		The author is an English Jew , who was a newspaper correspondent in
Germany	LOCATION	at the beginning of the war .

		Arrested for no other rea - son than that he was an alien enemy , he was im - prisoned three different times in the city jail of
Berlin	LOCATION	and finally interned in the concentration camp for civilians at
Ruhleben	LOCATION	, where he was con - fined for nineteen months .

		His story is a recital of hardships , of brutality , and of despair almost without parallel in the his - tory of modern warfare .

		The prison camp was a race-course near
Berlin	LOCATION	, the stalls and lofts of which were converted into barracks into which the prisoners were huddled and jammed like animals .

		Without the most ordinary comforts , insufficiently fed and warmed , without adequate bathing facil - ities , without proper medical attendance , denied all newspapers except a cheap
Berlin	LOCATION	sheet , forbidden to see their wives and children for the first seven - teen months after the opening of the camp , limited in their postal privileges to the writing of one short letter each week , subjected to the most rigorous military discipline , severely punished for trifling in - fractions of the prison regulations , their physical suffering and mental torture was indescribable .

		The privilege of engaging in sports having been tardily wrung from the camp authorities upon pay - ment of

		Societies of various kinds , literary , artistic , social , professional , and athletic , were formed ; educational classes were or - ganized ; concerts , plays , and lectures were staged and a variety of similar expedients adopted to dis - tract their minds from constant brooding .

		GERMANY IN DEFEAT .

		By Count
Charles de Souza	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The author of these convenient volumes has succeeded in doing an admirable thing .

		A soldier himself , and interested in the larger strategic as - pects of the war , he has written a book which will be read with pleasure by the non-military man .

		He has performed a much-needed service to the general reader by bringing order out of the chaos left in most minds by the daily press .

		Though he deals with campaigns and victories , and the mistakes of commanders , he has a clear vision of the relative importance of events , and brings be - fore the reader the great stage of war in its true setting .

		Count de Souza is , however , a thorough parti - san , and his book will not be agreeable reading for adherents of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		As his title indi he believes that
Germany	LOCATION	has been fighting a losing cause since the
Marne	ORGANIZATION	.

		He looks upon all her subsequent acts as those of a fighter who has been put upon the defensive .

		As in the earlier volumes , he pictures
Marshal Joffre	PERSON	as the outstanding military figure of the war the true master < > i grand strategy .

		He makes clear to the reader that
Germany	LOCATION	was not set to capture
Paris	LOCATION	or War but to crush the French and Russian armies , neither of which results she was able to attain .

		He therefore minimizes the importance of the great Russian campaign of
1915	DATE	, and argues that in the fundamental sense it was a failure for Germain , or at most a barren victory .

		He keeps forever in mind the essential fact that delay is fatal to the German cause , and that her whole strategic plan was based upon an early and overwhelming success .

		Count de
Souza	PERSON	is a special pleader , but no follower of the
Entente	ORGANIZATION	will fail to be thrilled by his argument .

		In closing the present volume with a description of the Battle of
Verdun	LOCATION	, he again sets in the foreground the great figure of the patient
Joffre	PERSON	, strategic genius , conserver of his men , un - shakable believer in that nibbling policy by which , in the author 's opinion , the downfall of the Ger - man military power is to be achieved .

		THE BRONTES AND THEIR CIRCLE .

		By
Clement Shorter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dutton ; 50 cts .

		Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	's large book is here brought out in the convenient `` Wayfarer 's Library . ''

		Though the size and print are smaller , nothing is omitted .

		In running through the book , the reader feels again how great is his debt to Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	for these new Bronte letters letters which reveal so much of the three sisters , especially
Charlotte	LOCATION	.

		Aside from the letters , however , the book is not particularly valuable .

		Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	does not suf - ficiently unify the story ; nor are the conclusions he draws always trustworthy .

		For instance , he denies that
Charlotte	LOCATION	had any particularly warm feeling for
M. Heger	PERSON	, whereas both the letters and the novels are direct witness that the author of
Jane Eyre	PERSON	suffered from unrequited affection .

		It can hardly be denied that the tang of reality in her stories is attributable to her sufferings .

		On the other hand , it is presumptuous to assume that the love was a guilty one ; it seems rather to have been the fixed idea of a strong feminine mind fas - cinated by a virile personality .

		The editor draws other conclusions that are not altogether justifi - able , but one is grateful for his patience in fer - reting out many contributions to the
Bronte	LOCATION	story .

		THE JOYOUS ART OF GARDENING .

		B \
Frances Duncan	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		`` The Joyous Art of Gardening '' is an alluring title .

		It sounds as if
Miss Duncan	LOCATION	had discovered some royal road to miracles of garden loveliness and gardener 's skill in producing them .

		Further ex - amination discloses that most > !

		> i : iu - .

		m 's chapters are matter-of-fact expositions , intended
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 69 for beginners about to embark on `` The Joyous Adventure of a
First Garden	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		They treat such prosaic subjects as what and how to plant , how to prune shrubs , the possibilities of fences and lattices , how to make slips and cuttings , and so on .

		But as there is , after all , no royal road to suc - cessful gardening , and as `` The Joyous Adventure of a
First Garden	ORGANIZATION	, '' like other joyous adventures of a first baby , a first trip to
Europe	LOCATION	, and so on , is the most wonderful of all garden adventures , we consider Miss
Duncan	PERSON	's title justified .

		One flaw we find in her book : all the particularly joy - ous pictures show pools , but in the text we find no mention of water in gardens , except as applied with a hose or a watering-pot .

		To offset this defect noticeable , perhaps , only to a gardener who happens to be struggling with the problem of a suitable pool it is only fair to call attention to the delightful first chapter , `` In Praise of Garden - ing . ''

		`` There be delights , ''
Miss Duncan	PERSON	quotes from an ancient writer , `` that will fetch the day about from sun to sun and rock the tedious year as in a delightful dream '' ; and she proceeds , with a contagious enthusiasm , to suggest some of the `` 1,000 delights of gardens '' that the old-time gar - den-lover enumerated .

		Lately Dame Fashion set her devotees to planting sweet peas and roses ; now the war has switched the emphasis to beans and `` spuds . ''

		But we must have the flowers too , and as the practical result of long and varied ex - perience ,
Miss Duncan	ORGANIZATION	's garden-guide will stimulate interest and furnish valuable information to the garden-adventurer whose high ideal is not size or showiness or expensiveness but that far more elu - sive garden-quality , charm .

		SHOULD STUDENTS STUDY ?

		By
William T. Foster	PERSON	.


Harper	PERSON	; 50 cts .

		The felicitous title of this little book suggests a cleverness of style and a tone of mild irony , which run through the whole argument .

		The author is at odds with many tendencies of college life , and against certain obvious abuses he wields an effec - tive , if not a weighty , weapon .

		Many of his hits , too , are palpable ones , and will appeal to college boys themselves ; and few of the conclusions can be successfully opposed .

		The thoughtful reader , however , after a diverting hour , will lay down the book with a feeling that all has not been said .

		Though it is true , as the author in many ways points out , that students ought to study , it is not so certain that they ought always to study what faculties prescribe ; and this large field of argu - ment is but lightly touched in Mr.
Foster	PERSON	's enter - taining volume .

		He gives many figures to prove that students of high scholarship supply the larg - est number of men distinguished in later life , and no one will be surprised at the statistics which show that , of the low scholarship men , few attain prom - inence in later years .

		One can not help wondering , however , whether the college curriculum has made a successful search of the aptitudes of all the men who are tried by its tests .

		The business world , for in - stance , has not yet accepted the college .

		The prejudice of an older day against book-learning will not down , and it is by no means certain that the colleges have made more than a start in the reform which practical men have expected .

		It would be interesting to hear what so skilful a pleader as Mr.
Foster	PERSON	might say on the subject of adapting colleges more closely than now to the manifold needs of the time .

		But it would be unfair to imply that this book is not a stimulat - ing one .

		It carries its points with force , and it is written in a style that is pungent , and at times brilliant .

		THE TOMB OF SENEBTISI AT LISHT .

		By
Arthur C. Mace	PERSON	and
Herbert E. Winlock	PERSON	.

		Metropolitan Museum of Art ; paper ,
$ 8.	MONEY	; boards ,
$ 10	MONEY	.

		The first publication of the Egyptian expedition of the Metropolitan Museum is this handsome quarto volume by the assistant curators of the museum 's department of Egyptian art .

		The work of the expedition was begun in the
winter of 1906-07	DATE	on the site of the pyramid-field of Lisht , which includes the pyramids of Amenemhat 1 and Senusert 1 , of the
Twelfth Dynasty	ORGANIZATION	, with `` royal '' cemeteries surrounding them .

		Up to
1915	DATE	the major part of the work had been upon the northern end of the site the pyramid of Amenemhat .

		The results of an important part of the work are given in the present volume .

		Text and drawings , photogravures and colored plates present and de - scribe the site and the tomb , the clearing of the tomb , the coffins and canopic box , the jewelry , ceremonial staves , and pottery .

		Appendixes con - tain notes on the mummy , by Dr.
G. Elliott Smith	PERSON	, and an index of names of objects from the painted coffins .

		Mr.
Albert Morton Lythgoe	PERSON	, curator of the department of Egyptian art , is general editor of the publications of the expedition .

		THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF
CHRISTOPHER PEARSE	PERSON	CRANCH .

		By
Leonora Cranch Scott	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		The reader who is accustomed to think of
Chris	PERSON	- topher
P. Cranch	PERSON	as a Transcendental poet may be surprised to find how small a part either Trans - cendentalism or poetry occupies in this `` Life and Letters . ''

		Trained for the Unitarian ministry and for some years a successful preacher , though never regularly settled , Cranch became in old age a sort of cheery agnostic .

		Transcendentalism marked one of the stages of thought through which he passed .

		He was all his life devoted to poetry , as he was to music ; but after he abandoned the ministry , painting was his chief occupation .

		It was his love for this art that led him to spend much of his time abroad , and his success was recognized in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	as well as in
New York	LOCATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		His writings brought him some rep - utation and some money .

		Possibly the reason that they brought no more may be guessed from a letter which Story wrote him in
1856	DATE	: `` We all know that you can do much better if you choose to put your energies to work ... Do n't get lazy over it , and think it will do itself .

		Brace up your fac - ulties , and think you touch gold thereby ... I pray you on my knees , oh !

		Cranch , wake up to 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	this and do it well . ''

		This was apropos of a prose story to follow `` The Last of the Huggermuggers , '' but it is significant that he never wrote a better stanza than the one beginning `` Thought is deeper than all speech , '' published in the `` Dial '' about
1840	DATE	; and that he never fully got over the loose - ness that would let him rhyme `` Jehovah '' and `` over '' in his `` Hymn to the Pilgrims '' of the same date .

		Mrs.
Scott	PERSON	tells us that her father 's man - uscripts were submitted to
George William Curtis	PERSON	, who `` decided that further publication would add nothing to the fame of his friend . ''

		Strictly speak - ing ,
Curtis	PERSON	was probably right .

		With a few ex - ceptions the selections from
Cranch	LOCATION	's letters , jour - nals , and autobiography give no deep insight into the heart of the man , and many of them do not even tell the most significant facts of his life .

		His biographer has shown a daughter 's partiality in including accounts of travels , which , while pleas - antly written , add little that is worth while .

		Cranch seems to have been a man whose character is best seen as reflected by his friends .

		By far the most valuable part of the book is made up of the letters he received from others .

		Besides early notes from
James Freeman Clarke	PERSON	and
Emerson	LOCATION	, there are several letters in
Lowell	LOCATION	's happiest manner , several from the Brownings in one of which Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	gives in detail both her own and her husband 's criticisms of one of Cranch 's poems and many from
W. W. Story	PERSON	and
George William Curtis	PERSON	.

		A few , like those of Curtis from
Berlin	LOCATION	, are valuable for themselves ; but most are of the sort that reveal the recipient as well as the author .

		The man who could inspire them had a rare nature , and their publication is a proper and a welcome filial tribute .

		JESUS , THE CHRIST , IN THE LIGHT OF PSY - CHOLOGY .

		By
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	.

		2 Vols .

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		The late
Josiah Royce	PERSON	, writing about `` what is vital in Christianity , '' succeeded in making out that what is vital in Christianity is Royceian trans - cendentalism .

		Mr.
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	makes out that what is vital in Christianity is the particular fashion in modern psychology that he most affects .

		But where
Royce	PERSON	turned his trick in a few thou - sand words , Mr.
Hall	PERSON	takes two ponderous vol - umes to turn his , with the display of erudition , neologisms , and liveliness long familiar to readers of this voluminous writer .

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	thinks that the world is in sad need of a renovated Christianity .

		At present this re - ligion is out of keeping with the spirit of the times .

		It has undergone the mutations of periods of the - ological , speculative , and historical-philological re - thinking , each mode transmuting it to its own form .

		To-day these modes are outgrown : the dominant interest of the times is the psychological , and the psychology is the psychology of
Freud	LOCATION	.

		That great investigator of the mind of man in severance and aggregation , has shown that reli - gion and art are largely symbols which `` sublimate '' and vicariously realize all sorts of underground wishes and impulses that the compulsion of ter - ranean living represses .

		The rethinking of tianity in these terms may save Christianity , which is to-day in a parlous state .

		Such a rethinking is a problem in the psychogenesis of belief .

		To take the gospels literally is infantile , as is a child 's tak - ing
Blue Beard	ORGANIZATION	literally .

		Experience teaches us that Jesus is a symbol , that Christianity is a s \ m - bol .

		The meaning of the symbol changes with the time , the place , and the condition , but it always designates more or less adequately the innermost \ vishes and hopes of men .

		At first symbol and meaning are regarded as identical : there is a `` period of spiritualizing the material '' ; then they are regarded as distinct ; a constant reinterpretation becomes necessary ; there ensues a period of ar - tistic `` sensualizing of the intellectual and the spir - itual . ''

		`` Even , '' hence , `` if the historical existence of Jesus were disproven , we should have to post - ulate some such person at about this time , place and circumstance . ''

		For man craves a symbol for his `` eternal nature , '' and for this Jesus must stand .

		His life story must integrate and dignify the strug - gle between what is good and what is evil in man .

		His character must be infinitely complex ; indeed , all things to all men , the realization of all ideals , the artistic projection of the vital hopes and lies , we might add that severally animate us all and are our Bethlehemic stars .

		So Mr.
Hall	PERSON	, learnedly and interestingly enough , contributing his share to the modern obscurantism that insists on having , in
Christianity	LOCATION	, the old shadow with a new substance .

		A candid psychol - ogist might be invited to say whether the deference to this shadow , to
Jesus	LOCATION	, to Christian myth - ology , and to all the rest , is not itself an infantil - ism , a survival from the thinker 's wishes and fears and prepossessions of childhood .

		For , we may per - tinently ask , why should the new wine of psy - chology be poured into just these old bottles of Christianity ?

		Is not the back yard of civilization littered with old bottles enough ?

		And why , indeed , old bottles ?

		Is there anything in the Freudian mechanisms to compel the use of old ones ?

		In sum , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's psychological treatment of Jesus and Christianity reminds the reviewer of the famous summing up of the gospel of the late Modernist movement in the Catholic church : `` there is no God and
Mary	PERSON	is his mother . ''

		THE BEGINNINGS OF PORCELAIN IN
CHINA	LOCATION	.

		By
Berthold Laufer	PERSON	.

		Field Museum of Nat - ural History .

		Dr.
Laufer	PERSON	, the curator of anthropology at the
Field Museum	ORGANIZATION	, occupies a unique place among American scholars .

		From a sinologue saturated with the ethnological point of view , he has devel - oped into an ethnologist who has indeed chosen
China	LOCATION	for his special sphere of inquiry hut never ceases to regard Chinese civilization in its relations to that of surrounding nations and of mankind as a whole .

		Hardly any of his monographs , however specialized a treatment may be suggested In its title , can be ignored by the student of culture , and his latest volume is a veritable treasure-trove for the ethnologist , the Orientalist , and the anti- quarian .

		The notion of glazing pottery was de - rived by the Chinese from the
West	LOCATION	through their
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 71 relatively late contact with the Greek culture-area during the reign of the Han dynasty , and espec - ially that of the Emperor Wu -LRB- 140-87 B. C -RRB- .

		Original experiments with glazing were under - taken , and about the middle or close of the
third century	DATE	of our era a type of ceramic ware had arisen which agrees absolutely with the later por - celain in chemical composition but differs in appear - ance owing to its porosity , which is probably caused by the use of too coarsely ground material .

		At last genuine porcelain resulted about the be - ginning of the seventh century as the end product of a long-continued series of experiments and im - provements .

		It can not therefore be attributed to a single inventor but is due to the united efforts of generations ; and we have here a striking instance of how an alien idea may not only be assimilated but even come to stimulate creative activity .

		Dr.
Laufer	PERSON	is wont to interlard his monographs with supererogatory side remarks as illuminating as the main discussion , and here he appends a whole chapter on `` The
Potter	PERSON	's Wheel . ''

		His point is that hand-made and wheel-turned pottery belong to entirely distinct cultural domains .

		The latter can not be regarded as the natural , let alone neces - sary , evolutionary derivative of the former .

		Hand - made ware is practically always manufactured by women ; wheel-turned pottery is always made by men .

		Man applied the wheel , a device originally connected with the cart or chariot , to the ceramic problem ; the origin of the potter 's wheel is clearly revealed by East Indian specimens , where the spokes are still preserved .

		It belongs to the com - plex of ideas which ancient
China	LOCATION	shared with other Asiatic civilizations of hoary antiquity , with the plough and the ox as representatives of masculine husbandry as opposed to feminine till - age with the aid of the hoe .

		The potter 's wheel is thus not merely of ethnographical significance but is also bound up with one of the most persistent forms of a sexual division of labor .

		Dr.
Laufer	PERSON	's paper is thus doubly suggestive in shedding light on the psychology of technological progress and in establishing an important sociological correlation .

		TEXAS THE MARVELLOUS .

		By
Nevin O. Winter	ORGANIZATION	.

Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		To the `` See America First '' series Mr.
Nevin O. Winter	PERSON	adds a spacious volume on the wonders and beauties , the riches and large possibilities , of the
Lone Star State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The history of this common - wealth has been made so familiar in connection with the Mexican War that no additional general chronicle of its checkered course was needed ; hence the earlier and historical chapters of the book are less notable and less distinctive than the later pages depicting the present condition of
Texas	LOCATION	, its in - dustries and resources , its spirit of progress -LRB- espec - ially noteworthy is the account of `` Pioneering in Government Affairs '' -RRB- , and some of the marked characteristics of its far from commonplace popula - tion .

		Special studies of `` the Hero of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	, '' `` Historic San Antonio , '' the old Spanish missions , life in the early days , ranches and ranching , and other Texan topics , are features of the volume .

		It is the enthusiasm animating the descriptive mat - ter that most attracts the reader and holds his attention .

		The publishers have given to the text a setting little short of magnificent , large type , fifty-four illustrations -LRB- six in color -RRB- , a folding map , and an ornate binding .

		PRINCIPLES OF MONEY AND BANKING .

		By
Harold G. Moulton	PERSON	.


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The publication of Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's book affords what is probably the most complete text - book in this field of economics .

		The volume consists of `` a series of selected materials with explan - atory introductions '' ; but , as the editor is careful to explain , it is not a book of collateral readings in the ordinary sense , for it is designed `` to give the student a breadth of view , a contact with reality , a stimulus to independent thinking , and a training in judgment and discrimination which are not afforded by the ordinary text-book . ''

		The purpose of a course in money and banking is not to furnish the student with predigested informa - tion or to compel him to memorize principles ; what is desired is thought and discussion on his part , and the way to secure this desired result , Professor
Moulton	PERSON	argues , is to supply the student not only with the conclusions of economic theorists , but also with the material necessary for the formu - lation by the student -LRB- perhaps under the guidance of an instructor -RRB- of his own conclusions and prin - ciples .

		For this purpose the volume is admirably adapted .

		The catholicity of selections is shown to cite only one instance by the fact that
A. Barton Hepburn	PERSON	is quoted between two excerpts from
William Jennings Bryan	PERSON	.

		Continental and Anglo-American writers , practical bankers , and economists are represented .

		The volume deserves a wider circulation than that of the classroom .

		PRINCIPLES OF
AMERICAN STATE ADMINISTRA	ORGANIZATION	- TION .

		By
John Mabry Mathews	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Following the Civil War and the death of state sovereignty , there was a relative decline of inter - est in state government .

		The national government overshadowed everything , both for the politicians and the students .

		In recent years the state has been coming into its own again .

		It is finding itself , not as a rival of the national government , but rather as an enlarged municipality .

		For this field the state is more necessary than ever and its work is constantly increasing .

		Scholars now recog - nize this fact and are devoting serious study to the problems of state government .

		One of the latest and most important additions to this field is Professor
Mathews	PERSON	's work .

		The author follows the modern trend in dealing with civic questions in that he lays more emphasis on functions than on forms .

		About two-fifths of the book is devoted to the organization of the administration , the rest to the functions which it performs .

		The hybrid character of our state executive is well brought out in the chapters on the governor and his powers , the heads of executive departments , and the boards and commissions .

		Naturally , the conclu - sion reached is that it would be better to have a 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	grouping of about a dozen departmental heads , somewhat like our national cabinet .

		Another con - clusion is that the separation of powers has been carried to an absurd extreme .

		The book is written in clear , non-technical language and should be of use , not only to students of state government , but also to delegates who this year and next will be engaged in drawing up new constitutions .

		A SECOND BOOK OF OPERAS .

		By
Henry Ed	PERSON	- ward
Krehbiel	PERSON	.

		Maonillan ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		As its title indicates , this is a supplement to the author 's earlier work of the same nature .

		It `` con - siders the plots , the music , and the histories of those important operas which were not included in his first work , '' and the two together are supposed to embrace `` practically all the operas that are ever presented in the modern theatre . ''

		Biblical operas and oratorios and recent Italian , German , and French productions furnish topics for the bulk of the book , which is of the same useful , easily con - sulted sort as its predecessor .

		A plea is made for the further utilization of biblical themes in opera , and the biblical operas of
Rubinstein	PERSON	, whom the author confesses to have been `` the strongest per - sonal influence in music '' he has ever felt , receive considerable attention .

		In Italian opera `` Pagliacci '' and `` Cavalleria '' are by this time comparatively old acquaintances , as is also `` Madama Butterfly '' ; but it is handy to have these with other and less familiar pieces all treated in Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	's in - structive and entertaining manner .

		As in his earlier work , the free expression of his own preferences and aversions contributes to the enjoyment of the book .

		Portraits of composers and performers abound , and there are a few facsimiles of auto - graph scores .

		EGYPTIAN RECORDS OF TRAVEL IN
WESTERN ASIA	LOCATION	.

		Edited by
David Paton	PERSON	.

		Vol .

		II .


Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		The period of
Egypt	LOCATION	's greatest prestige abroad , the XVIII Dynasty -LRB- 1580-1350 B. C -RRB- , is made to speak for itself in the second volume of `` Egyptian Records of Travel in
Western Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		The aged grandee Amenemheb may be heard telling how he `` cut off the hand -LRB- trunk ? -RRB- ''

		of a huge elephant when danger threatened his lord Thutmote III in the
Euphrates	LOCATION	country .

		Or one may read in a slightly later folk-tale how Thuti , a general of the same king , captured
Joppa	LOCATION	by an Ali Baba trick .

		Thutmose 's own extensive Annals of his Asiatic campaigns are to form volume III .

		The introduc - tion of page numbers supplies an awkward deficiency of the first volume , especially when con - sidered as a reference work .

		For this function the series is richly equipped with a thorough bibliog - raphy .

		But the sign-by-sign collations are useless without
Erman	PERSON	's `` Aegyptische Grammatik , '' which none but the specialist would possess ; and the author 's previous disavowal of any claims to inde - pendent authority prepares one for various misun - derstandings in the transliteration and translation of the texts .

		The absence of explanatory notes on the geographical terms assembled in the final col - umn is unfortunate , for the reader may not suspect the identity of `` Ngbba , '' for example , with the
Negcb -LRB- Southern Palestine	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- or of `` Haarah \ \ - land '' with the city of
Aleppo	LOCATION	.

		In any ca > e. both Mr.
Paton	PERSON	and his typist Mr.
Welter	PERSON	are to be com - plimented for their devotion to an arduous task .

		THE RETURN TO FAITH .

		By
William North Rice	ORGANIZATION	.


Abingdon	LOCATION	; 75 cts .

		This slim little book , five addresses in all , taking title from the first , contains the very cream of the whole matter the apparent disparateness of science and religion , still of vital import despite the pre - occupations of the day .

		The return to faith is not presented here as due to any remarkable ver - ifications in newly found records , of old traditions , nor to geological evidence that the biblical order of creation , interpreting a `` day '' as this or that number of thousands of years , is now found scien - tific , nor to any similar finding of pseudo-scientific abracadabra .

		The return to faith is due to a be - lief in the man Jesus .

		Theism has not conquered monism .

		In the second address the author sa \ s. `` We believe in God to-day because we believe in Jesus Christ . ''

		It might do Dr.
Rice	PERSON	's thought in - justice to take this out of its context and follow it through all its negative implications ; but cer - tainly it shows the method of scientific induction beautifully contrasted with the Aristotelian cus - tom of starting with an assumed universal affirma - tive .

		In assigning to Jesus this demonstrative importance Dr.
Rice	PERSON	is not unique by any means ; he merely represents the higher religious convic - tions of most liberal Christians .

		But his book is remarkable for the unconditional and intelligent acceptance of science with all its implications .

		There is no string either to his science or to his religion .

		SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT .

		By
George R. Davies	PERSON	.

		McClurg ; 50 cts .

		The long and not wholly academic discussion of the relative merits of heredity and environment as formative factors finds a new presentation in this brief volume .

		It is interesting to note that popular thinking generally accepts the biological view of character formation , but our author takes the more recent and sophisticated view that char - acter , in its social aspects at least , is mainly the result of environmental influences .

		While giving due weight to hereditary factors , especially in relation to our purely physical traits , he devotes his space mainly to illustrating the influence of the various environmental formative factors in building up acquired characters through the learning process .

		Mental and moral characters , apparently , always have a large element of learned adjustments in them , even though they are built upon native or instinctive reactions as bases .

		The forces which make great men and great peoples are quite as much environmental or social as they are hereditary or biological .

		The science of eugenics -LRB- and eu - thenics -RRB- must come to depend more and more upon the sciences of environment , even though the laws of heredity can not be disregarded or neglected .

		Hitherto there has been a dearth of literature em - phasizing environmental forces in society .

		This little book should be welcome for its contribu - tion to that neglected field .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 73 ON FICTIOX If you were an internationally notorious gambler and an assiduous district attorney shut up your `` place '' and practically exiled you from
New York	LOCATION	, what would you do ?

		Let it be understood that the press has snapped you until an alibi is im - possible , save temporarily in the remotest quarters of the earth .

		Let it be further understood that you are a gentleman , self-made , to be sure , but absolutely `` on the square , '' with better manners than the district attorney , a nicer taste in first editions than the eminent
New York	LOCATION	lawyer who has long received generous payment for protecting your business , and a higher sense of honor than most of your wealthy and respectable ex-patrons .

		Granted further that you are middle-aged and a bibliophile , but a sociable and active one , with no intimate friends out of
New York	LOCATION	save the one faithful , enigmatical valet who insists on being in - cluded in the adventures of your `` retirement '' ; and , finally , let it be fully understood that your private character has been so subordinated to your public career that no respectable citizen , however fair-minded , wishes to associate with you .

		These are the novel and amusing problems that Mr.
Gordon Hall Gerould	PERSON	sets himself to solve in ``
Peter Sanders	PERSON	, Retired '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , a tale that is gay without vapidity and adventurous without sensationalism .

		Thoroughly to enjoy it , one should know that Mr.
Gerould	PERSON	is a college professor ; his interest in ex-gamblers gains pi - quancy from this fact .

		His stories some of the episodes of
Peter Sanders	PERSON	's career have come out in the magazines are apparently the fruits of his leisure hours .

		Unlike the tired business man , who will consider ``
Peter Sanders	PERSON	'' too analytical for his taste , Professor
Gerould	PERSON	finds thinking a delight , even at the end of a jaded day ; planning the re - tirement of
Peter Sanders	PERSON	has evidently been a truly recreative adventure .

		The book is as gay and sparkling as a trout-stream , as piquant as a spring salad , with the `` snap '' of a well-driven golf-ball , and the zest that goes with the energy one puts into good play or good work .

		We have said that the tired business man may find it be - yond him , but let that not be interpreted to mean that the book suffers from a surplus of academic atmosphere .

		Mr.
Gerould	PERSON	may be academic at times , but not when he is having fun with
Peter Sanders	PERSON	, ex-gambler .

		The sublime and the ridiculous , the depressing and the appealing , when mingled together and treated with a strong dash of humor , form a sub - stance difficult of analysis .

		So it is in `` April Folly , '' by St.
John Lucas	PERSON	-LRB- Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The novel is one of those second-rate English works , which , had it come from an American pen , would have been hailed as a masterpiece .

		It is , in fact , an extremely interesting piece of fiction a first - rate analysis of calf love in
London Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		The only difficulty lies in the comparative slimness of the subject ; it does not draw out the novelist 's re - sources .

		What really interests us in the book , and what the author finally abandons for matters that he apparently considers more important , is the character of
Rosalind	PERSON	, who guarded and guided the quartet of
Chelsea	LOCATION	musicians in their progress .

		The whole group is well sketched and we should have preferred following their adventures rather than turning to the sordid , pathetic little tragedy to which the story finally devotes its course .

		`` Bab , A Sub-Deb , '' by
Mary Roberts Rinehart	PERSON	-LRB-
Doran	LOCATION	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , is the story of a girl of seventeen who has successive affairs of the heart with a matinee idol , a married playwright , a youth of her own age , and even with an imaginary hero .

		This is padded , of course , with the usual
Rinehart	PERSON	brand of comedy , a brand which is as amusing in its way as the after-dinner talk of a care-free group of high-school girls .

		The things that pleased us in `` The Dark
Tow	LOCATION	- er '' were its economy of utterance and its sim - ple relation of a story whose characters made its telling worth while .

		In the collection entitled , `` The Derelict '' -LRB- Century ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , the only story that is really worth the reader 's attention judged by
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	's own standard of work is the title piece .

		This is a `` strong '' tale of the moral victory over a good English woman of a woman whom the world termed anything but good .

		Its telling , however , is somewhat marred by an af - fected epigrammatism .

		There is nothing profound about `` The Derelict , '' but it serves .

		Less can be said for the other stories ; the reader 's enjoyment of them will probably be proportionate to his tol - eration of average magazine fiction .

		In `` The Cinema Murder '' -LRB- Little ,

		Curiously enough , both his story and `` The Man in Evening Clothes , '' by
John Reed Scott	PERSON	-LRB-
Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , suggest that it does not pay to be too good in this world .

		The outcome of the stories justifies the heroes in their departure from rectitude .

		In Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's book a starving playwright commits murder , or intends to , and robs his victim , and from that time dates the material success of his life .

		In Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's book the hero is one of those gentlemen-thieves who rob their friends and acquaintances , but finally re - form and win the lady 's heart .

		The plot varies from type in that our thief is puzzled by the opera - tions of another member of his profession .

		Both stories are told with the proper amount of sus - pense and the proper number of surprises .

$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		How realistically the author writes of the Klondike during the gold rush , we have no means of determining .

		Her tale is mingled of humor , pathos , and sensationalism , with an unbe - coming leaning toward dare-deviltry .

		It carries a certain air of conviction and will serve for read - ers whose imaginations accept the printed page as probable truth .

		`` Enchantment , '' by
E. Temple Thurston	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-

$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , though likewise melodramatic from cover to cover , is immeasurably better because of its charming style and interesting characterizations .

		Here the persons really have life and individuality 74 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The scene is laid in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The plot shows us a man bargaining with a priest , prom - ising to send his daughter to a nunnery if he breaks his pledge not to drink .

		The hero is the romantic son of a smuggler , and when the oath is broken , he asserts himself and steals the daughter away from the nuns .

		It is a tale for all those who `` would not give a chapter of old
Dumas	PERSON	for the whole boiling of the Zolas . ''

		The village type of story appears to be coming into vogue , together with a recrudescence of fiction of a historical turn .

		`` Dominie Dean , '' by
Ellis Parker Butler	PERSON	-LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is quite up to date in these particulars , relating as it does the life of a young preacher in a
Mississippi	LOCATION	town during the Civil War .

		There is more than a touch of
Mark Twain	PERSON	in its composition , without the spark that vitalizes

		Possess - ing all the conventional characters the villain - hero , the ingenue , the other charmer , and the noble friend the plot of this novel is probably aided in modern effectiveness by its setting in the operatic world of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The book promises no great dis - traction for those readers who care to have their authors look upon life neither through a rose - nor a yellow-tinted medium .

		The original `` Odd Number , '' a collection of thirteen tales with introduction by
Henry James	PERSON	, gave many American and English readers their first introduction to Maupassant , and has long been one of the most familiar collections of short stories .

		`` The Second Odd Number , '' with introduction by Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, is bound to arouse considerable expectations and to cause some disap - pointment .

		The similarity in name and in outward form invite comparison with the earlier collection , and it is hardly to be expected that even so prolific an artist as Maupassant could produce twenty-six tales all of which are as good as his best thirteen .

		Three or four of those now given `` The Jewels , '' `` Grave-Walkers , '' `` Passion , '' perhaps `` Decorated '' may have been excluded from the earlier list because of the greater reluctance to deal frankly with sex matters , but most of them were probably omitted for other reasons as well .

		`` Tfc Jewels , '' it is true , presents a situation as striking and as tragic as that of `` The Necklace , '' and offers even more opportunity for psychological analysis ; but it is far below the author 's best in finish and perfec - tion of form .

		`` Grave-Walkers '' is more artistic - ally wrought , and the taint of unpleasantness in the subject is saved from offensiveness by the bit of psychological observation at the end .

		`` Tony , '' which for some reason is given the place of honor , abounds in sheer physical realism , and is too much for Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, whom it moves to say of Mau - passant 's occasional `` brutality '' that `` its grossness bedaubs the author and comes off on the reader , without verifying the fact presented . ''

		Perhaps the tale that in proportion and restraint comes nearest to `` The Necklace . ''

		`` The Coward , '' and `` A Piece of String '' is `` Two Friends '' already probably known to most casual readers of Maupassant .

		But the new volume is worth having , though it can never cause quite the same thrill as its earlier namesake .

Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , parallels the episodes , particu - larly the love episodes , of a girl 's life with a river in its different parts : the rill , the river proper , the marsh , the sea .

		When the story opens the girl is leading a simple life among the mountains , but as the successive episodes invariably end sadly , life itself constantly compels her to seek activity in new fields , and she finally takes up social work in
London	LOCATION	.

		The girl 's character is developed not only by the various environments but also by the different men with whom she falls in love : the dilettante who plays with her ; the unconsciously selfish man who uses her ; the consciously selfish one who marries her and with whom she stagnates mentally ; and , finally , the man who both gives and takes unselfishly and with whom she reaches the consummation of her life .

		All these characters are clearly and most interestingly differentiated .

		The whole story , in short , is a most charming idyll .

		To be sure , there is nothing new in the plot , which concerns the fortunes of a young woman who yields to the enthusiastic optimism of a
Florida	LOCATION	land agent , only to find herself mistress of a run - down orange grove .

		Finding a likable heroine in such a predicament , the reader knows that she will make an uphill fight which will end success - fully , if not romantically .

		Nor will the reader be disappointed ; rather will he find an unusually well-written story which does not put too hc.u \ a strain upon his credulity and which has a vivid charm by way of local color and much genuine humor .

		If , with the rising temperature , one is willing to abandon consideration of probability nnd im - probability and to accept the premises of

		1917 -RSB- 75 CASUAL , COMMENT WILLIAM WINTER was quite the most pro- lific and tireless of our dramatic critics .

		He began with a fine zeal , and he had the rare luck , as men go , of finding that zeal sufficient to last out a life - time .

		He had a great many admirable qualities , chief among which was an inflexible honesty .

		A man of downright personality and strongly marked style , he attracted followers in many parts of the country , and that tendency to gather adherents and inspire imitators had both its good and its bad effect on the contemporary American stage .

		The men who felt his influence were encouraged to indulge a literary feeling for words , old-fashioned to be sure , but still literary .

		To that extent he improved the technical qual - ity of critical journalism .

		Unfortunately , his shortcomings quite matched his virtues .

		He was the kind of man who finds youthful loyalties sufficient and undergoes no evolution .


Essen	LOCATION	- tially a hero-worshipper , he found it easier to worship men at a certain distance ; hence his absurd devotion to the past , his intolerance of the experiments without which no art can live at all .

		His eyes were in the back of his head .

		In style and sentiment he was already outmoded in middle life , and he showed only impatience in the presence of those characteristic modern plays that exact some genuine cerebral response .

		As a result of his limitations , he failed to speak justly or intelligently of the most vital work of his time , and for such failure in the critic no amount of industry and no zeal in recalling the splendors of the past can compensate .

		A NEW GROUND FOR ADMITTING AMERICAN COOPERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE has been discovered by the
London	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		The point of departure is , characteristically enough , that important organ - ism the British Empire .

		A loyal Boer has re - marked that the man who really found a proper name for this great conglomerate would be per - forming a valuable service for its many millions ; and the `` Times '' feels that a stronger effort would be required to substitute
Commonwealth for Empire	ORGANIZATION	than to reorganize the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's gov - ernment .

		The difficulty with British nomencla - ture , just now , appears to be that the hand of classical language shall we say , the hand of classical philology ?

		lies heavy on political sci - ence .

		Complaint is made of the juvenile habit of trying to turn English thought into Greek and Latin prose and to describe English institutions in incongruous classical terms .

		`` Some of our pedagogues even cudgel their own and their pupils ' brains to think what words an ancient Greek would have used to describe a ` U-boat ' or a ` tank . ' ''

		While such an `` obsession '' lasts , `` we shall have to look to
America	LOCATION	for the growth of the English language '' : to an
America	LOCATION	en - cumbered , by implication , with small Latin and less Greek .

		A new spirit here , however ex - pressed : one that
America	LOCATION	should meet not with slang , nor flippancy , nor breezy `` language-sling - ing , '' but as an earnest of the future cooperation , in many directions , which is to subsist between the two countries for many years to come .

		THE PERIPATETIC MAGAZINE is over our land .

		`` Off again , on again '' is its motto .

		The `` Little Review , '' once of
Chicago	LOCATION	, has reached
New York	LOCATION	by way of
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		`` Others , '' lately of
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- or its vicinage -RRB- , may be trying to reach
San Francisco	LOCATION	, or some other town , by way of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		At least
Alfred Kreymborg	PERSON	, its - originator , is reported as at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	.

		But he looked over the local field a few months ago , and now `` Others '' hazards a `` Chicago Num - ber , '' and announces that other numbers will come forth from the present headquarters on South Water Street .

		The first issue here Vol .

		4 , No. 1 , as regards the whole series opens with the obligatory poem on the Soul of
Chicago	LOCATION	, a production full of the now requisite violence and swagger ; and the number concludes with a poem by Mr.
Kreymborg	PERSON	himself , on a theme cleverly seized through the open window of the new sanctum .

		Clark Street bridge and the hen - coops of South Water Street thus take their place at the hither end of tradition , and help establish a convention for the generations that follow .

		THEORY 'S SEDUCTIVE CHARM makes fools of us all , though not of all at any one time , nor of anyone all the time .

		The beauty of a theory , until marred by the rude shock of a practical test , is to most of us well-nigh irresistibly lovely .

		Huxley used to maintain , with a chuckle of amusement , that
Spencer	PERSON	's conception of a ca - tastrophe was the disconcerting discovery of one or more instances tending to upset a plausible and attractive theory .

		Of theory harshly con - tradicted by fact the history that is now in the making is unusually full ; and it is not the occu - pants of professorial chairs at
Heidelberg	LOCATION	or
Gottingen	LOCATION	or elsewhere in middle-Europe that have been the only ones to spin theories out of moonshine .

		Even so clear a head as Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's has not kept itself wholly free from the fogs of fallacious reasoning .

		His latest war book returns once more to the plausible general - ization that the Germans , as a whole , lack in - itiative , and therefore , it is argued , they find more congenial to their nature and suited to their training the
Zeppelin	LOCATION	, with its capability of executing large designs through the instrumental -
76	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	ity of a considerable company obeying one leader , than the aeroplane , which is the machine preem - inently fitted for the exercise of individual in - itiative .

		In other words , according to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, the German was conscious from the be - ginning that `` he could not produce aviators to meet the Western Europeans ; all his social in - stincts made him cling to the idea of a great , motherly , and almost sow-like bag of wind above him . ''

		Nevertheless two of the three most skil - ful and daring flyers thus far produced by the war were `` made in
Germany	LOCATION	'' ;
Boelcke	PERSON	, the chief of them all , was most unmistakably a Ger - man ... THE WORK OF EDGAR LEE MASTERS con - tinues to be abundantly noticed by the British press .

		Critics over there are still trying to place him , to put him into the right pigeonhole , to `` find a name for him . ''

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' for example , insists that he is not a prose writer and still less a poet .

		After going through the two hundred and eighty pages of `` The
Great Valley	LOCATION	, '' the reviewer decides to call him a talker `` a person who utters his ideas in talk without stopping very long to think what he is saying , ... a primitive and provincial
Robert Browning	PERSON	. ''

		In the `` Times '' critic we evidently have a conservative one who does not relish the `` colloquial style '' that characterizes so much of free verse and does not believe that a man filled full of matter may quite trust that matter to run itself out .

		Yet there are advan - tages in speaking as one feels and in confidently letting words `` unpack the heart '' with a free runway .

		The improwisatore has many points in his favor .

		Abundance , fluency , momentum all these count to the good .

		Carry the contention too far the other way , and you begin to blame a Sorolla for not being a
Meissonier	ORGANIZATION	, a Mas - cagni for not being a
Humperdinck	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each man 's expression according to his gifts .

		There will be debits as well as credits , but the balance in the end is likely to be on the right side .

		NEW GLIMPSES OF THREE GREAT POETS arc given in the `` Cornhill . ''

		The poignant query , `` Ah , did you once see
Shelley	PERSON	plain , And did he stop and speak to you ? ''

		must , if put to
Coler	PERSON	- idge , be answered in the negative , for reasons given below ; but if `` Keats '' be substituted for `` Shelley '' the answer becomes a picturesque affirmative .

		Fresh light on the relations between the three is yielded by a new `` Talk with
Coler	PERSON	- idge , '' set down by
John Frere	PERSON	in
1830	DATE	and but now transferred from manuscript to type .

		What most British critics thought of the two young poets in the
' 20 's of the last century	DATE	is but too well and fatally known .

		What was the attitude of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, a sort of literary arbiter of the day ?

		His belated comment is by no means lack - ing in appreciation of either though it is the indulgent , rather casual comment of one who \ \ a > established , upon a brace of younger men who were yet to become so .

		The meeting with
Keats	PERSON	\ \ as an unexpected , unconventional one in the public highway , and
Coleridge	PERSON	did not learn until afterward the identity of the young man who had accosted him , though he felt the prophecy of death in
Keats	PERSON	's handclasp two UMI > before the event .

		`` I have seen two sonnets of his , '' said
Coleridge	PERSON	to
Frere	PERSON	, `` which I think showed marks of a great genius had he lived .

		I have also read a poem with a classical name I forget what '' : thus negligently do the Established take the efforts of the Beginner .

		As for
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, he got on
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's track , but missed him .

		`` He went to
Keswick	PERSON	on purpose to see me , '' says the great
Samuel	PERSON	, `` and unfortunately fell in with
Southey	PERSON	instead .

		There could have been nothing more unfortunate ... I should have laughed at his atheism ... I could have shown him that I had once been in the same state myself and I could have guided him through it . ''

		Coleridge appears to have thought that
Shelley	PERSON	needed equal guidance through his poetry .

		He `` was a man of great power as a poet , and could he only have had some notion of order , could you only have given him some plane whereon to stand and look down upon his own mind , he would have succeeded .

		There are flashes of the true spirit to be met with in his works . ''

		On the whole , it may be said that
Coleridge	PERSON	safeguarded himself adequately with posterity , in reference to his two younger contemporaries , though his dicta might have been , speaking in modern terms , `` differently expressed . ''

		... THE PORTRAYAL OF HIGH SOCIETY IN
FIC	ORGANIZATION	- TION is becoming a more exacting problem , and that exceptional publication , `` Vogue , '' gives the matter its attention .

		`` There is usually something a trifle nauseating , '' it says , `` in the attempt to display the upper circles of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		That is the pronouncement , and no word of explanation follows .

		We are not told why there is something nauseating in the de - piction of the upper circles of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, Bos - ton , and
Chicago	LOCATION	, nor why it should be more discomforting than an attempt to depict the upper circles of
New York	LOCATION	, a town which seems specifi - cally exempted .

		One can but grope .

		Is it be - cause the three cities designated have really no upper circles ?

		Or is it because they possess no authors capable of depicting them ?

		Or is it because the procedure of their authors is only a poor imitation , in manner and spirit , of the au - thors who treat
New York	LOCATION	?

		Or , finally , is it because
New York	LOCATION	is the one American cit \ which has any upper circles to render the `` dis -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 77 play '' worth while ?

		Probably this latter is the meaning intended .

		But if any of these provincial authors can produce a greater degree of nausea than several
New York	LOCATION	ones who are writing in a
New York	LOCATION	way on
New York	LOCATION	material , the country at large , along with `` Vogue , '' would do well indeed to discountenance them .

		Why , one has but to name But one can also refrain from naming .

		Better still , one can drop the whole matter ; for in these days of grim realities the display of upper circles , whether attempted or realized , may very well be dispensed with .

		GLIMPSES OF WARFARE IN THE ALPS are given by Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, who writes about anything and everything , and whose latest vol - ume deals with
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	work among the mountains of
Italy	LOCATION	's northeastern borders .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	used as an excursion-centre the small pro- vincial capital ,
Udine	LOCATION	, close to the present or shall one say , the former Italo-Austrian fron - tier .

		Among prominent Englishmen engaged in work at this `` outpost of mercy '' to fall back on the book 's title are
George Trevelyan	PERSON	, the his - torian of
Garibaldi	PERSON	, who is at the head of a staff of motor-ambulance drivers , and Dr.
Ashby	PERSON	, di - rector of the
British School of Archaeology	ORGANIZATION	, now a controller of hospital stores and bedding .

		As much too little is known about the campaignings of the Italian armies in the Alps , by reason of the singular indifference of the governmental au - thorities to a `` good press , '' Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's account of `` the spectacle of the Italian soldiers perform - ing astonishing tasks and cheerfully overcoming the most appalling difficulties '' should be wel - come ... SOME CRITICISM HAS BEEN MADE OF THE EDITORIAL POLICY which has inspired THE DIAL to publish recently occasional articles of social rather than literary character .

		In explanation the Publisher wishes to state his conviction that a war for democracy is fought as much at home as on the firing line .

		Should the end of the pres - ent war see a return to former social conditions , the war will have been a ghastly crime .

		Unless those at home begin now the creative work of clear thinking upon the principles involved , they will betray the men who are risking their lives `` in a war for democracy . ''

		It is imperative that we begin now preparing those social changes which will be the foundations of a permanent peace .

		Those changes can not be made overnight , nor can their consideration be deferred until the conclusion of a victorious peace .

		In publishing articles bearing directly upon the crisis , THE DIAL is acting upon the presumption that those who enjoy literature are not adverse to doing their bit of thinking .

		The acquisition of a bundle of unpublished let - ters written by
John Clare	PERSON	, the
Northamptonshire	ORGANIZATION	peasant-poet , to his publishers ,
Taylor	PERSON	and
Hessey	PERSON	, who , it will be remembered , acted in the same capacity for
Keats	PERSON	, brings to light the most ex - traordinary association-interest between two con - temporary poets , one great and both unfortunate , that has been recorded in recent years .

		For a supreme instant Fate seems to have brought her two nearest of kin together .

		In
March of 1820	DATE	,
Clare	PERSON	came to
London	LOCATION	.

		His poems had already been printed with a preface by his publisher .

		`` There was no limit to the ap - plause bestowed upon him , '' says his biographer ,
Frederic Martin	PERSON	.

		``
Rossini	PERSON	set his verses to music ;
Madame Vestris	ORGANIZATION	recited them before crowded au - diences ;
William Gifford	PERSON	sang his praises in the ` Quarterly Review ' ; and all the critical journals , reviews , and magazines of the day were unanimous in their admiration of poetical genius coming before them in the humble garb of a farm labourer . ''

		It was also the year of `` Lamia '' and of
Keats	PERSON	's de - parture for
Italy	LOCATION	.

		But a few months later
Keats	PERSON	lay dead in
Rome	LOCATION	and
Clare	PERSON	's popularity had so far subsided that he wrote to
James Montgomery	PERSON	, `` My New Poems do not sell ,
Taylor	PERSON	tells me , and so I must either do better or do nothing .

		I expect the rage for novels being predominant is as much the cause as anything , and I hope a better time , if not a better taste , is to follow thereafter but I dare not ques - tion that . ''

		Apparently , the rage for fiction con - tinued long in the ascendant , for in
1837	DATE	Clare was led half starved and wholly insane to the county 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 19	DATE	madhouse at
Northampton	LOCATION	, where there commenced an oblivion for the poet that lasted to his death in
1864	DATE	.

		It is recorded that he `` wrote occasionally to his son
Charles	PERSON	, but appears never to have been visited by either relatives or friends .

		The neglect of his wife and children is inexplicable . ''

		And yet it was during this period that he contributed his finest efforts to literature .

		Among these documents is a single folio sheet torn from the context of an entire letter , bearing on one side the address , dated
June 5 , 1820	DATE	, with
Clare	PERSON	's inscription , `` Cut round the Seal ,
Clare	PERSON	, '' and on the reverse a sprawling postscript comment - ing pathetically on the vicissitudes of his success with a noble patron `` I forget to mention that I yesterday wrote a very strong letter to Sir Thos .

		Plumer .

		I am in hopes to receive from him Three pounds , not more .

		I have had some failures but this must necessarily be look 'd for ... Be - low this , in

		It has been conjectured that
Keats	PERSON	, visiting his publishers at their place of business , wrote the emendation for the original passage upon the near - est piece of paper that presented itself , and that this happened to be -LRB- strangely enough -RRB- a letter from
Clare	PERSON	, then in
London	LOCATION	on a visit .

		`` Poor Keats ! ''

		writes
Clare	PERSON	in one of these letters con - cerning the preface to his `` Village Minstrel , '' of
1821	DATE	, `` I mention his name with reverence and regret .

		IRELAND 'S DEBT TO FOREIGN SCHOLARS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am obliged to Mr.
Sapir	PERSON	for adding an impor - tant name to my list of foreign scholars whose work has helped the revival of Celtic lore .

		It w.i - inexcusable on my part to leave out of such a list the name of
Rudolf Thurneysen	PERSON	: his name did not occur to me as I wrote , although , as I knew , he had been lecturing in
Dublin	LOCATION	recently at the
School of Irish Learning	ORGANIZATION	.

		The name `` d'Arbois de Jour - ainville '' was , of course , a printer 's error for `` d'Arbois de Jubainville . ''

		But Mr.
Sapir	PERSON	is wrong in regarding
Whitley Stokes	PERSON	as an English scholar of Celtic .


Whitley Stokes	PERSON	was an Irishman , of a well-known
Dublin	LOCATION	family , and his relative , Mar - garet
Stokes	PERSON	, has done notable work in Irish arche - ology .


Whitley Stokes	PERSON	went to
India	LOCATION	in the fifties and his emigration was deplored by the litcrarv and scholarly group that had centred round `` The \ .

		` in . ''

		After his retirement from the
Indian Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	he lived in
London	LOCATION	.

		1 had tin - priv - ilege of meeting him there in his last days .

		He \ \ .

		i > an Olympian old man .

		I remember his speaking of the introduction of exotic metres into English poetry .

		Browning , he said , had used Arabic metres in `` Abt Vogler '' and in `` One Word More '' al - though he had no knowledge whatever of Arabic poetry .

		Goethe , too , in his version of the Serbian ballad , `` The Wife of
Hassan Aga	PERSON	, '' had restored the original metre although he knew nothing of Slav poetry , and had taken the ballad from an Italian translation that gave no hint of the metre of the original .

		JAPANESE POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is reported that altogether about 37,000 verse - lets were submitted to the
Imperial Court	ORGANIZATION	this year on the subject `` Snow on the Distant Mountains .

		Of that grand total over 31,000 succeeded in pa ^ - ing the preliminary examination ; and out of that enormous total only seven were selected as suitable for the Imperial audience .

		Those seven had the honor of being read in company with the verses edited by the Emperor and the Empress and other members of the Imperial family .

		I shall not attempt to give a literal translation , but I should like to set down the general idea , of the two poems by the Emperor and the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Emperor 's , poem was to this effect : `` How white the snow appears on the summit of
Mount Fuji	LOCATION	as seen over the pine twigs of the Imperial garden ! ''

		The Empress developed the theme that `` The glory of the Imperial reign seems as bright as the snow on the distant mountains over the seas of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Those are sadly prosaic renderings of beautiful , suggestive verses .

		The Empress has been so gracious as to grant to the
Girls ' Higher Normal School of Nara	ORGANIZATION	a special poem , of which the following crude transla - tion from `` The Herald of
Asia	LOCATION	'' may at least serve to give a general idea : Hailing the day 's light , That rises bright Above Kasuga'a height , Blow , oh blow !

		ye beauteous sakura of hearts .

		Gather , oh gather , the tender buds of learning !

		From their pure source Do Saho 's waters course , While on their brink , From ancient trunks The willows lush young shoots put forth .

		From out the old seeking the new ,
March	DATE	, oh march , on life 's highway !

		That poem of course is not a tanka , but what is called imayo , or `` modern style '' ; it consists of eight lines of twelve or thirteen syllables each , in all about one hundred syllables .

		The Japanese word sakura , which is retained in the translation , means `` cherry . ''

		The poem is especially cherished by the students because it is the composition of Her Maj -

$ 1.60	MONEY	net The Needed Quality The quality ' of a manual on English Lit - erature is probably more important than that of any other book in use .

		Literature is nothing , if it is not a living source of in - spiration or pleasure , it can not be taught as a dead language , or a mathematical formula .

		With this in mind Professor
Miller	PERSON	planned his new text-book .

		What Sometimes Happens It is generally acknowledged that the reading habit is often greatly weakened sometimes completely destroyed in the schools .

		Tennyson knew this and despaired upon learning that ``
Enoch Arden	PERSON	'' had been adopted for class-room study .

		Dates and places are important but less important than the ideals , ideas and purposes of the great writers as shown in their works .

		Too often the boy 's or girl 's study of fact obscures the core of the subject the beauty , the stimu - lus .

		How often is this the fault of text - books , the introduction to a live matter through a dead medium ?

		What Should Be the Object The object of text-books in English Liter - erature should be to stimulate readers to a love and appreciation of the best and to lead them into the habit of reading the good and great books for enjoyment as well as learning .

		This new book by Professor
Miller	PERSON	has been planned throughout with this in mind .

		The pages are not burdened with facts but with stimulating ideas .

		Emphasis is laid upon forces and influences not upon dates .

		During the preparation of the book the author gave careful consideration to every important pedagogical principle .

		Is n't that the right sort of book for in - troducing young people to the vast field of Literature which is intended for the inter - pretation and enrichment of life ?

P. F. Madigan	PERSON	, of 561 Fifth Avenue .

Colonel Ethan Allen	PERSON	of the `` Green Mountain Boys '' to General
Richard Mnnmomen	PERSON	, at Saint
John	PERSON	's ,
Canada	LOCATION	, and dated
September 20 , 1775	DATE	.

		\ I :
Madigan	PERSON	believes that the letter is unpub - lished .

		It reads as follows : Excellent Sir : I am now in the parish of
Saint Tuores	PERSON	, four leagues to the South ; have two hundred and fifty Canadians under arms ; as I march they gather fast ; these are the object of taking the ves - sels in
Sorel	LOCATION	and
General Carleton	ORGANIZATION	.

		These objects I pass by to assist the army besieging
Saint Johns	PERSON	; if the place be taken the country is ours ; if we miscarry in this , all our other achievements will profit but little .

		I am fearful our army will be sickly , and that the siege may be hard , therefore rhux - to assist in conquering
Saint Johns	PERSON	, which , of con - sequence conquers the whole .

		You may rely on it that I shall join you in about three days with about five hundred or more Canadian volunteers .

		I could raise one or two thousand in a week 's time , but will first visit the army with a less number , and , if necessary , will go again recruiting those that used to be enemies to our cause .

		Come cap in hand to me , and I sware by the Lord I can raise three times the number of our army in
Canada	LOCATION	, provided you con - tinue the siege .

		All depends on that .

		It is with the advice of the officers with me that I speedily repair to the army .

		God grant you wisdom , forti - tude and every accomplishment of a victorious gen - eral .

		The eyes of all
America	LOCATION	, nay of
Europe	LOCATION	, are or will be on the economy of this army , and the consequence attending it .

		I am your most obedient and humble serv ` t.
Ethan Allen	PERSON	.

		P. S. I have purch ` ased four hogsheads of rum , and sent a sergent with a small party to deliver it at headquarters , and Mr.
Livingston	PERSON	and others under him will provide what fresh beef you need .

		As to bread and flower I am forwarding what I can .

		You may rely on my utmost attention to this object , as well as raising axuillaries .

		I know the ground is swampy and bad raising batteries , but pray let no object of obstruction be insurmountable .

		The gl < > r \ of a victory , which will be attended with such im - portant consequences , will crown all our fatigues .

		r 5j NEW BOOKS I A Soldier of
France	LOCATION	to His Mother The brief story of an artist-soldier who , when
France	LOCATION	called , forsook his brush and his studio to serve his country with the Poillus in the trenches .

		The work is in the form of letters written by him to his mother during the early period of the war .

		They are wonderful letters , unique because they reveal the tragic recoil of the artist-soul from the brutalities of war .

		He abhors war but he loves his country more and so he does not flinch from his duty .

		No work touching on the war has approached this in the personal and intimate aspect which it presents of the soldier in the trenches .

		THE DIAL Jfortni ` stJtlp Journal of mterarp Criticism ,
Btecustfion	PERSON	, anb Snformatioit Creative Criticism If contemporary criticism were to be judged by such practice of it as appears in magazines and even the more serious books , it would force one to believe that it had advanced very little , if at all , since the days when
Aristotle	PERSON	declared that one of the critic 's functions is to censure a work of art as being `` morally hurtful or contrary to technical correct - ness . ''

		To be sure , our notions of correctness , as well as our ethics , have changed ; but , for the most part , we have merely substituted new conventions for old , new prejudices , new rules and tabu - lations .

		The very men who laugh at the old discussions concerning `` the unities , '' themselves condemn all dramas that do not conform to a purely arbitrary thing called `` dramaturgy '' ; and a well-known professor has asserted that `` King Lear '' is not a play at all since its climax comes in the first act !

		In somewhat similar fashion , a recent biographer of Dostoev - sky , after proving in a long introduction that a novel can not be defined , proves also that
Dostoevsky	PERSON	was not a novelist !

		Such ludicrous opinions are , of course , due to the common supposition that there are genres , or predetermined forms into which the artist pours his thought .

		It seems almost impossible for critics to realize that an idea is form , that the idea is the form .

		It can not be embodied .

		Every idea is a new idea ; every work of art is a new work , a new genre .

		The artist may wrangle with his germinal impulse , twist and distort it to fit some theory of form ; but just in so far as he does so , he toils against himself .

		The critic 's misconception of these matters arises partly from lack of ability and partly from sheer laziness .

		A man of ordinary intellect may easily find super - ficial resemblances , classify them , talk of them as constituting a genre , and then proceed to discuss the work of art at hand in relation to the factitious structure he has made .

		On the other hand , to appre - hend a work of art creatively requires a taste allied in its functioning to genius , and the use of an energy not different in kind from that exercised by the artist himself .

		Probably the first great step toward what we may call modern criticism that is , modern criticism at its best was taken when
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	insisted upon the necessity of ascertaining `` what the poet 's aim really and truly was , how the task he had to do stood before his eye , and how far , with such materials as were afforded him , he had fulfilled it . ''

		At about the same time ,
Coleridge	PERSON	, the most keenly intuitive of English critics , hinted at an extension of this idea when he said that , in order to read the difficult metres of
Donne	PERSON	and thoroughly to understand his poems , it was necessary practically to become
Donne	PERSON	.

		The significance of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's remark seems to have been unappreciated even by himself , since he failed to general - ize it or to apply it in a consideration of other poetry ; and all posterior aestheti - cians , without exception , have overlooked it .

		Goethe 's idea , however , underwent a fairly steady development , and culminated in the conception of
Benedetto Croce	PERSON	that every work of art is an organism governed solely by its own law .

		Upon this and the many other conceptions so brilliantly pro- pounded in his `` Aesthetic , '' Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	bases his essays entitled `` Creative Criti - cism '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The latter 's book is far less substantial and , quite properly , far more controversial than that of the Italian .

		The `` Aesthetic '' is obtainable in an excellent English trans - lation , and its lucidly reasoned exposition of theory needs only popularization and defence .

		For this task no one in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	is better qualified than Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	, whose erudition is coupled with intellectual passion and the gift of power - ful , if sometimes impatient , expression .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	The present volume begins with a lecture called `` The New Criticism . ''

		Here , after briefly setting forth the princi - ples of impressionistic and of dogmatic criticism , the author points out that they are essentially a mere continuation of the old battle between the Romanticists and the Classicists , between those who seek to enjoy and those who desire to judge .

		As far back as the sixteenth century ,
Pietro Aretino	PERSON	was asserting that there is no rule save the whim of genius , no standard of criticism save individual taste ; while
Scaliger	PERSON	was helping to formulate the classical code and declaring that
Aristotle	PERSON	is `` the perpetual dictator of all the fine arts . ''

		The next century exposes the same antinomy in
France	LOCATION	, where it has continued until the present hour .

		These opposing types , Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	speaks of as `` the two sexes of criticism ... the masculine criticism that may or may not force its own standards on literature , but that never at all events is dominated by the object of its studies ; and the feminine criticism that responds to the lure of art with a kind of passive ecstasy . ''

		The eighteenth century produced no fundamental contributions for the old quarrel until the
Romantic Movement	ORGANIZATION	stressed the element of expression , either of society -LRB- Mme. de Stael -RRB- , or of person - ality -LRB- Sainte-Beuve -RRB- , or of race , age , and environment -LRB-
Taine	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The first , how - ever , `` to give philosophic precision to the theory of expression , and to found a method of criticism based upon it , were the Germans of the age that stretches from Herder to
Hegel	PERSON	. ''

		But it was left for a Neapolitan ,
Croce	PERSON	, to lead `` aesthetic thought inevitably from the concept that art is expression to the conclusion that all expression is art . ''

		This part of Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	's book can - not be too highly praised , and it should have distinct value even for the Classicists , since it affords the most succinct history of modern critical theory , besides being , by its grouping of facts , an original inter - pretation .

		The remainder of the essay is a summary of
Croce	PERSON	's ideas and a very cleverly argued invective against dogma - tism in all its forms .

		Following a method similar to that of Zola in his famous `` J'accuse '' Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	attacks the idea of genres , or literary kinds , of the theory `` I style , of metaphor , simile , and `` all the old terms of classical rhetoric , '' of moral judgment of literature , the `` confusion be - tween the drama and the theatre , '' of technique as separate from art , the criti - cism of poetic themes , of race , time , and environment as an element in criticism , of the `` evolution '' of literature , the concept of progress , and , finally , `` the old rupture between genius and taste . ''

		Obviously , there is here much matter for consideration , too much indeed to come within the limits of a review .

		If Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	's dismaying contentions were accepted or even merely sadly absorbed , what would become of our col - lege professors with their courses on rhetoric , the forms of literature , and the history of prose style ; or of our doctors of philosophy with their theses comparing , for instance , the grammatical construc - tions of ^ Eschylus and
Tennyson	PERSON	?

		Ami how should one write a book on the works of any great artist if one had to judge those works separately and thus to dis - card the convention that there is always a period of apprenticeship , a period of fulfilment , a period of deterioration ?

		For , be it noted , if a
Milton	LOCATION	, after a life dedicated to beauty and to toil , achieves the sublime austerity of a `` Samson Ago - nistes , '' the critics invariably find in such a masterpiece the signs of waning power , of aridity , decay ; or if a Michelangelo finally attains the almost abstract grandeur seen in many of the designs for the cele - bration of Christ 's Passion , there in - evitably appears a
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	to see in them only the `` autumn stubbles of declining genius '' .

		In the second essay , Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	is concerned only with `` Dramatic Criti - cism . ''

		This section of his book is an extraordinarily brilliant example of dia - lectical writing and of irony and humor in the service of clear , sound thought .

		For the curious , perhaps the most interesting part is that in which the author deals with
Lodovico Castelvetro	PERSON	, who , as early as
1570	DATE	, broached the theory of the drama that is now associated with the names ot Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	and Mr.
A. B. Walk	PERSON	- lev and of their `` noisy but ne ^ li ^ ihle echoes in our own eountrv . ''

		It is this
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 97 theory that Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	sets himself most vigorously to combat .

		Castelvetro , like the moderns , em - phasized the conditions of stage repre - sentation : the size of the theatre , the motley crowd , the limitation of time .

		Bacon ,
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	, and many others , also dwelt on what is to-day discussed , with an amusing air of originality , as the `` psy - chology of the crowd '' ; and even Voltaire thought to reform the drama by changing the theatre .

		We need not detain our - selves with the tenets of
Lessing	LOCATION	,
Schlegel	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Grillparzer	PERSON	, and the others who fought and re-fought the battle that began when
Castelvetro	PERSON	challenged the all - powerful standards of Aristotle .

		It is not until we come to
Francisque Sarcey	PERSON	that we have a really full and clear exposition of the theory of dramatic materialism that now reigns almost without dispute on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	; but even his famous `` Essai d'une Esthetique de Theatre '' is of less immediate interest for us than the writings of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	, Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	, and `` the negligible echoes . ''

		The chief assertions of these gentlemen are .

		all founded on a confusion between `` inner impulse and outer influence . ''

		Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	, for instance , affirms that the dramatic critic must `` sit tight '' against the prejudices and opinions of audiences and then tells us that the playwright must be judged by his effect - on the `` peculiar psychology of the crowd he is addressing . ''

		Confusion could scarcely confound itself more fully !

		It seems unnecessary to ask why , if the measure of the dramatist 's genius is to be judged by its effect on the crowd , the critic should `` sit tight '' against the very thing that would enable him to estimate that genius ; or how the critic , if he imposes on the artist one standard and on himself another , can hope to under - stand the former and evaluate his work .

		But without this confusion and with - out the rules of `` dramaturgy , '' we should have very few critics of the drama , since few there are whose creative powers are highly enough developed to enable them to put themselves in the place of the artist , thus discovering the urges and intentions of his work , and then , having experienced what he experienced , to estimate his measure of success .

		As it is , almost any - one can go , like a second-rate dog fancier carrying his standard of conformation , and appraise with perfect assurance what - ever the contemporary stage may offer .

		If he but apply his rules , perceive where the play falls outside of them and where within , and consider the audience while he `` sits tight '' against it , he may be sure that whatever issues from his pen will pass as criticism of an art !

		It is in dealing with such `` criticism '' that Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	carries furthest his in - vective an invective thrust perhaps a little too far when he characterizes Mr.
Archer	PERSON	as `` a connoisseur of stale plati - tudes , angered and confused by the thought of a new age impatient at his commonplaces . ''

		Very refreshing , how - ever , is it to find someone to whom things intellectual are sufficiently stimulating to call forth impassioned utterance instead of the usual dreary locutions of philosophi - cal debate .

		The last two essays are , comparatively , of less importance than the first two .

		In `` Verse and Prose , '' Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	finds it necessary to descant upon a good deal of familiar matter in order satisfactorily to prove that `` whatever distinction exists between words in metre and words with - out it exists in exactly the same way be - tween verses written in the same metre '' ; and that `` rhythm and metre must be re - garded as aesthetically identical with style , as style is identical with artistic form , and form in its turn is the work of art in its spiritual and indivisible self . ''

		The last essay is a letter to an artist on the
International Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	,
February , 1913	DATE	.

		It expresses , with rather vague enthusiasm , the author 's admiration for the spirit of the show , and then , character - istically , goes back to the Italian Renais - sance , but only in order to point out the well-known fact that the great patrons of that time fostered creation whereas our American millionaires merely load their rooms with old masterpieces .

		There is , however , a valuable and suggestive pas - sage in which Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	shows how the collector , like the critic , may become creative in the realm of taste .

		Lastly , in an appendix , we find a little model of effective controversial writing a tilt at Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's objections to 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	lt > the author 's `` New Criticism '' wherein we are once more led to the conclusion that `` by genius is now merely meant the creative faculty , the power of self-expres - sion , which we all share in varying degrees . ''

		In finishing a review of so admirable a book , it may be ungracious , but it should not be amiss , to say that the author is too rare a combination of scholarship and critical acumen to be heard from so seldom .

		Without being impertinent enough to advise Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	as to his activities , one may notice the fact that
Croce	PERSON	conducts the most important criti - cal magazine in
Italy	LOCATION	, the most vital in
Europe	LOCATION	, and that Mr.
Spingarn	PERSON	is com - petent to do the same thing for the
United States	ORGANIZATION	.

		Studies by him of con - temporary or past men of letters would be welcomed by all lovers of literature and would be stimulating especially to the younger generation , who are still fed largely upon the pabulum of Arnold with the old notions or a `` grand style '' and of what is `` best '' in literature .

		To attack theory with theory is valuable ; but , once the foundations are laid , it is even better to attack practice with practice .

		BAYARD BOYESEN .

		The Twilight of Rhyme In a time that now seems strangely re - mote I happened to drop in on a meeting of an
Ottawa	LOCATION	debating club in which President
Wilson	PERSON	's peace note to the bel - ligerent nations was being discussed .

		Af - ter we had been treated to a couple of innocently academic utterances , the floor was taken by a rather elderly , choleric - looking Englishman of very determined manner and voice .

		He woke us up .

		In a rambling discourse that had little connec - tion with the ostensible subject of debate , he aired his views and feelings mightily .

		He convinced those of us that had a mind to be convinced that President
Wilson	PERSON	's policy had been marked by a consistent pusillanimity worthy only of contempt , that the American people as a whole -LRB- and he knew all about it , for he had only recently visited the
United States	LOCATION	-RRB- were criminally lukewarm about the war , and that the only permanent hope for world peace lay , not in any professorial , Wilsonite notes , but in the strong arm of British sea-power .

		All of which , it need scarcely be said , was liberally punctuated by blazing eyes , wav - ing arms , and clarion intonations .

		Some of us later , incautiously and vainly , looked for an intelligible argument or two in the Englishman 's flow of rhetoric .

		No mat - ter we were all carried away at the mo - ment , and when he ended up with a triumphant snort and a bang , our answer - ing applause was nothing if not sincere .

		Only the cultured elite can resist mere elo - quence .

		I lay no claim to membership in that very exclusive species of humanity .

		Yet I was vain enough to take a certain pride in my failure to respond as unre - servedly as most of the audience to our orator 's fiery outburst of British patri - otism .

		It was the old man 's fault .

		Had he not quoted rhymed poetry at the tail end of his peroration , I should have drowned with the rest .

		That poetry of his was just the straw needed for a drowning man 's clutch .

		It tided me over nicely .

		Indeed , after a fitting interval of sur - charged silence , the memory of those rhymes , still tingling like a box on the ear , inspired me .

		with courage to get up and , in the very teeth of the storm raised by the great man , to put in an apologetic word for Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	.

		This was what the orator quoted , with a fervor that sent shivers down our backs : Breathes there a man with soul so dead Who never to himself hath said , `` This is my own , my native land ! ''

		and some more to the same effect .

		`` Aha ! ''

		said I to myself , `` is it some of Scott 's old doggerel you are trying to palm off on us ? ''

		But it was
Max Eastman	PERSON	who was uppermost in my thoughts just then .

		His `` Lazy Verse '' crusade had branched off even into the wilds of
Canada	LOCATION	and I was still vicariously smarting from the whip blows he had administered the lazy prac - titioners of the free-verse habit .

		Quick as lightning I saw my chance ; in a second I had Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	by the throat .

		Here was a moment of intense social conscious -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 99 ness , of patriotic emotion vivid and sin - cere , demanding aesthetic resources , it would seem , for its consummate expres - sion .

		The old man , in his instinctive grop - ing for a climax , felt the need too and chose a bungling anticlimax !

		Had he but called in the aid of measured blank verse or , preferably , free verse , he might have succeeded in producing a truly climactic effect .

		But what had such inane jingles as dead said , shed bed ,
Ted Fred	PERSON	, to do with the expression of heightened feel - ing ?

		What concern had we , stirred to the patriotism that dealt and suffered death , to do with pretty boudoir tricks and ro - coco curtseys ?

		It was the most magnifi - cent test case one could have desired .

		The verse came quite unexpectedly , the emo - tion was already there to be definitely crystallized .

		In my own case , alas !

		it suf - fered collapse .

		Evidently rhyme had not stood the test .

		Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	, in so far as he lays stress on rhyme as a sincere aes - thetic device , might question the diagnos - tic value of my experience .

		He might accuse the evident tawdriness of the lines themselves of the disconcerting effect pro- duced upon me , not to speak of other psy - chological analyses less flattering to my aesthetic sensibility .

		No doubt the lines stand in somewhat helpless contrast to the emotion they are supposed to call forth , but I do think it was quite specifically the rhyme as such that shunted me on to the wrong track .

		Rhyme , I decided , might do very well for certain lighter forms of poetry , the fluffy ruffles of literary art drinking songs , sentimental but not too seriously felt love ditties , vers de societe , popular ballads , and quite a number of other genres one might mention .

		In short , its value seemed purely decorative at best and not indispensably decorative at that .

		I decided that one could allow for it where graceful trifling or purely technical sound - effects were in order , but that its employ - ment in conjunction with deep feeling was perilous , to say the least .

		I had for years had an instinctive dislike for the jingle of rhyme in all but the lighter forms of verse , and it seemed that my dislike had experi - mentally justified itself in a flash of insight .

		Incidentally , I could not help feeling impressed by the purely ethnological con - sideration that rhyme is rarely , if ever , found in the lyrics of primitive people , whereas there is probably not a tribe that does not possess its stock of measured songs .

		Whatever our attitude to the prob - lem of strictly measured or polyphonic verse in our own artistic levels , it is very evident that a set rhythm at least does an - swer to a primal human trend , that rhyme , on the other hand , is no more than a bit of technical flavoring that happened to be - come habitual in
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	poetry at a certain period not so far removed from the present after all .

		Rhyme is merely a passing notion of our own particular cultural development , like chivalry or alchemy or falconry or musical canons or a thousand-and-one other interesting no - tions now dead or moribund .

		Some of these notions , like rhyme , still vegetate -LRB- for that matter , canons are still composed by students of counterpoint -RRB- , but they can - not be allowed to cumber the earth for - ever .

		No doubt rhyme will some day be thrown into the limbo that harbors its first cousin , alliteration .

		Some day all sensitive ears will be as much outraged by its em - ployment in passionate verse as by the musical expression of flaming desire in the pattern of a formal fugue .

		Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	contends that rhyme , like rhythm , has a certain disciplinary value which is of direct aesthetic benefit , in so far as it imposes a wholesome restraint on the artist .

		Rhyme sets definite technical lim - itations that tax the poet 's ingenuity .

		He has to solve technical problems , and in their solution he is braced to the utmost limit of his powers of concentration , of clarity of vision , of self-expression .

		A chastening halt is put to a too easily satis - fied , a too glibly facile flow of expression .

		The aesthetic product , which must of course appear perfectly natural and un - hampered , is all the more refined and po - tent for the painful struggle that has preceded its birth .

		The dynamic value of the overcoming of conflict in aesthetic pro- duction is by no means to be lightly set aside .

		Where Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	errs , it seems to me , is in the narrow and specific appli - cations he makes of the principle .

		Just as soon as an external and purely formal 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	aesthetic device ceases to be felt as inher - ently essential to sincerity of expression , it ceases to remain merely a condition of the battling for self-expression and be - comes a tyrannous burden , a perfectly use - less fetter .

		The disciplinary argument is then seen to belong to precisely the same category as the conservative plea for the educational value of Latin or for the wholesome restraining influence of an out - lived body of religious belief .

		In other words , there is no absolute standard by which to measure the validity of a formal aesthetic device .

		Necessary or self-evident in one age , it is an encumbrance in an - other .

		Perfection of form is always es - sential , but the definition of what consti - tutes such perfection can not , must not , be fixed once for all .

		The age , the individual artist , must solve the problem ever anew , must impose self-created conditions , per - haps only dimly realized , of the battle to be fought in attaining self-expression .

		It would be no paradox to say that it is the blind acceptance of a form imposed from without that is , in the deepest sense , `` lazy , '' for such acceptance dodges the true for - mal problem of the artist the arrival , in travail and groping , at that mode of ex - pression that is best suited to the unique conception of the artist .

		The `` best '' may , of course , be many ; it is necessarily con - ditioned by temperament .

		Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	's error , then , would seem to be the rather elementary confusion of form -LRB- an inner striving -RRB- with formalism -LRB- an outer ob - stacle -RRB- .

		But Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	seems to go further .

		He would not merely preserve rigid met - rical forms and even rhyming schemes as essential to the satisfaction of our craving for poetic form , but he seems also to have regard for virtuosity as such .

		He speaks almost as if the greater the number and difficulty of formal limitations , the greater or more admirable the aesthetic result .

		This should mean that the pinnacle of poetic art has been reached in the Skaldic verse of Old Norse literature , perhaps the most artificial verse patterns ever devised .

		Here we have alliteration , assonance , ex - treme brevity of lines , and the use of highly conventional metaphorical modes of ex - pression four difficult masters to serve at the same time .

		De gustibus !

		In truth there is no greater superstition th ; in the belief in the ever-growing com - plexity of all the outer forms of life and art .

		Progress in both means , on the con - trary , an ever-increasing will and ability to do without the swaddling clothes of ex - ternal form .

		The `` freedom '' of primi - tive culture is only an illusion , gained partly by the freshness of contrast with our own order of restraints , partly , and chiefly , by the imperfectly developed techniques of lower levels .

		Formally the great languages of modern civili - zation are very much simpler , very much less virtuoso-like , than most of the lan - guages of aboriginal
America	LOCATION	.

		Roman Catholic ritual seems rich and complex to us , but it is a mere bagatelle in comparison with the endless elaboration of the ritual life of the Pueblo Indians .


Northwest Coast Indian	ORGANIZATION	art is relatively crude in its delineation -LRB- at its best , superb -RRB- , but the purely formal limitations set on the artist 's activity would seem to us almost to pre - clude the possibility of individual expres - sion at all .

		In lower levels of culture the number of things that one must do is great ; in higher levels the number of things one may do is vastly greater , the number of things one must do relatively less .

		Progress , if it means anything at all , may be ideally defined as the infinite mul - tiplication of things one may profitably do , think , and enjoy , coupled with the gradual elimination of all things one must not do .

		We may seem to have gone very far afield , but the truth is that a proper his - torical perspective of such a problem as that of the use of rhyme can hardly be gained on a less broad foundation .

		The historical and psychological considerations affecting rhyme are by no means peculiar to it , but necessarily apply to countless other elements of art and life .

		Briefly , then , aesthetic progress can not mean that we hold on to such a feature as rhyme because it is a valuable conquest , a complexity that we have achieved in passing from a less to a more subtle grasp of form -LRB- this < / .

		* true in its day -RRB- , but that we leave it behind as already belonging to a more primitive stage of artistic consciousness .

		Once a re - splendent jewel , it is now a pretty bauble .

		In time it will have become an uglv bauble . '

France	LOCATION	of the twentieth century is striving , and striving very successfully in spite of the war , to make amends for the crass injustice done to the memory of Shakespeare during the eighteenth century , under the bigoted -LRB- in this instance -RRB- leadership of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		A vigorous `` Societe Shakespeare '' was founded this
spring	DATE	in
Paris	LOCATION	, `` with the poet acting as the connecting link , '' writes the general secretary ,
M. Valentin Mandelstamm	PERSON	, `` between the civilizations of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, where Shakes - peare has always been feted '' another of the many examples of how our entrance into the war has associated the
United States	LOCATION	with the liberal countries of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is even the inten - tion of the founders of the new society to `` establish at
Paris	LOCATION	a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	club based on the plan of the great clubs of
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, which will bring together the intellectual elite of the three great nations . ''

		But perhaps a not less interesting feature of this present Shakespeare revival in
Paris	LOCATION	is the reminder which it has called forth of an earlier and somewhat different effort in the same direc - tion .

		When the new society began to be talked about in the public prints , there appeared one day in `` Le Temps '' a letter signed by the
Duchesse Herminie de Rohan	PERSON	, the poet who is associated with so many intellectual activities in
Paris	LOCATION	,
M. Georges Lecomte	PERSON	, president of the
Society of Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	, and
M. Acollas de Larmandie	ORGANIZATION	, which pointed out rather sharply that the new organization was rather ungracious , to say the least , in making no acknowledgment of the work already accomplished by the `` Societe du Theatre Shakespeare , '' founded in
1909	DATE	by
M. Camille de Sainte-Croix	PERSON	, who died two years ago , and whose aim was much the same as that announced , `` with a flourish of trumpets , '' by the `` Societe Shakespeare . ''

		The widow of the talented and active Shakes - peare translator and impresario , `` the faithful guardian of his memory , '' as
M. Lecomte	PERSON	characterizes Mme.
Suzanne Camille de Sainte	PERSON	-
Croix	PERSON	, who is a sculptor of ability , presents this whole matter in these words , which she gave me not long ago : My husband devoted the energy of his best years , his days and nights , his health and his very life , to an effort to found in
Paris	LOCATION	a Shakespeare Theatre and to acclimate in
France	LOCATION	a love for the great English poet .

		In doing this , he encountered all those difficulties always met by him who takes the initiative in a really disinterested work , and he died at the very moment when this preliminary effort accom - plished at the cost of much labor was on the point of succeeding brilliantly .

		His task was about to be crowned with approval by the transformation of one of the largest playhouses in
Paris	LOCATION	into a Shakespeare Theatre .

		He had arranged a repertory of ten plays , with their scenery , stage settings , and costumes ; he had trained a troop of young actors ; he had selected a corps of able translators ; had done , in a word , everything necessary to produce that unity which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had in mind when he wrote his plays .

		A prodigy of this sort could have been brought about only by a veritable man of letters who was also a dramatist .

		No one who was simply an actor could have accomplished this .

		-LSB- The reference here is to
M. Gemier	PERSON	, the soul of the new
Shakespeare Society	ORGANIZATION	, who recently brought out at
Paris	LOCATION	`` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' `` with some new-fangled ideas . '' -RSB-

		To enter into the spirit of a genius as powerful , as com - plex , as varied and as subtle as that of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, one must be a man of brains who has spent years in studying him , in fathoming him , in discovering his thought and then properly expressing it , not one who is striving after striking effects and stage tricks .

		But in this world persons and things are quickly for - gotten .

		The dead can not defend themselves .

		So we must speak for them , especially at a moment when a
Shakespeare Society	ORGANIZATION	is being founded on the ideas of a grand precursor , such as was
Camille de Sainte	ORGANIZATION	-
Croix	PERSON	.

		What M. de Sainte-Croix and
M. Firmin Gemier	PERSON	have done in the
France	LOCATION	of to-day for the Elizabethan drama ,
M. Eugene Baie	PERSON	is doing for
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	and the
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	by the publica - tion of his remarkable book , `` L'Epopee
Fla	LOCATION	- mande '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	; 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- .

		It is quite impossible in a paragraph or two to give an exact and adequate idea of this complex and often dreamy volume ; and the sub-title , `` History of Collective Sensibility , '' supplies but a partial and on the whole a rather unsatisfactory descrip - tion of its character .

		If one reads the apprecia - tions from a dozen leading European writers and critics given on an accompanying sheet sent out by the publisher , one is struck by the many - sidedness of this book , which does not seem to have been translated into English and which would be exceedingly difficult to translate if the attempt were made to preserve the delicacy and elusiveness of style and thought of the original .

		Thus ,
M. Maurice Barres	PERSON	finds it `` one of the most nationalistic works of
Europe	LOCATION	'' ;
Maeter	PERSON	- linck declares it to be `` one of the most vigorous and picturesque books in our language '' ;
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	said that `` though written in prose , it is a real lyric , solidly built and violently generous '' ;
Camille Lemonnier	PERSON	held that it is `` a medullar book , and the author imperious and a man of decided convictions '' ; while another critic compares him to
Michelet	PERSON	, a second to
Taine	PERSON	, and a third to
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		And who is this author to whom such great 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	praise is given ?

		I do not find his name in any of the European `` Who 's Whos . ''

		But I know him to have been born in
1874	DATE	, at
Malines	LOCATION	, the city of the beautiful chimes , shamefully destroyed by the Germans ; and he stands forth to-day one of the best known of the Belgian writers of the new generation .

		His first book , at least 1 think it was his first , was entitled `` Sub Rosa et Sub Umbra . ''

		It consisted of subtle evocations of the life of the ancients and of the Italian Renaissance , and its appearance immediately attracted the attention of the best of intellectual
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Then the young author began to be active in parliamentary and political circles with - out being either a deputy or a politician .

		Here was another reason why eyes were turned toward him .

		His indefatigable efforts to bring about a political and economic rapprochement between
Holland	ORGANIZATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	caused considerable stir in
1907	DATE	.

		For ten years he was associated with the late
Auguste Beernaert	PERSON	, the prominent Belgian senator , in international affairs , and since the out - break of the war ,
M. Baie	PERSON	has been the soul of the
International Conference	ORGANIZATION	, whose aim is to establish an economic solidarity among the Allies .

		He announces for early publication `` La Legon des Morts , '' which will continue and complete the present volume , telling `` what strength is hidden in the Flemish temperament and what hopes this strength gives rise to . ''

		The following extract from a letter which M. Baie sent me recently from
Florence	LOCATION	may perhaps give the reader some idea of the working of the mind of this exceptional man , of the spirit which pervades his writings , and of his literary style , though , as I have already said , it is not easy to reproduce his style in a translation : It is difficult to say now what forms of art and literature will prevail in
Flanders	LOCATION	after the war , for my poor country is too distracted at present to think of such things .

		Her Muses are Weeping Muses who are shedding tears of blood , and if they had a mission in keeping with the hour , it would be that of catching the echo of those in despair , the cry of the vanquished , and then tracing in words , like the imprint on the handkerchief of
Veronica	LOCATION	, the terribly
august	DATE	record of the agony of the nation , so that it shall never , never be forgotten and the people may take pity upon itself .

		It is not necessary that the things of the imagination begin forthwith to flourish once again in our land , for each one of us bears a hell in his breast ; and nothing else can equal that .

		Our visions of this hell are so intense that it would seem that thev might break our hearts to the end of eternity .

		But what should flower again without delay for the uplift of our dear people who aspire to be reborn only through the dignity of labor , is our ancient art industries whose invention was the honor of our ancestors but which are to-day , at one and the same time , a menaced patrimony of humanity and a possible instrument of our national regeneration .

		Lace - making , high-warp , iron-work , diamond-cutting all the charming masterships and mysteries , to use a Hue old word , of my race await the coming of the holy ark in order to be reborn to-morrow .

		Indeed , how admirable it would be if the
United Stato	LOCATION	, \ \ huli bends with such tenderness of soul over our distress , should decide to open at
Antwerp	LOCATION	, after the war , a Flemish conservatory of arts and trades , on \ \ li .

		.

		-- benches places would be reserved for American students , thus creating between our two nations a bond of union which would be very dear to us .

		Ami how in conformity with the proverbial spirit of American generosity would it be to make known this idea in your noble country so that this dream of our own national redemption might to-morro \ v become a superb and certain reality .

		Why
M. Baie	ORGANIZATION	proposes
Antwerp	LOCATION	as the site for such a great school is evident after reading the pamphlet , `` Le Port d'Anvers '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Van
Oest	PERSON	; 25 centimes -RRB- , by
M. Andre Fontainas	PERSON	, the Belgian author , wherein is set forth the impor - tance of this great port before the war and what is hoped for after its restoration at the end of the German domination .

		But perhaps just now the best page in this study for Americans to read is that devoted to the history of
Herr Albert von Bary	PERSON	, that typical Teuton in foreign parts , who resided at
Antwerp	LOCATION	thirty years , until he became one of the most feted and powerful men of affairs in that busy town .

		`` I have tun countries , '' he would say at banquet tables , `` Ger - many and
Belgium	LOCATION	. ''

		But when at the be ^ innin ^ of
August , 1914	DATE	, he saw that
Belgium	LOCATION	meant to fight , he suddenly fled , and then the astonished municipal police found in his house a machine - gun , a stock of small arms and German officers ' uniforms , and it became painfully evident that this
Herr von Bary	PERSON	was simply one of those hi '' ; h-class spies which
Germany	LOCATION	had everywhere and which she still has among both enemy and neutral nations .

		Here are the closing lines of
M. Fontainas	ORGANIZATION	's admirable little work : In the fabulous times of
Julius Caesar	PERSON	a horrible giant called
Druon Antigonus	PERSON	devastated the banks of the
Scheldt	LOCATION	, where he lived by his depredations , until the whole region trembled with terror at the mere mention of his name .

		But one dav a rinc young fisherman ,
Salvius Brabo	PERSON	, came boldly forth and bravely challenged to battle him whom all so feared .

		The giant , clad in armor , carried a dagger and a sword , while the fisher boy was armed < > nlv \ \ ith a clumsy cutlass and bore on his shoulder a coil of rope .

		Supple and quick of movement , he parried the heavy blows of his adversary , whose clum-v \ i - ^ finally got tangled in the rope so that he fell to the ground , when the boy dashed forward and cut off the head and the right hand of the giant .

		This hand he whirled up into the air and with a vigorous effort cast into the river , thus performing an act of hand li ` frfifn , as the Flemish say ; and hence the name of the city of
Antwerp	LOCATION	.

		So when the hand of this monstrous
Germania	LOCATION	is cut off ,
Antwerp	LOCATION	will again have a rebirth , the last let us hope , and will pnper once more in a purer and more beautiful glorv than ever .

M. Baie	ORGANIZATION	and M. Fontainas complain .

		The Later Feminism TOWARDS A SANE FEMINISM .

Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		If we are to judge from
Miss Meikle	LOCATION	's bril - liant little book , the newer feminism is marked by an unwonted kindliness toward men .

		`` As fellow-discoverers , equally blundering , equally uninstructed , equally suffering , '' she redeems them from that `` slashing revenge for the early Christian calumnies upon woman '' which femin - ists like Miss
Christabel Pankhurst	PERSON	have so con - spicuously wielded .

		If the predatory and tainted male is no longer to be the theme of feminist laments , feminism must have ceased to be a cru - sade and become a philosophy of life .

		The change is evident in
Miss Meikle	LOCATION	's iconoclasm .

		Her sharp and witty criticism is directed neither against men nor against the unawakened woman , but against feminist leaders and types and trends themselves .

		She wants to transcend the past and clear the ground for a sounder feminism after the war .

		She is unsparing of the tactics that lead women into education and professional studies rather than into business and industry .

		.

		Her argument is that a dependent class must become economically influential before it can hope for political power .

		Women in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- she writes as an Englishwoman -RRB- would long since have had the vote if feminist capital and ability had been urged to produce woman business and industrial leaders instead of political agitators and routine cogs in the man-made machine .

		She would sweep away the traditional college training of women in cultivated intellectuality , and replace it with an education in science and business , pre - paring women to take effective leadership in the economic reconstruction after the war .

		As to sex problems ,
Miss Meikle	LOCATION	is unsparing in her mockery of the English feminists who tried to wreck the conventions .

		She paints satir - ically the uneasy and pedantic freedom which the experimentalists took for themselves .

		She looks for a healthy `` balancing of the fiercest claims of the body with the mind 's ultimately stronger hunger for romance . ''

		She has the ad - mirable attitude of no longer having to argue for freedom but rather to define and clarify it .

		Her very vagueness as to forms is recognition of the fact that with freedom personal relations may be hoped to adjust themselves .

		The fam - ily 's sacredness is undermined by her idea that `` motherhood is one of the most casual of all relations . ''

		It is to this plausible but shocking idea that Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	takes exception , but she has all Miss
Meikle	PERSON	's kindliness toward men .

		She even goes so far as to say that `` no man leaves a woman till she sends him from her . ''

		She does not see that her thesis that `` no ideals have been produced by even the most progressive and en - lightened persons to replace the family group '' is not really inconsistent with much greater sex and personal freedom .

		Her language is a little old-fashioned in wanting the family `` recon - structed with all its historic bonds of unity and sanctity preserved and yet fitted to meet modern needs . ''

		She represents the older , motherly fem - inism with its rather self-conscious responsibility and its weakness in referring to criteria of biolog - ical science where only an artistic sense of per - sonal relations should rule .

		Much unity and sanctity , the psychologists are discovering , could pass from the family without hurting it .

		Miss Meikle would agree with Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	that `` the immoral union is the one that results in bad and irresponsible parenthood . ''

		The latter herself scolds the unprogressive woman and ad - mits that the mother is often the real enemy in the home .

		Her defect consists in being too abso - lute .

		Surely the family group should be con - served where the home means `` sympathetic relationships of mutual affection . ''

		But the younger feminists are more realistic in seeing that where the family means uncongenial rela - tionships that fact should be recognized without sentimentality and provided for .

		Mrs.
Gallich	PERSON	- 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	an 's book moves too much in the realm of con - ventionalized emotions .

		Yet she is with the \ ounger feminists in advocating other forms of sex-partnership besides marriage .

		And she is firm in her insistence that
the State	ORGANIZATION	and industry regulate women 's work to the needs of her phys - ical functions .

		If women are to take their place everywhere , as they must after the war , the con - ditions of their labor must be revolutionized .

		The newer feminism seems quite willing to admit sex-differences and to make the most out of them , both for personal values and for the adjustment of men 's and women 's work .

		The old fierce denial of women 's sex-disability was a tactic in the struggle for equality .

		The abandonment of sex-antagonism and of the denial that women 's functional differentiations count , indicates that this later feminism is so sure of itself that it can dispense with these old vital myths .

		Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	's book will break no bones .

		Its style is verbose , and the scientific chapters could have been left for abler hands .

		She is in - teresting , however , as a transition stage from the old absolutes to a pragmatic feminism like Miss Meikle 's .

		I do not know Miss
Meikle	PERSON	's background , but her book is immensely capable and provocative .

		It is so novel in its scathing wit and its high good humor of irreverence that I can imagine it taken with some resentment by the more studious American feminists .

		Fortu - nately the discussion is of
England	LOCATION	, and there is admiring comment on women 's social and public achievements in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This should alleviate any smart left by the pugnacious attack on the `` educated '' woman and the experiment - alist .

Germany	LOCATION	and the War
GERMANY	LOCATION	: The Next Republic ?

		By
Carl W. Ackerman	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Toward the close of this book , Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	writes : `` The people of the
United States	LOCATION	are better informed about the war as a whole than are the people of any European country . ''

		This may be the case indeed , it would be a pity if it were not but yet there is much still to be hoped for .

		When one listens to the absurd statements in regard to
Germany	LOCATION	which are made even by educated people , he must wonder what persons who were less `` well informed '' would say .

		For example , probably the worst thing that could happen for
Germany	LOCATION	, for peace , and for democ - racy throughout the world would be the death of the present
Kaiser	PERSON	, leaving tin - down Prince in charge of the German Government ; \ i-t how often do we hear from our newspaper ^ , our clergy , our college professors , from all the lead - ers of American thought , that if we could onl \ get rid of
William II	PERSON	, then all the world 's troubles would disappear overnight !

		And this bit of idiocy is typical .

		Unprepared for war as we were in a military sense , we were even worse off in intellectual preparedness .

		We knew \ ery little of
Germany	LOCATION	before the war , and we know practically nothing of what has been going on in that country since
August , 1914	DATE	.

		Our con - ception of the whole war is confined to some trite phrase , such as `` democracy against autocra - cy '' the constant repetition of which will hurt nobody so much as ourselves .

		In view of this deplorable situation , it is fortunate that Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	has written this book ; it is a book that every American , and especially every American liberal , should find of the greatest value .

		Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	was the representative of the
United Press	ORGANIZATION	in
Germany	LOCATION	from
March , 1915	DATE	-LRB- shortly after the submarine campaign was tir > r started -RRB- until the
spring	DATE	of this year , when he left in company with Ambassador
Gerard	PERSON	.

		Dur - ing those two years he naturally acquired a wide knowledge of conditions in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, while no less a person than our Am - bassador has said that he was `` one of the two American correspondents whose dispatches re - mained uncolored by German prejudice . ''

		But though he remained unprejudiced in their favor , Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	was not unsympathetic with the German people , and particularly with their striv - ings toward liberalism .

		What he has to say of the
Germany	LOCATION	democracy is therefore worth -RRB- of the most careful attention .

		The present book is his account , somewhat journalistic in its char - acter , but apparently careful and accurate , of the liberal forces in
Germany	LOCATION	as he observed them .

		At the very beginning of the war , we are told , there was a great struggle in
Germany	LOCATION	be - tween the liberals and the militarists .

		While members of the latter party , which included \ .

		n
Moltke	PERSON	, von
Tirpitz	ORGANIZATION	, von Falkenhaxn .

		the Krupps , and the
Rhine Valley	LOCATION	industrial leaders , were clamoring for war and an immediate in \ a - sion of
Belgium	LOCATION	, the liberals , under the leadership of von Bethmann-Hollweg , were urging the
Kaiser	PERSON	to heed the proposals of Sir
Edward	PERSON	-LRB-
Irc	ORGANIZATION	\ for a
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mobilization was thus delayed for three days .

		For this .

		Hethmann -
Hollweg	PERSON	never has been , and never will be .

		for -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 105 given by the military authorities .

		`` This internal fight became
Germany	LOCATION	's bitterest struggle #nd from time to time the odds went from one side to another .

		The army accused the diplomats of blundering in starting the war .

		The
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	replied that it was the lust for power and victory which poisoned the military leaders that had caused the war . ''


Belgium	LOCATION	was invaded against the counsel of the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Allies have said little about this crime which the Ger - man liberals , particularly the Socialists , did not say at first , but the force of circumstances com - pelled them to acquiesce .

		Internal dissension therefore existed in
Germany	LOCATION	from the very be - ginning of the war .

		As time went on , a number of events , includ - ing the battle of the Marne and the destruction of German commerce , conspired to strengthen the hands of the military party .

		But not the least of these aids to militarism was the oft-re - peated epithet of `` Huns and Barbarians '' which their enemies applied to them .

		This cut the Germans to the quick ; it hurt them worse than any military defeat could have done , and drove them into frenzy .

		They replied to it with the cry `` Gott strafe
England	LOCATION	'' ; so when von Tirpitz announced the submarine campaign , it met a popular demand .

		This campaign went on until the
Lusitania	LOCATION	was sunk , and President
Wilson	PERSON	began sending his notes to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The public discussion which resulted -LSB- from these notes -RSB- was greater than that which followed the first declarations of war in
August 1914	DATE	.

		The people , who before had accepted everything their
Government	ORGANIZATION	said , began to think for themselves .

		One heard al - most as much criticism as praise for the
Lusitania	LOCATION	incident .

		For the first time the quarrel , which had been nourished between the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	and the Admiralty , became nation-wide and forces through - out
Germany	LOCATION	lined up with one side or the other .

		The liberals were not able to stop the submarine campaign at once , however , and presently the Arabic was sunk and the Sussex torpedoed .

		As a result of these crises , the matter was laid before the
Kaiser	PERSON	himself , who decided in favor of Bethmann-Hollweg and the liberals .

		Von Tirpitz and von Falkenhayn had to go : the liberal forces were now in control .

		`` Washing - ton for the first time began to see that eleven months of patience was bearing fruit . ''

		During the `` period of new orientation '' which followed , the reactionary forces were not idle , however .

		The hate campaign against
America	LOCATION	, which had been started soon after the
Lusitania	LOCATION	affair , was redoubled .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	was singled out for especial attack ; it was said that we never had been really neutral ; the German people were prepared for war with
America	LOCATION	.

		Re - peated attempts were also made by the militar - ists to oust the Chancellor , but in vain .

		During this period , too , the economic conditions in
Germany	LOCATION	became steadily worse .

		People be - gan to be dissatisfied with the course of the war .

		At length the liberals , led by the Socialists , com - pelled the Chancellor to make his celebrated peace proposals of
December 12	DATE	.

		In due time the Allies sent their reply , with its impossible terms .

		This finally threw the whole people over into the arms of the militarists .

		Nothing which had happened during the year so solidified the German nation as the Allies ' replies to
Berlin	LOCATION	and President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		It proved to the German people that their government was waging a defensive war because the Allies demanded annexa - tion , compensation and guarantees , all of which meant a change in the map of
Europe	LOCATION	from what it was at the beginning of the war .

		The interests which had been demanding a submarine campaign saw that their opportunity had come .

		They knew that as a result of the Allies ' notes the public would sanction an unrestricted sea warfare against the whole world if that was necessary .

		Even after this , Ambassador
Gerard	PERSON	made strenuous efforts to prevent the impending vic - tory of the militarists .

		But it was then too late : the die was cast .

		The people were ready to accept the motto
Lieber	PERSON	ein Ende mit Schrecken ah ein
Schrecken	PERSON	ohne Ende -LRB- better an end with terror than a terror without end -RRB- .

		On
Janu	PERSON	- ary 30 , the German government announced the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare .

		A few days later ,
America	LOCATION	broke off diplomatic relations , and subsequently declared war .

		Such is a summary of Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	's account of the struggle between the two factions in the German Empire .

		Every page of it must give food for thought to every American liberal .

		More clearly than anything that has yet ap - peared in this country , it tells us what the lib - eral forces in
Germany	LOCATION	are .

		Though these forces are now in defeat , they must still continue to exist , and we are here given more than one valuable hint as to how we may best cooperate with them .

		In many passages the author bears eloquent testimony as to the aid which these liberals have already derived from
America	LOCATION	, and particularly from President
Wilson	PERSON	's notes .

		`` I believe , '' he writes , `` that the
United States	LOCATION	, by two years of patience and note-writing , has done more to accomplish the destruction of militarism and to encourage freedom of thought in
Germany	LOCATION	than the Allies did during nearly three years of fight - ing .

		The
United States	LOCATION	helped the German people think for themselves . ''

		The American 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	notes were therefore most effective in aiding the victory of the liberals and the dismissal of von Tirpitz , but it is a pity that the American gov - ernment did nothing to cooperate with them when they were in power .

		Though Mr.
Acker	PERSON	- man does not say it expressly , he makes it abundantly clear that at every point the
United States	LOCATION	then did exactly what the most reactionary forces in
Germany	LOCATION	hoped and prayed that it would do .

		During the period of liberal ascend - ancy , the
United States	LOCATION	did nothing to make
England	LOCATION	stop interfering with the mail : the author says that the Admiralty prevented his pub - lishing what few things he did manage to get , so that they might complain that all news be - tween the two countries had to go by
London	LOCATION	.

		In notes to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	had characterized the British blockade as `` illegal and indefensible , '' but nothing was done to break it ; the German reactionaries blocked all Ambassador
Gerard	PERSON	's efforts to get out some dye-stuffs , that they might cry the louder to
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	against `` British piracy . ''

		Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	quotes one of the leading German militarists as saying that if
America	LOCATION	would only declare war , `` everybody in the German navy would throw his hat into the air . ''

		But what we might have done is a use - less question .

		We must rather ask how we can most effectively aid the German liberals now .

		On this point , Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	seems to be inconsistent with himself .

		Though having said repeatedly that nothing strengthened the German militarists so much as the Allies ' talk about a `` crushing defeat , '' he now says the same thing himself in the hope of throwing the people over into the hands of the liberals !

		It may be that if the present militarists are `` defeated and discred - ited , '' as he urges , the people will then establish a democratic government and live peacefully ever after ; but it is hard to think of another case in history where a military defeat has had such effects .

		A more probable result would be that which followed the battle of
Jena	PERSON	.

		Germans would spend their money for military prepared - ness more gladly than ever , for they would then have a legacy of hatred greater than that left by
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	and
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		The present mil - itary leaders might be `` discredited , '' but more efficient ones would be sought .

		Liberalism would be permanently banished for having betrayed the Fatherland in its supreme hour of need .

		Moreover , we must now see clearly the sui - cidal nature of an unrestrained and undiscrim - inating vituperation of all Germans .

		Not only is it true that `` you can damn a German until you are blue in the face , but that will not beat the ^ m , '' but this very act of damning makes it the harder to defeat them .

		Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	says explicitly that the Allies ' cry of `` Huns and Bar - barians '' helped materially in making the Ger - mans accept the original submarine warfare and the destruction of the
Lusitania	LOCATION	.

		It is equally clear that the only way to put an end to
Prus	PERSON	- sianism is to cooperate with the many persons in
Germany	LOCATION	who are even more anxious than we to see its finish .

		So all in all , it seems that the most effective - enemy of democracy in the world to-day is the American `` patriot '' who loudly hopes that an American army will soon set foot in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Like the
Paris	LOCATION	conference on a `` war after the war , '' and the Allies ' peace terms , such persons are a veritable God-send to the Prussian mili - tarists .

		And not only do they force the German liberals into the arms of the militarists , but the two British failures on the Somme show con - clusively that such an event would require a mil - itary machine on our part of such gigantic pro- portions that it would crush out whatever democracy we have in our own country .

		We might better devote our energies to persuading our allies to renounce certain of their exagger - ated ambitions in which our entrance into the war has so far apparently encouraged them .

		If the
United States	LOCATION	should accept the Russian formula of `` no annexations , no indemnities , '' it would be a more severe blow to Prussianism than would be the annihilation of several army corps : it would be a blow directly at the mili - tarists , and not at the unfortunate `` German people '' who compose the army corps , and for whom we profess only friendship .

		Let us hope that President
Wilson	PERSON	still holds to his lofty ideal of a `` peace without victory . ''

		An Essay in Misunderstanding THE NOTE-BOOKS OF SAMUEL BUTI.ER .

Samuel Butler	PERSON	somewhere suggests -LRB- I believe it is in his `` Alps and Sanctuaries '' -RRB- that no less interesting and important than
Locke	PERSON	's fammi * `` Essay Concerning the Human Understanding '' would be an Essay Concerning the Human Mis - understanding .

		We do not sufficiently realize , he remarks , the part which illusion has played in our development .

		How different would life be but for
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 107 the ability to do as the poor Ticinese woman did who , transplanted from
Ticino	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	, was found kneeling in prayer before a dentist 's show - case in
Hampstead Road	LOCATION	, mistaking the show - case for a roadside oratory and the artificial teeth for the relics of a saint .

		The power of adaptation to varying circumstances is a prime requisite for evolution , physical and mental , and the power of adaptation is mainly dependent upon the capacity of thinking certain new things sufficiently like others to which we have been accustomed for us not to be so much incommoded that habitual response becomes impossible .

		The power to take things in such manner that a modified habit and eventually a new structure becomes possible is the power to mistake them ; as the power to fuse ideas in a process of thought is the power to confuse them .

		So
Butler	PERSON	.

		To stop here , however , would be to treat of but one aspect of the human misun - derstanding .

		Progress has depended not only upon the ability to mistake a new object for an old one , but also upon the ability to see an old object in a new light .

		It was important for the Ticinese woman to mistake teeth for the relics of a saint , but it was important for Luther to mis - take the relics of a saint for teeth .

		And accord - ing to the psychologists , the essential difference between the human and the animal intelligence is just this ability to recognize and deal with new aspects in old situations .

		In their superficial manifestation there is this difference between the two types of misunder - standing : it is the most common thing in the world to accept a new object , providing only it is not too new , as a repetition of the object it resembles , while it is a most rare thing to see anything novel about an object that is well known .

		But more profoundly considered both processes are equally unusual .

		In the one case as in the other the native dulness of mortals justifies
Isaiah	PERSON	's complaint , `` They see many things , but do not observe ; their ears are open , but they hear not . ''

		Only the very exceptional mind perceives , in any comprehensive sense , the strange as if it were familiar or the familiar as if it were strange .

		So it takes a Franklin to see a storm cloud as a
Leyden	PERSON	jar , and a
Watts	LOCATION	to discover a steam engine in a teakettle ; while a folk-song waits to be heard as a symphony until the coming of a
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		And for the very good reason that mistaking the new for the old or the old for the new constitutes not two unique processes , each working after its own fashion , but one process facing in two directions .

		To think of the moon as an object swinging in a circle at the end of a string is not different in principle from thinking of an object so swinging as a moon .

		Each is misunderstanding `` in the grand style . ''

		An
Essay Concerning the Human Misunderstanding	ORGANIZATION	might therefore comprise two volumes , after the manner of
Locke	PERSON	's work one , let us say , on Simple Misunderstanding , and the other on Misunderstanding Extraordinary .


Butler	PERSON	did more , however , than suggest a title and offer a few hints to the possible author of sugh a work .

		In a sense he was forever writ - ing chapters of the book .

		Butler 's life was one long essay in misunderstanding -LRB- in the present sense -RRB- and all his books bear testimony to the fact .

		It used to be a boyhood stunt to stand on your hands and see the world upside down .

		Butler knew the trick well and did a deal of walking on his hands through our world of conventions , intellectual , moral , aesthetic , and religious .

		His books are integrated visions of the world thus viewed `` The Way of All Flesh , '' of marriage and the family ; `` Erewhon , '' of the daily life of the English-speaking world ; `` Life and Habit '' and `` Evolution , Old and New , '' of Darwinism ; `` The Fair Haven , '' of Christianity .

		But he came very far from compiling into reports all he saw .

		`` One 's thoughts fly so fast , '' he said , `` that one must shoot them : it is no use trying to put salt on their tails . ''

		The `` Note - Books '' are a museum of thoughts thus caught on the wing , singly or in flocks .

		One can not promise that the visitor , whoever he be , will find the exhibit to his liking .

		On the contrary , few will agree entirely with the curator 's sense of values , and many will deeply resent the low esti - mate placed upon common favorites .

		One may , however , safely assure all comers of the com - plete absence of anything cheap , commonplace , or artificial .

		But to let go of this figure before it goes too far , and to return to the `` Note-Books '' as a record of extraordinary ability in seeing and thinking contrary to conventional models , I may as well admit , first as last , that I believe it im - possible to convey in a review a fair idea of so remarkable a book .

		How shall one carry over its freshness , its humor , its honesty , its kindliness , its independence ?

		And the versatility of the man !

		Biology , painting , metaphysics , music , re - ligion , politics , poetry , morality , but why go on ?

		and always an idea , not a phrase ; always a voice , not an echo .

		Theoretically it is really im - possible that one man should be the author of such a book .

		That one man was , is only another 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	Ih instance of life 's disdain of logic .

		And hmv transmit the flavor of such tales as `` Homer 's Hot and Cold Springs '' ?

		I give it up .

		Let the reader be content or , rather , let him be dis - content with a few citations and straightway go to the book itself .

		Compare the cant and affectation of the re - ligious idiom we are taught from our youth with the freshness and naturalness of
Butler	PERSON	.

		His note headed `` God and the Devil '' may serve as an example : God 's merits are so transcendent that it is not sur - prising his faults should be in reasonable proportion .

		The faults are , indeed , on such a scale that , when looked at without relation to the merits with which they are interwoven , they become so appalling that people shrink from ascribing them to the Deity and have invented the Devil , without seeing that there would be more excuse for God 's killing the Devil , and so getting rid of evil , than there can be for his failing to be everything that he would like to be .

		For God is not so white as he is painted , and he gets on better with the Devil than people think .

		The Devil is too useful for him to wish him ill and , in like manner , half the Devil 's trade would be at an end should any great mishap bring God well down in the world .

		For all the mouths they make at one another they play into each other 's hands and have got on so well as partners , playing Splenlow and Jor - kins to one another , for so many years that there seems no reason why they should cease to do so .

		Nor was
Butler	PERSON	's heresy due , as is often the case , to spiritual poverty .

		It was exactly the profundity of his spiritual convictions that mo - tivated his disdain of the conventional religionists .

		What better expression of the religious attitude can be given than is found in his paragraph on `` Blasphemy '' ?

		He writes : I begin to understand now what Christ meant when he said that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost was unforgivable , while speaking against the Son of Man might be forgiven .

		He must have meant that a man may be pardoned for being unable to believe in the Christian mythology , but that if he made light of that spirit which the common conscience of all men , what - ever their particular creed , recognizes as divine , there was no hope for him .

		No more there is .

		The same frankness characterizes
Butler	PERSON	's ut - terances on the relation of parent and child .

		His philosophy , voiced in `` The Way of All Flesh , '' is there summed up in a remark by the way : Why should the generations overlap one another at all ?

		Why can not we be buried as eggs in neat little cells with ten or twenty thousand pounds each wrapped round us in
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	notes , and wake up , as the sphex wasp does , to find that its papa and mamma have not only left ample provisions at its elbow , but have been eaten by sparrows some weeks before it began to live consciously on its own account .

		This is a hard doctrine for most of us , trained as we are to accept the divine right of parents , and ever ready to sacrifice the ideals of youth to save the interests of age .

		It is , however , a central doctrine in
Butler	PERSON	's view of life .

		Rub him am u here and you soon lay bare the con - viction that much of human misery and failure is directly traceable to the family .

		`` I believe , '' he says in the `` Note-Book , '' `` that more unhappi - ness comes from this source than from any other I mean from the attempt to prolong family connection unduly and to make people hang to - gether artificially who would never naturally do so .

		The mischief among the lower classes is not so great , but among the middle and upper classes it is killing a large number daily . ''

		That his attitude on family ties is , again , not due to poverty of feeling is clear from the char - acteristic note which appears in the chapter on `` The Life of the World to Come . ''

		I have often told my son that he must begin by finding me a wife to become his mother who shall satisfy both himself and me .

		But this is only one of the many rocks on which we have hitherto split .

		We should never have got on together ; I should have had to cut him off with a shilling either for laughing at Homer , or for refusing to laugh at him , or both , or neither , but still cut him off .

		So I settled the matter long ago by turning a deaf ear to his importunities and sticking to it that 1 would not get him at all .

		Vet his thin ghost visits me at times and , though he knows that it is no use pestering me further , he looks at me so wistfully and reproachfully that I am half - inclined to turn tail , take my chance about his mother and ask him to let me get him after all .

		But I should show a clean pair of heels if he said `` Yes . ''

		Besides he would probably be a girl .

		But it was rash to venture upon quotation .

		And now in profusion I give that up too .

		For what should one select from chapters of notes on `` Truth and Convenience , '' `` A Painter 's Views on Painting , '' `` Written Sketches , '' `` Han - del and Music , '' `` Higgledy-Piggledy , '' and twenty others ?

		Why , there are books in the fifteenth chapter alone , where
Butler	PERSON	's unused titles and subjects are collected .

		Consider , for instance , the possibilities of `` The Diseases and Ordinary Causes of Mortality among Friend - ships . ''

		And I know of nothing written on painting so intimate as chapter nine .

		It is paint - ing become articulate in speech .

		One appears to be in the very midst of the process , one smells the oils , one sees the colors laid on , one invol - untarily avoids coming into contact with the fresh paint .

		And there are the notes on music and on the master whom
Butler	PERSON	worshiped from his twelfth year onward , and who inspired his coin - positions .

		`` Handel is so great and so simple that no one but a professional musician is unable to
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 109 understand him . ''

		It is fitting that the last thing in the `` Note-Books '' should be one of the son - nets on Handel : Father of my poor music if such small Offspring as mine , so born out of due time , So scorn 'd , can be called fatherful at all , Or dare to thy high sonship 's rank to climb Best lov 'd of all the dead whom I love best , Though I love many another dearly too , You in my heart take rank above the rest ; King of those kings that most control me , you , You were about my path , about my bed In boyhood always and , where'er I be , Whate'er I think or do , you , in my head , Ground-bass to all my thoughts , are still with me ; Methinks the very worms will find some strain Of yours still lingering in my wasted brain .

		There are people no doubt who could read
Butler	PERSON	and remain unimpressed , for there is absolutely no display of erudition in his work .

		There are others , I suppose , who could read him with interest and get away untouched , for some intellects are Leibnizian monads , having no win - dows .

		To thinking men and women , however , providing they are not too old in spirit ,
Butler	PERSON	speaks with vital directness .

		Not that he formu - lates a philosophy or solves problems or teems with information .

		Exactly not that .

		In read - ing
Butler	PERSON	one 's growth is not by apposition but by intussusception .

		One does not accumulate ; one expands .

		One does not become a little But - ler but a larger self .

		That is why if one had to choose between going to
Butler	PERSON	and going to college , one might do worse for one 's soul than choose the less expensive course .

		For
Butler	PERSON	has a way of decreasing that the reader may in - crease .

		He is not anxious for his standing , what position he shall hold , what honors he shall re - ceive , what reputation he shall acquire .

		And be - cause he prefers to determine what he shall be interested in rather than take his cue from the authorities ; because he insists upon seeing clearly and for himself , in spite of religious and scien - tific orthodoxy ; because he strives to voice his views naturally and honestly , even if this entails serious losses ; finally , because he speaks out of contact with life and with creative activity rather than out of an artificial academic at - mosphere , acquaintance with
Butler	PERSON	means spir - itual regeneration .

		The `` Note-Books '' especially would do admirably for a radical 's book of devo - tions .

		A paragraph read of a morning as a basis for meditation , and a larger portion in the same spirit for
Sundays	DATE	, may therefore be recom - mended to socialists and others who look forward to a different social state .

		While the suggestion of `` family prayers '' with passages from the `` Note-Books '' as scripture readings , would doubt - less have appealed to
Butler	PERSON	's sense of humor , the scheme is so contrary to his spontaneous spirit that one must apologize for even having thought of it in connection with him .

		And what I meant to say was after all that the book is delightful and stimulating , whether read in snatches or in continuity , and that it wears well .

		What can be done by certain vested interests to damn an original author is illustrated by But - ler .

		In the analysis of the sales of his books one discovers that from only one of them , `` Ere - whon , '' did he have any financial profit .

		The reason for this lack of popularity may be given in
Butler	PERSON	's own words : I should have liked notoriety and financial success well enough if they could have been had for the ask - ing , but I was not going to take any trouble about them and , as a natural consequence , I did not get them .

		If I had wanted them with the same passion - ate longing that has led me to pursue every inquiry that I have ever pursued , I should have got them fast enough ... One reason , and that the chief , why I have made no noise , is now explained .

		It remains to add that from first to last I have been unorthodox and militant in every book that I have written .

		I made enemies of the parsons once for all with my first two books .

		-LSB- `` Erewhon '' and `` The Fair Haven . '' -RSB-

		The evolution books made the Darwinians , and through them the scientific world in general , even more angry than `` The Fair Haven '' had made the clergy so that I had no friends , for the clerical and scientific people rule the roost between them .

		I have chosen the fighting road rather than the hang-on-to-a-great-man road , and what can a man who does this look for except that people should try to silence him in whatever way they think will be most effectual ?

		... `` Ages , like rulers , ''
Kuno Fischer	PERSON	once said , `` have a way of withholding audience to those who would speak to them until it suits their convenience to listen . ''


Butler	PERSON	's turn has come .

		He is being heard , and he will be heard more .

		And as he is understood , his voice will join those others which to-day are challenging the vested interests church , college , state interests which combined in his day and combine in ours to silence all heralds of a new order .

		Reading
Butler	PERSON	should be an encouragement to all who are struggling to maintain their moral and in - tellectual integrity in the midst of widespread insanity .

		If , however , I were running the uni - verse ,
Butler	PERSON	would have been introduced to our age not by
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	but by
William James	PERSON	.

		110 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	The Scammon Lectures Six LECTURES ON ARCHITECTURE .

		By
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	,
Thomas Hastings	PERSON	, and
Claude Bragdon	PERSON	.

		The
Scammon Lectures	ORGANIZATION	for 191 5 .

		-LRB- Published for the
Art Institute of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	by
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		To trace the history of Gothic architecture in the course of two lectures , would be no small undertaking , even were one to confine himself to the simplest , most straightforward account of the rise of the style and its subsequent develop - ment .

		But , nothing daunted , Mr.
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	, who believes that , `` to understand a style , it is necessary to do more than scrutinize its material elements , determining by scientific meth - ods its line of stylistic descent and the peculiar - ities of its organic mechanism , '' sets out , in precisely that space , to interpret the spirit as well as the form of the supreme architecture of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, and to relate this , however sum - marily , to the entire social , political , cultural , and spiritual life of the period .

		Needless to say , the results are somewhat sketchy .

		To accomplish his purpose he prac - tises startling retrecissements of architectural history and summarizes the evolution of the characteristic features of Gothic construction ribbed vault , domed vault , compound pier , archi - volt , flying buttress , pointed arch , and so forth in paragraphs bristling with names , dates , and technical terms .

		The effect is sufficiently cryp - tic even on the printed page , and one can only imagine the impression that must have been produced upon Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's hearers mainly in - telligent laymen , no doubt by such a passage as that dealing with the development of the chevet , for example , from the Syrian builders of the dioceses of
Damascus	LOCATION	and
Antioch	LOCATION	, to those who completed the process in the great churches of
Rheims	LOCATION	,
Bourges	LOCATION	,
Chartres	LOCATION	, and Westminster , or by such a bit of engineering jargon as the fol - lowing : Between the two types we are considering , the ques - tion was live load versus dead loads .

		The basilica was inactive ; its small nave arches had little thrust and its apse semi-dome also ; the great triumphal arch to the choir was the only thing that was se - riously active .

		Yet the treatment , on the whole , is stimulat - ing and suggestive .

		No one in the world to-day certainly not in this country is , perhaps , bet - ter qualified than Mr.
Cram	PERSON	to interpret the Gothic spirit , not only in architecture and the allied arts , which , as he says , make a single syn - thesis with it , but in all that pertains to the culture and civilization of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		We -LRB- inly wish he might have had a somewhat broader canvas on which to project his picture , and find it hard to understand why he should not have been invited to deliver the entire course of Scammon lectures for
1915	DATE	, instead of only a third of it .

		Mr.
Thomas Hastings	PERSON	was doubtless chosen as a representative of the Renaissance , to balance Mr.
Cram	PERSON	as champion of the Gothic .

		It can hardly be said , however , that he presents a very strong brief for his cause .

		For if it be true , as Mr.
Hastings	PERSON	premises , that `` style in its growth has always been governed by the univer - sal and eternal law of development '' something which is entirely untrue in any absolute sense then he has already pronounced the harshest possible judgment upon Renaissance architec - ture , which is the most striking violation of the above rule the history of art has to offer .

		In - stead of being , as implied , a continuous growth or evolution from Gothic architecture , as the Gothic itself actually was from the Roman , through the Romanesque , the new style , born overnight in a renewed perception of the beauty and grandeur of the antique world , was a total denial and repudiation of the old a break with the immediate past as radical and abrupt as that return to the Gothic which Mr.
Hastings	PERSON	so de - plores in the early Victorian era and in our own day .

		Moreover , far from appearing in response `` to the needs of a new civilization , '' as he seems to think , Renaissance architecture was , itself , one of the most potent factors in creating this civili - zation , which , in certain material aspects at all events , was markedly inferior to its predecessor .

		One of Mr.
Hastings	PERSON	's questionable dicta is that , `` in order to build a living architecture , we must build as we live . ''

		But it is a fact that the men of the Renaissance , intent only on reviving the classic splendor , lived rather as they built , and thus lived very badly indeed for several genera - tions , as compared with their medieval ancestors , the practical conveniences of whose castles , as Mrs.
Putnam	PERSON	has shown in her delightful book on `` The Lady , '' greatly surpassed those of the Renaissance palazzo .

		All this , of course , is not to say that the Renaissance is not justified as a great historic school of architecture , but simply that Mr.
Hast	PERSON	- ings has not chosen the right way to justify it .

		The confusion in his thought seems to an \ e from a certain conflict between his training and his practical aptitudes .

		Recognizing implicitly but one mode of architecture the `` organic , '' as .

		Mr.
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL in
Claude Bragdon	PERSON	calls it he is obliged to con - tend that the Renaissance is no less structural and developmental in its origin than the Gothic , or else completely throw over the school in which he received his education .

		Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	, it seems to us , comes much closer to the truth in his first lecture the fifth in the volume where he recognizes two distinct architectural modes , instead of one only .

		`` When we come to consider architecture throughout the world and down the ages , '' he writes , continuing a contrast between nature and man 's work , or art , `` we find it bisected by a like inevitable duality : either it is organic , fol - lowing the law of nature again ; or it is ar - ranged , according to some Euclidian ideal devised by proud-spirited man .

		In other words , it is either cultivated , like the flower ; or it is cut , like the gem . ''

		The Renaissance , which is the type of the latter , has , therefore , its place in the psychologic order no less than the Gothic , which is the type of the former , though on a distinctly lower level from the standpoint of creative art .

		And choice between them , or the tendencies which they rep - resent , will always be primarily one of funda - mental taste or mental constitution .

		To seasoned travellers or advanced students of the socialist state Messrs.
Walling	PERSON	and
Laidler	PERSON	have furnished a `` handy guide '' in `` State So - cialism Pro and Con . ''

		The major part of this work , over six hundred pages , consists of `` offi - cial documents and other authoritative selections showing the world-wide replacement of private by governmental industry before and during the war . ''

		The relation of these documents to the editors ' theme is presented in an admirable in - troduction wherein attempt is made to prevent confused thinking through confusion of terms .

		The nicety of phrasing in this introduction gives fair warning to mere sightseers that there will be little excitement for them in the suc - ceeding pages .

		The tired business man and the culture club sociologist will not find those pal - atably inaccurate generalizations with which to impress a dinner partner .

		There are no daylight criticisms of contemporary folly or moonlit prophecies of future wisdom .

		In truth the edi - tors hold themselves ostentatiously aloof from their production .

		This is not a brief for state socialism , they announce .

		`` Our object has been rather to provide the reader with the most im - portant data , so that he may be equally free to reach a conclusion for or against collectivism . ''

		There is however a false suggestion in this object , as stated , because of the implication that arguments for or against collectivism are inher - ent in the compiled documents .

		Yet the selec - tions that follow are not records of the success or failure of collectivism but exhibit largely the form and extent of state operation of industry , with little data upon which the interested reader may base an approving or disapproving judg - ment .

		One may be inclined to feel that in so vital a controversy as the present world conflict be - tween receding individualism and oncoming col - lectivism such an array of statistical information should be humanized by intermittent emotional outbursts .

		Finance , Agriculture ,
Transportation	ORGANIZATION	, and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	are paraded before the reader under the flags of all nations ; but there are no brass bands .

		Rank upon rank pass in review : Central Banks and methods of control in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, and
Australia	LOCATION	.

		Postal Savings Banks , showing increases in num - ber of depositors , size of average deposit , and amounts of total deposits .

		Land Reclamation and
Development	ORGANIZATION	, with total cost and acreage .

		Forestry , Roads ,
Fisheries	ORGANIZATION	,
Water Power	ORGANIZATION	, Canals , Shipping ,
Railways	ORGANIZATION	, Telegraphs , and Telephones .

		The monotonous columns of legislative and ad - ministrative product seem as endless and all-con - quering as the German horde pouring into North - ern
France	LOCATION	.

		There is something in the extent and power of these mobilized statistics that demands an emo - tional reaction even from a neutral .

		Is collectiv - ism marching to a world triumph or to a world defeat ?

		Will it capture
Paris	LOCATION	, or almost reach its goal and then , retreating sullenly , dig itself into hostile soil and hold for decades even cen - turies the ground won in the first rush of a world war ?

		It is no criticism of the editors of `` State So - cialism Pro and Con '' that they do not even attempt to answer these questions .

		It is rather the most sincere compliment that their `` source book '' is so impressive in its array of facts and figures that it stirs deeper curiosity .

		One feels that the editors themselves must have a Conclu - 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	lu sion as well as an Introduction to their com - pilation .

		Of course a Conclusion on so vast a subject would be full of half-baked ,
Utopian	LOCATION	, illogical , and unwarranted ideas , and therefore a choice subject for critical review .

		It is truly un - gracious for the editors of the present volume to exercise such restraint of personal opinion as to give no opportunity for the reviewer to be clever at their expense .

		He is forced to acknowledge that within the self-imposed limits of their work they have succeeded in presenting a unique and adequate record of the world-advance of col - lectivism .

		A chapter on `` Municipal Ownership , '' edited by Mr.
Evans Clark	PERSON	, surveys that field briefly , effectively , and with consistent impersonality .

		`` State Socialism Pro and Con '' is not recom - mended for hammock hours .

		But as a handy reference volume for the serious-minded it will save many days of searching through technical libraries for data on collectivism .

		Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	says in `` The Ford '' : `` Some - body who has the interest of the feminist move - ment at heart ought to think out a formula by which an earnest young man can readily convey to an equally earnest young woman that , while he knows , of course , that she means absolutely everything she says , he knows at the same time that she does n't mean anything ... it must be a situation frequently cropping up in these days when young women are nothing if not earnest . ''

		Most of the young women in the novels here commented on are dead in earnest , live in earnest ; and the authors , except one , are intently serious .

		In spite of an estival desire to escape responsible thinking , I rind their serious - ness commendable , strongly enough supported on narrative structure and sufficiently mitigated by humor to amuse me in a hammock or console me when one sheet is too heavy to sleep under .

		We can not escape the problems ot labor and capital or the problems of the feminine , eternal or transitory , and the pleasantry \ v : u to put in some sort of order the part of your mind which is occupied by these problems is to watch the novelists play with them .

		And if the players are intently sober , the play is not on that account less delightful to the onlooker .

		Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	is a practised , dexterous pla \ er .

		Sometimes consciousness of her dexterity leads her into over-elaborated phrasing ; you become so interested in watching her juggle her racket that you forget to see where the ball goes .

		But most of her strokes are swift and sure .

		She is a wise woman with an affectionate understanding of young people , and a gently satirical sense of their follies .

		The characterization of
Virginia	LOCATION	, the vague and restless radical , is excellent .

		Any veteran Socialist will recognize his younger com - rades -LRB- but not himself , of course -RRB- in
Virginia	LOCATION	and her friends who bandy half-understood catch-words .

		The great social and commercial plot behind these children is strongly handled and conveys more than any other American fic - tion since
Frank Norris	PERSON	of what Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	calls the `` epic quality of the west . ''

		For one thing I am deeply grateful : Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	does not try to settle the strife between the capitalist `` interests '' and the agrarian `` interests '' by marrying the children of the contesting parties Such an obvious solution seems to me to spoil the reality of two of our novels .

		In `` Gold Must Be Tried by Fire '' Mr.
Richard Aumerle Maher	PERSON	marries his attractive working girl to the son of the mill-owner .

		As the publishers say , this does `` bring the volume to a pleasing close , '' but I have a feeling that things do not happen so .

		The real strength of the novel is the dramatic picture of the industrial wars , the war between the workmen and the owners , and the war between the independent mill and the trust .

		Those wars which are going on all the time , are second in interest only to the military war , and in the long run are not second to it in importance .

		It is a fact in life -LRB- and there - fore a proper theme in fiction -RRB- that against the immense background of industrial and military contest lovers plav their individual comedies and tragedies .

		But in the tumult wedding hells make but a thin tinkling music , and a kiss is a minor episode , not a climax .

		The marriage of the mill girl does not thrill me , but the tire that tried her is real fire .

		In `` The Straight Road . ''

		an anommous novel , the heroine becomes a hop-picker on a
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 113 rancn belonging to her lovers father .

		Here again the solution is too easy .

		Montague and Capulet may marry and by young love and young death heal the breach between the families ; they live in the same society and their encounter is plausible .

		But to marry an 1 .

		W. W. striker to a son of plutocracy and to bring it about that this particular striker should happen to go to the particular hop field owned by the cruel aristocrat who had separated the girl from his son , well , that is asking too much of the most acquiescent credulity .

		And the unlikelihood is not lessened by the fact that the girl is not of the working class but a gentlewoman in reduced circumstances , and the fact that the son of the rich man is in revolt against his father and in sympathy with the workers .

		The story of the strike itself is told with conviction .

		An
I. W. W.	PERSON	reporter would be glad to write with so much vigor of phrase and emotional appeal .

		And the woman 's experiences before she becomes a hop-picker , her struggles to earn a living and keep straight in a world dominated by the pred - atory male , seem to be real adventures and not special pleading .

		It is a book which any good craftsman would be willing to sign , and I can - not see the reason for anonymity .

		I look with suspicion on the publisher 's statement that `` obviously the author of this startling narra - tive ... would not , and could not , sign the manuscript , '' but I am willing to connive with him in advertising the book by exciting curiosity about it .

		Another anonymous novel is `` The
Empty House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It deals with another problem of woman : the wealthy woman whose husband is absorbed in business , who has no children because she does not want them , and who does not get much happiness out of an apparently prosperous life .

		It is a vivacious story with an air of determination to speak out and tell the truth .

		What it tells is interesting .

		But after all it does not tell very much .

		The manner is sometimes irritating , if the reader is over - sensitive to literary manner .

		In trying to sound human and natural the author makes an unnecessary sacrifice of sentence-construction .

		However , she does give the effect of a woman talking plain talk , and she is worth listening to .

		The childless woman in Mrs.
Mary Hallock Foote	PERSON	's ``
Edith Bonham	PERSON	'' finds her consolation in the care of another woman 's children after their mother 's death .

		She wins an extra reward for her devotion bv marrying the children 's father , which is a good old-fashioned ending , a natural outcome of the circumstances .

		Here is at least one wedding in our new novels to which I give a reviewer 's benediction .

		The contest under unusual circumstances between the man and the woman , both endowed with strong wills and honest minds , is firmly drawn .

		Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	is one of our veteran novelists and she knows her business .

		I ask , however , with due respect whether the book should not end on page 321 , whether the postscript is not superfluous .

		A novelist who is not yet a veteran , but is going to be if the gods spare him , is Mr.
Ernest Poole	PERSON	.

		Of recent novels by the younger
Ameri	PERSON	- can writers `` His Family '' is the best I have read .

		`` The Harbor '' was promising .

		`` His Family '' is an achievement , almost a mature achievement .

		It is not quite mature , because Mr.
Poole	PERSON	sometimes allows himself to write with an amateurish awkwardness which a trained hand would correct .

		`` A small demure woman of thirty-five , with light soft hair and clear blue eyes and limbs softly rounded , the contour of her features was full of approaching maternity . ''

		`` Of medium height and a wiry build , his quick kindly smile of greeting did not conceal the fine tight lines about his mouth and between his eyes . ''

		`` The house was one of a dozen others . ''

		`` Listening from his study , again the feeling came to him of her fresh and abundant vitality . ''

		Such sentences betray the writer who has not learned what any artist born with Mr.
Poole	PERSON	's sense of beauty can learn by thoughtful labor .

		In the substance as well as the style are signs of the author who is not yet artistically grown up , commonplace reflec - tions on life , the saying of things that need not be said , and saying them too often .

		Having established by his title and by the relationship of his characters that the theme of the book is `` Family , '' the continuity of life through the generations , Mr.
Poole	PERSON	repeats the theme many times without variations ; thereby he loses the power of suggestion and gives the impression of an impoverishment of ideas in a book which is rich and vital .

		For , to have done with quarrel - ing , it is a rich book , full of the stuff of life .


Roger Gale	PERSON	is the finest old father of a family since
Silas Lapham	PERSON	, of whom in many ways he reminds me .

		And the resemblance , or , if the resemblance is not as close as I think , the recollection is a compliment to Mr.
Poole	PERSON	.

		For Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is a master in the portraval of elderlv men .


Silas Lapham	PERSON	and Judge
Kenton	PERSON	are his best characters .

		-LRB- The young people are not so well done : Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is afraid of their 114 Tin : DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	passions . -RRB-

		Mr.
Poolc	PERSON	keeps his elderly man the central figure in the book , and hangs about him the three several stories of his daughters , each one of which is a good story in itself .

		The girls and their young men arc distinctly character - ized and live their own lives , as independent of the author -LRB- when he lets them alone and does not rub his theme into us -RRB- as they are inde - pendent of their perplexed and affectionate old father .

		A glass of light wine to go with the rather serious novels we have been consuming is Mr.
Allen Updegraff	PERSON	's `` Second Youth . ''

		In Amer - ica we have not enough of this sort of light - handed humor .

		There is a touch of farce in the postulated situation , which you have to grant and are very willing to grant .

		Once that is granted or accepted , you move along in a romantic adventure which is conducted in the true spirit of comedy .

		The material is of the quality that ought to make good plays , and I hope that some time , many times , Mr.
Upde	PERSON	- graff 's humor and gay feeling for the human being will be found combined with whatever other talents are necessary to write for the stage .

		JOHN MACY .

		HHIEFS ox XEW BOOKS OVER THE TOP .

		By
Arthur Guy Empey	PERSON	.

		Putnam 's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` It is the real stuff . ''

		For once the publisher 's urgent description does not exaggerate ; for in this unpretentious volume is caught at last the soul of
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	.

		A voice has risen from the trenches that speaks his language .

		From the ranks has come an intelligence , hardly con - scious even of itself , that has looked into the simple heart of the soldier , and has seen there the loyalty and courage , the grim humor , the boyishness , the playfulness , above all , the mod - esty of men who do not know that they are heroes .

		And yet this soldier-author deals little in reflection .

		He has held the mirror up to human nature as he has found it in the English private soldier and the reader has but to look in and see .

		Mr.
Empey	PERSON	is a young American who could not wait for his country to come in .

		He left his home in
New Jersey	LOCATION	early in the war , went to
London	LOCATION	and enlisted , saw a year and a half of real fighting and came back to
England	LOCATION	more dead than alive , after having lain wounded for thirty-six hours in No Man 's Land .

		Honorably discharged as no longer fit for active service , he IN now hack in his home country , making public addresses whose modesty and graphic power will surprise no one who has read his book .

		The book is a cheerful record ot this soldier 's life as he lived it from day to day .

		K \ rr \ page of it is alive with color the jolting rides in cattle trains , the mud of the trenches , the `` coo - ties '' -LRB- tiny insects on whom Tommy wages con - stant petty war -RRB- , the good-humored quarrels over rations , the rude play which
Empey	PERSON	wrote during two weeks in `` rest billets '' back of the line , the solemn service over a comrade 's grave .

		One of the many stirring incidents of the book is the story of the coward who `` came back .

		Condemned to die at
3:38 in the morning	TIME	for desertion he found himself freed by a German bullet which killed his guard , and rushing to the front , took charge of a machine gun whose crew had all been killed , and turned it on the enemy in time to save his own company from annihilation .

		As his comrades were returning he fell with a bullet in his brain .

		The court 's order was duly carried out .

		for the hour wa - 3:38 .

		Such a book may well become one of the best - sellers .

		Its story never flags .

		It is human and the men who fill its pages are simple children , brave without heroics , tender-hearted , loyal , and enduring .

		The author is merely one of them , modest as they are and with a narrative power that is impressive .

		His book will appeal to young and old alike , to all who love pathos and humor , great deeds , and manly men , and no reader will put it .

		down without being glad that someone put a writer in the trenches .

		THE MAN IN COURT .

		By
F. DeW	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wells .

		Putnam 's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The law 's delay has long been a favorite sub - ject with humorists and other men of purpn-r .

		not to omit mention of the modern reporter .

		The present author has chosen the straight - forward descriptive method , and in knowledge of the subject is well fitted for his task .

		He h > .

		- attempted simply to bring his reader into touch with the everyday workings of courts in this country , and thus to leave him with certain in - evitable conclusions .

		It is a sorry story , though not ungraciously told .

		Starting with a descrip - tion of the drab scene of a
Night Court	ORGANIZATION	where the `` visitor leaves with a sense of having hi < 1 values overthrown , '' Judge Wells take-s his reader through a variety of court proceed under such chapter titles as `` The Anxious Jury . ''

		`` The Strenuous Lawyer , '' `` The Worried Cli - ent . ''

		`` The Confused Witness . ''

		and `` Tho * , - Technical Objections . ''

		The descriptions are clear and are enlivened by occasional touches of humor , usually through the telling of some odd incident .

		The book ends with a chapter called I > oking Backward . ''

		in which the author
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 115 shows the present legal machinery broken down by
1947	DATE	, and all law business carried on by
Judicial Corporations	ORGANIZATION	, just as real-estate titles are now certified by
Title Guarantee	ORGANIZATION	companies .

		Unfortunately for so sincere and sane a work , the style lacks grace , and the argument drags at times .

		That the facts are interesting for all that , is no small tribute to the author .

		THE IDEALS OF PAINTING .

		By
J. Comyns Carr	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		`` This volume , '' says the prefatory note , `` lays no claim to original research , nor does it affect to furnish an exhaustive record of the life and work even of the more eminent masters of mod - ern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Its purpose is rather to assist those students who desire to obtain a general view of the movement of painting from the time of Giotto to the present day ; and to compare and contrast the spiritual ideals that have been pur - sued and perfected in the work of separate schools laboring under the dominating impulse supplied by individual genius . ''

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	carries out his purpose in a pleasant , ambling manner which makes his book very different from most hand - books of art .

		He surveys in turn the `` ideals '' of
Italy	LOCATION	,
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	, but just what the `` ideals '' are the reader can not clearly discern .

		There is any amount of interesting detail , comparison , analysis , and assertion ; but no pattern of a theory of life , related in specific ways to the theories of life of the others , emerges for any one of these lands .

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	has missed an opportunity ; for the arts of peoples , far more than their philoso - phies or religions , incarnate their essential spirit and outlook .

		Its designation afresh in terms of the pictorial art is a desirable thing , and if Mr.
Carr	PERSON	fails of it , it is because of his deference to the tradition of criticism .

		His spontaneous judg - ment seems robust enough to have achieved it , and will perhaps lead him to try again .

		YOUR NATIONAL PARKS .

		By
Enos A. Mills	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		`` The Piute Indians have a legend which says that just at the close of creation the woman was consulted .

		She at once called into existence the birds , the flowers , and the trees . ''

		Thus writes
Enos Mills	PERSON	at the beginning of one of his chap - ters .

		He believes thoroughly in that kind of woman and he believes also in learning to love the things she called into existence and in creat - ing islands of safety for them , which are also pleasure grounds for human beings .

		This brings up the question that rose in our mind when we examined his book .

		Are the national parks created alone for preserving and exhibiting our country 's marvellous wonders , or should their greater purpose be to provide great playgrounds for the public ?

		If they have a dual purpose , then the thought at once arises that at present they are hardly impartially distributed , the eastern , central , and southern states being almost wholly neglected .

		Of course there are city and state parks , but these are never on the scale that thrills the imagination as the national parks do .

		Mr.
Mills	PERSON	himself names several spots in these less - favored sections which he considers fitted to be parks : the Dunes , a portion of the South
Caro	PERSON	- lina shore , the Mammoth Cave region , and several others .

		The bulk of the book is given over to an ex - haustive treatment of all the national parks .

		The peculiar natural beauties of each are de - scribed with considerable detail ; the history of their discovery and final change into parks is told ; and a clear explanation of their natural phenomena given .

		This valuable matter , the reading of which is almost necessary for real en - joyment of these great scenic playgrounds , is supplemented by a splendid appendix , which gives everything in the way of information regarding access to the parks , hotels , trips , camping facili - ties , costs , etc. , that a possible visitor might want .

		PLAYS AND PLAYERS : Leaves from a Critic 's Scrapbook .

		By
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	.


Stewart & Kidd	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	groups the play reviews in this book in three sections
American Plays	ORGANIZATION	, Foreign Plays , and Shakespearean Revivals ; and there is a fourth section made up of short essays on topics connected with drama and the theatre .

		It is worth noting that the section on American plays is by far the longest ; our theatres are de - pending less and less on translations and adapta - tions .

		It is encouraging , too , to find so many relatively good plays in the American list `` The Piper , '' `` Kindling , '' `` As a Man Thinks , '' ^ ` Kismet , '' `` The Yellow Jacket , '' `` Romance , '' `` The Unchastened Woman . ''

		The foreign plays discussed include ``
Hindle Wakes	PERSON	, '' `` The Pi - geon , '' `` Justice , '' `` The Legend of Leonora , '' `` Androcles and the Lion , '' and `` The Weavers . ''

		On the whole , we need not be ashamed of the American showing ; if we have no master to set against
Galsworthy	PERSON	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, or
Hauptmann	PERSON	, we have in `` The Piper '' a play of rare and dis - tinguished beauty , as likely to be of permanent interest as any in either list ; and the other American plays represent genuine achievement both in realism and in romance .

		Easy and col - loquial in style , Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	's criticism is nearly always suggestive or constructive , and custom has not staled his gusto .

		To the general reader perhaps the most interesting part of the book will be the last section , with its lively discussions of what constitutes a good play , personality in 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	acting , and the new art of the theatre .

		The volume ends with a well-told and significant bit of theatrical history the story of the Wash - ington Square Players .

		PROFILES FROM
CHINA	LOCATION	.

		By
Eunice Tiet	ORGANIZATION	- jens .


Ralph Fletcher Seymour	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		A good deal of the discussion as to whether free verse is really poetry has seemed futile to the reviewer : the arguments pro and con have led into so many blind alleys or else have been so absurd as to be simply amusing .

		One won - ders why all these heated antagonists can not ac - cept this new poetic expression for what it is , and neither judge it by its worst examples nor argue that it takes the place of metrical verse .

		Many prose poems , expressions of single sensa - tions or short stories , can not be brushed aside as trivialities .

		They have distinct and decided charm .

		Among those which deserve to be cherished are Mrs.
Tietjens	PERSON	's `` Profiles from
China	LOCATION	. ''

		The poems are distinguished first by their almost un - failing subjectivity .

		The writer nearly always interprets each sight in terms of her own reac - tion .

		The poetry is personal , intimate , confiden - tial .

		We do not mean that it is autobiographical , but that Mrs.
Tietjens	PERSON	quickly establishes a close relation between herself and the reader .

		She sees dirty , crowded
China	LOCATION	with a quick eye , and puts it before us with its gods and beggars , walls , women and dandies , rickshas and camels all portrayed with humor , fear , sympathy , pathos , irony , and imagination .

		That is , it is weighted with an emotional appeal and lively imagery .

		We quote from one of the most beau - tiful .

		THE MOST SACRED MOUNTAIN Space , and the twelve clean winds of heaven , And this sharp exultation , like a cry , after the slow six thousand steps of climbing !

		This is
Tai Shan	PERSON	, the beautiful , the most holy .

		Below my feet the foot-hills nestle , brown with flecks of green ; and lower down the flat brown plain , the floor of earth , stretches away to blue in - finity .

		Beside me in this airy space the temple roofs cut their low curves against the sky , And one black bird circles above the void .

		Space , and the twelve clean winds are here ; And with them broods eternity a swift , white peace , a presence manifest .

		The rhythm ceases here .

		Time has no place .

		This is the end that has no end .

		But I shall go down from this airy space , this swift white peace , this stinging exultation ; And time will close about me , and my soul stir to the rhythm of the daily round .

		Vet , having known , life will not press so close , and always I shall feel time ravel thin about me ; For once I stood In the white windy presence of eternity .

		THE BOOK OF CAMPING .

		By
A. Hyatt Verrill	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		This instructive little book aims to supph the beginner 's need for a primer in woodcraft , and in the main it succeeds in its purpose .

		It contains much useful information for the neo - phyte camper and is especially valuable for its practical hints about camp sites , camp house - keeping , cooking , and accidents .

		At times , in its efforts to be superpractical , it overshoots the mark .

		No old woodsman , for example , would call lean-to 's or shacks of evergreen boughs or bark , whose construction is minutely described , `` comfortable permanent
summer	DATE	camps . ''

		He knows them for stuffy insect-traps .

		To him the directions for homemade traps and moccasins are reminiscent of the days when he really believed all that was set forth in
Dan Beard	LOCATION	's `` Ameri - can Boy 's Handy Book . ''

		This fault the fault of telling how to make clumsy things that can better be bought often gets into `` how-to '' books .

		However , if salted with the knowledge that the old camper 's first rule is `` Be comfortable sensi - bly , '' this little handbook will be very valuable to the novice .

		Hi SSIAN MEMORIES .

		By
Madame Olga Novikoff	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.


Madame Novikoff	PERSON	's strong reassertion of the might and the right of Russian imperialism strikes a startling note in the revolutionary at - mosphere of to-day .

		She is said to have been in great part responsible for the Anglo-Russian alliance of the present war .

		It was a peaceful alliance she strove for during forty years , but she is none the less satisfied that a common foe should have brought the two countries to a closer understanding .

		Her activities won from Dis - raeli the doubtful compliment implied in the title `` The M. P. for
Russia	LOCATION	in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Of a more friendly nature was the praise bestowed upon her by
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	,
Kinglake	PERSON	, and
Froude	PERSON	, as well as by
Gladstone	PERSON	, who took her side during the tide of Turkish feeling in
England	LOCATION	during the
' 70	DATE	's .

		At the time of the Turkish atrocities in Bul - garia , her brother ,
Nicholas Kireeff	PERSON	, arming him - self with relief money and hospital materials .

		hastened to do his bit in behalf of the southern Slavs .

		Becoming fired with enthusiasm for their cause , he joined the Serbian ranks as an officer , and was shot in the first charge .

		His fame im - mediately spread ; he \ \ as acclaimed a hero throughout
Russia	LOCATION	and the
Balkans	LOCATION	; and thou - sands followed his example as volunteers .

		But to his sister 's distraught mind it was
England	LOCATION	that had killed him .

		`` It is
England	LOCATION	, '' she wrote , `` who prevents our Government from helping our brethren in the
Balkans	LOCATION	. ''

		Upon reflection .

		she saw that the remedy for such blunders in the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 117 future would be a better understanding between her country and
England	LOCATION	, and to this end she devoted all her energies , her unfailing charm , and her capacity for sympathy and comprehen - sion .

		At a time when
Lord Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	and the larger part of
England	LOCATION	were speaking in the highest terms of their ally ,
Abdul Hamid	PERSON	, `` whose every impulse is good , '' her self-imposed mission was none of the lightest ; nor was
Disraeli	PERSON	's epi - thet the most discourteous she received .

		The period was one of which modern Englishmen are little likely to boast , so that some of her retro - spective bitterness is perhaps unnecessary .

		Her `` Memories '' include , besides political material , reminiscences of the musicians and writers of the day , and of other prominent men and women in the two countries .

		Since it is a chapter of na - tional life that is perhaps closed , it gains in interest at this time .

		The author has apparently spent little time on the ordered preparation of her book , but her manner of writing is invari - ably engaging and intelligent .

		NOTES OK NEW FICTIOST Imagine a book that starts like an essay on modern philosophy , continues like a confession , goes at a bound into fiction , shifts into the man - ner of a Kipling fairy tale , and ends in perfect consistency with them all .

		Such is
Stella Ben	PERSON	- son 's `` This Is the End '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		One may take it quite literally , and remain puzzled by a few various matters .

		It is fairly safe to say that however one takes it there will still be puzzling things about it .

		What a reader gets from it , after all , will be in proportion to the imagination , sympathy , and intelligence that he brings .

		Was it Sainte-Beuve who maintained that in reading over old papers one never finds more than half the matter in print ?

		The other half lies in the minds of contemporary readers and constitutes by no means the least effectual part .

		Every significant book stimulates its read - ers to the office of participant ; Miss
Benson	PERSON	's does so in a peculiar degree .

		One imagines that Miss Benson must be some - thing like her own
Jay	PERSON	.

		For
Jay	PERSON	`` was a per - son who took nothing in the world for granted , but as she had only a slight connection with the world , that is not saying very much .

		Nothing ever embittered
Jay	PERSON	, not even her own pessimism .

		There is a finality about bitterness and
Jay	PERSON	was never final . ''

		You may look upon
Jay	PERSON	's secret story as `` an imaginary hieroglyphic , '' if you will ; you may look upon Miss
Benson	PERSON	's story as a fan - tasy , an extravaganza , a symbol , or a subtle com - ment upon contemporary life .

		It is all these in part , and therefore people will enjoy it for dif - ferent reasons and in different wavs .

		She her - self says : `` This is the end , for the moment , of all my thinking , this is my unfinal conclusion .

		There is no reason in tangible things , and no system in the ordinary ways of the world .

		Hands were made to grope , and feet to stumble , and the only things you may count on are the un - accountable things .

		There are no reasons except reasons you and I do n't know ... But if the things which I know in spite of my education were false , if the eyes of the sea forgot their secret , or if the accent of the steep woods became vulgar , if the fairy adventures that happen in my heart fell flat , if the good friends my eyes have never seen failed me then indeed should I know emptiness , and an astonishment that would kill . ''

		No account of the book would be complete that did not mention the war , for the war is through it , beneath it , part of its very making , and yet always unobtrusive .

		The war is a hu - morous thing , it is a commonplace thing , it is an overwhelming , flat , disillusioning thing that de - scends and robs the world of all hope and of all light .

		Perhaps it is superfluous to add that
Miss Benson	PERSON	is a writer of unusual skill .

		She is , how - ever , something more than brilliant , humorous , and fantastic .

		What this something is , she sends out a challenge to the individual reader to dis - cover .

		Perhaps
F. T. Wawn	PERSON	's `` The Joyful Years '' is best described as a first-rate , second-rate novel .

		It is one of those stories of solid worth which only the English writers seem able to produce .

		On every page there is evidence of the trained thinker and writer who has observed life .

		There is never a hint of `` inspiration , '' none of the slovenliness of the `` divine fire . ''

		At the start one meets several interesting people , and having found them to be genuine people and not `` char - acters , '' one settles comfortably back , knowing that whatever happens will make interesting read - ing .

		There is a middle-aged journalist with a whimsical philosophy and a delicious cynicism ; there is a young woman who is mildly rebellious toward the British respectability of her family ; then there is a young clerk of excellent family but with no prospects , and against him there is the successful Official , his employer and rival in love .

		Of course there is nothing new in the situation , but there is much that is new in the way the various characters develop under that situation .

		It is this avoidance of effort at originality in plot which is so admirable , for the true artist finds his material in character rather than situation and is as much interested in what his people think as in what they do .

		It is worth remarking , in passing , that although the war plays a part in the story , it is handled with some perspective .

		The book may be recommended for those who enjoy a good story well told .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
August	DATE	lf Whenever the reviewer finds a subject that is commonly a novelist 's excuse for sensation , actu - ally treated with relative truth and soberness , his impulse is to give the author hearty accla - mation irrespective of the real value of his per - formance .


Joseph McCabe	PERSON	, in `` The Pope 's Favorite '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , has succeeded in giving a truthful representation of the reign -LRB- one can call it no less -RRB- of
Alexander VI	PERSON	, the
Borgia Pope	LOCATION	.

		His knowledge of the times has perhaps led him a little astray as far as narrative unity is concerned ; his story is more an incidental description of the lives and deeds of that notorious personage , his favorita
Giulia	PERSON	, and the papal `` nephew '' and `` niece , '' Cesare and
Lucrezia	LOCATION	, than it is a properly conducted plot .

		But by smashing a number of cherished traditions con - cerning
Rodrigo Borgia	PERSON	, he represents him as a really very possible sort of person .

		If the title cause the reader to expect a book that he will conceal behind a magazine in public , he will be misled .

		It is hardly pour Us jtunes filles , neither is it for the sensation seekers .

		It is simply a good historical novel one of the best that it has been our luck to see in a long time .

		Why can not authors get together a bit in this matter of plot and setting ?

		Why must we be subjected invariably to a Broadway plot in a Broadway setting , and to an Alaskan plot in an Alaskan setting ?

		Stage a
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	story in the Yukon , for instance , and you might have something rather piquant .

		These dispiriting re - flections are caused by the perusal of a new snow - and-primitive-man tale entitled `` The Yukon Trail , '' by
William MacLeod Raine	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		It will be all the same to you whether you read this novel or any one of half a dozen of the same variety of the present sea - son .

		It is a fairly plausible , well-planned yarn that clings to the traditions of its type and its setting .

		One seldom encounters a book which may be added to the group of which `` Huckleberry Finn '' and `` The Story of a Bad Boy '' are the classics .

		Although
Edward Bellamy Partridge	ORGANIZATION	by no means approaches those two stories in `` Sube Cane '' he has nevertheless written an authentic story of boyhood .

		It is quite true that `` Sube '' is `` all boy . ''

		His is the ingenuity and ingenu - ousness of adolescence and those who have a furtive sympathy with the innate genius for mis - chief which characterizes youth will find a hu - mor which does not tax their credulity or patience .

		The author knows the psychology of boys and has written a story in which there is a genuine appreciation of a boy 's character and mind .

		CASUAL , COMMI N i 1 UK TENTACLES OF MR. HEARST hu \ e reached out and have gathered in another repre - sentative periodical .

		The International
Maga	PERSON	- zine Company , which has already appropriated the `` Cosmopolitan '' and ``
Harper	PERSON	's Bazar , '' is now reported as having closed in on `` Puck . ''

		Having conquered the library table and the bou - doir , Mr.
Hearst	PERSON	is now to conquer the barber shop .

		The library table , thanks to him , is not what it once was , nor is the boudoir ; so why should one expect the barber shop to remain un - changed ?

		The Hearstian breeze wafts itself over flowery banks stealing and giving odors , and often making two odors , or two dozen though of a pungent sort not hitherto known or relished grow where but one grew before .

		The man who is waiting two or three minutes for the next vacant chair was well worth going after .

		He is many , and in those two or three minutes he may be able , if taken decisively in hand -LRB- as he doubtless will be -RRB- , to come to im - portant determinations in matters of statesman - ship and of sociology .

		The saloon as a political molecule threatens to pass : welcome the newer and better -LRB- or different -RRB- political molecule , the tonsorial parlor .

		THE GROWING TASTE OF THE JAPANESE FOR READING continues to excite wide remark .

		Less than fifty years ago literature was the interest of the few : the `` Daigaku '' and the `` Rongo , '' two classics setting forth Confucian precepts , were held to be sufficient intellectual food for the average samurai child .

		To-day not the sec - ond-hand book shops of
London	LOCATION	or of
New York	LOCATION	, not the quais of
Paris	LOCATION	can compete with the
Jimbo Cho	PERSON	, in the student quarter of
Kanda	LOCATION	.

		English titles are first in number , as the English language is learned by all students in the higher schools , and as all foreign literature is likely to be studied through English translations .

		Among British authors themselves ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	,
Conan Doyle	PERSON	,
Tagore	PERSON	, and
Gordon Craig	PERSON	are prominent .

		Among
Continental	ORGANIZATION	authors
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Eucken	LOCATION	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Maupassant	LOCATION	,
Verlaine	PERSON	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	have their following .

		Among the novelists , the Russians enjoy the inside track
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	.


Japan	LOCATION	regards the Russians as tremendouslv vital and expressive ; and as Japanese canons of good taste forbid too open an indulgence in the feelings , this stoic people finds a sort of vicarious M-lt-i-xpres - sion through the willing Muscovites .

		As is shown by the names cited , the Japanese prefer - ence is for the moderns of the
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	world , not for the long-established classic .

		1 \ cn the cubists and futurists enjoy a welcome . '

		1
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 119 fluctuates , of course ; but it may be said , in a general way , that , at present , it runs more to the sober and serious than it did not long ago .

		Books of psychological , ethical , and political in - terest have succeeded the licentious stories for - merly so much in vogue .

		The censor has been busy among Maupassant ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and
Kropotkin	PERSON	as the result , possibly , of love trage - dies which have involved several of the `` new '' men and women .

		`` New women '' writers and authors of stories of geisha intrigues tend more and more to be neglected .

		The corrective even runs farther : among periodicals all kinds of tech - nical magazines are reported to be in great de - mand ; and the most widely circulated of all are those which address themselves to woman and the home .

		PRESIDENT
WILSON	PERSON	IN FRENCH such is the promise conveyed by the announcement that his `` History of the American People , '' in five vol - umes , is to be published in
France	LOCATION	and the French colonjes by
Bossard	ORGANIZATION	, of
Paris	LOCATION	, under arrange - ment with
Harper & Bros.	ORGANIZATION	, the President 's American publishers .

		The translation is to be made by Professor
Roustan	PERSON	, of the
Lycee Louis	LOCATION	- le-Grand , and the introduction will be written by
Emile Boutroux	PERSON	, of the French Academy .

		Some of the President 's critics have noted that his long series of state papers , through the past three troubled years , were penned quite as much with a view to history as to the crisis they dealt with : his concern for style helped make it seem that he was writing with an eye to posterity .

		If the opinion of the foreign peoples of our own day may be considered as constituting a kind of contemporaneous posterity , the President will be able to appraise the extent and quality of his own future fame before he quits this present sphere .

		AN OUTSPOKEN AND CHARACTERISTIC ESTI - MATE OF THE RECRUIT can be picked up from
Captain Agate	ORGANIZATION	's new book , `` L. of C. '' -LRB- Lines of Communication -RRB- .

		Says he : `` The man who en - lists for his sweet country 's sake is a bit of a nuisance who should have been born a leading article .

		The man we most \ vant is he who en - lists for a lark , or because everybody else is enlisting , or for a jumble of reasons , or for no reason at all . ''

		The reader may gloss such a pronouncement according to his own nature and taste .

		Some will gather the idea that the humble private is best , in the English army , as in the German , when he does not exercise his mind , or when he has no mind to exercise .

		Others will see a left-handed compliment , based on ad - miration for the man who minimizes emotion , even if he be emotionally hidebound .

		Perhaps the latter is the true reading ; witness the recent volumes of soldier slang , the recent examples of soldiers ' songs : the former briskly fending off all approach to the feelings , the latter , often ribald and silly , never dignified , never patriotic .

		Perhaps the reactions of our own troops will soon throw additional light on the emotional make-up of English-speaking peoples in times of patriotic service and of danger .

		A NEW WAY OF PUTTING TOGETHER ENCY - CLOPAEDIAS has been devised .

		It is the plan so long pursued in the putting together of world 's fairs : on the basis of the country .


Harper	PERSON	and
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	are to issue an encyclopaedic library of twenty-four special encyclopaedias , each compris - ing six volumes and each devoted to a particular race or nation or region .

		The first set deals with the Slavonic race .

		The set to be devoted to the
United States	LOCATION	will be , it is promised , the most comprehensive and detailed account of us yet at - tempted .

		The necessary financial backing for this extensive enterprise is furnished by Mr.
Adolph Lewisohn	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, and the edi - torial supervisor will be Dr.
Isidore Singer	PERSON	, as - sisted by a board selected from the faculties of various American universities .

		It is understood that Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	has taken this means of com - memorating the fiftieth anniversary of his ar - rival in this country .

		A set of books may be as enduring and satisfactory a memorial as the chain of library buildings in which they may find themselves housed .

		WILL THE OBER-AMMERGAU PASSION PLAY SURVIVE ?

		Or , more specifically and immediately , will it revive for
1920	DATE	?

		No war within man 's memory has imperilled this ancient observance at the heart of the Bavarian highlands until the present one .

		Late visitors to the village speak of it as a haunted place , struggling to live on in memories of the past a past more tender of long-established tradition than the iconoclastic days which we now endure .

		They report that the spirit which made and kept the play is lack - ing , as well as the cast .


Anton Lang	PERSON	, the `` Christus , '' renouncing his dream of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land after the return of peace , has been called to the colors , following the `` John the Baptist '' and other participants into the strife .

		A new world will emerge , with gains , let us hope ; with losses , assuredly ; and the pious , remote institution dating from the
seventeenth century	DATE	may be among the things to the sacrifice of which the coming day will have regretfully to adjust itself .

$ 1.60	MONEY	net The Needed Quality The quality of a manual on English Lit - erature is probably more important than that of any other book in use .

		Literature is nothing , if it is not a living source of in - spiration or pleasure , it can not be taught as a dead language , or a mathematical formula .

		With this in mind Professor
Miller	PERSON	planned his new text-book .

		What Sometimes Happens It is generally acknowledged that the reading habit is often greatly weakened sometimes completely destroyed in the schools .

		Tennyson knew this and despaired upon learning that ``
Enoch Arden	PERSON	'' had been adopted for class-room study .

		Dates and places are important but less important than the ideals , ideas and purposes of the great writers as shown in their works .

		Too often the boy 's or girl 's study of fact obscures the core of the subject the beauty , the stimu - lus .

		How often is this the fault of text - books , the introduction to a live matter through a dead medium ?

		What Should Be the Object The object of text-books in English I.itrr - erature should be to stimulate readers to a love and appreciation of the best and to lead them into the habit of reading the good and great books for enjoyment as well as learning .

		This new book by Professor
Miller	PERSON	has been planned throughout with this in mind .

		The pages are not burdened with facts but with stimulating ideas .

		Emphasis is laid upon forces and influences not upon dates .

		During the preparation of the book the author gave careful consideration to every important pedagogical principle .

		Is n't that the right sort of book for in - troducing young people to the vast field of Literature which is intended for the inter - pretation and enrichment of life ?

Tennyson	PERSON	, some of them with his autograph .

		have been sold at public auction .

		The Tennyson drawing in Mr.
Madigan	PERSON	* s possession is of a ruined castle .


Robert Browning	PERSON	is another author who is represented .

		His sketch is a study of three Rus - sians standing in front of a building ; he sent this drawing from the Continent to several members of his family .


Browning	PERSON	devoted a great deal of his time to obtaining odd effects with his impromptu pictures .

		One of his diversions was roasting brown paper over a candle to produce weird results .

		There is a sketch also by CharKv K ngs - le \ .

		whose skill with the pencil was unusual , and who at one time founded and taught a drawing - class at
Bideford	LOCATION	.

		Many examples by him are scattered among his friends , their heirs , and cessors .

		Knights of
St. John	ORGANIZATION	, though it was taken by Ae i Turks in

South America	LOCATION	.

Africa	LOCATION	the source of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	is made to appear to be two large i lakes in the centre of the country .

		Three things are of paramount interest in his story : the men with whom he came into contact and their influence in his mental and moral attitude toward life ; the books with which , during the impressionable adolescent years , he fed his imagination to forget the dis - agreeable work-a-day world ; and that marvel - ous old woman , his grandmother , of whom it has been said that `` she has the values of a Rembrandt .

		THE
DIAL & Jfortntst	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tlj > journal of Utttrarp Criticfcm , jBtecussrton , anb Snformattoit A Plea for Shorter Novels Swollen novels , like swollen fortunes , have come to be a good deal of a nuisance .

		We read too much , just as we eat too much our fiction is too long , just as our dinners are too heavy .

		The cause of the swollen novel is dis - closed in part by an anonymous English essayist who has been tracing the develop - ment of long-form fiction through the past century .

		His attack is chiefly against the conventional paraphernalia of novel-mon - gering when employed by second-rate hands , and he sets forth some principles of his own to replace a perfunctory and worn-out service ; yet almost as much that is objectionable crops out in the ideals he holds up as in the practices he condemns .

		The point of departure is Samuel But - ler , author of that exceptional novel , `` The Way of All Flesh '' a good citation and a timely .

		Butler , it is maintained , has pointed out better than any other novelist the right way to the novel , has better ex - pressed the law of its being .

		That law appears to be this : the novelist should use the story as a means of talking about all that interests him most , and about noth - ing that does not interest him .

		Construc - tion , in a novel , is not the art of exciting by means of the connection of incident with incident : it is the art of leaving out , without incoherence , all that does not interest the writer and of putting in all that does .

		Dostoevsky expressed nothing but his own intense interests ;
Jane Austen	PERSON	saw that a plot should be to the novelist a means of expressing his own interests , not of trying to interest his readers .

		Stiff doctrine , this , and unpalatable to the arri - viste ; yet the intending novelist is urged to learn from such authors , so actuated , rather than from the competent hacks whose works , by the time they are ten years old , seem but a mass of stale con - trivance .

		Real art , the writer goes on , repeti - tiously , consists not in telling a story , but in finding one which you can use to tell what interests you , and that only .

		To dis - cover the nature of your own interest in life , to ascertain what you know about human beings , and to express that in the form of a story , such is the task of the novelist .

		You may do what you like with your plot provided you get your own inter - est , your own knowledge , into it .

		The history of the novel through the past hundred years is incoherent , because our novelists have not , consciously and with increasing determination , set themselves to the task .

		Interest yourself ; express your inter - est. .

		All amateurs do so ; and that , finally , `` is why amateurs have had such astonish - ing success with the novel . ''

		Well , it might be maintained that all novelists at least near the beginning are amateurs ; indeed , it might be asserted that the art of novel-writing , through lack of instruction and of a body of systematic rules to govern practice , is the amateur 's art par excellence .

		The amateur has more enthusiasm -LRB- or `` interest '' -RRB- than discipline ; and lack of discipline makes for diffuse - ness and formlessness .

		These two have always been the capital defects of the Eng - lish novel , and even such modern British practitioners as have lived in
France	LOCATION	and have studied their art there have not al - ways been able to leave behind them that slackness which is one of their racial characteristics .

		The loose-tongued , self - indulgent Englishman chats , sprawls , goes quite ungirt ; and the essayist of the Lon - don `` Times '' finds justification and indul - gence for him .

		Of course the cardinal point of `` inter - est '' remains quite unshaken , if we are dealing with the artist and not with the 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	mere purveyor .

		Yet even the artist , though he has chosen his theme on the basis of `` interest , '' must sometimes exe - cute longueurs or face the scene-a-faire just as the portrait-painter , for example , must sometimes reconcile himself to giving about so many square feet of dull , drab background .

		The essential difference is , of course , that the canvas is seen at a glance , with its longueurs automatically subordinated or ignored , while the novel is usually -LRB- or sometimes -RRB- taken page by page , as the pages run , with the arid tracts in complete evidence .

		Now and then appears an author who will banish the drab and the arid ; every page must sparkle , every paragraph must aid the grand elan : the result is the fidgeting rapidity of `` Candide '' or of the `` Dolly Dialogues . ''

		Any style is permissible save the ennuyeux yet even the most rapid and brilliant style becomes a weariness if it represents too long and systematic an eva - sion .

		`` Interest '' is , of course , but another form of confidence .

		They are the two sides of one shield .

		The author who says , `` I have enough interest in this topic to develop it in extenso and full confidence in my ability to hold my reader 's attention through all my amplifications and wander - ings , '' is doubly armed .

		To confidence coupled with industry is due about nine - tenths of `` Clayhanger . ''

		You are carried on by the author 's absorption in his sub - ject and by his serene assumption that he can carry you on .

		`` Skip ? ''

		exclaimed a reader in the midst of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's great trilogy ; `` where can you skip to ? ''

		And indeed you are on a wide prairie that makes its own horizon , and there is noth - ing to do but trudge ahead .

		The novel is expected to have at least 75,000 words .

		One of 90,000 is still of moderate length .

		One of 125,000 may be taxed with embonpoint .

		One of 150,000 or more unless the words are demon - strably necessary may fairly be pro- nounced gross .

		I recall the instance of a novelist who wrote half a million words , from which to cull 125,000 for his volume .

		Even if one has no reason to complain of the result , he has a good right to pro- test against the process .

		That indicates a lack of self-discipline such as threatens to lead on almost to a disintegration of mental fibre .

		Surely , a man should know what he is after , and should go after it straight .

		The long novel too often sug - gests the unpacked trunk the contents have never been compactly brought to - gether at all , but are spread loosely , and often at random , over bed , chairs , and floor .

		If one 's material is to take the journey to other lands , or to posterity , or even through the day 's market , it ought to be packed in for the trip .

		It must have compression and the form that ensues .

		Compressed form is itself one of the mani - festations of force an evidence of vigor .

		The novel of to-day should be required to bant .

		I believe that a novelist can say his say in 60,000 words , or even in 50,000 .

		I believe that in 50,000 words , properly packed , he can even cover long periods of time and can handle adequately a large number of individuals and of family groups .

		Much of the accepted apparatus must , of course , be thrown into the discard .

		I would be indulgent toward the preliminary exposition , but not far be - yond it .

		One should rule out long descrip - tions of persons such things are nugatory and vain : with your best effort the reader sees only what he has seen , and figures your personage on the basis of his own experience and recollection .

		One must abolish set descriptions of places , unless unique , remote , unfamiliar ; for the world , in these days of easy travel and abundant depiction , has come to know itself pretty well .

		One will banish all `` conversation , '' whatever its vraisemblance to life , if it merely fills the page without illuminating it .

		I would sweep away , as would the writer I am commenting upon , all labor - ious effort on stuff that is dragged in because someone will think it `` ought to be there '' cliches , conventional scenes and situations .

		To prevent sprawl and form - lessness I favor a division into `` books , '' and a division of the books into sections .

		Thus articulation and proportion will be secured , as in the case of an architectural order ; and one will be better able to down the rising head of verbosity .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 141 `` Real art '' does not consist in finding a story in which you can tell what interests you , and that only .

		Such a step indeed makes an advantageous preliminary , and may free one in advance from some of the botherations lying in wait reluctant love passages , repellent sex-discussions , scenes of violence and bloodshed with which one may have no proper affinity , indelicate `` close-ups '' which explore and exploit poor humanity beyond the just bounds of decorum , and such like .

		`` Real art '' is , and will remain , largely a matter of form , of organism , of definition , of boundaries .

		The artist will express his `` interest '' heaven forbid that he should not ; but it must be an interest disciplined by , and within , metes and bounds , an in - terest which shall result in a unified im - pression that depends much upon the time-element and on the simple counting of words .

		Words sometimes darken coun - sel ; and too many of them may becloud and even wreck artistic intention .


HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.


William James Europe	PERSON	knows at present but one
Ameri	PERSON	- can philosopher .

		This is
William James	PERSON	.

		And
Europe	LOCATION	knows him as the American philosopher , because in the most intimate and specific way , he is the philosopher of
America	LOCATION	.

		In the history of philosophy , there are always two streams of ten - dency which cross each other and in - terpenetrate often but never remain coincident throughout their course .

		The first and more fundamental is the spon - taneous envisagement of the world and of man , the vision of the place of man in nature and of his destiny under the as - pect of eternity .

		The second is largely commentary on the first .

		The first is com - posed of theories of life , rooting deep in the experiences and adventures of man - kind .

		The second is essentially a pedan - try which elaborates , in the manner of the professor , the implications of the first and carries it to the limit of logical re - finement , until it is displaced by a fresh vision at the hands of a fresh thinker .

		Most philosophy in
America	LOCATION	has been sec - ondary , professorial , irrelevant to the actual course of life and thought in this country .

		Its roots lay in a tradition which the circumstances of life rejected and which the adventure of living falsified .

		This tradition is that of Calvinism .

		Calvin had a vision which infected great groups of European people .

		The light of that vision led them to undergo many hardships and to undertake many difficulties .

		For one it drove a company of them to con - tinental
North America	LOCATION	.

		It was the urge within the heart of the Puritan pioneers , of the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		It helped them to fight the wilds in nature and in man , to build their community , and to order their lives .

		It was an intense thing and it was a learned thing .

		The wilds of nature , however , rejected the sophistications of learning ; they required strength of body and sincerity of soul .

		The Calvinist tra - dition hence became mitigated under the stress of the conflict between man and na - ture which necessitated the belief in neigh - borly good will , in human initiative , in continual trustworthiness , in responsibil - ity , and in freedom .

		What the Calvinist brought to
America	LOCATION	and what he there learned were opposites .

		The life of
America	LOCATION	consequently flowed away from Calvinism into other courses .

		Its role was changed from the dynamic organization of an emotion into the skeleton of an idea .

		It became the preoccupation of the school - man , thin in utterance , vaguely optimistic in sentiment , and completely irrelevant to the problems of life and living .

		From
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	to
Josiah Royce	PERSON	, it retained this character .

		Even in
Emer	PERSON	- son , it failed to come to close grips with the realities with which human life in
America	LOCATION	was dealing .

		That life flowed on , pioneer .

August	DATE	30 beliefs , whether these be Mormonism or
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	, or the undiscriminating good-fellowship of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		In its higher reaches it was cheerful , humorous , experimental , with faith in its own power ; adventurous without being romantic , pious without ceasing to be essentially human - istic .

		It was the spirit that trekked across the American continent , that mined the gold , that fought the Civil War , that built the railways , that converted a wilderness into a civilization .

		It is forward-looking , industrious , democratic .

		It is the spirit of the industrial democracy of
Europe	LOCATION	as well , but without the hampering past of mankind in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is the spirit of the rising masses of
Europe	LOCATION	, confronting , not a conflict with the repressive machinery of a caste-hardened social order , but virgin Nature , and building a new and freer civ - ilization of her substance .

		It is this spirit which the philosophy of
William James	ORGANIZATION	expresses .

		And it is for this reason that his vogue in
Europe	LOCATION	is proportional to his articulate visioning of the unconscious guiding forces in the life and hopes of
America	LOCATION	.

		His philosophy is a theory of life , not made in the schools but gathered through deep sympathy with the hearts of men whose beating his own responded to , the wide world over .

		For significantly enough , though
James	PERSON	was an American thinker , his training was very far from American .

		The parental household in which he spent his childhood was that of a Swedenborgian clergyman whose concrete spiritism made a lasting modification of
James	PERSON	's mind .

		His youth was spent in schools in French
Switzer	PERSON	- land , in
France	LOCATION	itself , and in
England	LOCATION	.

		He studied painting with
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, and nature with
Louis Agassiz	PERSON	.

		He was in succession a painter , a physician , a physiologist , a psychologist , and a philoso - pher .

		After
1872	DATE	he was one of the best known members of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	faculty .

		His theory of life is technically known as Pragmatism .

		He got the word from
Charles Peirce	PERSON	, and he called it himself a new name for an old way of thinking .

		But this old way of thinking might as well have been called Americanism , for it is substantially the perception of the nature and destiny of man when human life is apprehended at its fighting weight , and its form and go come under direct observa - tion .

		What then appears is mankind struggling for survival in a world which was not made for it but in which it grew .

		This world is characterized by a grow - ing diversity and manyness .

		Not only are man and all living things seeking to win a livelihood at the risk of their lives , but in - animate nature itself is composed of mul - titudes , each one of which has a character , an idiosyncrasy and selfhood , the destruc - tion of which it resists and the conserva - tion of which seems to be the endeavor of its existence .

		Each thing in this world is autonomous and self-governed .

		It exists with other things only in so far as it has succeeded in making an adjustment to them , only in so far as it has succeeded in establishing , in a word , certain habits and forms of interaction , which make up the actual unities of the world we live in and know .

		All these unities are not primary but secondary .

		They are habits of behaving which things develop toward each other in order that thev may be together at all .

		We call them ' laws of nature , '' but even the most fundamental of the laws of nat - ure are no more .

		The laws of mechanics , of thermodynamics , of chemistry they also change , evolve , accommodate .

		There was a time when they were not , and there will be a time when they shall not be .

		What in truth characterizes the world as a whole is the fact that all of its parts are constantly undergoing mutations muta - tions sometimes compelled from without , and always arising from within .

		All the items in the world are changing items novelties keep constantly emerging and they either succeed in winning a place for themselves in the cosmos or disappear .

		The cosmos itself is like a team of in - dividuals who have attained to a certain mode of being and acting together .

		It is a happening , not an eternal form , and its unity is contingent upon the assent , the formed habits , of its constituents .

		In this cosmos , man has happened , an infinitesimal scrap in an infinite universe .

		He is no more central to the world than any other thing , not even the gods .

		For
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 143 gods there may be , differing in kind and in individuality just as there are men , and having qualities of consciousness with which religious experience suggests men may come into touch and be helped or frustrated .

		These gods also may be part of the cosmic team .

		They also , if they are , must undergo change , must struggle for survival , must work together with men and things for the maintenance of the ordered world , in an environment which is infinitude .

		Working , consequently , successful working , is the test .

		Men and thoughts and things are not born good , they make good .

		It is becoming , not being , that counts .

		All the organs and capacities of man must be strong to maintain them - selves and to do their appropriate share in maintaining the organism of which they are parts , if they and it are to survive .

		Ideas , opinions , hypotheses , arising no matter how , all start really on the same level .

		Each involves , at the outset , an act of faith , a willingness to believe in the prosperity of its guidance , a willing - ness , consequently , to take the risk of failure that is likely as not to come by following its guidance .

		Each has to be set to work to win its way in the control of that aspect of the world or of experi - ence which it intends or designates .

		Each is true or false , not primarily but eventu - ally , as it succeeds or fails in winning this control .

		It follows that it is unwise as well as unjust to rule out , a priori , any hypothesis , any way of thinking , which as it appears makes a claim to truth .

		The right , the scientific action is to give it a chance to make good its claim .

		No matter what an idea may be , it must be tested , so far as possible , experimentally .

		Whether it be the conception of human survival after death , or of the character of divinity , or the power of the mind to heal , it must not be rejected a priori .

		There is a dogmatism and intolerance of science which can be quite as vicious as the dogmatism and intolerance of religion .

		The important thing , in this changing world , is the democratic equality of op - portunity to make good for ideas as well as for men .

		That is really the only in - dispensable assumption of scientific meth - od , and Pragmatism is a theory of scien - tific method .

		James 's thinking was impregnated and fertilized through and through by this as - sumption .

		His associations of childhood and his youthful training had given him the power of sympathetic insight into the motives and bases for the great variety of human demands , both superstitious and intelligent .

		Lover of peace and inter - nationalist as he was , he had sympathy even for the instincts which find expres - sion in war , and his proposal of a moral equivalent for it is one of the great docu - ments in the history of the socialization of mankind .

		If one were to sum up in a single phrase
James	PERSON	's attitude toward the world and to - ward human life , one might call it that of metaphysical democracy .

		His sense for individuality in things , his sense for the right of things to their individuality stands out in all of his philosophical writing : that is really all that is implied in the meta - physics he has called `` radical empiricism '' ; that is really all that is implied in the method he has named Pragmatism .

		In ethics , of course , he was a humanist to that degree that nothing human , even the most remote and fanciful of human things , was alien to him .

		He acknowledged the claim of each and asked for each an op - portunity to justify itself by its works .

		That is the tenor of the collection of es - says headed by the famous one on `` The Will to Believe '' -LRB- 1897 -RRB- , and the `` Talks to Teachers , '' etc. -LRB- 1899 -RRB- .

		That is the as - sumption underlying his great two-volume `` Psychology '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , his - `` Pragma - tism '' -LRB-
1907	DATE	-RRB- , his `` A Pluralistic Uni - verse '' -LRB-
1909	DATE	-RRB- , his posthumous `` Some Problems in Philosophy '' -LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- , the various essays in `` Radical Empiricism '' -LRB-
1912	DATE	-RRB- , his study in the `` Varieties of Re - ligious Experience '' -LRB-
1902	DATE	-RRB- .

		In his think - ing what was fundamental and what was best as well as what was most hopeful and most fresh in the life of
America	LOCATION	and in the life of Western civilization as a whole found its first free articulate philosophic expression .

London	LOCATION	-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The literary critic in
London	LOCATION	is beginning nowadays to feel what old soldiers felt when the Prince de Conde or it may have been Turenne undertook and carried out his classical winter campaign .

		They objected with justice that if this innovation were to take root , the soldier would get no rest and the leisurely indus - try of warfare would grow distasteful to persons of a quiet habit .

		And since Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	and
Miss Marie Corelli	PERSON	led their victorious thou - sands into the middle of the slack season , the old routine of the year has been broken up and the critic has been robbed of his rest in the hot weather .

		A scattered fire of volumes of all sorts has come from all the presses during the
summer	DATE	.

		Poetry continues most amazingly to flourish .

		In - telligent prophets predict darkly that it will pres - ently altogether oust the novel , which , they say , is rapidly dying .

		But to me , at least , the mod - ern novel seems quite sufficiently alive .

		Look at the younger men and women who are writing it in
England	LOCATION	to-day
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	,
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	,
Francis Brett Young	PERSON	,
Ford Madox Hueffer	ORGANIZATION	,
Christopher Stone	PERSON	,
John Palmer	PERSON	,
Frank Swinnerton	PERSON	,
Viola Meynell	PERSON	,
Sylvia Lynd	PERSON	... I am not an enraptured reader of the works of all I have mentioned ; I even wish that some of them would stop writing .

		But their color , their live - liness , their observation , and their sense of lan - guage are incontestable .

		It will go hard with us if we do not carry the English novel a few steps further in this generation than it has hith - erto gone save in two or three very exceptional books .

		The Victorian novel was always like a length of cloth cut off a roll .

		But the ambition of the present century is to make it a complete , rounded , and orderly form , which shall leave one definite impression , and not a multitude of impressions , on the mind of the reader .

		The prose story tends to be a sprawling thing ; it was in its origins the child of `` Le Grand Cyrus '' by
Richardson	PERSON	's
Pamela	LOCATION	.

		Heredity has seemed to curse it ; but it shows many signs now of escaping from orig - inal sin .

		One of the authors I have named , Mr.
Frank Swinnerton	PERSON	, has just produced a most remarkable piece of work , called ``
Noc	ORGANIZATION	- turne . ''

		I can not rid myself of the conviction that he did it for a bet ; but he has written a beautiful , brilliant , and moving book .

		The events which it describes take place within the compass of a single night , from about six o'clock in the evening to two or three in the following morning .

		There are six speaking characters Emmy , the housekeeping and dull sister ;
Jenny	PERSON	, the adventurous sister who works `` in the millin - ery '' ; their paralytic `` Pa '' ;
Alf	PERSON	, a young man , the rejected lover of
Jenny	PERSON	and the accepted suitor of Emmy ;
Keith	PERSON	,
Jenny	PERSON	's sailor lover ; and a chauffeur .

		But the story is not , as one would imagine , overburdened with psychology or retrospective enquiries into the past careers of these persons ; nor is it a turmoil of overcrowded adventures .

		The characters are exquisitely and exactly drawn , each modelled and rounded into a complete semblance of life .

		The book is not padded out by unrelenting insistence on the squalid vulgarity of the setting .

		The scene is transformed as if by a rich light by
Jenny	PERSON	's pas - sionate and adventurous nature .

		Emmy , who might have been a scolding drudge , is observed so lovingly and with so much pity as to make her acceptance of Alf touching and beautiful .

		Even that solid and practical young man who , rebuffed by
Jenny	PERSON	, approaches Emmy with a sad story of his landlady 's cooking , becomes lik - able under the play of Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	's humor .

		`` Pa '' might very well have been horrible with his paralysis , his senile childishness , and his hun - ger and thirst for `` bready-butter pudding '' and the
evening	TIME	dole of beer .

		The point of intense light in the story , round which the whole com - position is grouped , is the love of
Jenny	PERSON	and
Keith	PERSON	.

		The scene on the yacht in which they declare their love is one of the most beautiful in recent literature .

		But it is not isolated .

		This book , from its most workaday humor to its most mov - ing situation , is one piece , attaining unity by an unvarying truth of observation and candor and coolness of exposition .

		Yet of what vulgar materials it is made , is it not slatternly , grum - bling Emmy , pert , selfish , and eventually im - moral
Jenny	PERSON	, the horrible , senile father ... But since Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	can make these things beautiful to us and yet leave them real , they must , perhaps , be beautiful in themselves .

		We may therefore hope for more novels like Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	's , since his appears not to have been a fluke .

		It may be that the novel is learning from poetry , since poetry has become popular again .

		Lyric verse dare not sprawl ; and the growing public liking for it may indicate , or may be de - veloping as a by-product , a taste for compact
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 145 and workman-like things .

		However this may be , it is certain that verse is beginning to share in a kingdom hitherto reserved for the novel .

		The fact that much indifferent or even nauseous verse is being written and read is in reality an excel - lent sign .

		Let the public get accustomed to metre and rhyme and the poets will do the rest .

		Besides , there is always the lucky chance that the public will like the right thing for the wrong reasons , or in a state of vagueness as to its reasons , or because it is bullied into liking it .

		It does not much matter , so long as contributions are made to the support of deserving young ar - tists .

		And it will be good for the poets to be in touch , however suspiciously or disdainfully , with a wide audience .

		Some of them are beginning to show unmis - takable signs of this influence .

		Mr.
Harold Monro	PERSON	, who took a conspicuous part in the movement by founding the Poetry Bookshop , used to be a singularly dull and insipid writer .

		But about three years ago he began suddenly to be fresh and interesting , and he has continued to improve ever since .

		He is not yet fully in command of his own temperament ; he really does not know when he is being individual and when he is being merely silly .

		His new book , `` Strange Meetings , '' is a collection of verses , which change abruptly from being moving and piercing to be - ing clumsy and inept .

		Imagine the state of mind of a man who can write : The stars must make an awful noise in whirling round the sky .

		Yes ; but what of him when he writes : A flower is looking through the ground Blinking at the
April	DATE	weather ; Now a child has seen the flower : Now they go and play together .

		Now it seems the flower will speak , And will call the child its brother But , oh strange forgetfulness !

		They do n't recognize each other .

		Mr.
Monro	PERSON	writes poetry very much as people walk in their sleep .

		He gets sometimes into the most ridiculous places and does the most ludicrous things ; but sometimes his somnambulis - tic mood leads him with astonishing exactness .

		If one were to wake him but criticism will not do this he might become again a writer of tediously lucid poems about socialism and over - feeding and God .

		As it is , he is one of the strangest and most mysterious of poets .

		There is no use in exhorting him .

		We sit patiently and wait what his shifting moods may produce .

		Mr.
Francis Brett Young	PERSON	, whom I mentioned earlier in this letter as a novelist , has recently appeared as a poet of a sort directly opposite to Mr.
Monro	PERSON	.

		He was a serious and conscien - tious novelist ; he is a serious and conscientious poet .

		He does not go sleepwalking after poetry ; he sits down and thinks about it earnestly .

		But the result is extremely satisfying .

		There is nothing flimsy in what he writes ; and if he is a little clumsy and a little stilted , these defects are obviously attendant on his chief quality , which is intellectual power .

		How rare but how splendid a gift in a poet !

		I do not think any - one will be vastly thrilled by his book .

		I can - not imagine schwarmerisch young ladies looking off his pages and dreaming away into inanity , as they are said to do with Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	.

		But grown men , whose minds have grown equally with their sensual perceptions , will find that Mr.
Young	PERSON	feeds the intellectual as well as the emo - tional appetite .

		His poem `` Testament '' is a very moving and satisfying piece of work .

		The author has been campaigning in
East Africa	LOCATION	and he writes : If I had died and never seen the dawn For which I hardly hoped , lighting this lawn Of silvery grasses ; if there had been no light And
last night	TIME	merged into perpetual night ; I doubt if I should ever have been content To have closed my eyes without some testament To the great benefits that marked my faring Through the sweet world .

		And the poem proceeds with a sober but lovely catalogue of good things friendship , argument , and love .

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	admits that his verse is a by-product of his prose ; and it seems un - likely that he will ever write very much of it .

		His utterance seems rather difficult ; but he has a solidity which is not found too often in mod - ern poetry and which makes his book , `` Five Degrees South , '' remarkable .

		I have another new poet before me as I write , whom I feel a little doubtful about mentioning .

		Mr.
Robert Nichols	PERSON	is still very immature and his `` Ardours and Endurances '' has a great many of the defects of youth .

		But he has a singular luxuriance of temperament which promises well .

		I feel rather as one might feel with a young relative a little timid of mentioning his per - formances outside the household .

		I will confine myself to saying that we think we have here a writer whose work may very well make a great impression in a short time .

		146 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	A Frustrated Prophet of Pacifism
HERBERT SPENCER	PERSON	.

		By
Hugh Elliot	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Henry Holt & Co	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
Hugh Elliot	PERSON	has produced a notable work , notable as a biography , notable in its cur - rent appeal , notable in the perspective it estab - lishes for viewing a remarkable intellectual career .

		It is notable also for the experience which prepared Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	to write it .

		It has been my singular fortune -LRB- or fate -RRB- to have read through the whole of
Spencer	PERSON	's works twice at an interval of fifteen years , and each time in the midst of a great war .

		The first reading in fact was carried out on active service on the South African veldt , where not infrequently I had little other baggage than a toothbrush and a volume of the `` Principles of Psychology . ''

		There exists in the English language no more trenchant indictment of war and militarism than is contained in the `` Study of Sociology . ''

		Yet it was my lot to read that work many miles from any inhabited town , in momentary expectation of an attack , and with revolver ready loaded in case of sudden need ... Once again during the progress of a war , have I read
Spencer	PERSON	's furious declamations against warlike and military activities ... Yet still the thought arises , that , if
Europe	LOCATION	had followed
Spencer	PERSON	, this war could never have occurred ... The spirit of Treitschke has triumphed over the spirit of Spencer the meta - physics of
Germany	LOCATION	over the common sense of Eng - land .

		It is strange in how short a time the achieve - ments of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	should assume a ret - rospective interest .

		Even at the time of his death in
1903	DATE	the zenith of his fame had been passed ; and foreign reviewers commented upon the indifference of
England	LOCATION	to his loss .

		His chief contributions had been so thoroughly ab - sorbed in the unparalleled acceleration of scien - tific thinking of which he was an initiator that the debt carried little sense of personal obligation .

		Many of his principles had become common knowledge , and his `` highly original sug - gestions had degenerated into platitudes . ''

		The tone of his own comment upon his career is spir - itually as well as neurasthenically depressed : the devotee of authorship must be prepared for financial losses , for heavy penalties , for privations and denials of human pleasures , for disappoint - ment in the satisfactions of fame .

		Of
Spencer	PERSON	's life and personality little need be restated to set the philosopher in his position twenty years after .

		His education was irregular and self-directed ; he had no academic associa - tions ; he was constitutionally idle and temper - amentally rebellious .

		He was coldly intellectual , strongly self-centred and self-contained , and emotionally barren .

		He avoided social relations beyond his control , and accepted the Athenaeum as his retreat , with music and billiards as diver - sions .

		He lived and wrote largely in boarding - houses , and in many ways reflected the bourgeois attitude of his neighbors .

		He accepted few pub - lic dinners or honors ; he declined , while in this country , an attractive offer to lecture , saying that he had no desire to make a show of himself .

		His life was that of his books ; `` his works were much greater than himself ; and all the best of him will be found in his philosophy . ''

		The formative fact of his modus vivendi was his neurasthenic state , doubtless aggravated by unwise yielding to its impositions and a prejudiced attitude to the proper care of his teeth .

		`` He could not read Kant from the same mental peculiarity that he could not have a tooth extracted : in both cases a subtraction from his own personality was in - volved . ''

		Beginning his career as a civil engineer , he soon turned to the writing of books -LRB- issued largely at his own risk -RRB- , setting forth his ideas and the foundations of his system .

		Legacies from relatives enabled him to survive the attendant losses ; and the subscriptions of friends , to con - tinue the enterprise .

		American support helped him greatly .

		His eighteen volumes were , for the most part , dictated , and often the dictation was continued for a few minutes only at a time , the intervals being spent in restoring or easing the circulation in his brain .

		The limitations of au - thorship and of living for the neurasthenic -LRB-
Spencer	PERSON	wore ear-pads to eliminate controver - sial conversation -RRB- , and the consequences of sen - sitiveness in human relations , have rarely been more singularly expressed than in the `` case '' of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		Of Spencer the biologist , the psychologist , the sociologist , the moralist , the philosopher , the writer on education and social institutions and reforms , it is Spencer the reformer whose work has endured unassailed .

		Spencer survives as the exponent of liberalism and the prophet of pac - ifism .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	was moved to give his mil - lions for the cause of peace by the arguments of Spencer .

		It is still true , however , that this practical consequence of his views , though it stands out conspicuously in a twentieth-century estimate of his work , does not overshadow the intrinsic value of his thought and the type of his achievement .

		The mind of
Spencer	PERSON	, like his character , \ \ .

		is a singular instrument .

		It needed but a few guid - ing principles for its direction .

		In the main these were two : Evolution for the view of the universe , and Liberty for the guidance of human affairs .

		These make the system in a gigantic .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 147 deductive unfoldment .

		Even the `` Sociology , '' with its array of corroborative facts , was , in Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	's opinion , only retroactively inductive .

		In his contribution to evolutionary theory Spen - cer was an anticipator as well as a pioneer , but he was an individualist even in that , the dis - tinctive nineteenth-century movement .

		The principle of increasing differentiation sufficed , and the inheritance of acquired characteristics -LRB- his chief error -RRB- was adequate to supply the material for variation and selection .

		`` The truth is that
Spencer	PERSON	had the makings of a fanatic , and herein lie both his strength and his weakness .

		The stream of thought in a fanatic is a narrow one .

		Nothing counts outside the province on which attention is concentrated . ''

		Within that province it is a magnet , picking up everything that such a magnet can hold .

		On the side of political affairs Spencer dis - tinguished between governments that govern much and those that govern little .

		The former subordinate the individual and in them wars are common ; they are of the military type ; in the others , peace is the rule , and they conform to the industrial type .

		The industrial has most of the virtues , the military most of the vices .

		The main virtue is great individual freedom .

		Spencer car - ried the doctrine of non-interference by the state to the extent of regarding it as a mistake for the government to have the postal monopoly , to reg - ulate measures of health , to enforce education or factory-laws .

		All that should be left to private enterprise and the fate of competition .

		Strongly positive philosophically and individualistic so - cially ,
Spencer	PERSON	's convictions -LRB- prepossessions in some aspects -RRB- made for simplicity of solution , and for the overstatement of what was a truth in moderation .

		When they were enunciated , his positions seemed much more tenable than they now appear .

		It is easy in our richer experience to see their inadequacy , their exaggeration ; it is not so easy to appreciate their startling origin - ality and their remarkable independence of pre - vious schooling and thinking .

		It is intelligible that we should be less con - cerned in our radically reconstructed world with
Spencer	PERSON	's `` Synthetic Philosophy , '' his biology and psychology and ethics and metaphysics from all of which science has accepted what it could use than with his contributions to the understanding of social forces .

		So far as Spencer submits to classification , he was chiefly a sociologist .

		His foundations reflect the accepted principles of his time , reflect them with a limited acquaintance with their setting in previous thought and with a national as well as a temperamental insularity .

		His ethics is hedonistic ; his psychology , associa - tional , in the limited English sense .

		In all these realms he has done his bit , sometimes with slight effect , sometimes with considerable profit .

		His most ambitious conception the Unknowable proved as negatively fruitful in thought as in expression .

		His psychological construction of the bond between reflex action and logical thinking stands as established .

		Similarly , his views of education the most popular of his contributions are still influential in the modern forms of emphasis on a return to nature , a fixed sense for logical value , and avoidance of formal scho - lasticism .

		The days of all-inclusive systems , sweeping the circle of the sciences with however modern a periscope , are over .

		They lasted from
Aristotle	LOCATION	to
Spencer	PERSON	, and the last survey was worthy of its predecessors .

		The fertile thought that science is one remains ; ethics and psychol - ogy , politics and sociology , even physics and biology , are held together by the unity of nature and the consistency of the mind 's comprehension .

		Spencer 's consistency , though not innocent of the quality of strain , is yet suggestive and sustained .

		As a sociologist
Spencer	PERSON	attempted far more thoroughly than in any other domain to supply the data for directive views which , according to Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	, were already firmly fixed in his con - victions .

		He surveys with much detail for the most part contributed by others the forms of society in primitive and imperfectly evolved communities .

		In his interpretations he carries his guiding principles with him .

		As Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	pointedly remarks , he makes primitive philos - ophers miniature Spencers , and primitive myth - ologies miniature synthetic philosophies .

		Dealing in the main with primitive modes of thought and their later expansion such as his `` ghost theory '' of religion his central interest is fixed upon the social forces that determine the life of a people and the direction of its activities .

		He concludes that the largest distinction of social life is that between the organization of society for peace and its organization for war .

		And that distinction may stand with unexpected pertinence to-day .

		With deep antipathy te militarism , he sees in it the enemy of industrialism , which is the activity of peace .

		The case of
Germany	LOCATION	completely re - futes his conclusion , though this was not true of the
Germany	LOCATION	of his day .

		As in so many other relations ,
Spencer	PERSON	has confused the spirit and the background of endeavor with its formal ap - pearance .

		That has ever been a radical idol ; in its extreme manifestation , the fanatic 's fallacy .

		148 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	Liberty comes forward as the redemption of mankind .

		But again citing Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	liberty should not be a dogma -LRB- as to Spencer it fre - quently was -RRB- , but `` an atmosphere of social thought . ''

		In contrast
Spencer	PERSON	's deduction in favor of the complete freedom of women as a consequence of his social philosophy is about to be realized by the cruel indirection of his much - hated war .


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	under the test of the world war makes very different reading from
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	as the calm occupation of a philosophic mind .

		He becomes prophetic not only of the pacifist doctrine -LRB- of which
America	LOCATION	is the most influential protagonist -RRB- , but also of the recon - struction of thought with reference to social con - trol , which is to be our chief business after the war and that of the next generation .

		Spencerism will contribute to the responsible thinking and doing of the future , to the maintenance of con - fidence as well as to distrust of former errors .

		National philosophy is inevitably and properly dominant in revolutionary times .

		As between
Nietzsche or Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	and
Spencer	PERSON	, there is no hesitation in the Anglo-Saxon liberty-loving mind .

		It is a tribute to the sterling value of
Spencer	PERSON	's Weltanschauung that it is congenial to an international formulation .


JOSEPH JASTROW	PERSON	.

		An American Humanist THE ASSAULT ON HUMANISM .

		By
Paul Shorey	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
The Atlantic Monthly Co.	ORGANIZATION	; 60 cts . -RRB-

		It is difficult to appreciate the admiration which the editor of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' feels for Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's `` eloquent defense of the classical tradi - tion . ''

		This little book is indeed , as Mr.
Sedg	PERSON	- wick says in his preface initiating the `` Atlantic Monographs , '' `` sharp and glittering . ''

		But such adjectives are dubious praise for a partisan of humanist learning like the
Chicago	LOCATION	professor who has supposedly become saturated throughout a long and scholarly life with the immortal poise and mellowness of the classics .

		Not sharpness and glitter do we expect as fruits of such an intimacy , but those qualities of `` lucid ration - ality and precision , their urbanity , their sanity , their common sense , their humanized and human - izing emancipation from ` primitive foolishness , ' parochialism and fanaticism '' which Professor
Shorey	PERSON	claims for that Latin literature he is struggling to save .

		From his own writing , how - ever , these qualities are almost pretentiously absent .

		Nothing could be less urbane , less rational and precise , than this strident polemic .

		The book is an incoherent and angry jumble of appeals to classical authority , attacks on Mr.
Flexner	PERSON	and the `` new '' psychologists , complaints that President
Eliot	PERSON	and the other assaulters have ignored the arguments of Professor
Shorey	PERSON	and his friends , and dark imputations against the `` sullen jealousy '' of those of us who are trying , he says , to `` control American education with the political efficiency of Prussian autocracy and the fanatical intolerance of the French anti- clericalists . ''

		This shrillness of tone is not any mere sudden heightening of the emotional pitch .

		Crassness permeates the book like bad blood in a neurotic child .

		The professor 's leading argument for the study of Latin is that it is an `` almost indis - pensable form of mental discipline for the speakers of such a language as ours , '' and that , at its best , it ministers to `` the final mastery of English for highest artistic and philosophical ends . ''

		Listen to a sentence from Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's book , and judge for yourself the `` men - tal discipline '' and `` mastery of English for high - est artistic ends '' which may result from a long and studious `` humanistic '' life : `` Its disintegrating and deliquating effect on the logical functions of young minds com - pelled to attack it without the protection of a gasmask is a thing imagination boggles at . ''

		This beautiful example of Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's humanistic style refers to the literature of edu - cational psychology , of which he seems to have read only the crudest examples .

		Of the really fruitful and very recent work of
Dewey	LOCATION	,
Hall	PERSON	,
Terman	PERSON	,
Cubberley	LOCATION	,
Hetherington	PERSON	,
Wells	LOCATION	, he is evidently as ignorant as he thinks his opponents are of his own arguments .

		The difference is that to ignore his case means only to ignore a priori speculation , while to ignore present-day educational psychologists is to ignore a serious and most suggestive effort toward objective and incontrovertible evidence .

		Here is another passage : `` There is ample time for both science and Latin in a rationally constructed curriculum .

		There is not time for both and for the dementia praecox of premature preoccupation with pseudo - science .

		But real science is hard work , almost as hard as Latin ; while the science of the talking delegates of science is a soft snap . ''

		That second sentence must be read aloud to get its full barbarous flavor .

		What are we to < !

		< > with a mind that , in a defence of the cul -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 149 tural influence of the classics , talks about gas - masks , dementia praecox , and soft snaps ?

		And in comparison with some of Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's utterances , the slangy staleness of this passage is mild .

		Now it is exactly the argument of the advocates of the `` modern school '' that when even a lifelong exposure to the classical languages and literatures results in a mind so thoroughly uncultivated as Professor
Shorey	PERSON	shows his own to be , it is a waste of time to continue these studies as an integral part of the education of American youth .

		Professor
Shorey	PERSON	is only an extreme example of his class .

		No American thought , criticism , or literary art of any creative value whatever comes from these guardians of the classical tradition , who are given to ex - pressing themselves with an incoherence of thought and an insensitiveness to style that we should complain of in modern journalism .

		It is the lip-service to `` the fair things of beauty '' which our professors of literary studies render while they aridly betray them in work and thought that has earned the contempt of a younger genera - tion and driven literary studies into limbo .

		It is the custodians themselves who have done more than anyone else to discredit the classics .

		The true lovers have only the professors to blame and not those of us who have revolted at sterility .

		Professor
Shorey	PERSON	thinks that the main issue is `` the survival or the total suppression , in the comparatively small class of educated leaders who graduate from high schools and colleges , of the very conception of linguistic , literary and crit - ical discipline ; of culture , taste and standards ; of the historic sense itself ; of some trained fac - ulty of appreciation and enjoyment of our rich heritage from the civilized past . ''

		This is gro - tesque .

		None of these values are now being acquired from literary studies in high schools and colleges by even `` the comparatively small class of educated leaders . ''

		Our younger edu - cated leaders have found their intellectual heri - tage in the study of history , politics , and modern philosophy , not in the study of the Latin lan - guage or anything that flows mystically from it .

		Furthermore , not even the most furious `` modern school '' proposes to exclude the great ancient lit - eratures .

		In implying this , Professor
Shorey	PERSON	is far more unfair to the modernist than any mod - ernist has been to him .

		Even the terrible Mr.
Flexner	PERSON	distinctly admits into his `` modern school '' the best translations of the ancient classics for reading and enjoyment .

		Nobody intends to sup - press these great books .

		Nobody intends to sup - press `` critical discipline , culture , taste and standards , the historic sense itself . ''

		The issue , however , is exactly as Mr.
Flexner	PERSON	has stated it whether the study of the Latin and Greek languages automatically produces these desirable qualities .

		The contemporary verdict is emphat - ically that there is no discoverable relation be - tween linguistic studies and the attainment of a cultivated mind .

		As long as there are public libraries with Latin grammars , or as long as there are people who know and love Latin , the industrious child with a turn for it will have adequate opportunity to learn the language .

		Four school years of ef - fort to give heterogeneously endowed children even a smattering of Latin have proved in the American school to be sheer futility .

		Acquaint - ance with the old literatures , however , is still an essential part of education in taste .

		How is that acquaintance best to be obtained , through the opaque medium of a complex language and the child 's own barbarous and halting translation , or through reading of the best translations , themselves finely tempered pieces of English prose ?

		Which is more likely to bring `` mastery of English for artistic ends , '' and the awaken - ing of the imagination to `` things of beauty '' and large ideas ?

		Who has done more to make the classics known and felt by Americans , Professor
Shorey	PERSON	with his polemics and his frantic struggles to keep Latin in the secondary school , or
Gil	PERSON	- bert
Murray	PERSON	with his translations of the Greek plays into exquisite English verse , which made possible those stirring performances that gave delight to thousands of modern Americans ?

		If Professor
Shorey	PERSON	were really a humanist , would he not be content to let the languages die , if the literatures could be kept so vitally with us , serving culture as they will in a modern school which treats them as literature and not as philology ?

		But he is not really a humanist .

		He is a professor , angrily defending his lifelong business .

		He is a proprietor , protecting a vested interest .

		It seems to give him comfort that idealists in every age have tilted quixotically at what they called impractical and verbal forms of education .

		Our little system , he thinks , will also have its disillusionment .

		It is queer com - fort .

		For the more obvious and encouraging moral is that there have always been men of insight to struggle against the tradition and the
Paul Shoreys	PERSON	of their day .

		This moral might only whet our ardor to make this `` modern school '' veritably the final coup .

		Now that the `` defense of the classical tradition '' has been so 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	palpably revealed in Professor
Shorey	PERSON	as the peevish stand of a professorial `` die-hard , '' real lovers of the classics will pray to be spared so prejudicial a defender .

		The ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' has done a disservice in stirring the dead bones of this controversy to rattle again .

		It may be , as the editor suggests , the last rattle heard in our life - time .

		I sincerely hope it will be .

		The classics will not die for want of the striking of such blows .

		Their precious qualities are safe in the most modernist of schools .

		Meanwhile even the radical will regret that the polemics of the clas - sical tradition should go out in so tasteless a splutter as this first of the ``

		If there is one respect in which contemporary English poetry is conspicuously and consistently superior to contemporary American poetry , it is in the lyric .

		While their more adventurous fellow - craftsmen in
America	LOCATION	have been experimenting , perhaps a little recklessly , with narrative , epic , and symphonic verse , and with bizarre arythmics and insoluble self-symbolisms of all sorts , the English poets , with one or two exceptions , have held more clearly to the lyric tradition .

		This is not the cause , as some appear to think , for either heartburnings or self-congratulations .

		Poetry is poetry no matter where or how it is written , art should not be regarded from a narrowly and selfishly national standpoint , and we should be as ready to applaud a foreign artist as an American .

		As a theory , this is of course a plati - tude ; as a fact , it might in some quarters be regarded as an alarming novelty , or even treason .

		As a practice , moreover , it meets opposition because it demands the application of a high degree of fair-mindedness and intelligence .

		One must face , in all foreign art , a considerable divergence from one 's own in temper and method ; and face it with understanding .

		It is different , but is it necessarily inferior ?

		These problems have been often raised in the last few years over the question as to the rela - tive merits of contemporary English and
Ameri	PERSON	- can poetry .

		Foolish things have been said on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, the patriotic instinct has been as vigorous and cloistral in `` Poetry and Drama , '' of
London	LOCATION	, as in `` Poetry , '' of Chi - cago .

		In general the failure has been one of understanding , aided in some cases by a disposi - tion to condemn , a priori , without consulting the evidence .

		It is encouraging to see signs that this attitude is breaking down .

		The fact that the whole poetic firmament is in such a state of chaos has of itself made it necessary for critics to discard easy traditional theories and employ methods a little more empirical .

		This has resulted in greater fairness to the individual it has even gone so far , at times , as to indicate complete anarchy , in which bad was as loudly acclaimed as good .

		The upshot , however , has been the establishment of a middle attitude of good-humored , first-hand analysis , toward foreign art as well as domestic .

		It is with this attitude that we should approach the work of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	, Mr. de la Mare , and Mr.
Monro	PERSON	.

		If we have developed a taste for work more racily American , more conspicuously of the place and moment , we may conceivably feel that we are stepping back two or three decades when we read , for example , the poems of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	.

		We should not allow this to prevent our enjoyment of their unique charm and originality .

		Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	is that rarity in these times , a poet of very small production , and of production on a uniformly high level , a poet who had already earned a reputation before the printing of his first book .

		His range is not wide .

		A single tone dominates nearly all the twenty-five poems in .

		this book whether in the narrative lyrics , such as `` The Bull , '' `` Eve , '' `` The Song of Honour , '' and `` The Gipsy Girl , '' or in the simple lyrics , such as `` Time , You Old Gipsy Man , '' and `` Stupidity Street . ''

		The metrical variety is not great , the melody is always simple ; but Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	possesses a genuine gift for modulation which carries him safely over inversions that to others would have proved fatal .

		If Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's abilities stopped there , his verse would be charming , but empty ; these are matters of the voice merely .

		But Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's chief value lies rather in what he has to say .

		There are two arts in poetry : the art of precisely saying what one has in mind ; and , even more important -LRB- though less regarded -RRB- , the art of excluding from one 's conception all that is not of pure value .

		It is particularly in this latter respect that Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	excels .

		His mood is always perfectly clear ; the terms by which he states it have a
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 151 delicate and sweet precision .

		Seldom is there a waste idea , seldom a waste line .

		Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	does not , like many poets , have to take a running start , only to generate lyric speed when half way through the poem ; neither does he exhaust himself altogether in the first stanza .

		On the contrary his poems have that clear certainty , from beginning to end , which consti - tutes excellence in art .

		This would of course be a dull perfection if it were not for the quality of cool magic which is woven every - where through Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's work , varying all the way from the twinkle of whim , as in `` Eve , '' to the graver tones of `` The Song of Honour . ''

		In general , this magic is not so much the magic of beauty as the magic of unaffected truthfulness , vigorously phrased , naive , sin - cere .

		One feels little trace of artifice , even in so fluent a lyric as `` Eve . ''

		And a large part of the effectiveness of `` The Bull '' is in its honest matter-of-factness .

		The most arresting feature of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's work , however , is the feature which is most likely to give radical Americans the impression that he is old-fashioned : the fact that though he is essentially a lyric poet -LRB- preferring a lyric which is narrative -RRB- he is none the less essentially objective , never , or seldom , speaking in his own voice , or developing , psychologically , any per - sonal or dramatic viewpoint .

		This is an attitude which predicates poetry as a something separate from our own tortuous lives , a some - thing additional , perfect in itself : a something to turn to for delight , which shall take us , not deeper into ourselves , but away from ourselves .

		This attitude adds to the charm of Mr.
Hodg	PERSON	- son 's work , but it is also , in a wider sense , a weakness .

		It means that the greater part of human experience must remain unexpressed by him .

		It means that his work , in spite of its realistic or objective method , is in the last analysis decorative rather than interpretative .

		Poetry of this sort is not a window through which one may see , but a picture hung on the wall .

		It aims by every means known to the art to combine aesthetic patterns which shall delight us with their color and texture ; but it never strikes at us through our emotions .

		The pleasure it affords us is serene , cool , detached .

		Itself produced by no very intense emotional dis - turbance in the poet 's brain -LRB- beyond the pathos of creation -RRB- it has in consequence no power to disturb the reader .

		It does not reach forward or backward in human experience .

		It is , in fact , all treble , and no bass .

		The darker chords of intellectual and emotional frustration which shake the centre of individuality itself , and which in the past have given us our greatest poetry , are here untroubled .

		In this respect Mr.
Hodg	PERSON	- son , Mr. de la Mare , and the Imagists , antipodal as their methods are , all share essentially one purpose .

		The work of Mr.
Monro	PERSON	is from this stand - point the direct antithesis of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	's work .

		Mr.
Monro	PERSON	is , if the expression may be used , a psychological realist .

		If he is by no means the equal of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	in point of lyricism or natural magic or roundness of form , he more than makes up for this in greater rich - ness and variety and in what must be called , for lack of a better word , the quality of human - ness .

		It is daily , personal experience that interests Mr.
Monro	PERSON	personal experience viewed from the individual centre , observed almost religiously as it flows from moment to moment in the stream of consciousness .

		This is in the strain which is perhaps the richest in potentialities among modern tendencies in poetry .

		To a considerable extent it implies the transference of the method of the psychological novel or play to poetry : in the end it is nothing less than a poetic study of consciousness itself .

		In this respect Mr.
Monro	PERSON	's method is right rather than successful .

		His speech , if robust , is crabbed , muttering , and laborious .

		His pre - occupation with the profound trivialities which make up our lives , though often fresh and delightful , as in parts of the two series called `` Week End '' and `` Strange Meetings , '' some - times merely results in amiable catalogues , humorously tinged with panpsychism .

		Along , too , with a good deal of real imaginative rich - ness Mr.
Monro	PERSON	displays an unfortunate ten - dency to push quaintness and whim to the verge of preciosity .

		Should a train , for instance , be said ever to `` tittle tattle a tame tattoon '' ?

		This is an example of a good idea not quite successfully brought to birth .

		It should be added that Mr.
Monro	PERSON	does not do this often , and that , in general , his work has an intellectual saltiness of originality which makes it satisfactory and often delightful reading .

		And as was said above , it gains in suggestiveness because it is in a strain , as yet infrequent in modern poetry , but probably destined to great importance : the strain of psychological realism ; although Mr.
Monro	PERSON	can not be said to have taken that method either far or subtly .

		Mr. de la Mare , presumably , needs no intro - 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	duction .

		His `` Peacock Pic '' consists of lyrics ostensibly for children ; in reality it contains some of the most delightful work he has done .

		It is doubtful whether any other living American or English poet can weave simple melody as deftly as Mr. de la Mare , melody both as regards words and ideas .

		If after a century has passed one may recall
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's categories of imagina - tion and fancy as the two springs of the poetic , it would be no violence to say that Mr. de la Mare 's power over us is rather in fancy than in imagination .

		It is delicate , elusive , impalpable ; over the simplest lyrics hangs an overtone of magic .

		And now and again , as in the `` Song of the Mad Prince , '' this magic reaches a grave intensity which strikes well to the marrow of things .

		Mr. de la Mare is not an innovator , and his scope is not great ; but within his scope he has no superior .

		If after a reading of these three rather typ - ical English poets we recall as contrast the dom - inant notes in contemporary American poetry , certain differences stand out conspicuously .

		De - spite the fact that Mr.
Monro	PERSON	manifests a slight orientation in a new direction , we may say that these poets , like most contemporary English poets , hold more or less surely to the main poetic tradition , in particular as concerns the theory that lyric poetry is a decorative rather than an interpretative art , and that its affair should be , primarily , the search for and modulation of beauty , with or without regard to its nearness to human experience .

		The result is that from a purely literary viewpoint English poetry of the present day is much more perfectly finished , much maturer , than American poetry .

		On the other hand , it loses proportionately by this very fact .

		By comparison with contemporary Amer - ican poetry , which is more empirical , drawing more boldly on the material of a wider con - sciousness , without so sharp a literary distinc - tion between the poetic and the non-poetic , and more richly experimental as concerns questions of form , English poetry appears at once thin - ner and more `` literary . ''

		It does not seem to relate so closely to the complete life of the indi - vidual .

		It becomes obvious , in view of this con - trast , to hope for some sort of fusion of the two methods .

		Will the poet arise who will have no occasion for envying either `` this man 's art '' or `` that man 's scope '' ?

		It appears to be only a question of time .

		The German youth entering the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	is met at the door by a huge statue of Treitschke , standing in a flamingly heroic atti - tude .

		On his shoulder is perched the imperial German eagle , intently gazing into his face .

		There is every reason why the German eagle should listen to what
Treitschke	PERSON	has to say , for what he says is balm to its soul and music to its ears .

		The German
Michael	PERSON	would have been better off if he had not listened to Treitschke , but the German eagle , patriotic , imperialistic , and rapacious , did well to press him to its bosom .

		Take , for example , this second volume of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's magnum opus his `` History of
Germany	LOCATION	in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It deals with a dull period and to a liberty-loving man a disconcerting period .

		From
1815	DATE	to
1819	DATE	,
Germany	LOCATION	was losing the high-strung heroism of the
Wars of Liberation	ORGANIZATION	and was busy planting potatoes , for the simple reason that for the time being potatoes were more needed than heroism .

		Now , other peoples have planted potatoes with - out saying anything about it .

		Not so the Ger - mans .

		When a German plants his potatoes or drinks his beer and smokes his pipe , he is engaged in a good old German custom .

		He is performing a task , noble , patriotic , and almost religious .

		At least , one would think so after reading Treitschke .

		It is true that he is hard put to it to reconcile this unheroic period with his heroic bluster .

		In fact he does not hesitate to show his contempt for it on one page while growing sentimental over it on the next .

		For so he oscillates between heroic brutality and tribal sentimentality .

		Yet
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	has a keen eye and a sharp tongue .

		He sees the
Germany	LOCATION	of 1815-19 pass - ing through a silent crisis .

		He sees that the particularism which made possible the division of
Germany	LOCATION	during the Napoleonic ascent is again coming to the top and with it the antiquated feudal organization which
Napoleon	PERSON	had greatly damaged but not totally destroyed .

		His problem is how to condemn this particularism , for
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	is an arch-imperialist , to get rid of it and still keep the old feudalism .

		Treitschke 's Weltanschauung , which comes out so glaringly in his controversy with
Schmoller	PERSON	, is intimately associated with the maintenance of a monarchical and aristocratic order .

		Life to him means the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 153 keeping up of the heroic paraphernalia of a mil - itary social system , on which is built a rigid division of classes , devoted to the carrying out of the classical ideal of life with a German accent .

		For his ideal of national heroism he needed a united
Germany	LOCATION	, which involved the break-up of the old princely organization .

		For his ideal of a `` cultural '' nation he needed the old feudal organization .

		How solve this problem ?

		Treitschke does not solve it , but he makes a spectacular attempt .

		He begins by denouncing the eighteenth cen - tury and
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		To do so was and is quite the fashion in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The spirit of the eighteenth century was one of cosmopolitan lib - eralism and international good will a spirit utterly at variance with the efforts at national self-sufficiency predominant in the nineteenth .

		The eighteenth century also believed that un - aided human reason could frame schemes of hu - man welfare without recourse to the accidental historical experience of any people .

		This un - historical procedure had the effect of alienating the feelings of the student or reformer from the particular past of a particular people .

		The moment history was turned out of doors , Ger - many said farewell to the particular feudal ex - perience which was so dear to the heart of Treitschke and his reactionary Germanophiles .

		This , of course , they could not tolerate .

		Since the international spirit of the eighteenth cen - tury carried with it also ideas of constitutional reforms , such reforms are , naturally , viewed as a recurrence of the `` Jacobinism '' of the earlier period , and therefore sternly opposed .

		Treitsch - ke 's opposition goes on the path of a particular God-given characteristic of the German people which does not comport well with the notion of constitutional reforms .

		The idea that the opinions and convictions of the common people should be consulted in matters of government , and that on these matters they should be con - sidered the court of last resort , seems to him to be a proposition so utterly ridiculous , so ex - travagantly absurd , that he laughs himself sick over it .

		This attitude comes out very clearly in his treatment of Rotteck .

		Rotteck was a historian and political scientist of
Wurttemberg	LOCATION	who rep - resented the cosmopolitan-democratic ideas of the eighteenth century .

		He had a good deal to do with directing his country early on the path of constitutionalism .

		He was a man of great humanitarian enthusiasm and highly respected in his own community .

		Treitschke treats him with amused contempt .

		He speaks of him as a paro - chial Philistine and a scientific hewer of wood and drawer of water , and accuses him of `` spurn - ing the historical world '' because of his espousal of liberal ideas .

		The possibility is not precluded of
Rotteck	ORGANIZATION	's having been all these things in spite of his liberal ideas , but it is clear that in
Treitsch	LOCATION	- ke 's estimation he is a
Philistine	LOCATION	and a hewer of wood because of his liberal ideas .

		Treitschke seeks the heroic everywhere and at all times , and
Rotteck	PERSON	was unheroic enough to take account of the immediate humanity of the people about whose destinies he was writing and philosophiz - ing .

		This seems to our historian a most glaring perversion .

		A pretty pass shall we have come to if we allow mere human beings to interfere with the God-appointed destinies of the state !

		Of course what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander .

		What Treitschke says of Sa - vigny , the darling of the historically minded , can - not be applied to
Rotteck	ORGANIZATION	.

		When
Savigny	LOCATION	, with consistent Historismus , says that law must always remain the product of the unconscious social forces and national intelligence , Treitschke firm - ly but respectfully -LRB- of course ! -RRB-

		begs to differ with him , asserting that `` law is actually deter - mined not by national intelligence but by the national will , '' which national will , if it means anything , means precisely what
Rotteck	PERSON	was try - ing to express when he insisted that an enlight - ened public opinion must have its share in framing its own laws and its own social and political organization .

		But then , what Treitschke probably means by national will is the will of His Majesty the
King	LOCATION	, expressed by His Excel - lency the Chancellor to His Honor the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	- crat .

		On the whole , one rises from a reading of this volume of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's `` History '' with a feeling of having listened to a very able apologist of a reactionary , one-sided , and autocratic order , parading under the guise of progress and hero - ism .

		One can not escape , however , a feeling also of disgust at the diseased passion to prove Ger - many great in all things and at all cost .

		When Treitschke speaks of the work of German scien - tists , which at that period was a sad affair at best , one gets the impression that to him scien - tific work is a matter of patriotism ; the scientist is something in the nature of a patriotic fighting - cock whose business it is to overtake and beat the scientists of other nations .

		He sets it down to the particular credit of
Germany	LOCATION	that Hum - boldt was well received in scientific circles in
Paris	LOCATION	, and forgets that Humboldt had to go to 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	Paris because he could not get a hearing in his own land and because the field of scientific en - deavor in

Sahara	LOCATION	.

		English readers will not fail to be amused when he tells them that ``
Walter Scott	PERSON	, the most fruit - ful and best-loved poet of the age , went to school to
Buerger	PERSON	and Goethe '' !

		Let the German eagle , by all means , look gratefully into
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's face , for he has done a good job , better than the historians of other nations have ever done .

		As long as history is looked upon as the proper field for the exhibition of patriotic animosity and sentimental turbulence , we shall have no right to object to
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is only doing what they are all doing , doing it a little more crudely , more bluntly , more re - voltingly -LRB- to the outsider -RRB- , and consequently more effectively .

		The difference between them is only a difference of degree and not of kind .

		Gorky IN THE WORLD .

		By
Maxim Gorky	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		An attentive reader of Gorky might have seen that he was prepared to write this amazing book .

		If all good fiction is a kind of auto - biography ,
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's fiction is often avowedly just that .

		He likes to enter directly into his tales , showing us this or that episode precisely as if it had gone on under his own eyes as , no doubt , more than one actually had .

		And in those tales and sketches , so casually and vividly handled as to resemble bits of the actual seized almost at random , he has known how to find the evoca - tive word , to summon a mood or stamp an impression on the mind , and pass rapidly on to something else .

		Swiftness and brevity these are great virtues in a man who is going to tell us the story of his life .

		They fill us with assur - ance at the outset .

		We can trust him not to bore us by piling up detail or losing his way among the labyrinthine windings of formal auto - biography , in which there is neither perspective nor any merciful sense of values .

		Nor does Gorky disappoint us .

		Everywhere in this , the second , volume of his Life , one finds the shining virtues of brevity , concreteness , vigor always unfailing vigor .

		That there is also a moving sincerity goes without saying , since
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	is in the great Russian tradition .

		The first volume carried us up to
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's twelfth or thirteenth year , to the time when he left the house of his grandfather .

		The second volume , thick as it is with impressions and rich in the material of character , gives us two or three years only of his life in the world ; when up - take leave of him , he is just setting out for
Kazan	PERSON	, in the futile hope -LRB- as we shall hear later -RRB- of getting an education for nothing .

		Thus it is still almost a child 's world in which we are moving a world seen with that fascinating mixture of sophistication and simplicity which his genius made possible .

		Gorky was restless and passed from place to place , always wretched , trying to find a world which he could reconcile with his dreams .

		As door-boy in a shoe shop , drudge in the house of an architect , dish-washer on a Volga steamer , apprentice in an icon - painter 's establishment , he was beaten and bedeviled and dragged through the foulest back - wash of life .

		It was a brutal experience that might well have turned him into a brute an experience , so far as one can see , that offered little enough to the future writer except the maturity that suffering brings .

		But in such cases talent is almost everything , and certainly no talent could have set itself more sharply and decisively to work .

		Gorky was a born novelist , for whom the special enigma of charac - ter never lost its torturing fascination ; he had already begun to observe , not coldly and criti - cally but with a brooding and terrible intensity .

		He observed that he might learn , but with no detached and purely intellectual passion .

		On the contrary , he was quiveringly responsive to suffering ; the sight of cruelty , he tells us , roused in him a physical repulsion that swiftly trans - formed itself into a cold fury .

		He had a `` fas - tidious dislike of unhappiness , illness , and grievances . ''

		And these things , with many more abominations , were always under his eyes .

		The dulness of life , which oppressed his companions , weighed too upon him and desolated his heart .

		He was prepared to understand the profound melancholy of a people tormented by the riddle of existence a melancholy growing less out of the weight of external conditions than out of a deep intuition of the futility of man 's fate , the sense of life flowing past , eluding the clutch , dropping at last into the void .

		Why struggle against the inevitable ?

		`` Do n't struggle , do n't hope for anything , for the grave and the church yard let no man pass , '' says the mason ,
Petr	PERSON	; and
Uncle Yaakov	PERSON	sums up his life in a few contemptuous phrases : `` Take myself , for instance ; what has my life been ?

		I look back on it with shame , everything
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 155 by snatches , stealthily ; my sorrows were my own but my joys were stolen .

		Either my father shouted , ` Do n't you dare ! '

		or my wife screamed , ` You can not ! '

		I was afraid to throw down a ruble .

		And so all my life has passed away , and here I am acting the lackey to my own son .

		.

		.

		But , even without that , why was I born ?

		What pleasure have I had in my life ? ''

		Whatever one may think of this characteristic Russian pessimism , it is solidly based : it com - plains , not of the transitory and the remediable , but of the unsatisfactoriness of first and last things .

		It expresses a deep , philosophic discontent .

		Is this sombre mood
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's own ?

		It is hard to say .

		I confess I had thought so from a read - ing of the tales and novels in which he seems obsessed with the hideousness of life .

		But here he tells us that he was often troubled by the thought that `` sorrow appealed more than joy to the hearts of these people . ''

		He himself struggled against the `` dreamy Russian sadness '' and often desired to cast a spell over the whole earth which would cause everyone `` to be swept by a joyful whirlwind , a festival dance of people ... '' In fact , there were two men in him .

		One was aware of only too many abomina - tions and obscenities and had come to view life and people `` distrustfully and contemptuously , with a feeble pity . ''

		He wished only to escape from the world of men .

		But the other , nourished on books and dreams , `` loved and pitied actively . ''

		This is the Gorky who can look to the future hopefully and call himself a lover of humanity .

		`` All that is good and human in our hearts and brains needs renewing . ''

		That he loved and pitied actively there can be no doubt .

		This book is full of the beautiful evidence of it .

		The intuition of genius carried him deep into the heart of the strange Russian nature , and one can not read his report of it without becoming oneself more human .

		The heroic figure of his grandmother , which domi - nated the first volume , appears here only occa - sionally but the impression is even deepened .

		One feels that this strong and good woman was the great formative influence in
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's life and that the sweetness and soundness of her nature explain in great measure the miracle by which the lonely boy escaped shipwreck .

		But there are other figures hardly less striking .

		The fat cook of the Volga steamer , who encouraged
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's passion for reading and gave him books ;
Yaakov	PERSON	, the stoker , `` with his ape-like hands , '' before whose eyes life burned `` like the flame of the stove beneath the boilers '' ;
Petr Vassilich	PERSON	, the pious and scoundrelly `` valuer '' of icons ; `` Queen Margot '' ;
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's step-father , a decayed aristo - crat dying of consumption all these walk into and out of the pages , preserving their secrets , filling us as they filled the boy with a troubled sense of what is deepest and most ambiguous in human character .

		And for
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	, as for us , the mystery remains .

		That it tortures him some - times , who can doubt ?

		For when
Yaakov Shumov	PERSON	went away , rolling from side to side like a bear , Gorky was aware in his heart of an uneasy and perplexed feeling .

		`` And what sort of man was he Yaakov Shumov ? ''

		The American Constitution THE AMERICAN PLAN OF GOVERNMENT .

		By
Charles W. Bacon	PERSON	and
Franklyn S. Morse	PERSON	.

		With an Introduction by
George Gordon Battle	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		`` There come crises to all nations times when actions taken or policies adopted will vitally affect the lives of future generations .

		At such times men are forced to think to go back to fundamentals to re-examine the foundations of their institutions .

		For the
United States	LOCATION
this second decade of the twentieth century	DATE	is a period of crisis . ''

		These words from `` The American Plan of Government , '' by
C. W. Bacon	PERSON	and
F. S. Morse	PERSON	, two lawyer-graduates of
Harvard	LOCATION	, make an even stronger appeal than when written several months ago .

		At this time , thinking Americans are turning to the Constitution to find out whether or not a plan of government adopted 127 years ago to give the people of thirteen little republics a central government is strong enough to protect them from internal dissension and foreign aggression , whether or not that Consti - tution is still sufficient for the management of the business of a nation which uses commercial and industrial machinery not dreamed of in the constitution-making era .

		To say , therefore , that this is a timely book is trite ; perhaps it is better to express our appreciation for having just now such `` an interpretation of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	by accepted authorities , '' the authority followed being , for the most part , none other than
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		When decisions of this court on con - stitutional questions are unavailable , recourse is had to decisions by state courts and to constitu - tional writers of repute , including
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	,
James Madison	PERSON	, and
Joseph Story	PERSON	.

		156 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	The purpose of the book is to show the real meaning of the Constitution and its actual work - ing as a plan of government .

		To do this , the authors take up the Constitution clause by clause at times almost word by word interpreting the one and defining the other in the exact words of judicial decisions .

		Herein lies its library value , for it puts within reach of the general reader a great fund of exact constitutional knowledge hitherto accessible only to the lawyer or to the trained investigator .

		All references are to or - iginal sources , long , involved decisions and irrelevant details being omitted , so that defini - tions are clean-cut and unmistakable .

		On each constitutional question , the authors select , as a rule , a single leading case and present only so much of the decision in that case as contains the desired definition .

		Not all provisions of the Constitution , however , can be treated adequately in this summary manner , for the meaning of some has been extended gradually by judicial interpretation in successive decisions .

		The inter - state commerce clause , for example , has grown in meaning so that the power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has come to include control of the navigable waters of the
United States	LOCATION	, the regulation of railroad rates and articles of commerce , and the forbid - ding of combinations and contracts in restraint of trade .

		On the meaning of other provisions of the Constitution ,
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	has sometimes disagreed even to the extent of reversing itself , as in the Legal Tender and the Income Tax cases .

		In the discussion of such constitutional provi - sions , the authors trace the history of their in - terpretation by presenting a series of decisions .

		`` The American Plan of Government , '' in spite of its rigid accuracy and exactness of defini - tion , is an easy and interesting book to read , and this was made possible by a novel plan of pre - sentation .

		This consists of prefacing each cita - tion with a statement of the facts in the case that shows how the word or phrase in question came to be carried to court for interpretation .

		These statements of fact , many of them of historic note , others of human interest , show how constitutional principles are applied as rules of action to the affairs of everyday life .

		Without such state - ments , knowledge of the Constitution would re - main abstract and theoretical ; with them , it becomes concrete and practical .

		The book shows the general reader how our national government rests on a great , living body of constitutional law , broader and more vital than the original Constitution from which it sprang , but which , designed for the United States of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tionary era , has endured with surprisingly few changes for over a century and a quarter .

		We see the present Constitution of the
United Stato	ORGANIZATION	as a system of constitutional law that , largely through judicial decisions , has grown up about it .

		The growth of the
United States	LOCATION	in extent and power and the increasing complexity of its national life have demanded a progressive modifi - cation of its plan of government .

		New con - ditions have demanded new laws or new applications of existing laws , with the result that ajjain and again the courts have been called upon to measure each new law or new application , and the standard of measurement has been al \ va \ s the Constitution .

		The ever-growing body of decisions in such cases forms the system of fed - eral constitutional law on the authority of which rests our national government of to-day .

		Librarians to whom come requests for such information as this , will appreciate the value of `` The American Plan of Government , '' a book which should be found in every library , large or small , for it has to do with the fundamentals of American government , a subject of absorbing interest in these stirring times .

		Strange to say , there is no similar work in existence .

		Progress in Education EDUCATION AND LIVING .

		By
Randolph Bourne	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The majority of Americans are not , as so many people aver , apathetic in regard to the war : they are apathetic only in regard to the violation at home of those principles for which they are setting out , so very gallantly , to fight abroad .

		The sentencing to imprisonment of a young man whose crime was the circulating of excerpts from the Declaration of Independence , the lynching of a worker because he was in op - position to the emotional tendencies of to-day , the advocacy by a senator -LRB- Mr.
Harding	PERSON	-RRB- of a dictatorship for this country , such things have called forth little reproach and less criticism .

		Why ?

		Because the schools of the past have taught their students , as most of the schools of the present are teaching them , not how to think , but how to accept thoughts already hardened into formulas ; not how to evaluate events and actions , but how , if the former be unpleasant , to ignore them , and how , if the latter be per - formed by those in temporary authority , blindly to sanction them .

		This will explain the apathy
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 157 of the multitude as well as the muddle-headed - ness of the so-called intellectuals ; and it will ex - plain , furthermore , why Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	's book , `` Education and Living , '' has not only a peda - gogical , but also a distinctly topical , interest .

		The author 's observations are of what others have done ; and , for that very reason , coupled with his liberal inclinations , he is able to present the fairest , the most impartial , description of the numerous educational experiments now making in
America	LOCATION	.

		His marshalling of them is im - pressive ; his review of them , concise , lucid , constructive .

		One may therefore assert that `` Education and Living '' is the best handbook for teachers that has thus far appeared .

		Few of us have had the opportunity to travel the country over in search of such material as he gives us ; and hitherto we have had to rely upon scattered or inadequate information .

		The only serious fault to be found with this book is that it is either too comprehensively titled or too exclusive in confining itself almost entirely to the grammar and the high schools .

		Though the scholastic `` groundwork '' is certainly superior to the succeeding work , it is , equally certainly , not so `` excellent and thorough '' as Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	believes it to be .

		Furthermore , the author is too brief and cursory in his treatment of the colleges ; and his remarks about the un - dergraduate are superficial .

		Anyone who has had intimate contact with the freshmen at one of our universities will have discovered some - thing very different from what Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	calls the `` baffling resistance of the undergradu - ate mind . ''

		He will have discovered , on the contrary , an eager receptivity , a surprising and delightful intellectual buoyancy .

		It is only after the undergraduate has been thoroughly stu - pefied by his professors that he becomes impervi - ous to ideas , points of view , interpretations .

		Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	is , of course , right in putting the emphasis on the worse-than-wasted years that succeed the primary school , and he is right also in his condemnation of the methods that make recitations merely `` a skilful guessing on the part of the child of what the teacher wants him to say . ''

		This is due to the fact that the method natural to the child is absolutely reversed : in - stead of being allowed to use his teacher as a medium of knowledge , a source from which he may , in his curiosity , draw , he is set difficult and usually uninteresting tasks which test only his ability to memorize and the docility of his character .

		And this strange reversal is driven so far that in such a subject as history , for in - stance , he is forced to begin , not with facts which might entice his attention , but with events so distant in time that he can not bring them into any sort of relationship with himself ... Any criticism of this procedure is met with the old statement that it is necessary for discipline , though it is easily demonstrable that the great - est concentration , the most protracted effort , and therefore the most and best discipline , are ob - tained when the child is stimulated to his studies by his own inquisitiveness and sympathy .

		How different from the old-fashioned methods are those described in `` Education and Living '' !

		The variety of the new experiments if anything so successful can still be considered experimen - tal is astonishing , though all of them are based on Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's well-known dictum that the child can be educated only by concerning himself with what has meaning to him as a child , and not with what may have meaning to him later as an adult .

		The most significant thing about these experiments is that they are not confined to private schools where the equipment may be exceptional .

		Mr.
Wirt	PERSON	has shown in his now famous Gary system that rational meth - ods may be applied in large public schools as well .

		It is unnecessary here to particularize further : we need only refer the reader to `` Education and Living '' with its detailed exposition and criti - cism , and to note the fact that Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	's discussion of vocational education is probably the soundest on record .

		It may , however , be well to call attention to the chapter entitled `` Education in Taste , '' in which the author seems to misconceive the very nature of taste .

		He contends , with truth enough , that the teacher should not impart to his students judgments of works of art ; but he bases this contention upon the extraordinary notion that `` we should never have enough
Matthew Arnolds	PERSON	to go round . ''

		A host of Arnolds speaking in sentences that crinkle like an academic gown , favoring pupils with standards by which to determine the `` best '' in literature and with dogmas concerning `` the grand style '' surely , nothing could be more effi - cacious in producing children wholly lacking in taste .

		It might , however , obtain for us what Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	seems to desire , `` strange and vigor - ous expressions like the contemporary architecture and sculpture of
Germany	LOCATION	, '' which are in reality only copies , heavy vulgarizations of French genius .

		This exception noted , `` Education and Living '' is to be recommended to everyone inter - ested in the subject .

$ 6	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The mythology of
India	LOCATION	possesses unique in - terest , not only on account of its antiquity , but because of the continuity of its literary records .

		For over three thousand years its steady growth , as well as its degenerative tendencies , may be traced in a series of voluminous writings , begin - ning about
1500	DATE	B. C. with the `` Rig - Veda , '' and coming down through the `` Brahmanas , '' the `` Epics , '' the ``
Puranas	LOCATION	, '' and the Buddhistic writings , to the literature of the present day .

		In that portion of the sixth volume of `` The Mythology of All Races '' devoted to Indian mythology , Dr.
A. Berriedale Keith	PERSON	has with infinite skill cut a swathe through what seems an inextricable tangle of mythological detail .

		He keeps in mind constantly , the general trend of Indian mythology toward pantheism and its final flowering in the philosophy of the Absolute .

		At the same time he describes with fascinating lucidity the characteristics of the multiple gods , who grow to be more and more the symbol of spiritual forces .

		Even as early as the `` Rig -
Veda	LOCATION	, '' there is a hymn , referred to by Dr.
Keith	PERSON	, addressed to the
Creator of Heaven and Earth	ORGANIZATION	, of the waters and all that lives , who is designated impersonally `` the Golden Germ . ''

		It is repeatedly asked in the hymn , `` What god shall we adore with our oblations ? ''

		At the end of the hymn he is called
Prajapati	PERSON	, `` the Lord of Creation . ''

		In Dr.
Keith	PERSON	's opinion , `` This passage is the starting point of his great history which culminates in the conception of the Ab - solute but personal Brahma . ''

		In dealing with the succeeding stage of the development of Indian mythology , the author bases his descriptions principally upon the Brah - manas , or explanatory texts , attached to the
Vedas	LOCATION	.

		He traces the development of the conception of
Prajapati	LOCATION	, showing how this god might have become a greater figure among the Indian pop - ular deities had not the philosophic spirit which conceived him soon gone beyond the original idea and translated the male form , as too per - sonal for the expression of the Absolute , into the neuter
Brahman Sayambhu	PERSON	-LRB- Self-Existent Prayer -RRB- , thus opening the way for the ``
Upa	ORGANIZATION	- nishads . ''

		Besides the development of the philosophic idea of the Absolute , the Brahmanic period sees the evolution of the idea of Heaven and Hell , and also that of Reincarnation , found first in the `` Upanishads . ''

		It reaches its highest pinnacle of thought in a later
Brahmana	LOCATION	, which holds that the man who attains true knowledge of the nature of the Absolute thereby wins freedom from rebirth and union at death with the Absolute .

		In the `` Epics , '' the imaginative bent of the Indian mind is especially prominent , though the gods show the influence of the strong philosoph - ical tendencies in the fact that they are no longer independent , eternal entities .

		They have become manifestations of one infinite power , em - phasized by the doctrine of the `` Ages of the World '' in which the Absolute reveals itself .

		At the expiration of three ages , each succeeding age being worse , everything is again absorbed into the Absolute for twelve million years , and is remanifested in the course of fresh ages .

		Vishnu and
Siva	PERSON	are the only gods who re - tain a degree of real power .

		Upon these gods the Indian imagination expends itself in the usual riotous manner .

		Siva is said to appear in as many as 1008 forms .

		Vishnu has a thousand names , and appears in many avatars , one of the most important being
Krishna	PERSON	, who is later the god celebrated in the `` Bhagavad-Gita . ''

		Rama , whose exploits fill the epic `` Ramayana , '' is an - other important avatar of Vishnu .

		In his chapter on Buddhism , Dr.
Keith	PERSON	op - poses the view held by some scholars that Bud - dha was merely a man and his system originally a purely ethical system , though this is certainly indicated by its discarding of the earlier doc - trines of the soul and personal immortality .

		Even in the earliest texts Dr.
Keith	PERSON	finds evi - dence that
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	was regarded and regarded himself as a divine being .

		His arguments here do not convince .

		Rather does
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	seem to regard himself as a type of the Beyond Man , neither human , in the ordinary sense of the word , nor divine .

		The remaining chapters are given to the Jains and modern
Hinduism	LOCATION	.

		The mythology of the former possesses interest because of their doc - trine that time is endless , and that successive reincarnations finally bring man to a place of conscious bliss , formless but consisting of life throughout .

		Finally , in modern
Hinduism	LOCATION	, there is an in - describable confusion of sacred beings and ob - jects , all brought into harmony by the pantheistic philosophy and the idea of the Absolute , which is now conceived of as feminine in its nature .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 159 The personifying tendency which , with a ten - dency to metaphorical interpretation , is the for - mative element in Indian mythology from the earliest times , is still at work , and among the objects of worship are found plows , yard-meas - ures , pickaxes , lions , tigers , and holy men .

		On the other hand ,
Vishnu	LOCATION	and
Siva	PERSON	still retain their importance , though in the refined philosophy of the cultured they are manifestations of the Absolute .

		Dr.
Keith	PERSON	makes clear the development of philosophical ideas and yet preserves so much of the mythological drapery in which these ideas are clothed that the book possesses the double quality of scholarliness and fascination .

		By rec - ognizing the close connection between mythology and religion , he has greatly enhanced , in my opinion , the interest of his subject .

		Dr.
Albert J. Carnoy	PERSON	, in his treatment of Iranian mythology , adopts a different plan from that followed by Dr.
Keith	PERSON	.

		He restricts his definition of myth so that it excludes all that is properly religious , historical , or archaeological , and attempts to give the myths and `` nothing more '' in Iranian traditions .

		In accordance with this plan he has emphasized especially the ro - mantic aspects of the myths , though philosophy and religion are continually breaking through the purely imaginative elements .

		He gives , for instance , an account of the dualistic religious principles of the Iranians , and of their origin in the cosmic conflicts of sun and storm or light and dark , which are characteristic of Vedic mythology .

		The Iranian mind , he says , seized especially upon the element of conflict and elab - orated upon it , carrying it into the moral and spiritual world and also into romance and his - tory .

		Professor
Carnoy	ORGANIZATION	illustrates these lines of development with many verse translations from the `` Avesta '' and the `` Shah-Namah . ''

		He also notes interesting parallels between the myth - ologies of
Babylon	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and
Iran	LOCATION	.

		In conclusion he shows that his conception of a myth is enlarged beyond the idea that it is merely the beginning of science in an attempt to account for some phenomenon of nature .

		He declares that , besides giving an explanation , it tries to give the explanation picturesquely .

		Thus we see added to the popular definition of myth the aesthetic element .

		Is it not reasonable to say that there is also present in myth-making the very source of religious aspiration in the search for the Cause ?

		The fact that in every volume of this series thus far examined , the writers have not suc - ceeded in making a clear demarkation between myth .

		and religion surely indicates that religion is something more than ritual , or rather that ritual is a crystallization of the religious element in myth-making .

		The remarkable continuity of the religious development of Indian myth - ology toward the conception of the Absolute the primal cause of all things and of which all phe - nomena are but manifestations seems to point to a primeval instinct in man to search for that cause and conceive of it in imaginative symbols of godhood .

		Like the other volumes , this one is rich in valuable illustration .

		A good bibliography and notes , chiefly bibliographical , complete these em - inently satisfactory treatments of two great myth - ologies .

		The Relaxing Grip of Prussianism SCIENCE AND LEARNING IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		Edited by
John H. Wigmore	PERSON	.

		With an introduction by
Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	.

		A nation that wills to impose its culture on other peoples must begin by believing thoroughly in its own superiority .

		Confidence is at least half the battle .

		A cult of the national life and habits of mind has to be established , a whole ritual of pious observances erected .

		For super - stition works even in the lofty realm of the in - tellect , and scholars , as the war has shown us , are not creatures of pure reason .


Germany	LOCATION	had such a cult .

		She cherished an ambition for in - tellectual primacy .

		She willed to dominate the world not through the crude instrument of war alone , but through the `` peaceful penetration '' of scholarship and the prestige of great names .

		In
America	LOCATION	, certainly , her `` peaceful penetration '' enjoyed an immense success ; the influence of German universities and German methods was enormous , the respect for German scholarship unbounded .

		It was , as we see now , an undis - criminating respect a respect founded in good part on superstition , as the extraordinary defer - ence shown to Eucken a few years ago made abundantly clear .

		A nation that could produce
William James	PERSON	and
John Dewey	PERSON	should have had a better eye for philosophers .

		But the prestige of the label `` Made in
Germany	LOCATION	'' was as great when attached to scholars as to chemicals .

		Nor is it hard to account for that prestige .


Germany	LOCATION	, with a realistic sense which it would be idle to deny , understood better than her rivals the requirements of the new industrial age which 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	was dawning .

		She divined the increasingly im - portant role which expert knowledge would come to play .

		She saw how the development of in - dustry must wait on discoveries in the laboratory , and she put science in harness , so to speak .

		She was not hampered by the old-fashioned idealism that would keep science pure and undefiled by keeping it out of the factory .

		The human ma - terial with which her organizers had to work was excellent .

		The German is by nature patient and diligent ; he loves and respects learning .

		All that was needed to give
Germany	LOCATION	an undoubted lead in producing scientists and investigators of the second rank was organization on a whole - sale plan and the official encouragement of re - search .

		That organization she undertook and accomplished , with results that have been open to study for a long time .

		That her methods in scholarship produced excellent results , no sane man would dream of denying .

		But to claim intel - lectual primacy because of a marked superiority in the second line of achievement will hardly do .

		It sounds arrogant , when it does not sound absurd .

		And the methods themselves indis - pensable as they are now recognized to be are subject to quite serious objections if they are not applied with a constant critical scrutiny of the results .

		The test to apply is a rigorously pragmatic one .

		Where mere industry in the collection of facts facts of any order is valued for itself , the door is thrown open for medi - ocrity to enter .

		Those `` Culture-Philistines '' at whom
Nietzsche	PERSON	raged are only too likely to give the tone and adjust the scale of values by which merit shall be measured .

		And one knows how the prevailing type fixes the standard of measurement .

		In our own universities , partly as a result of the uncritical adoption of German methods , the collectors of negligible facts and musty gossip , those busy journeymen of learning , have multiplied intolerably , and an appalling amount of sterile and frivolous activity has passed itself off under the name of research .

		If you doubt it and have a courage amounting to sui - cidal recklessness , make a wager with yourself to read all the doctor 's theses published by a single great university in a year .

		It would be pleas - anter , perhaps , to face Kultur directly in the trenches .

		The war , which is challenging so many insti - tutions and shibboleths , has demolished the myth of German intellectual supremacy .

		The famous manifesto of the `` ninety-three German profes - sors '' was a blow to German prestige a blow from which it will hardly recover in our time .

		It was a miracle of ineptitude , as blunderingly cuiKx-ived and as stupidly drafted as any docu - ment lathered by the Foreign OHke .

		It was manitcbtly not the product of pure reason .

		A new orientation has become inevitable , and `` Science and Learning in
France	LOCATION	'' is one of the first tangible evidences of a change ut heart .

		This book , edited by Dean VVigmore , ol the faculty of law at
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, with a preface by
Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	, emeritus presi - dent of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, is the work of the foremost scholars in the various departments of learning in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is a tactful book .

		It makes no invidious comparisons .

		On the con - trary , it expressly recognizes the high intellectual achievements of German scholars and thinkers .

		But it seeks to restore a lost perspective by call - ing attention to the distinguished work of French scientists in our time and reminding us of the distinctive qualities of the French mind .

		Our relative indifference to French culture has been a serious loss .

		We have ignored to some extent the great contributions to science made by the lucid and imaginative French intellect .

		The free experimental impulse , the absence of preju - dice , and the strong democratic bias give us an atmosphere in which progress is possible .

		It is n't pure sentiment that attaches us to the French people ; it is really a deep if vague consciousness that we have set out on the same adventure and are committed to the same political and social programme .

		It is a `` consciousness of kind . ''

		Nevertheless , there is not a hint of propagandist ardor in `` Science and Learning in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Such ardor would be an insult to
France	LOCATION	, which needs no commendation beyond the simple record of achievement .

		Everywhere in this book Western culture is recognized as international a growth to which all the peoples have made important contributions .

		What was attempted was a brief , judicial survey of the contributions made by eminent French thinkers , with special emphasis on the work of men now living or so recently dead as to belong to the modern period .

		Every field of scientific and literary investigation is covered by a committee of American scholars .

		The scheme of the work embraces a swift his - torical summary of the labors of French in - vestigators in each department , philosophy , astronomy , the social sciences , biology , and so on , an account of the significant contributions of living men , and an outline of the courses offered in the various universities , together with the special facilities for research .

		In short , the book is a compendious introduction to the intel -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 161 lectual world of
France	LOCATION	, intended to serve as a guide for students who may be planning to work for a doctorate abroad .

		But it should serve the broader purpose of acquainting the general public with the brilliant achievements of con - temporary
France	LOCATION	.

		It is an impressive book in the mere list of famous names of the living or quite recently dead
Henri Poihcare	PERSON	,
Berthelot	PERSON	,
Becquerel	PERSON	,
Curie	PERSON	,
Tarde	LOCATION	,
Durkheim	PERSON	,
Letourneau	PERSON	,
Bergson	PERSON	... In the face of such evidence of fertile activity as the mere names afford , one finds it hard to understand the vulgar notion that prevailed before the war that the French talent had exhausted itself .

		For this notion there was substituted later the equally preposterous one that the war had renewed French manhood .

		In truth , I think there is some need for Ameri - cans to read `` Science and Learning in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		One should add that the book was planned and begun a year and a half ago , while the
United States	LOCATION	was still a neutral country ; it is in no sense , as the editor quite superfluously points out , a `` pro-ally document . ''

		It is simply the result of a conviction formed by American scholars that the time had come for restoring French science to its `` place in the sun . ''

		A society has been formed for establishing American fellowships in French universities on the basis of competitive examination , and we seem in a fair way to readjust the balance .


C. H. Edith Wharton SUMMER	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Within the memory of a not very aged reader of American fiction there have been a few won - derful moments , moments when one has realized , perhaps without clear , critical consciousness , that something important has happened .

		Such un - forgettable moments are one 's first reading of ``
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	, '' and `` A Modern Instance , '' and ``
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, '' and `` A New England Nun , '' and `` The Red Badge of Courage , '' and `` Sister Carrie '' -LRB- the promise of that book has not been fulfilled -RRB- , and two books by Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	, `` The Greater Inclination '' and `` The Touchstone . ''

		In those days , the end of the Nineties , most of the established literature of the world was still unexplored , and a new ar - rival from
New York	LOCATION	had to compete with the world 's inexhaustible masterpieces and also with contemporaneous English fiction , especially the two gods of the undergraduate ,
Stevenson	PERSON	and Kipling .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	dawned upon our ignorant but eager appreciation , a little bewil - dering to our immaturity because she was so mature and sophisticated .


Henry James	PERSON	and
Meredith	PERSON	had educated us to read her intelli - gently -LRB- though we had only begun to read them -RRB- , and if our admiration was boyish it was genuine .

		I remember distinctly the emotions of surprise and delight at the appearance of a new writer , an American writer , whose first work showed the competence and finish of a practiced hand .

		Then followed , at intervals sufficiently long to indicate careful workmanship , now a novel , now a collection of short stories , all of unvary - ing excellence .

		But there was another sense in which the work was unvarying , another inter - pretation of the moderate rate of production .

		Though the plots were ingenious , original , not cast in one mold , the kind of life so acutely and deeply studied was a limited , even thin , upper layer of society .

		Was her material restricted ?

		She saw far , she penetrated to the bottom of a soul , but could she see broadly ?

		Was her knowledge of life at once cosmopolitan and class - provincial , like the outlook of
Henry James	PERSON	?

		One of her contemporaries , Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	, I think , was reported to have expressed , apropos of `` The House of Mirth , '' a somewhat envious fear lest Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's vein should be ex - hausted , and to have suggested that her success was due , if not to her snobbery , to the snobbery of a public that liked to read about the high life .

		I doubt if snobbery can find an ounce of nourishment in the gray pathos of the story of
Lily Bart	PERSON	.

		And as for her creator , a woman who is born to the social purple and to the intellectual purple , whose attitude toward her own class is tragic and ironic , who treats with a fine disdain just those qualities and privileges of the upper ten which the next four or five tens admire and emulate , is the shrewdest possible foe of snob - bery .

		The powerful final answer to these ques - tions was that amazing masterpiece , ``
Ethan Frome	PERSON	. ''

		And the answer is reiterated by `` Summer . ''

		Before `` Ethan Frome ''
New England	LOCATION	fiction was virginal .

		The stork preceded the doctor , but nothing preceded the stork .

		A doubtful ex - ception is `` The Scarlet Letter , '' in which the sorrow of illicit love is covered by a romantic veil .

		The exquisite stories of Miss
Jewett	PERSON	and
Miss Wilkins	PERSON	give delicate expression to as much as the shy
New England	LOCATION	characters would have wished to tell of themselves .

		These stories show the grace of narrow lives , the charm and humor 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	that can flourish amid rural poverty .

		By not making the deeper passions articulate the authors are precisely true to
New England	LOCATION	character .

		There are two kinds of suppression ; one is the suppression of life by the author 's ignorance or reticence ; the other is the suppression of feeling by life itself .

		Passion beats against obdurate facts and falls broken and bleeding .

		This con - test must be studied objectively , for the charac - ters do not understand what is happening to them .

		The author understands , and sitting omniscient and Olympian at the right-hand side of Fate , contemplates their lives ; at the same time he enters into each life with immense tenderness .

		This is the greatest achievement of that kind of imagination which creates fiction .

		The com - bined power of impartial contemplation and sym - pathy makes the genius of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	and it makes the genius of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	as it is found in ``
Ethan Frome	PERSON	'' and `` Summer . ''

		For she can not play with these people , as she plays with her people in
New York	LOCATION	society , shooting her own ironic shafts at them or analyzing them in terms of their own sophisticated talk .

		Her
New England	LOCATION	people are elemental , victims of circumstance -LRB- so also , of course , was
Lily Bart	PERSON	-RRB- , and they must be left for the irony of life to deal with .

		At the same time there is no cold detachment .

		A woman who had been reared on a bleak
New England	LOCATION	farm could not have a more intimate comprehension than has Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	of its pitiful details and lonely aspira - tions .

		And the
New England	LOCATION	woman 's knowl - edge would not be so wise or so wide , for it would not include so much of the rest of life as to give by comparison a full realization of bitterness and frustration .

		For the tragedy of ``
Ethan Frome	PERSON	'' and of `` Summer '' is not a shattered love affair .

		That experience is so common that everybody has known a case or two among his own friends .

		The tragedy is the defeat , the spiritual death , of natures that have not merely capacity for strong sexual passion but the capacity , which passion indicates , to grow and make something out of better circumstances than chance happens to permit .

		The saddest thing in
New England	LOCATION	, and no doubt in some other parts of the world , is the contrast between the spendor of the landscape and the aridity of some of the life that mocks its loveliness .

		A distinguished painter who knows the
New England	LOCATION	scenery but not the
New England	LOCATION	people told me that he admired ``
Ethan Frome	PERSON	, '' but he could not believe that such people lived they would all be dead by murder or suicide .

		Well , the only answer is that though murder and suicide are not unknown in rustic
New England	LOCATION	, Judge
Brack	PERSON	was on the whole right : `` people do n't do such things . ''

		They live along , like
Ethan Frome	PERSON	and his two women , after an abortive attempt at murder and suicide ; or like the girl ' in `` Summer , '' after the wreck of passion , they drop into a life of more or less comfortable resignation .

		For her , at the end of
summer	DATE	, there is an autumn of peace .

		The story , in its beautiful natural setting , is mellower and gentler than ``
Ethan Frome	PERSON	, '' which might have been called `` Winter . ''

		In her feeling for nature Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	is a poet .

		My friend the painter tells me not to mix up the arts , and says that words can not describe .

		Perhaps they can not , but they do .

		I could prove it by many quotations from `` Summer , '' but it is better for you to read the book and see whether I am wrong in regarding it as a marvel of com - position .

		The descriptions have the same con - tinuity with the narrative that trees have with the road they shelter .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	is at once direct and subtle .

		She unfolds with perfect lucidity the complexities of human nature .

		Her sentences are so beautifully sequential that some - times a passage seems to straighten out , tense and flexible , like a taut wire ; and the vibration is the sound of life .

		JOHN MACY .

		NOTES ox NEW FICTION - It is the astonishing combination of the mod - ern and the mid-Victorian that fascinates the reader of
William J. Locke	PERSON	's `` The Red Planet '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		A well-ordered globe is Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's , an
England	LOCATION	rubber-tired and ball-bear - ing , not the dusty and irresponsible country of Mr.
Britling	PERSON	.

		The Major , an English Gentle - man , is the rosy lens of the picture , and through his eyes we measure the charm of
Betty	LOCATION	, Sir
Anthony	PERSON	's temper ,
Marigold	ORGANIZATION	's discretion , and the psychology of
Colonel Boyce	ORGANIZATION	.

		This last is the book .

		Conrad 's `` Lord Jim '' spent his life in passionate overproof of his courage in conse - quence of a lapse of it on his first voyage .


Leonard Boyce	PERSON	spends other people 's lives in the same effort .

		And we are not sure that
Boyce	PERSON	is not one of the most virile men that
Locke	PERSON	has ever drawn .

		We feel the Major 's repulsion , we wonder at
Betty	LOCATION	's tenacious allegiance , and we smile at the adoration of Mrs.
Boyce	PERSON	as \ \ c watch
Leonard	PERSON	's mouth when he stands at the window with his loaded cane .

		But curiously , the reader feels his charm in spite of all dislike ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 163 the sympathy that brought the crowd to tears when his blind eyes could not help him put down the casket .

		We are won by his `` glorious de - fiance . ''

		Betty , the generous , the courageous , the independent , is the usual delightful
Locke	PERSON	hero - ine .

		She rushes through quiet Wellingford in tumultuous glory .

		Phyllis fails to provide enough color to warrant her obstinacy .

		Althea , dead before the book opens , is the most convinc - ing of all , a hollyhock in an English garden .

		It is easy to forgive the sentimentality of `` The Red Planet . ''

		In spite of the clockwork and the blue sky , there is the real story of a man 's life .

		The tendency in modern metaphysics and philosophy has been toward the recognition of a soul in the chaos called man .

		Mr.
George A. Dorsey	PERSON	evidently does not share this prejudice .

		In his `` Young Low '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- the young gentleman of the title role , obsessed by sex , jour - neys self-consciously through twenty-eight years of life in different parts of the traveller 's globe , and is left at the end of the book to go back to
America	LOCATION	and start all over again .

		The partners of his life vary interestingly .

		The girl at home , naturally , is not only stupid but old-fashioned ; the strictures from which Young Low escaped have bound her forever .

		A Hungarian Jewess is abject and adoring .


Alexandra Lanfiere	PERSON	, whose charm is difficult to discover , proves a con - venient vehicle for a large number of feminist theories , to which Young Low plays enthusiastic Rollo .

		It is unfortunate that the really excellent presentation of matter should be marred by a vast amount of modern Freudian dogma , which has not yet worked down to reasonable propor - tions .

		Much of it is still fermenting , and defies digestion .

		There is notable ease and grace in description and narrative , and with the growth of sympathy and understanding the author may be expected to produce something on a much higher plane .


F. W. Bain	PERSON	's latest romance , `` The Livery of Eve '' -LRB- Putnam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , would make a delight - ful ballet .

		There is the proper theatrical con - trast between
Keshawa	PERSON	, the handsome king , and
Kamarupa	PERSON	, the hideous barber .

		Both are enam - ored of the seductive water sprite Aparajita , but The King may not acknowledge his love for a woman and the barber can never hope to gain any woman 's toleration .

		Aparajita instructs the barber how to distenant the king from his hand - some body and assume that body himself , and afterwards she tricks him into giving up the king 's body for an instant so that
Keshawa	PERSON	, who has been led to admit his passion , may have a body handsome enough to woo her in .

		The scene in which the seductive water sprite , weeping over her dead fish , induces the barber to abandon his borrowed body would be delightful in such a ballet as the Russians stage for us .

		But however charming and picturesque it may be , Mr.
Bain	PERSON	's latest story is not likely to add to the unique reputation which he has gained among discriminating readers .

		It is slight in - deed , on the lips of any but an Indian story - teller with a perfect rage for `` making the com - parison , '' `` The Livery of Eve '' would be a mere short story .

		It comes out of a conversation be - tween the Moony-crested God and his spouse the Daughter of the Snow , and out of a conun - drum that he propounds which of the three be - ings ,
Keshawa	LOCATION	,
Kamarupa	LOCATION	, or Aparajita is to be blamed as the thief ?

		The Moony-crested God beats his spouse in casuistry , but she has had the satisfaction of hearing an agreeable and ingenious tale .

		Mr.
Bain	PERSON	is one of the initiators in the litera - ture of to-day .

		When he wrote the delightful `` Digit of the Moon , '' he discovered for us a novel sort of romance a romance that was neither European nor Arabian , but Indian and distinctive .

		He took Sanskrit romance with its mythological background and its copious com - parisons , its intellectual subtlety and its limited psychology , and infused into it an element of humor .

		By virtue of his humor he has made this alien literature delightfully entertaining .

		To many minds a great deal of the entertainment comes out of the sympathetic perception of the curious Indian mind .

		No other European writer gives us such a sense of being absolutely at home with the Pundits .

		Kipling , in comparison with the author of `` A Digit of the Moon '' or `` A Draught of the Blue '' or `` Ashes of a God , '' seems to be a Cockney interloper .

		Two sympathetic views of the race-problem are presented by Mr.
Paul Kester	PERSON	in the novel `` His Own Country '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		All the traditions of the South , and its preju - dices , all the arguments of the negro , and the evidence of the possibilities of his race have been carefully woven into this tragic romance .

		As a novel , the story is interesting ; as a psychological study and as a thought-provoking introduction to more serious consideration of the future of the colored race in
America	LOCATION	, it deserves attention .

		To offset the prolixity and occasional stiffness there is a sincere and wholesome study of con - ditions and atmosphere that can not fail to im - press the reader .

		There is no especial enlightenment concerning the `` misunderstood Americans '' of the southern mountains , to be derived from `` The Master of the Hills , '' by
Sarah Johnston Cocke	PERSON	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The book proves , if it proves anything at all , that an author may be fairly truthful in regard to history , geography , and dialect , and yet completely miss the essential characteristics of a people the things that give them life , and their story the savor of reality .

		164 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS RAYMOND , OR LIFE AND DEATH .

		By
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doran ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		To review this volume is a painful task how - ever considered .

		One hesitates to wound the sensibilities of the writer , not as a man of science , but as a father who has lost in the chance of battle a peculiarly promising and beloved son .

		The book begins with a brief record of the life and services of young
Raymond Lodge	ORGANIZATION	and in - cludes estimates of his character by comrades and some of his letters from the trenches .

		They tell what is a sadly familiar story : much bravery , admirable self-command , an engaging personality , a strong sense of duty , and the fatal rendez - vous with death .

		The bulk of the volume is an account of seances with various spiritualistic me - diums , in which the dead son speaks and , to the satisfaction of Sir
Oliver	PERSON	and other members of his family , gives evidence of his acquaintance with the thoughts and incidents of his life on earth .

		Other distinguished Englishmen who have entertained similar beliefs also communicate .

		When one observes the loose conditions under which these seances are held , the far-fetched con - clusions by which the evidence is made `` evi - dential , '' the overwhelming prepossession of the sitters in favor of the belief , the absence of pre - caution to guard against fraud , and then recalls the endless series of similar sittings that have demonstrably been fraudulent and the vulgar de - ceptions by which the mystification has proceeded , one can not render any other verdict than that this book is pernicious in the first degree .

		It is a shocking example of how an intellect trained to fine reasoning in physical science utterly breaks down in the presence of an emotional psycho - logical situation .

		One can hardly be satisfied merely to pity ; one must condemn .

		For reason is too precious a matter to be sacrificed in the worthy cause of charity .

		The conscientious re - viewer closes the volume with a sense of regret that it was written .

		THE MODERNS .

		Essays in Literary Criti - cism .

		By
John Freeman	PERSON	.

		Crowell ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		A book professedly devoted to `` the moderns '' and opening with an essay on Mr.
George Ber	PERSON	- nard
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	might be expected to continue with another on Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	and to discuss no writer born
earlier than the last half	DATE	of the nine - teenth century ; but Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	's list em - braces Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	,
Henry James	PERSON	, Cov - entry
Patmore	PERSON	, and Dr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	.

		The other names -LRB-
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Wells	LOCATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, Con - rad , and
Francis Thompson	PERSON	-RRB- just form a ma - jority , and hence may be considered to justify the book 's title .

		The company as a whole illus - trate the breadth and comprehensiveness of the critic 's sympathies and give promise of a whole - some catholicity in the tone of the essays .

		In his opening paragraph Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	calls atten - tion to `` the modesty lurking in his -LSB- Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's -RSB- defiant egotism , '' and then , inevitably enough , confronts us with such exhibitions of audacity , self-assertiveness , and lack of reverence -LRB- in the accepted sense -RRB- on Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's part , as to leave us wondering what room is left for the alleged modesty .

		One feels a little as one might in turning from
Dixon Scott	PERSON	's elaborate exposition of `` The Innocence of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	'' to witness a performance of `` Misalliance '' or `` Getting Married . ''

		By an odd trick of the mind Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	is somehow reminded of
Bunyan	PERSON	when he contemplates Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		All of which goes lo show the danger of falling into paradox when one ventures to handle this paradoxical genius .


Henry James	PERSON	impresses the author as having `` the most original mind of our time '' which would be more convincing from one who had not already devoted more than twice as much space to the startling originality of the `` modern '' just men - tioned .

		But he writes with discernment of the gifted and subtle novelist .

		TURKEY ,
GREECE	LOCATION	, AND THE GREAT POW - ERS .

		By
G. F. Abbot	PERSON	.

		McBride ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The world-war had its beginning in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, and the southeast has never ceased to be the principal theatre of its diplomacy and a main scene of its armed combat .


Germany	LOCATION	's chief aspiration lay in the direction of the j ^ Egean ; and one of the reasons why the Entente nations were unwilling last
December	DATE	to enter upon peace negotiations was that the Turkish alliance and the Roumanian collapse had brought this German aspiration to approximate realization .

		A timely book , therefore , is Mr.
Abbot	PERSON	's `` Study in Friendship and Hate . ''

		Mr.
Abbot	PERSON	has writ - ten earlier volumes on both
Turkey	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	, and his high qualification to discuss the kaleido - scopic politics centring about the
Balkans	LOCATION	and the eastern
Mediterranean	LOCATION	has been well proved .

		The present book consists of two series of chapters .

		The first sketches lightly , but with a sure hand , the relations of
France	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and the Germanic powers with the Turks ; it concludes with an interesting descrip - tion of the perplexity of
Turkey	LOCATION	at the outbreak of the present war , and a statement of the con - siderations that finally induced the Empire to cast in its fortunes with the Teutonic side .

		The second series of chapters deals similarly with the relations of the greater powers with
Greece	LOCATION	, and with the difficulties of the position into which the Hellenic kingdom was brought by the war .

		The Turks went into the war on the Teutonic side , the author says , for the simple reason that
Germany	LOCATION	outbid the Entente nations .

		The best
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 165 that
England	LOCATION	and her allies did was to promise unimpaired independence and integrity as a re - ward for neutrality ; and
England	LOCATION	gave offence at the outset by seizing two Ottoman battleships which were just ready to be delivered to the Porte by their English builders .


Germany	LOCATION	, on the other hand , made up the gap in the Sultan 's fleet ; plied the starving state with gold ; kindled the Turkish imagination with visions of an
Otto	PERSON	- man
Empire	ORGANIZATION	supreme in the
East	LOCATION	, as the Ger - man should be supreme in the
West	LOCATION	; and , above all , pushed the telling argument that if
Russia	LOCATION	came out of the war victorious ,
Turkey	LOCATION	would be doomed .

		Mr.
Abbot	PERSON	is strongly of the opinion that notwithstanding these odds ,
Turkey	LOCATION	might have been kept neutral by good diplomacy , for he says that the Sultan and Grand Vizier were opposed to a war policy .

		The fault , he thinks , lay not with the British ambassador at Con - stantinople , but with the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, and arose from adhering too slavishly to the policy of aloofness toward
Turkey	LOCATION	dictated by the Anglo-Russian entente .

		A final chapter , entitled `` The Moral Suasion of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' is perhaps the best in the book .

		It lays bare the fundamentals of one of the most tangled situations for which the war has been responsible , and shows that the struggle was the last thing the Greeks `` wished for or were pre - pared for . ''

		STATE SANITATION .

		By
George Chandler Whipple	PERSON	.


Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pioneer work of a constructive type in sani - tary engineering , especially in the fields of sewage disposal , the development , protection , and care of water supplies , and the prevention and control of pollution of streams by sewage and industrial wastes , has marked the history of the
Massachu	PERSON	- setts
State Board of Health	ORGANIZATION	to a degree unusual among governmental agencies .

		With the rise of preventive medicine the activities of this board have been turned toward the prevention of epidemics , the control of contagious diseases and the preparation and supply of antitoxins and vaccines .

		The history of this board is a record of the vanguard of socialized medicine in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Its successes have inspired other states to action and its officers have been widely recog - nized as leaders and advisors throughout the nation .

		For these reasons Dr.
Whipple	PERSON	's account of the organization , its political and scientific vicissitudes and its various projects undertaken in sanitary and medical research form an inter - esting and stimulating record of American prog - ress in state and municipal sanitation and preventive medicine .

		The first volume of the three projected in this work deals primarily with the history of the organization and republishes the `` Report of the Sanitary Commission of
1850	DATE	, '' a pioneer document of prophetic import in the history of American sanitation .

		THE LOVERS .

		By
Elizabeth Robins Pen	PERSON	- nell .

		Lippincott ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Six years ago , in the happy days before the war , Mrs.
Elizabeth Robins Pennell	PERSON	looked across from her high windows in
London	LOCATION	into the garret of an old house across the way and saw two lovers clasped in each other 's arms .

		It was
spring	DATE	when they settled in their attic , `` with an easel , two chairs , and a mirror for all visible furniture , '' and no thought save for each other and the work that was to bring them fame and fortune .

		For a year she watched them playing and working together , preluding ten-minute separations with endless last words and kisses ; then she saw them gradually losing their sublime unawareness of their surroundings , straying out of their lovers ' paradise into the humdrum world of every-day , and finally leav - ing their attic and her ken .

		Presently she wrote a sketch about them , called `` Les Amoureux '' for the `` Century Magazine '' and the incident would have been closed , had it not been that
Les Amoureux	ORGANIZATION	read the sketch and L' Amoureux came one day to bring Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	a book of his wife 's verses and to explain that her lovers were lovers still , and had been touched and thrilled not , as Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	feared , offended at finding themselves portrayed by a sympa - thetic hand .

		Again the story seemed ended , but again there was a sequel : a saddened , widowed L'Amoureuse , bringing to the friend who under - stood and could make others understand , her hero-lover 's letters , through which she wanted the world to read the tale of his bravery and devotion .

		L'Amoureux , a private , one of the first to volunteer , had fallen at
Loos	LOCATION	.

		From his brief , scrappy , breathless letters Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's sympathetic touch evokes a singularly vivid picture of the training of that first volun - teer army and of its early days in the trenches somewhere in
Flanders	LOCATION	days full of back-break - ing labor and heart-breaking hardships and mis - eries and dangers .

		Because he was a true artist , L'Amoureux had the seeing eye and the think - ing mind behind it ; writing as a private , he rec - ords , unconsciously , the experiences of millions of newly made soldiers who leave the life that they know to come and go as they are bidden , for reasons that they know .

		not , in support of policies that they do not understand .

		But for his letters , L'Amoureux would have passed , like most of his comrades , silently into the Great Silence .

		Because it is a true romance , `` The Lovers '' is a book to bring the huge , wasteful tragedy of war strongly home to its readers .

		Apropos of a conversation with
Madame Camille Lyon	ORGANIZATION	in which that distinguished mem - ber of the French bourgeoisie accused her of be - ing the most impatient of women , because , in going the rounds of ateliers and hospitals , she saw places and left them in such haste , Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	says of herself : `` The truth of the matter was that I had long since cultivated the habit of registering definite impressions in a flash . ''

		This quality of mind , combined with a dramatic sense fostered through the practice of writing fiction , has enabled her to gather exten - sive material during her three months ' stay in

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	was a sympathetic investiga - tor of the work which Frenchwomen have done because she is a great admirer of the French na - tion , which she considers , obviously , as pre - eminent among the warring nations of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		That the attributes of the French , which she de - scribes at length , belong to the women as well as to the men , is proved by the conspicuous ex - amples of resourcefulness , self-abnegation , un - tiring energy , and spiritual exaltation which she cites among all classes the aristocracy , the bour - geoisie , and the working people alike .

		It is in - teresting to become acquainted individually with the women of
France	LOCATION	who are associated with the founding and carrying on of the great relief - works of which we were poignantly , but imper - sonally , aware .

		The ouvroirs , the confines , the `` comfort package , '' the caring for the eclopes , and the reformes , Lt bon gite , the systematic training of women to do men 's work intelligently , the effort to rescue children of the frontier all these and other splendid works are described .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	is at her best when she confines herself to the concrete , and her portraits of French women have charm and piquancy .

		That great social and economic changes will be the result of these women 's far-reaching and hitherto unimagined activities , is Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's opinion , and this question she discusses in the last part of her book under the general subject of `` Feminism in Peace and War . ''

		At this point , `` The Living Present '' changes , in a measure , its character , for its author becomes discursive and resorts to generalities which are not always con - vincing .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's book , we believe , would have been more delightful , had she con - fined herself to portraiture and narrative , instead of undertaking , rather superficially , an abstract discussion of values .

		Recently we have had our attention sharply drawn to the fact that women may fight as fervently as they administer to the needs of the wounded .

		Any preconceived notion that the Russian `` Legion of Death '' is an innovation , is quickly dispelled when one turns to Mr.
Francis Cribble	PERSON	's `` Women in War '' and reads of the valiant achievements of `` warrior queens '' of the past .

		This is a historical account of the part which women of various nations have actually played in great battles , brought up to date by the mention of the exploits of certain women in the present war .

		Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	writes of
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	in detail , and with an open mind attempts to give her a proper place in history , conceding neither to
M. Anatole France	PERSON	that she was merely the tool of the clergy , nor to
Andrew Lang	PERSON	that she was the great military leader he thought her .

		His searching desire for fairness toward
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	gives one confidence in the author 's esti - mate of other women warriors with whose repu - tation the reviewer is less familiar .

		He specu - lates less than does Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	on woman 's `` status . ''

		His viewpoint appears to be , in the main , historical , although he has some interest - ing theories to account for the significantly feu - German women who have distinguished them - selves along military lines .

		CONFESSIONS OF A WAR CORRESPONDENT .

		By
William G. Shepherd	PERSON	.

		Harper ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Kot war events , but the adroit methods by which such events , despite censorship and red tape , may be related with promptness and pi - quancy and some approach to truth , for the benefit of newspaper readers , form the subject of Mr.
Shepherd	PERSON	's crisp narrative .

		He is said to have been the first American reporter per - mitted at the British western front , and to have been the only newspaper man to witness the first battle of
Ypres	LOCATION	.

		He also reported the fall of
Antwerp	LOCATION	, and has had a varied experience at the German , Austrian , and Italian fronts .

		His story brings out well the three stages through which war correspondence has passed in the course of the present conflict , and he calls them the `` free - lance days , '' the `` dark ages , '' and the `` stage of the new twentieth-century war correspondent . ''

		Lurid sensationalism characterized the first period , an unnecessary and vexatious meagrenr ^ of war news marked the second , and something like a happy medium between the riot of an irresponsible writer 's imagination and the severe brevity of official reports seems to have been at - tained in the new era now entered up-m .

		The book is an entertaining and apparently truthful account of a war reporter 's trials and triumphs and its author is an accredited correspondent nt the
United Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is an adept at adding the requisite touch of realism , but when he equips an Austrian locomotive with a cow-catcher , as
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 167 he does in his fourth chapter , the illusion is not heightened .

		However , we are willing to take the term in a generic and not a specific sense , and to commend his book unreservedly to the reader .

		SECOND WIND .

		By
Freeman Tilden	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Present conditions are causing something of a movement back to the land , from which , we are becoming acutely aware , we draw our sustenance .

		Therefore Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	's `` Second Wind , '' which professes in a sub-title to tell `` the plain truth about going back to the land , '' is a good book to read at this time , since it is written by one who evidently knows something about farming and is under no illusions as to the amount of hard work and , above all , intelligent work that successful farming demands .

		But whether the writer 's `` Alexander Hadlock , '' who got his second wind at sixty-two and exchanged the pro- fessor 's chair for the farmer 's hoe is a real per - son or purely imaginary , it would be hard to say .

		Perhaps he is a little of both .

		Perhaps the book is only another
David Grayson	PERSON	adventure in contentment .

		It has some of the pleasing qual - ities also of such realistic performances as `` One Way Out , '' `` A Living Without a Boss , '' and `` The Man Who Bucked Up . ''

		It certainly makes the sexagenarian
Hadlock	LOCATION	, with his iron determination not to be beaten and his courage - ous matching of his wits and pluck and energy against adversity , a very real and interesting character .

		A stony
Vermont	LOCATION	farm `` aban - doned , '' of course is the scene of his fight for life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ; and of course the fight ends in victory for
Hadlock	LOCATION	, else the story would not have been told .

		Inci - dentally the narrative conveys considerable in - formation about soils , fertilizers , dairy-farming , silos , ensilage , potato-bugs , and human nature , both rural and urban .

		There is not enough de - tail about the hero himself and the catastrophe that left him stranded and alone at sixty-two , to make him quite real to the reader , but he serves well enough as a peg on which to hang a pleasing and profitable disquisition on intensive farming .

		AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL PSYCHOL - OGY .

		By
Charles A. Ellwood	PERSON	.

		Apple - ton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The widespread interest in the psychological basis of social activities has led to a number of courses in social psychology , and these have nat - urally developed the need for textbooks .

		Such surveys frequently may be utilized to satisfy the interests of the general reader .

		For class pur - poses systematic exposition , with detailed heads of - paragraphs outlining the subject , offered in acceptable prose , represents the requirement .

		Professor
Ellwood	PERSON	has followed the traditional manner , and has produced a useful , well-ordered , and readable exposition .

		Thoroughly adequate when judged by class-room standards , the vol - ume can hardly be said to be notable .

		Yet it is generally unfair to criticize textbooks by the standards of notable contributions .

		Indeed , some teachers hold that a textbook is not a place for distinctive and individual contributions , but is in the first instance a handbook of direct service to the student .

		The texts in social psychology offer the educational disadvantage that their sub - ject-matter is not clearly defined or , when defined , is often a portion of another accredited domain .

		Sociology has practically sprung up in the un - claimed areas where the boundaries of several sciences failed to meet .

		It has also attempted to interpret the material of economics , of politics , of general social movements , and of psychology , from its own point of interest .

		Under this view of the function of social psychology , and the needs of the student , Professor
Ellwood	PERSON	's volume may be recommended as a well-balanced solu - tion .

		THE FRAGRANT NOTE BOOK .

		Romance and Legend of the
Flower Garden	ORGANIZATION	and the Bye-Way .

		By
C. Arthur Coan	PERSON	, LL.B .

		Putnam 's ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		How to know the flowers , intimately and lov - ingly , but not at all scientifically and botanically , is agreeably set forth in the rambling chapters of Mr.
Coan	PERSON	's delightfully original `` Note Book . ''

		Past the `` lodge of the Dumb Porter '' he leads the reader through `` no city park in which the weary palmer need dread signs inviting him to keep off the grass and attaching strange and un - usual penalties to the breaking of this or the plucking of that . ''

		It is a flower garden for one 's most vagrant moods , fragrant with old asso - ciations and full of all sorts of pleasant surprises .

		Here one may listen to the tale of
Narcissus	ORGANIZATION	from the beautiful youth 's own lips , and revive one 's memories of the folk-lore of the hyacinth , the Jack-in-the-pulpit , the
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	bells ,
Queen Anne	PERSON	's lace , monkshood , and many other flowers ; and here is to be found a new explana - tion of the name borne by the foxglove : `` The fairies play that these are gloves , because fairies can play anything , and to carry out the game they call them gloves too , just ` little folk 's gloves , ' or if they are in a hurry , ` folk 's gloves . '

		You see we have it all wrong .

		We call 'em ` Fox gloves ' because we do n't know any better .

		Fancy a fox with gloves on ! ''

		Poetry , both orig - inal and selected , profusely sprinkles the pages , and a set of `` cold frames '' at the end shows the origin of all these appropriate verses .

		Delicately tinted decorations cover the printed text , and a rural scene serves as frontispiece .

		168 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 30	DATE	CASUAL .

		COMMENT FRENCH SCRUTINY OF GERMAN SCHOLARSHIP is getting under way .

		It questions both the qual - ity and methods of `` Kultur '' and even its mor - ality .


Victor Berard	PERSON	, in a volume entitled `` Un Mensonge de la Science Allemande , '' attacks
Wolf	PERSON	's `` Prolegomena to Homer , '' a work which , on its appearance in
1795	DATE	, established itself as the chief in a new field of doubt , and has im - posed a rather stiff tyranny ever since .

		Accord - ing to this author , it is now clear that
Wolf	PERSON	borrowed right and left , and often forgot to specify his borrowings .

		He copied
Villoison	PERSON	, pre - tending that he had worked on the same subject before him .

		He copied
Merian	PERSON	, pretending that he did not know of this Swiss scholar 's work previous to the completion of his own .

		He copied the Abbe d'Aubignac , a still earlier scholar , who was the first to deny the existence of Homer and the common authorship of the Iliad and the Odyssey and who had put forward the hypothe - sis of independent tribal lays , and undertook to prove by false citations that the Abbe was but an old lunatic and that his conjectures were a mass of paradoxes and ineptitudes .

		The case of
Wolf	ORGANIZATION	is put forward as representative : `` No sooner did the human brain make a discovery or formulate a theory than
Germany	LOCATION	registered it , catalogued it , and contrived to profit by it and to boast of it as her own ...
France	LOCATION	imagined , created , invented ... Upon every Villoison that
France	LOCATION	produced ,
Germany	LOCATION	at once let loose a Wolf who , equipped with all the appliances of organized science , busily fabricated intellectual ` merchandise , ' until the world was aware only of the Germanic copy or counter - feit . ''

		Such testimony tends to put the Germans , along with the Japanese , among the imitative and assimilative peoples who `` better the instruc - tion '' derived from the really creative races and who , besides becoming a general menace , gain greater reputation for `` efficiency '' and other things than the facts warrant .

		THE WAIL THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES THE TRANSFER OF ENGLISH BOOKS AND PICTURES TO AMERICA -LRB- or , more strictly , books and pic - tures which have been English possessions -RRB- does not fail in connection with the recent sale of the
Bridgewater Library	ORGANIZATION	, got together by one of the earls of
Ellesmere	LOCATION	.

		A correspondent of `` The Publishers ' Circular '' mourns the `` lamentable fate of such a unique English heirloom being transported to
America	LOCATION	... To use the brute force of wealth at such a moment , for such a purpose , '' he declares , `` is just a little bit like picking your grandmother 's pocket at a familv funeral . ''

		For this are we allies !

		Continuing , this spunky writer hopes that , after all , Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	may intend , after exhibiting his spoils in `` some important centre of the
U. S. A.	PERSON	, '' to restore them -LRB- to the British Museum -RRB- as a memorial of the alliance of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in the great war .

		The editor who prints the above has his own hope : that `` when Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	's granddaughter marries the Prince < > t Wales ' son he may endow her with that gem among his other worldly goods and brin ^ the collection back ... to its ancestral halls . ''

		To which flight of fancy one can only oppose the calm opinion that collections of this sort or that having served their purpose in an old country , may serve a wider purpose in a newer one .

		THE ENGLISH `` DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY '' has been presented to the Univer - sity of Oxford by the family of its late proprie - tor .

		This vast undertaking was initiated in
1882	DATE	by
George M. Smith	PERSON	, at his sole risk and ex - pense .

		From
1885	DATE	to
1900	DATE	, under the editorship of Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, the original promise of quarterly publication was faithfully kept ; and three supplementary volumes , bringing the record down to the death of
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, were published in
1901	DATE	: sixty-six volumes in all , more recently issued as twenty - two .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	himself died in this latter year , having brought to successful conclusion , without state assistance or subsidy , the largest of all national collections of biography .

		In
1912	DATE	, his wife , to whom the property had been bequeathed , published three more supplementary volumes .

		This vast collection is described truly as a national asset , and it is gratifying to learn that
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	will commemorate upon the title-pages of all new issues by the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	, the name of its initiator and first proprietor and publisher .

		MAY A PERIODICAL APPEAR AS OFTEN AS IT LIKES ?

		Not in present-day
England	LOCATION	.

		`` Notes and Queries , '' that well-known and long-service - able monthly , has just been balked in an effort to convert itself into a weekly .

		Of course it took an odd time to make the change or to try for it .

		Other British periodicals are appearing with maimed and scanted rites , or at lengthened intervals , or have discontinued altogether .

		`` N. & Q. '' saw , however , a chance to take a different tack .

		A contributor of long standing had offered to purchase it , retaining the services of its time - honored sub-editor and those of its present pro- prietor as printer , and stood willing to gratify our intellectual curiosities fifty-two times a year instead of twelve .

		But the
English Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	had ordered that no person , without a lurnse from the
Board	ORGANIZATION	, should publish any new
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 169 magazine ; and for the purposes of this order -LRB- dating from last
June	DATE	-RRB- the expression `` new magazine or other publication '' has been made to include , with a dogged stiffness quite British , any periodical intended to be published more frequently than at the date of its order .

		A way to save paper , perhaps ; but no way to slake a community 's intellectual thirst .

		* WILL THE MODERN BOOK LAST ?

		Some years ago there was a well-founded alarm over the perishable nature of much of the leather used in book-binding .

		Today there is alarm about the paper especially that recent invention , `` art '' paper , to whose perfectly smooth but non - absorbent surface so many illustrations , black or in colors , have been committed .

		There are thousands of works in existence from the early centuries of printing , often as perfect as when first produced , even in the hand-colored plates .

		What , it is coming to be asked , would be their condition now if they had been printed and hand - colored on paper made as our modern coated `` art '' paper is made ?

		English paper-makers and publishers have been looking over the back files of such periodicals as have followed this method of illustration for thirty years the limit of endurance set by some authorities ; and they seem to feel -LRB- in the absence of expert opinion from chemists -RRB- that there is less danger from clay , or chemicals , or even from resin , than from the old and familiar enemy , damp .

		One hopes or fears that the only danger facing the vast number of illustrated works sure to follow in the wake of the great war is one already known and realized .

		A PLAN TO MAKE MUSICAL CELEBRITIES PROMINENT IN LITERATURE is involved in the project of the
National Society of Music	ORGANIZATION	, now reaching fruition after four years , to publish a comprehensive work on `` The Art of Music , '' with Professor
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	, of Co -
lumbia	LOCATION	, as editor in chief .

		Some of the names of his contributors resound internationally , as those of
Richard Strauss	PERSON	,
Anna Pavlova	PERSON	, and
Alfred Hertz	ORGANIZATION	.

		Others are those of well-known articulate forwarders of the art and themselves musicians , as
Frank Damrosch	ORGANIZATION	and
David Bisp	PERSON	- ham .

		Still other names , as that of Ernest New - man , give assurance that the writer as such will have his desired and necessary prominence .

		All this cooperative endeavor is expected to produce a work that will be a standard American one on music , will also be international in scope and in point of view , and will educate students and readers in the essentials of musical appreciation .

		Announcement of Fall ` Books THE DIAL offers herewith the first of the pub - lishers ' lists of fall books .

		The present division includes books on the theory and practice of edu - cation and textbooks for schools and colleges .

		The second division , to be published in the issue for
September 27	DATE	, will give books of a more general character .

		The present list is compiled from data obtained directly from the publishers , and is as complete as conditions in the publishing business will permit .

		The original oil painting of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	by Sir
Godfrey Kneller	PERSON	, after the celebrated Chandos portrait , said to be the only one of Shakespeare taken from life , is now in the pos - session of
Gabriel Wells	PERSON	, of
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The painting was executed about
1710	DATE	, and for more than a century remained in the keeping of the
Shakespeare	PERSON	family .

		It was displayed at the Ter - Centenary Exhibition at
Stratford-upon-Avon	LOCATION	.


M. H. Spielman	PERSON	, the literary and art critic , in a letter , says of it : I think this Chandos copy of special interest as it is the only one I have seen which is the exact coun - terpart , as to the head , of the celebrated copy that
Kneller	PERSON	made and sent to
Dryden	PERSON	.

		The proportions , expression , type of countenance and features are iden - tical in all respects as to the departures from the original
Kneller	PERSON	made .

		As the
Kneller	PERSON	has never been shown within the knowledge of the present generation , this portrait may probably create special interest .

		I base my judgement un the proof provided by the photograph I have taken of the
Kneller	PERSON	picture .

		The painting is framed , the outside measure - ments being twenty-eight and a half by thirty-five inches .

		The portrait is strikingly brilliant , the tones being mellowed by age .

		As it is lully life - sized it produces the eitcct of life .

		An edition de luxe of the complete works of will be published by
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page and Company for
Gabriel Wells	PERSON	, and will be ready for distribution about the latter part of
September	DATE	.

		It will be in fourteen volumes , octavo , large type , and handmade paper .

		It will be lim - ited to
1075	DATE	sets , and will contain material never before published , in addition to a volume of `` O. Henry '' miscellany , entitled `` Waifs and Strays . ''

		Tliis will have matter of great interest to the Henry '' reader , never before gathered together .

		1-iity of the copies will be reserved for finishing according to the specifications of the purchaser . '

		1 he set will be fully illustrated in the photogra - vure process by pictures painted by
Gordon Grant	PERSON	, the well-Known artist , trom types taken from real life .

		When the artist , in his prowling about the city , found a character that luted the person of `` O. Henry 's ' brain , he prevailed upon him by one means or another to pose tor the illustration in hand .

		The issuance of this de luxe set is espe - cially opportune at this time when `` O. Henry '' is being hailed both at home and abroad as one of the greatest literary artists of our time .

		In
England	LOCATION	the critics and public alike are vying with one another to do honor to him .

		Strange as it may seem , it has never been possible before to buy a complete set of `` O. Henry '' in fine binding , although millions of copies of his books have been sold .

		It is said that in
England	LOCATION	alone half a mil - lion copies of the one-shilling edition of his works have been sold .


James F. Drake	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, bought , through his
London	LOCATION	agent ,
$ 10,000	MONEY	worth of rare books of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries , at a recent sale at
Sotheby 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The agent informed Mr.
Drake	PERSON	that
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's had obtained
$ 50,000	MONEY	for eighty colored prints that belonged to Mr.
Barratt	PERSON	, a director of the
Pears Soap Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		This sale lasted only one and a half hours .

		A richly illuminated manuscript , `` Pontificale '' or `` Missale , '' on 156 leaves of vellum of
Franco	LOCATION	- Flemish execution of the fifteenth century , was knocked down at
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's in
London	LOCATION	the other day to
George D. Smith	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, for
$ 4000	MONEY	.

		It is written in large Gothic letters , red and black , eighteen lines to a full page , with musical notes .

		Nearly every page has richly decorated borders in compartments of natural flowers and fruits and conventional foliage interspersed with grotesque human figures riding grotesque animals , mummers with musical instruments and performing dogs , cen - taurs , demons , spearmen and archers , falconers , and shields bearing instruments of the Passion with angelic and animal supports .

		Some of the borders contain small square miniatures of scenes in the life of
John the Baptist	LOCATION	, of
Saints Nazarus	ORGANIZATION	and Celsus , of the life , death , and legendary history of the Virgin , of the life of Saint
Lazarus	PERSON	, of the martyrdom of Saint Leodegarius , shepherds and the heavenly host , scenes of the Nativity and the life of Christ , life of Saint
Malachi	PERSON	.

		and of the Office for the Dead , besides several hundred dec - orative large and small initials and textual orna - ments .

		It is evident that scribe , designer , and
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 173 decorator combined to produce a work of gorgeous - ness , the designs and decoration being evidently the work of the most eminent artists of the period .

		Two large miniatures occur before the
Canon	ORGANIZATION	, one representing the Crucifixion and the other the Deity enshrined , a full-length figure in flowing robes of gold , with cherubim and seraphim behind the throne .

		Each of these miniatures is surrounded by deep borders of flowers and fruit , in which are introduced remarkable , grotesque figures and ani - mals , having in the lower margin an emblazoned coat-of-arms of a prince bishop , supported by angels , beneath which is a Maltese cross .

		Other fine and large miniatures represent the three
Marys	ORGANIZATION	at the sepulchre , the ascension of Christ ,
Pentecost	LOCATION	, Christ celebrating the Eucharist with His disciples , the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	enthroned in heaven , the
Nativity	LOCATION	, and the offering of the
Magi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two interesting letters of
John Adams	PERSON	and
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	have come into the possession of
Patrick F. Madigan	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, who believes that they are unpublished .

		The letter of
John Adams	PERSON	was written when he was vice-president under
Washington	LOCATION	, to General
Winthrop Sargent	PERSON	, prominent in the Indian wars , 1791-5 , and gov - ernor of the
Southwestern Territory	ORGANIZATION	.

		The letter of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	was written when he was United States senator , and as a Federalist , to
William Smith Shaw	PERSON	, nephew and private secre - tary of
John Adams	PERSON	.

		The letter of
John Adams	PERSON	is as follows , with his capitalization , etc. : Dear Sir -
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
January 24 , 1795	DATE	.

		I have received your favour of the 30th of No - vember , and transmitted to Dr.
Belknap	PERSON	, as you desire , the papers inclosed .

		The Utensils aud ornaments represented in the Drawings are great curiosities , and seem to show more skill in Arts , than any of the native Indians , at this day , are possessed of .

		I am not enough in the habit of Antiquarian specu - lations to hazard any conjectures concerning them .

		I have never interested myself much in the inquiries concerning the ancient Inhabitants of this country , or the part of the world from which they first emi - grated .

		I should not be at all surprised , if here - after evidence should be discovered that
America	LOCATION	was once a Seat of Arts , Science and civilization : nor should I wonder if any one should prophecy that
Europe	LOCATION	, will cease to be what it is .

		and become as savage and barbarous as
America	LOCATION	was three hun - dred years ago .

		The temper and Principles pre - vailing at present in that quarter of the world have a tendency to as general and total a destruction , as ever befell Tyre and Sodom and
Gemorah	PERSON	.

		If all Religion and governments , all arts and pioneers are destroyed the trees will grow up , Cities will moulder into common earth and a few human beings may be left naked to chase the wild beasts with Bows and arrows .

		Printing they say will prevent it But it would be very consistent with the present professed Principles to destroy every Type and Press as Engines of Aris - tocracy , and murder every Pen and Ink man as aiming at Superiority .

		I hope in all events that religion and learning will find an Asylum in
America	LOCATION	: but too many of our fellow citizens are carried away in the dirty Tor - rent of dissolving
Europe	LOCATION	.

		I thank you Sir for giving me an opportunity to see those Antiquities , and should be glad to see any others that may appear .

		I am Sir with great esteem , your most obedient
John Adams	PERSON	.

Utterarp Criticism	ORGANIZATION	,
Btecustfion	PERSON	, anb Snformatiott Conscience and Intelligence in War The merely `` conscientious objector '' has absorbed too much attention from those who are concerned about under - standing the non-popularity of our par - ticipation in the war .

		Not all the pacifist feeling has had an evangelical color .

		There is an element of anti-war sentiment which has tried to be realistic , and does not hope to defeat war merely by not do - ing something .

		Though events have been manipulated against it , this element neither welcomes martyrdom nor hopes to be saved for its amiable sentiments .

		And it is just this attitude , far more significantly `` American '' than `` conscientious objec - tion , '' that
John Dewey	PERSON	has ignored in his recent article on `` Conscience and
Compul	PERSON	- sion . ''

		The result has been to apply his pragmatic philosophy in its least convinc - ing form .

		His criticism is of the merely good and merely conscientious souls whose moral training has emphasized sentiments rather than specific purposes , and who are al - ways found helpless before the coercion of events .

		His argument follows the well - known lines of his instrumental use of the intelligence for the realization of conscious social purpose .

		The conscience , he im - plies , is balked by an unpleasant situation , is futile unless it attaches itself to forces moving in another , and more desirable , direction .

		Dissatisfied with the given means or end , one chooses another alter - native , either a new end to which the means may be shaped , or a new means to effect the desired end .

		But in apply - ing this theory to the war situation , does not the philosopher ignore the fact that it is exactly in war that alternatives are rigorously limited ?

		Is not war per - haps the one social absolute , the one situ - ation where the choice of ends ceases to function ?

		Obviously in a world of choice one may hope intelligently to select and manipulate some social mechanism by which a desired social arrangement may be brought about .

		But war always comes to seem just that urgent , inevitable crisis of the nation 's life where everything must be yielded to one purpose .

		For a few months , the public may retain the illusion of freedom , of mastery over social forces .

		But as war continues , there comes the deep popular recognition that there is now but one end victory ; and but one means the organization of all the resources of the nation into a conventional war tech - nique .

		`` Peace without victory '' becomes a logical and biological contradiction .

		Belligerent peoples will have long ago re - alized that war is its own end , and that , to paraphrase a popular ditty , they fight because they fight because they fight .

		This was the real basis of the opposition to the President 's gesture for peace the reali - zation that though
America	LOCATION	might still be living in a pragmatic world , war had made
Europe	LOCATION	a realm of the absolute .

		And in our own country , war had not been with us for ten weeks before `` peace without victory '' changed officially into `` conquer or submit ! ''

		In wartime , there is literally no other end but war , and the objector , therefore , lives no longer with a choice of alterna - tives .

		The pacifist conscience attaches itself to no end because no end exists which connects with its desires .

		Plans and programmes may exist which have not to do with war , but they exist only in the realm of fantasy , not in the realm of prac - tical politics .

		Peace comes through vic - tory or exhaustion , and not through creative intelligence .

		The appeal to force removes everything automatically to a non-intelligent sphere of thinking and act - ing .

		Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	is depressed at the num - ber of conscientious young men who exchanged their `` Thou shalt not kill '' into an `` Obey the law , '' though they saw the situation exactly as before .

		But his de - pression is due only to that inexorability which every pragmatist must resent .

		It is 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	not just to be depressed at their poverty of imagination .

		For he is dealing with precisely the one situation in which his philosophy will no longer work .

		He im - plies that there was some way by which conscience could operate very differently from that whose main concern is to `` re - main itself unspotted from within . ''

		Well , in what way ?

		Where does one find `` forces moving in another direction '' ?

		One may find forces moving against the war , resisting the organization for war , agitating for a speedy peace .

		But such forces are not merely alternative social policies .

		They are not morally equivalent to the policy of war .

		They have the unique quality of disloyalty .

		They chal - lenge the entire force of the nation .

		As soon as they threaten to become at all ef - fective , they are automatically crushed out , under even the most democratic of governments .

		Never has a government in wartime been known to refuse the use of relentless coercion against `` forces mov - ing in another direction . ''

		The attaching of one 's conscience to any such forces is infallibly taken to be the allying of one - self with the disloyal , and the inadvertent aiding of the nation 's enemies .

		There is , of course , the alternative of revolution , which would have much the same effect as disloyalty .

		Does Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	mean to urge the `` conscientious objector '' to take to disloyalty or revolution in his efforts to attach his conscience to intelligent alterna - tives ?

		And if not , will he tell us what social mechanism he knows of that is con - sidered relevant or even permissible in wartime that does not contribute to the war technique ?

		One resists or one obeys .

		If one resists , one is martyred or coerced .

		If one obeys , the effect is just as if one accepted the war .

		In wartime , then , one 's pragmatic con - science moves in a vacuum .

		There is no leverage to clutch .

		To a philosopher of the creative intelligence , the fact that war blots out the choice of ends and even of means should be the final argument against its use as a technique for any purpose whatever .

		War once entered upon , neither means nor ends can really be re - vised or altered .

		The acceptance of the war by Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	can only be explained by the prevailing sentiment that this was a war in which we had to be .

		I have heard him say that it was far better to enter the war intelligently than blindly or hysterically .

		This is not quite the same as saying that deliberate murder is more creatively intelligent than murder commit - ted in the heat of sudden passion .

		For what Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	meant was probably that if we entered the war intelligently we would choose the ends which the war technique might serve .

		But is it not a little curious to find the men who thought the war inevitable `` what could we do ? ''

		and who could neither prevent it nor devise an alternative , still confident that they can control its terrible force for be - neficent purposes ?

		Having accepted the inevitable of war , one can more easily ac - cept other inevitables .

		At the back of Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	's mind was perhaps the hope that the pacifist con - science , though hating war and everything connected with it , might aid this war be - cause of the radical social reforms it was sure to bring .

		But the same people who thought of this as an end for which the pacifist should be willing to accept the in - strument , are now complaining that labor , though it consecrated itself to the nation 's service , is not now receiving the nation 's gratitude ; that the war-swollen fortune is sliding free of paying for the war ; that education is being impoverished , and national demoralization rather than inte - gration taking place .

		These ironic frustra - tions of the social purpose were foreseen by the realistic pacifists .

		They were the best of reasons for finding an alternative to war .

		They were the best of motives for not attaching one 's conscience to forces that involved a technique which in - fallibly trailed along these social evils .

		Once you accept war , there is no choice but to be shoved along the line of inev - itables with which war is organically bound up .

		In wartime , therefore , the `` forces moving in another direction , '' to which Mr.
Uewey	PERSON	invites the objecting con - science to attach itself , are illusory .

		War is just that absolute situation which is its own end and its own means , and which speedily outstrips the power of intelligent and creative control .

		As long as you are out of war , events remain to some degree
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 195 malleable .

		This was the argument for `` armed neutrality . ''

		But clamp down the psychic pattern of war on the nation , and you have precipitated an absolute where mastery becomes a mockery .

		Mere con - scientious objection in wartime is not so uncreative or unintelligent as Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	represents it .

		No social machinery exists to make dissent effective .

		Alternative ends are illusory .

		You can only accept , or rebel , or remain apathetic .

		This is not true of other social situations .

		It is true of war .

		If you are skeptical of the tech - nique of war , or of the professed aims , a negative attitude is the only possible one .

		It may not be noble to cencentrate on your own integrity , but it is perhaps better than to be a hypocrite or a martyr .

		And if pragmatists like Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	are going to accept `` inevitables , '' you at least have an equal right to choose what shall seem in - evitable to you .

		To many pragmatists the impotence of the pacifists in the period preceding the war has been a sore point .

		They are scolded for their lack of organization and their mere obstructiveness .

		Actually , they were fertile in constructive suggestions .

		But no social machinery existed for har - nessing their conscience to action .

		The referendum would have been a slight dem - ocratic clutch .

		It was hooted out of court .

		Armed neutrality was foozled .

		The forces that were irresistibly for war had control of the war-making machinery .

		The pacifists sounded ridiculous and un - reasonable , because the drive was the other way .

		The war suction had begun .

		Choices were already abolished , and the most realistic and constructive pacifism in the world would have been helpless .

		In all this chain of events , those minds were able to retain a feeling of alternative forces and of free choice which were in sympathy with the announced purpose of the war and not temporarily hostile to its technique .

		The philosophy of creative intelligence still seemed to be working be - cause there was no need to test its appli - cability .

		The dissenter , however , felt cruelly the coercive forces .

		Suppose I really believe that world peace will more likely come exactly `` by not doing some - thing , '' by a collusive neglect of imperial - istic policy on the new Russian model .

		Suppose I believe that a federalism of sov - ereign nations will only mean more com - petitive wars .

		What forces are there then to which I can assimilate this war of ours , and so make my intelligence and con - science count for what little they may ?

		Is not Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	's case against the merely passive built on an assumption that if one chose freely one would choose the present inevitable forces ?

RANDOLPH BOURNE	PERSON	.

		An Artist of the Supernormal Ever since
Henry James	PERSON	's horrible ghost story , `` The Turn of the Screw , '' the supernormal has had an increasing interest for the literary psychologist .

		Apparitions of the living and the dead are no longer confined to romance and fantasy or to the records of the Society for Psychical Re - search .

		They may be found in strictly realistic fiction , such as
Edith Wharton	PERSON	's powerful short story , `` The Triumph of Night , '' or
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	's `` Shadowy Third . ''

		Professor
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	adds phi - losophy to psychological analysis in his fascinating stories , and particularly in his book , `` All Men Are Ghosts , '' argues , with delightful humor , that ourselves and our realities may seem like illusions to those in other existences .

		But as a serious adventurer in the country of the supernor - mal , not one of these writers appears quite so courageous as
May Sinclair	DATE	.

		It was fitting that Miss Sinclair should give us , in `` The Three Brontes , '' the com - pletely satisfying interpretation of
Emjly Bronte	ORGANIZATION	's mysticism and poetry , for she herself is one of the few realistic writers in contemporary English fiction who is also a poet and mystic .

		`` Naked , shining , in - tense reality , '' to quote the writer 's own words , is what she seeks to discover in her art ; and she goes about her work , not heavily and solemnly , but with a serious - ness all lightened by humor , and a ridicule 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	which rarely fails to penetrate our little human absurdities .

		There is nothing of the comic spirit , however , in Miss Sin - clair 's extraordinary adventures in the su - pernormal `` The Flaw in the Crystal '' and `` The Intercessor . ''

		All her tragic power is here compressed into two neg - lected stories , unique in fiction .

		`` The Flaw in the Crystal '' concerns a strange case of mental healing , and the discovery by the healer through a tragic experience that in order to accomplish her intention she must remain absolutely pas - sionless and impersonal .

		The crystal , in the words of the symbol , must be flawless .

		Yet , when this book was published five years ago by a venturesome American publisher , `` hopeless immorality , '' `` neu - rotic femininity , '' `` amazing twaddle , '' was about all our reviewers found to say of a story whose purity of motive , exquisite balance , and precision of style are its most obvious qualities .

		They seemed quite un - aware , with a very few exceptions , that
May Sinclair	DATE	had accomplished a literary feat of amazing delicacy and power .

		There are visions of mystic beauty in
Miss Sinclair	LOCATION	's later work , none more ra - diant than the one recorded in her `` Jour - nal of Impressions in
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' a vision of tranquil and supernatural loveliness in the midst of human horror and despair .

		But the most extraordinary , in the present writer 's opinion , is the brief experience of joyous reality given to
Agatha Verrall	PERSON	, the psychic and healer , as she stands on the edge of the silent woods looking down a steep ploughed field in early
spring	DATE	.

		The man beside her , she has cured of mad - ness of the haunting Terror which has driven him indoors to sit crouching in his chair , with blinds drawn and locked door .

		Now , in the full assurance of his recovery ,
Harding Powell	PERSON	is out of doors , receptive to the wonder and beauty of
spring	DATE	.

		Agatha has demonstrated her fitness as an instrument of the inscrutable healing pow - er .

		She is happy purely in the sense of having helped .

		To quote in part : At that moment , in a flash that came like a shift - ing of her eyes , the world she looked at suffered a change .

		And yet it did not change .

		All the appearance of things , their colours , the movement and the still - ness remained as if constant in their rhythm and their scale ; but they were heightened , intensified ; they were carried to a pitch that would have been vehement , vibrant , but that the stillness as well as the movement was intense ... She would have said now that the earth at her feet had become insubstantial , but that she knew , in her flash , that what she saw was the very substance of the visible world ; live and subtle as flame ; solid as crystal and as clean .

		It was the same world , flat field for flat field and hill for hill ; but radiant , vibrant , and , as it were , infinitely transparent .

		Agatha in her moment saw that the whole world brimmed and shone and was alive with the joy that was its life , joy that flowed flood-high and yet was still .

		In every leaf , in every blade of grass , this life was manifest as a strange , a divine translucence .

		She was about to point it out to the man at her side when she remembered that he had eyes for the beauty of the earth , but no sense of its secret and supernatural light .

		Harding
Powell	PERSON	de - nied , he always had denied the supernatural .

		And when she turned to him her vision had passed from her .

		The complete reversal of this joyous experience is shown in another and horri - ble vision when
Agatha	ORGANIZATION	, because she has failed to hold herself passionless and im - personal in her healings , and , to save the man whom she loves , has abandoned Har - ding
Powell	PERSON	, is haunted by the latter and takes on his madness .

		Then , it is not the joy but the horror imminent in the life of things which she experiences : She saw the world in a loathsome transparency ; she saw it with the eye of a soul in which no sense of the divine had ever been , of a soul that denied the supernatural .

		It had been
Harding Powell	ORGANIZATION	's soul , and it had become hers .

		Furiously , implacably , he was getting at her .

		Out of the wood and the hedges that bordered it there came sounds that were horrible , because she knew them to be inaudible to any ear less charged with insanity ; small sounds of movement , of strange shiverings , swarmings , crepitations ; sounds of incessant , infinitely subtle urging , of agony and recoil ... She heard the stirring of the corruption that Life was ; the young blades of corn were frightful to her , for in them was the push , the passion of the evil which was Life ; the trees as they stretched out their arms and threatened her were frightful with the terror which was Life ... All this she perceived in a flash ... It sank into stillness and grew dim ; she was aware of it only as the scene , the region in which one thing , her terror , moved and hunted her .

		Among sounds of the rustling of leaves , and the soft crush of grass .

		and the whirring of little wings in fright , she heard it go ; it went on the other side of the hedge , a little \ \ -- .

		\ \ - behind her as she skirted the wood .

		She stood still to let it pass her , and she felt that it passed , and that it stopped and waited .

		A terrified bird flew out of the hedge , no further than a fledgling 's flight in front of her .

		And in that place it flrw from she saw
Harding Powell	ORGANIZATION	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 197 The apparition , born of
Agatha	ORGANIZATION	's fear , drifts away and is dissolved .

		She recov - ers herself and is released from the haunt - ing Terror ; but having discovered the cause of her imperfection , she sends the man whom she loves , and who is already married to another , away from her with the gentle inflexibility of the true mystic .

		`` His hand was on the door .

		He smiled back at her . '

		I do n't want to shake your faith in it , ' he said .

		` You ca n't shake my faith in it . '

		` Still it breaks down .

		It breaks down , ' he cried .

		` Never .

		You do n't understand , ' she said .

		` It was the flaw in the crystal . ' '

		Such analysis of the supernormal is surely one of the most difficult and danger - ous things a writer could undertake .

		So easily it might have led Miss Sinclair into the extravagant and fantastic , the inco - herent or hysterical ; but what she manages somehow to convey , with consummate art , is a sense of reality .

		Since `` The Turn of the Screw , '' with the exception of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's `` Tri - umph of Night , '' no such puzzling and gruesome subject has been undertaken in English fiction as
May Sinclair	DATE	's solitary ghost story , `` The Intercessor , '' published in the `` English Review . ''

		In `` The Turn of the Screw '' and `` The Triumph of
Night	TIME	, '' it is the powers of darkness which bring forth the apparitions of the living and the dead .

		Henry
James	PERSON	stops at hor - ror multiple horror ; Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	at triumphant crime .

		In `` The Intercessor , '' it is only through evil and suffering that the veil is rent between the worlds , but
May Sinclair	DATE	more gently makes the su - pernormal event the means by which the evil is banished .

		Among the realistic tragedies of child - hood in our literature , there can be noth - ing more poignant than this sobbing phantom of the little dead girl wandering about the desolate farmhouse where she has been neglected and abused by the mother whom she loves ; striking terror to the hearts of all within that brutish house - hold until , through the mediation of a stranger , one who is pitiful and unafraid , the intercessor , comes reconciliation .

		The mother is saved from madness , and the child 's sorrow and passion are appeased .

		To make of this strange and unbelievable story a work of naked , tragic reality , re - quires a peculiar combination of psychic and artistic gifts which
May Sinclair	ORGANIZATION	has developed beyond all the other English fiction-writers of our day .

		`` The Flaw in the Crystal '' and `` The Intercessor '' are , of course , only the occa - sional adventures of a gifted realist and psychologist , the bulk of whose work is concerned almost entirely with normal , everyday life .

		It is quite certain , how - ever , that before the war they were not mere `` interludes '' in Miss Sinclair 's more serious fiction -LRB- the hope expressed by one dissatisfied reviewer -RRB- .

		They were a grow - ing preoccupation .

		From contemplation of the external world , its ugly materialism , what she de - liberately sweeps aside as the `` whole ob - structive apparatus of material things , ''
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	was turning to seek a deeper reality and the supernormal fascinated her .

		She was an individualist and a mys - tic , quite detached from social and political movements , except woman suffrage -LRB- a rather large exception ! -RRB-

		.

		Then came the war .

		Gallant and militant ,
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	was one of the few women writers to sign the British authors ' declaration of loyalty to democratic ideals of government , and she went into active service as a volunteer in one of the first British field-ambulance corps to enter
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	.

		She witnessed the ferocious militarism of the German invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Those seventeen days spent under the `` curved lightning '' of the German shells and bomb-dropping aeroplanes , so scrupulously recorded in her `` Journal , '' and later in `` The Belfry , '' must have an incalculable effect on her work .

		Will it become less individualistic ?

		A stronger social purpose would strength - en its reality .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	has shown our social phi - losophers in fiction , the value of psycho - logical subtlety , of delicacy combined with courage in the presentation of erotic themes , of fidelity to the individual life .

		May not their insistence on the supreme importance of social analysis and vision have its value for her now ?

		Or will she react in these violent times , and find that the mystic and lyrical forces which move 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	us still have their most interesting and significant manifestations in elemental and personal emotions ?

		One thing , however , seems certain .

		May
Sinclair	PERSON	is one of the English novel - ists who will survive Armageddon .

		Her genius can not be so shattered .

		But it is quite possible that after the extremity of social wrong and human anguish which she now witnesses , her adventures in the super - normal will be discontinued , and that such stories as `` The Intercessor '' and `` The Flaw in the Crystal , '' will have no succes - AMY

		Instead of everlasting peace , a series of long and bloody wars will be the mark of the new century ... The era of international - ism is past and will never return ...

		Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	insults no one , impugns no one 's inoti \ rs .

		M-rk > no merely nationalistic inter - pretation of this war , and does not attempt to assume the role of Supreme Judge between the nations .

		He is looking not backward to Sera - jevo and the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	but forward to the treaty of the peace which is to come and to the decades of world reorganization in which that peace is to be made really effective .

		The ques - tion which he faces with wisdom and courage is lio \ v the coming war-settlement can promote the cause of international organization and how the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, proposed by President
Wilson	PERSON	, can secure to all peoples effective guaran - tees of future peace and healthy national develop - ment .

		In working out this problem upon the basis of a candid consideration of a vast mass of material Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	arrives at the con - clusion that the time is now ripe for the insti - tution of the League , that we can not afford to wait ten years or even five for hostile passions to cool , that the programme though difficult is feasible , that the League must be all-inclusive , and that it can not be successful unless
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	are invited to membership .

		In other words , Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	does not believe with Dr.
Meyer	PERSON	that
Germany	LOCATION	is a forlorn pilgrim who must forever defend himself against the wiles and lusts of a world of envious rivals .

		Nor does he agree with the Right Honorable
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	that progress consists in `` chaining the German Wolf . ''

		Instead he works out with great ability a tentative peace agreement and a provisional outline of the League which is to be constituted among the nations .

		At bottom the difference between men like Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	and hot controversialists like Professor
Meyer	PERSON	and Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is that the former are seeking large ends and are not concerned with making out a case against individuals or with indicting in advance of the facts a whole nation .

		Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	sees deeper .

		`` We set out , '' he `` to destroy Prussian militarism .

		It will be destroyed at the moment when a German govern - ment pledges itself to enter a League based on arbitration and conciliation .

		Short of that wr may slaughter Prussians , but we can not destroy militarism . ''

		In other words , the battle-field is but a preliminary to the real business of the war .

		`` Defeat means our failure to achieve inter - national organization , and victory means our success . ''

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 199 In a former book , `` The War of Steel and Gold , '' Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	described the vast con - flict between the nations which was going on in peace times .

		It was partly to escape this con - flict , and the dead weight of outlived conditions of which it was an expression , that the nations flew to arms .

		The war , concludes Mr.
Brails	PERSON	- ford in the present book , `` sprang from many passionate resolves to extort change from destiny .

		It was an act of insurgence against the death in life which acquiesces in hampered conditions and unsolved problems . ''

		The evil in
Europe	LOCATION	, which gave rise to this war , was `` the inertia , the im - potence , the suspicion , the lack of social sense which stood in the way of these necessary changes .

		The way of hope is not in the retro - spective moralizings which distribute blame and to blame would add punishment , '' but in the acceptance of impulses and in a new spirit of adjustment and compromise and faith .

		Under the somewhat pretentious title that heads this article ,
Marjorie	PERSON	and
Alan Leth	PERSON	- bridge have collected a number of stray essays inspired by their travels in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		There is no doubt that the authors were ill-advised in choos - ing for their book a name which promises far more than they endeavor to fulfil .

		In this case , the title is more than a misnomer ; it is a verit - able boomerang .

		It arouses great expectations which a reading of the essays quickly dissipates , leaving the reader disgruntled and somewhat disinclined to praise the good things that the book contains .

		This is most unfortunate , for `` The Soul of the Russian '' is not without its merits .

		Though the work is a collection of short , miscellaneous sketches written with very little distinction of style , it is , nevertheless , a sincere attempt to represent certain phases of Russian life .

		As such , it will have something to give to the general reader .

		The essays fall into three groups : historical or antiquarian bits , articles inspired by the war , and descriptions of persons and places .

		Some are flat and unprofitable , others merely quaint and curious ; a few are illuminating brief flashes that reveal some - thing of the Russian `` soul . ''

		A different purpose animates Mr.
W. F. Bailey	PERSON	in `` The Slavs of the War Zone . ''

		His desire is to give `` a vivid and accurate account of the countries in which the Slav races dwell to give a description of their habits and cus - toms ; of how they live at home , among their neighbours , and in their market places ; of their dress , their amusements and , their festivals ; of their music , their songs and their dances ; of their views of life , their joys and their sorrows ; of their political , national and religious aspira - tions ; of how the great war found them and how it leaves them . ''

		The author attempts to cover the vast territory between the Russian steppes and the
Adriatic Sea	LOCATION	, pausing wherever there are people of the Slav race , no matter under what name their ethnic descent is now hidden .

		Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	's interest is in the Slav race ; to him race kinship is a reality that sets at naught the disintegrating forces of variety of languages , social and environmental differ - ences , interracial affiliations , and neighborly comities .

		All these are laughed to scorn by the ordained ethnic grouping , by the mystic ties of blood .

		`` When the history of the origin of the present war comes to be written , '' says Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	, `` it will probably be conceded that it was mainly due to the clash of interests between the Teutonic and Slav peoples . ''

		`` The Russians : An Interpretation '' is the work of a man who has a deep affection for the Russian people and a knowledge of the grave problems that
Russia	LOCATION	will have to face in the near future .

		Unfortunately , much in Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's interesting volume has become `` anti- quated '' in view of the great strides that the country has made in the last four months .

		But the book will prove of value to that large sec - tion of the American reading public which seeks reliable information about an unknown coun - try , information given in clear , understandable terms .

		It has become the fashion to speak of the Rus - sians as a `` soulful '' people .

		, Writers like Ste - phen
Graham	PERSON	have journeyed to the country of the vast plain , determined to experience delect - able and mystic joys .

		Far be it from me to 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	remove the veils that shroud secluded mysteries .

		This is a form of iconoclasm from which I shrink .

		But it seems to me that some of us are in a fair way to forget that
Russia	LOCATION	, as
Kipling	PERSON	said , is not the most Eastern of European , but the most
Western of Eastern	ORGANIZATION	, nations .

		The Russians themselves are far too diffident to be - lieve the solemn things that the literary band of devotees says about them .

		With unconscious irony , the peasants of
Russia	LOCATION	have for genera - tions been raising the worldly cry , `` Land and Liberty , '' that Russian equivalent of `` No Tax - ation without Representation . ''

		And it will be impossible to them that they are sell - ing their souls for > of pottage .

		As they see it , they are trying to keep their birthright intact .

		Nor can they conceive that with the attainment of liberty will come the surrender of their faith or the gradual atrophy of the racial and inherent traits that go to make up the Russian `` soul . ''

		Liberty transforms a people only in the sense that it makes them true to their inner nature .

		Through liberty alone is the great apocalypse of a nation made manifest to those who can see and understand .

		Into the Russian heart there has entered the poignant melancholy , the subtle and compelling power of the vast , level , monotonous plain which took centuries to conquer .

		The Russian char - acter is linked , in its qualities and its defects , to the plain of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The emotional expansive - ness of the Russians , their spiritual eagerness that knows no bounds , their reaching out for full freedom of body and mind , is natural to a people who have the consciousness of space , the knowl - edge of far vistas and distant horizons .

		They are led to extremes of all kinds , but they are led by a sense of sin that gives them no rest , by a deep faith that truth exists and can be attained .

		And perhaps , because of the tragic earnestness of their search , the Russians have come upon the right way , for , in the words of
Alexei Tolstoy	PERSON	, they seek `` to embrace Nature , brothers , foes and friends . ''

		The Russians have been accused of not being `` practical . ''

		I have often asked myself by what signs one is to know a practical people .

		It seems to be the belief in our country , if one is to judge by the liturgy of success in certain of our popular magazines , that in order to be marked by this coveted virtue one must perform the job immediately in hand , and sec only as far as one 's nose extends .

		The `` practical '' method seems to be to investigate not causes but effects , to mend the social vessel after the mischief has been done , then to continue with `` the work in hand , '' utterly disregarding the possibility of another breakdown and democratic - ally unmindful of the fearful waste of human energy and the horrible degradation of human life .

		Epimetheus is the god of the `` practical '' man .

		Eschew the eternal and the universal , shun the vision of the whole and the far-away , and you will be eminently practical .

		But if a refusal to compromise with present evils , a long experience in the ways of communal living , a keen social sense that leads to all forms of free co - operation and voluntary organization , an impa - tience with political tinkering and half-measures , a blessed commonsense that seizes upon the essen - tial and the `` radical '' in all things , an inspired vision of the social state with all its interde - pendent parts , if these are the marks of a prac - tical people , then the Russians are practical , and civilized .

		And when they are permitted by their present national enemy and by oversolicitous friends to exercise in freedom the right to con - trol their own destinies , a right earned by a century of agonizing struggle , the Russians will reveal their soul in a glorified , shapely , and equitable state .

		Some years ago ,
Herder	ORGANIZATION	had the courage to state that the Slavs were destined to say the last word in the development of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean civilization .

		He is only one of many who have held the profound conviction that from
Russia	LOCATION	will come the final word of deliverance .

		History as `` Purposive Tendency THE SPIRITUAL INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY .

		The
William B. Noble Lectures	ORGANIZATION	,
1916	DATE	.

		By
Shailer	PERSON	Mailu-us .

		-LRB-
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	;

William James	PERSON	has said `` when we look at what has actually come , the conditions must al - ways appear perfectly designed to ensure it .

		We can always say , therefore , in any conceivable world , of any conceivable character , that the whole cosmic machinery may have been designed to produce it . ''

		But to assume upon the b : iM of such a causal series that the universe is evolv - ing a purpose is to commit the fallacy of ascrib - ing to the whole what appears to be true of the part .

		This , however , is the method employed by
Shailer Mathews	PERSON	in his `` Spiritual Interpreta - tion of History . ''

		He believes that a survey of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 201 historical development indicates that history is a process in which man has advanced beyond a condition of subjection to geographic and economic forces .

		These have `` given rise to cus - toms which in turn proceeded onward to free choice on the part of both individuals and groups and of rational action in the light of more per - sonal values . ''

		Consequently we may assume that this is true of history as a whole : that a spiritual force , an elan vital , has evolved out of and in opposition to natural and economic forces .

		Hu - man history is a rational process .

		Professor
Mathews	PERSON	protests against four prev - alent interpretations of history .

		The first seeks merely to amass facts without reference `` to their genetic relationship as tension points in a social process . ''

		The second is theological .

		`` Its rep - resentatives see little in history except providen - tial and often miraculous guidance by God . ''

		More significant at present are the geographic and economic interpretations of history .

		The geographic interpretation ascribes all differences to physical circumstances and grants humanity `` little more initiative than the flower that turns to the sun '' ; while the economic interpretation accounts for the rise of social institutions and morality as due to the limitations of nature , on the one hand , and as the resultants of social antagonism and adjustments , on the other .

		Each view is inadequate and too simple .

		It is a Pro- crustean bed to which its advocates strive to fit their facts .

		A `` real '' interpretation of history conceives of it as a genetic process and deals ex - clusively with facts as they are .

		It requires per - spective and a realization that man lives and develops in society .

		If we view history in this manner , we perceive that , although economic and geographic forces are important , human history finds its true significance `` in neither the environ - ment nor the human race itself , but in the total situation of man-in-nature . ''

		It is a process in which social life becomes more `` personal . ''

		This process manifests itself in three tendencies : `` the tendency to substitute inner sanctions and inhibi - tions for outward authority based upon force either human or divine ; to recognize the worth of the individual as personal rather than as merely economic ; and to substitute through so - cial action , itself increasingly democratic , the giv - ing of justice for the insistence upon right . ''

		This is the argument of the first five lectures .

		Most readers will agree with Professor
Mathews	PERSON	that religious , moral , and artistic ideals , racial aspirations , and so on have profoundly influenced the course of history .

		They will further agree with him that ideals are more than mere result - ants , that they are also creative factors which must be taken account of in any interpretation of history .

		So far Professor
Mathews	PERSON	appears to have demonstrated the undisputed .

		But this is only preparatory .

		The sixth lecture reveals the purpose of the book .

		In the previous lectures `` spiritual '' signified the personal elements re - ferred to above .

		Here a spiritual interpretation of history involves a belief in a super-personal tendency immanent in history .

		We become entangled in a mystical explanation which con - siders `` personal activities '' to be forces or enti - ties struggling in behalf of a Rational Spirit or Tendency in history .

		Such an interpretation confuses rather than enlightens ; for , after all , what is this type of interpretation but a dignified fetishism ?

		That it gives rise to more problems than it solves is obvious from the fact that Pro- fessor
Mathews	PERSON	's
Rational Tendency	ORGANIZATION	is a hybrid between
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's purpose which runs through the ages , and
Spencer	PERSON	's impersonal Unknown ,
Bergson	PERSON	's elan vital ,
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	's Weltgeist , and
Lotze	PERSON	's `` purpose . ''

		The layman is merely con - fused by this metaphysical fog , while the theolog - ian finds it too illusive to damn as heresy .

		But the man who is seeking an escape from the mech - anistic conception of life and wishes to remain loyal to the scientific spirit of the time receives no genuine help from this doctrine .

		Why must he be restricted to the two alternatives mechan - ism or supernaturalism ?

		Is the service performed by ideals any less vital and necessary to man if they fail to present a certificate of supernatural origin ?

		The problem of evil is not permitted to em - barrass this World Spirit .

		It is safely hidden and receives no mention .

		Nothing is said of immortality except that it `` is no longer a rhetor - ical sentiment but a phase of the world process . ''

		To be sure , it is requisite if history be a pur - posive tendency !

		We are assured that man is practically free of impersonal forces , although `` the pressure of materialistic thought and inter - ests was never greater than today . ''

		And , fin - ally , we are exhorted to cast our lot with the spiritual forces , for they represent `` no forlorn hope . ''

		God 's is the winning side !

		A Critical Anthol - ogy .

		By
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The energy of Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	is unflagging .

		Not content with bringing out annually the `` An - thology of
Magazine Verse	ORGANIZATION	, '' he has now entered upon another and even huger enterprise `` A Critical Anthology , '' he calls it ; and this , too , threatens to become a hardy perennial .

		In these four hundred pages , which for the greater part consist of his reviews in the ``
Boston	LOCATION	Evening Transcript , '' slightly revised and cast into the form of al fresco conversations between Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	and three others , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	purports to cover the entire field of English and American poetry for
1916	DATE	.

		Some fifty odd poets are discussed here , a list long enough surely to have included certain poets whose omission seems singular enough to warrant a more spe - cific explanation than Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	offers .

		Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	and Mr.
Wilfrid Wilson Gib	PERSON	- son come in for only incidental mention .

		Messrs.
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	,
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	, and
Maxwell	PERSON	Bo - denheim -LRB- whose work has appeared in anthol - ogies -RRB- are not mentioned at all .

		With these exceptions , however , the list is complete enough to afford us a clear idea of Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's temper and method .

		Concerning his predilections , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	leaves us in no doubt whatever .

		At the very centre of his attitude toward poetry is the ex - press belief that poetry is a sort of supernatural - ism .

		`` It is the sacerdotal wonder of life which poets feel , '' he remarks .

		`` More certainly than other men , poets are conscious of pre-existence , in other worlds , and in this too . ''

		Elsewhere , one encounters also such expressions as `` reverence for life , '' `` quest for beauty , '' and `` mystic illu - mination . ''

		This sort of thing , one must confess , is a little too easy .

		Is it not really a shrugging of the critic 's burden from his own shoulders , onto the shoulders of God ?

		This is no place , to be sure , for a quarrel over the importance or the reality of God ; but it is perhaps not going too far to say that within the sphere of man 's con - sciousness , no matter to what miraculous origin it be ascribed , all things are at least subject to man 's observation and analysis .

		If in the pres - ence of a piece of poetry the critic is content merely with the exclamatory , he is not doing his work .

		Let him remember that he is dealing , at least in large measure , not with the supernatural but with the natural ; and what is natural has natural -LRB- biological and psychological -RRB- causes .

		These it is the critic 's duty to determine and to relate .

		It is easy to see , therefore , where , in his rela - tion to contemporary poetry , so fundamental a failure leads Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	.

		With this some - what quaint notion of the holiness of poetry in his head , it is natural that he should be most tolerant toward that sort of poetry which itself , in somewhat the same manner , takes for granted the holiness of life .

		In his present book , there - fore , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	puts a clear emotional emphasis on work which is characteristically sen - timental .

		Lizette
Woodworth Reese	PERSON	, Bliss Car - man ,
Amelia Josephine Burr	PERSON	,
Olive Tilford Dargan	PERSON	,
Louis V. Ledoux	PERSON	,
Hermann Hagedorn	PERSON	, these are some of the poets about whom Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	can talk with unrestrained enthusi - asm .

		They , and to a less extent
Edwin Arling	PERSON	- ton
Robinson	PERSON	, observe toward life , in varying degrees , an attitude of chaste , romantic awe ; and it is this attitude , particularly when it ap - proaches the sweetly ecstatic or appears to be barely concealing a sob , that most delights Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	.

		Consequently , such other poets as
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	,
Orrick Johns	PERSON	,
William Car	PERSON	- los
Williams	ORGANIZATION	, and the unmentioned
Carl Sand	PERSON	- burg ,
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	,
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	,
John Rodker	PERSON	.

		and other poets of the `` Others '' group who are in the main realists , implicitly critical or analyt - ical of life , or at the most neutrally recepti \ e. are somewhat coolly entertained .

		Of Mr.
Mas	PERSON	- ters Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	remarks , characteristically , that he `` de-affinitizes imagination of mysterv '' ; of the poets who contributed to `` Others , '' that they do not deal with life `` but with their own little conception of it , '' which , of course , is precisely what all poets do .

		To
Bliss Carman	ORGANIZATION	.

		on the other hand , he ascribes `` magic , '' `` natural svmbolisms with ... supernatural meanings ... '' Clearly , such an attitude reveals in Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite a very decided intellectual limitation .

		Must poetry be all marshmallows and tear - ' I - it to be prohibited from dealing with ideas , or restricted solely to a contemplation of that small part of our lives which is , in a sentimental sense , beautiful ?

		Is poetry to be merely a perfume re - served for our moments of languor ?

		Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite might not say `` yes '' to this question as it stands , but if it were put in a slightly different form , he would .

		And in consequence , try as he will , he can not be entirely fair to our contem - porary empiricists .

		Even in his discussion of such poets as
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	and
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 203 amiable and even adulatory as -LRB- oddly enough -RRB- it sometimes is , one detects a fundamental per - plexity and lack of understanding .

		The trouble with this book is , then , at bottom , that while it has a rather intriguing appearance of being judicial , it is really , under the mask , highly idiosyncratic .

		This might be redeemed if Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	, in any part of his work , showed himself to be an interpreter possessed of subtlety or persuasiveness .

		Unfortunately that can not be said .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	has , to begin with , a singular incapacity for perceiving the real meaning of words .

		He uses words in an orotund , meaningless way ; words like `` essence , '' `` sub - stance , '' `` mystery , '' `` symbolism , '' are forever on his tongue .

		For this reason a great part of his book is thin reading ; it is often impossible , ex - cept through the exercise of considerable imag - ination , to get any meaning out of it whatever .

		It is possible indeed that his inability to associate words precisely with the ideas for which they stand is the central secret of Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's failure as a critic : the cloudy inaccuracy of style may well be simply another aspect of an attitude of mind which has determined his predilection for vaguely interpretative rather than judicial criticism .

		It may equally account for the ex - traordinary lack of discrimination which leads him to discuss , not so many kinds of art -LRB- which would be merely catholic -RRB- , but so many qualities of art , as if on one level of excellence .

		Brilliant , good , mediocre , and downright bad ; subtle and commonplace ; cerebral and sentimental , all are treated as of equal importance , and , apparently -LRB- as indicated by the last pair of contrasted terms -RRB- , without any keen awareness of their dif - ference .

		When he is beyond his depth , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	simply takes refuge in words .

		`` Every sense is evocative and intuitional , '' he says .

		`` Mysticism and wonder are the vital nerves which connect the outer world of reality with the inner world of spirit .

		Does it matter how the substance is shaped , so long as it is given a being ? ''

		This is mere word-blowing ; and Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's book is full of arguments equally ghostly .

		Shall we never learn that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural about poetry ; that it is a natural , organic product , with discoverable functions , clearly open to analysis ?

		It would be a pity if our critics and poets were to leave this to the scientists instead of doing it themselves .

		If we exclude her British suzerain , Americans are the most interested of Western nations in all that pertains to
India	LOCATION	.

		From the romantic days when swift Yankee clipper ships put the British out of competition for the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	trade , to the present war-time revival of Indian exports and larger imports , a consistent idealism has backed this interest : in Indian eyes
America	LOCATION	shed a dis - tant but kindly beneficence .

		American mission - aries have always outnumbered those of other Western nations , and they were the first to sub - stitute for a purely dogmatic religious platform the more effective educational wedge against heterogeneous
India	LOCATION	's caste-ridden masses .

		When famines visited those millions , recur - ring because of climatic and not administrative reasons , American largess promptly reached the field of suffering : during the epidemic of plague American missionaries , especially in the zenana , rendered valuable medical assistance .

		Nor has the acquisition of the
Philippines	LOCATION	changed or diverted this interest .

		That colonial adventure , with
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's clamant approval , merely identi - fied in the popular imagination both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, while an American vicereine at Simla later completed the sentimental rapprochement .

		Now that the Jones Bill has given the
Philippines	LOCATION	a political consciousness , the American experiment is the most practical example that has so far appeared for British assurance in their solution of
India	LOCATION	's immeasurably more complex problem .

		But it has remained for the epochal world-war to throw into flux all the facile cliches dispensed by Kipling about the isolation of East from West : they were no more erroneous than those Kipling scornfully attributed to his peripatetic members of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the superficial , ex - traneous differences have been dissipated by the economic interdependence that the war has called into existence .

		To-day
America	LOCATION	is importing from
India	LOCATION	far more than she ever did , more than she exports , even though these exports have increased because of the dislocation of European sources and channels .

		The future of this trade is assured , and its greatest benefit will be the reciprocal influences of the new social and polit - ical contact between East and
West	LOCATION	.

		The Orient was once a fruitful field of paradox and incon - gruity , whence the proteges of Cook drew abun - dant material for social impressions and 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	political generalizations .

		But the war has sown such incongruities and paradoxes liberally throughout Western civilizations , so that , iron - ically , West has become East in certain political and cultural aspects .

		Thus , in order to readjust our knowledge of the Orient , books like Professor
Mukerjee	PERSON	's are extremely valuable .

		That such books are com - ing from the pens of native scholars is the great - est compliment to the British educational system , even though that system is still hampered by the theoretical dogma of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's rhetoric .

		War - ren
Hastings	PERSON	has been released from
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's inaccurate , overdrawn picture , but the so-called literati of the Babu class are still being produced under the stupid minutes he once framed for Indian education .

		But Indian scholars are turn - ing their knowledge of rural and local conditions into useful surveys of the potentialities of
India	LOCATION	and her peoples .

		Hitherto they were academic - ally engrossed with her great past .

		Professor
Mukerjee	PERSON	is typical of the new school of Indian thinkers .

		He has sifted carefully the phenomena of change and decay in Indian institutions , reg - istered the perils arising from the conflict be - tween an ancient agrarian population and the disintegrating Western industrialism ; he makes an eloquent plea for those phases of an indigenous Indian economy upon which the life and soul of his people depends .

		The evils of overproduc - tion , wholesale extinction of hereditary arts and crafts , the exploitation of mill towns , are data familiar enough in the West , but they are freshly epidemic in the new Orient .

		It is encouraging to know that The Indian factory hand is primarily an agri - culturalist .

		His real home is in his native village , not in the city where he works .

		He leaves both wife and children behind him when he emigrates to the factory ' , and regularly returns to them to look after his family affairs and to rest from his labors .

		More than this , he can always find work in his village if he gets tired of the factory .

		So much for the family 's being , as in
China	LOCATION	, an effective economic unit .

		But I can not agree with the author in anticipating the continuance of caste on the grounds of a similar argument .

		It is true that caste has a societal cohesiveness , with all the fluid communalism he extols , but his statement regarding the flexibility of caste , of a sort of emancipation of the lower and depressed classes by virtue of adopting and practising a forbidden trade , is not true of the entire country .

		His observations are frequently limited to his native
Bengal	LOCATION	.

		But he has been at pains to pre - sent every trade and village industry of the country , and his illustrations are valuable .

		The only defect in his book is the absence of a nl < > for native names and expressions , especially since he quotes both the Hindi and the
Urdu	LOCATION	variants .

		There is no space to take up such fascinating subjects as the promise of the new rural credit and cooperative systems for
India	LOCATION	's future ; a ro - mance flickers about the native banking system , about the picturesque arts and crafts , and the guild system which , certain writers predict , will be revived among the smaller nationalities re - habilitated in
Europe	LOCATION	by the war and its after - math .

		Professor
Mukerjee	PERSON	warns against a blind adoption of Western industrial methods .

		His belief that
India	LOCATION	's economic structure has hitherto developed in keeping with her indigenous needs , and that it must so continue , will meet with ap - proval .


Japan	LOCATION	, as the pioneer , is now giving her
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	imitators a lesson in the way she is pain - fully recapitulating Western industrial and economic problems as a result of overproduction and meretricious `` booming '' : to her discredit she is dumping in
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	shoddy merchan - dise which must inevitably react in favor of
America	LOCATION	, her formidable competitor for the
East	LOCATION	- ern markets .

		With Professor
Mukerjee	PERSON	's intensive survey of
India	LOCATION	's potentialities , it is not Utopian to hope that
India	LOCATION	's economic contact with
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	will more and more reflect the genius of her fascinating races and their rich , manifold activities .

		One can only wish that the traditional panchdyat , or village council , had continued to exercise under the British aegis all its old administrative functions , instead of degenerating into a caste or trade guild .

		I believe that a resuscitation of the panchayat will justify its continuance , urged in
1818	DATE	by an able administrator like
Elphinstone	PERSON	, as a training-school for the autonomous govern - ment pledged to
India	LOCATION	by the British .

		Through this traditional vehicle of government
India	LOCATION	will come to full political stature , ready for eventual self-government ; but it would be futile , as the British already realize , to give her autonomy in her present incohesive , inarticulate condition .

		This , however , was not Professor
Mukerjee	PERSON	's theme .

		But none who knows her intimately will wish her any other future than one that is based upon such precious data from her historic past as are here evaluated by an Indian scholar , and as one who knows her personally I can wish her no better political future than is assured by her fair-minded if unimaginative British sponsor .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 205 The Problem of the Immigrant THE IMMIGRANT AND THE COMMUNITY .

		By
Grace Abbott	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Now that the long-debated question of im - migration exclusion is at least in a measure dis - posed of through legislation , the public mind may possibly find itself willing to turn toward a more sympathetic study of the immigrant .

		His - torically there has been so much feeling and so little calm consideration of the whole question of immigration that to most people there has seemed to be but one really significant problem : whether we should continue to admit to our doubtful hospitality such great masses of un - familiar peoples with different customs and habits and lower standards of living than our own .

		Miss
Abbott	ORGANIZATION	reminds us that we have in reality a much more pressing problem than this to deal with .

		How shall we learn to be neigh - borly with our immigrants at home ?

		How can we substitute justice for exploitation , sympathy for suspicion , and appreciation for derision and even hate ?

		In Miss Abbott these more neighborly atti - tudes were established long ago .

		As director of the
Immigrants ' Protective League of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and as a resident of
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	for many years , she has developed that intimate touch with the problems , the hopes , the disappointments , and the ways of thinking of the newcomers which ren - ders her perhaps as well fitted as anyone not an immigrant to interpret the people in her charge to the rest of the world .

		She is so sympathetic that some might call her partisan .

		Perhaps she is ; but certainly her partisanship is in the nature of a great moral protest against inexcusable evils of intolerance , race-prejudice , and economic and political exploitation .

		We need more such cry - ing out against this smugness of ours where other souls and bodies are at stake ; against our drift into a comfortable and complacent attitude of mind .

		Miss
Abbott	PERSON	's plea is for adjustment rather than assimilation .

		In this respect she disagrees with the textbook writers , and perhaps with most staunch Americans .

		She believes that the immi - grant brings a contribution to
America	LOCATION	which should be preserved ; that he is not merely a seeker after our treasures when they exist out - side the European peasant 's imagination .

		This contribution of hope and industry , of strength and purpose , of faith and power , which is so characteristic of the simple folk , she would un - cover and train into full flower for usefulness .

		Now we are accustomed to suppress it , to per - vert it , to turn its sweetness into bitterness be - cause of the hard face we turn and the relentless exploitation of the immigrant body which our cal - lous economic method demands .

		Often our un - regulated social institutions prove a snare rather than an aid to the unsophisticated immigrant , thus destroying his frugality and his sobriety .

		The troubles of the immigrant begin with the first touch of foot to our shores .

		The complex - ity of our street life and of our traffic weighs upon his simple rural mind .

		The extortions of the expressman and the small tradesman , the snare which the procurer sets for the helpless and friendless immigrant girl untrained in our lan - guage , the hard struggle for a job , often much more difficult than was expected or represented , the ever-present extortion of the labor agency , and the greed and bad faith of the contractor these are phases of our welcome to the immigrant almost as frequent as they are unexpected .

		Nor do we always improve upon a closer acquaint - ance .

		If our new neighbor prospers in a small way and wishes to send money home to depend - ent relatives or to aid some member of his family in joining him , the immigrant bank , which our political system permits to exist without due supervision and control , may defraud him of his savings .

		If he enters the courts , he is almost certain to find a prejudice against him there , which , if it does not pervert justice , may at least deny it because of lack of sufficient interest in the suppliant on the part of the court .

		Dis - honest lawyers and notaries make him their easy prey because of his unfamiliarity with our lan - guage and with the tricks of our laissez-faire social , political , and economic systems .

		In other ways , if somewhat less tangibly , the immigrant suffers from our neglect .

		In the matter of public health and morals he does not so much create new problems as complicate old ones .

		His lack of urban habits of mind and body makes it all the more necessary to hedge him about with safe - guards and leadership .

		The immigrant woman especially is the victim of the incompetence of the midwife , who in
America	LOCATION	lacks training and supervision .

		In the matter of education we have been lax and non-understanding with the immigrant .

		We have not sufficiently realized that his peculiar problems of economic and political adjustment call for more vocational and citizenship training than our but half-consciously organized schools are accustomed to give .

		Indeed , it might be much better for the native youth if they had 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 1	DATE	.

		?

		more of this sort of training in place of the highly traditionalized curriculum to which they are so often subjected .

		Frequently the immi - grant comes to us with good native attitudes but with a lack of experience in political affairs .

		Too often his first insight into our public callousness , the lack of democracy and efficiency in our re - puted democracy , saddens and disgusts him .

		Here we lose a good citizen .

		We need more sympathetic leadership and organization of immi - grant life on its public-interests and contacts side .

		One of the most interesting of
Miss Abbott	LOCATION	's many pertinent suggestions regarding immigrant adjustment is that we organize more carefully the potentialities for the development of an in - ternational understanding through immigration into this country and return migration .

		Emotionalism and ff ^ ar LETTERS AND DIARY OF ALAK SEEGER .

		-LRB-
Charles Scribncr	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Enough has possibly been said about the gen - eral disappointment in
Alan Seeger	PERSON	's `` Letters and Diary '' ; practically every critic who has reviewed the book has said something to that effect .

		As is the way with critics , however , they have all said the same thing :
Seeger	PERSON	's letters and diary are disappointing because they are not what was expected from a young , romantic poet .

		They prove with disconcerting flatness the truism that no poet is a poet all the time ; they even prove that some poets are less than poets most of the time .

		Seeger 's letters and diary -LRB- if one excepts the letters written consciously for publication and therefore with more attention to con - tent and style -RRB- consist for the most part of the commonplace details of soldier life , repeated many times without personal or enlivening com - ment and with only too few descriptions of com - panions or scenery .

		The greater portion of the book , including even the letters to the newspa - pers , is ordinary , quite like the many books from the hands of mere journalists .

		There is another , smaller , but far more im - portant part of the volume that is also disap - pointing , and in inverse ratio to its size ; it is the part , or parts , where the poet does write and where , therefore , his philosophy of life ap - pears .


Alan Seeger	PERSON	was narrow-minded .

		It might be said , paradoxically , that he was nar - row-minded in a broad way , for he happened to be warped on the side of those issues in life which are popularly called `` big '' and `` great . ''

		But to be convinced that he was incapable of genuine sympathy with many alien points of view one needs only to read the letters .

		In the poems this attitude had been discovered , the letters probably only emphasize it .

		In Sonnet XI , `` On Returning to the Front After Leave , '' he says : ... we turn disdainful backs On that poor world we scorn yet die to shield That world of cowards , hypocrites and fools .

		It is not ungenerous to find that disappointing .

		The tone of the letters is not quite so harsh ; the demands of rhyme and metre may take their share of the blame , but the attitude is the same and it is consistently held .

		`` I pity the poor civilians '' sums up his feeling toward those who , for no matter what reason , were not directly concerned with the war .

		But as in times of peace there is nothing better then love and art , so in times of war there is noth - ing better than fighting and one must make the best of it , finding recompense in feeling one 's heart pulse in concert with those of the eMite who are doing the inost admirable thing , rather than with those of the multitude who are concerned with second-best things ... Great as are the pleasures that -LSB- the poor civilians -RSB- are continuing to enjoy and that we have renounced , the sense of being the instrument of Destiny is to me a source of greater satisfaction .

		... Killed , more than any other man , -LSB- the sol - dier -RSB- can face the unknown without misgiving ... If
Alan Seeger	PERSON	had meant that some of us are forced to be content with second-best things , that would have been sympathetic and his poetry and letters would be more satisfying to the poor civilian .

		But we are `` concerned with second - best things , '' and a reading of the letters shows that we are so from pure mediocrity .

		The sense of `` being the instrument of Destiny '' comes to many a man , and many more women , who will never see a trench , and why the soldier faces the unknown with any less misgiving than other men is not clear .

		It is undoubtedly a glorious thing to be a soldier , especially so truly and thoroughly a soldier as was
Seeger	PERSON	.

		He is fas - cinating and admirable perhaps more for that reason than because he was a poet .

		And while to criticize him for having his point of view would be only to borrow his own narrow-mind - edness , it is perfectly permissible to criticize him for his inability to see that the world is full of other views , no less noble and commendable .

		Seeger 's is ' so largely a mere expression of his emotions that annoyance becomes the dominant reaction as one reads .

		He was tired of ordinary existence , that existence which demands the best
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 207 powers of mind and soul .


Victor Chapman	PERSON	, in his `` Letters from
France	LOCATION	, '' says : `` Remember
Alan Seeger	PERSON	was an appalling wreck before the war . ''

		No matter what this means , it throws a helpful light on one 's reading of the letters .

		He seems to have been satiated , for he calls `` a dia - bolical cry , a blood-curdling yell of mockery and exultation '' which came from the hillside of the
Boches	PERSON	one night , an `` antidote to civilization of which this war can offer so many to the searcher after extraordinary sensations . ''

		Search - ing for extraordinary sensations echoes discour - agingly of Oscar Wilde and his group ; it is certainly not the sort of thing that helps the civilian to live his life more worthily .

		Seeger does speak now and then in tones which remind the reader of the youth who wrote `` I Have a Rendezvous with Death . ''

		There are even paragraphs sufficiently penetrating to bal - ance his superficial emotionalism : There is a common bourgeois notion which , asso - ciated with the common bourgeois ideal of a man finally making enough money to be able to retire and live on his income , pictures the happy life as a kind of steady progression through a series of ups and downs toward a kind of plateau , the summit of which once attained , he can thereafter march along tranquilly on a level of unbroken and in - destructible well-being .

		It is perfectly clear that such a notion is entirely illusory , in the multiple accidents to which life is susceptible , for even sup - posing that he has attained such a level by the realiza - tion of every other earthly ambition , he is always walking on the unstable brink of the love that he has created for himself and upon which he is de - pendent , the crumbling of which beneath his feet by death or abandonment would immediately plunge him into the blackest abysses , where everything else that he had realized would mean nothing .

		As for myself , I look upon life as a series of ups and downs , right up -LRB- or down -RRB- to the very end .

		The idea of being any higher at the end than at the beginning was never part of my reveries .

		I never conceived the advent of a moment when turbulence and strife could be thought of as put definitely behind one .

		But I clung passionately to , and drank deep of , such moments of happiness as circumstances set before me the importance to me was the moment that joy rescued from oblivion and for me the measure of a happy life was simply the proportion in which the sum-total of these moments of happiness , scattered indiscriminately through it , outbalanced the sum-total of the unhappy ones .

		And that is wisdom , the very sort that will help the poor civilian with his ups and downs .

		That
Alan Seeger	PERSON	wrote so little of it may have been due to the external circumstances of a life at best none too conducive to thoughtfulness , but the unfortunate fact remains that his letters and diary show few such oases .

		Lucid Mystics THE OXFORD BOOK OF ENGLISH MYSTICAL VERSE .

		Chosen by

A. H. E. Lee	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The slowly growing series of the
Oxford Books of Verse	ORGANIZATION	has from its inception been one of the necessaries of life to every lover of poetry .

		With the single exception of Palgrave 's `` Golden Treasury '' no other anthologies of such uni - formly high merit have been published .

		-LRB- In passing , let us express a fervent wish that the Delegates of the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	may issue an `` Oxford Book of American Verse '' in recogni - tion of our alliance with
England	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		`` The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse '' maintains the standards set by its pre - decessors , but the reviewer of it faces one pecu - liar difficulty that of definition .

		What is mystical verse ?

		None but a
German Doctor of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	would dare attempt sharply to de - fine it , especially when the editors of the collec - tion frankly shirk the task .

		They say : Our conception of mysticism must be found in the poetry we have gathered together .

		But it may serve as a ground for comprehension to say that in mak - ing our selection we have been governed by a desire to include only such poems and extracts from poems as contain intimations of a consciousness wider and deeper than the normal .

		This is the connecting link between them the thread , as it were , on which the individual pieces are strung .

		It is less a ques - tion of a common subject than of a common stand - point and in some sense a common atmosphere , and our attempt has been to steer a middle course between the twin dangers of an uninspired piety on the one hand and mere intellectual speculation on the other ... When we abandon the hopeless effort at defini - tion and turn to the contents of the book , we find selections from more than one hundred and fifty poets , ranging in date from
Richard Rolle	PERSON	of Hampole to
John Masefield	PERSON	and
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	and in religion from
Francis Thompson	PERSON	to
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- ojini
Nayadu	ORGANIZATION	and
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	.

		The dis - tribution of the poems in point of time is interesting .

		Five-sixths of them more than five-sixths , if we count
Blake	PERSON	among the nine - teenth century poets are the product of that nineteenth century which its own prophets de - nounced as materialistic and skeptical beyond all previous epochs , of this twentieth century which , we were told before the war , was wholly given over to fads and superficiality .

		Of the poems from earlier centuries which have been deemed worthy of a place in this collection , far more than half are the work of five men
Donne	PERSON	,
Herbert	LOCATION	,
Crashaw	LOCATION	,
Vaughan	PERSON	, and
Traherne	PERSON	.

		Contemplation of these facts awakens a dreadful 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	qualm of doubt .

		Is it possible that we have over - looked some vital elements in our glib catalogu - ing of nineteenth century tendencies ; that even
Early Victorian England	LOCATION	is still too near at hand for its whole significance to be evident ?

		Sins of omission are the usual refuge of the reviewer of an anthology .

		Because the major - ity of the poems included are the work of men of established fame his fault-finding propensities are curbed ; he lacks the courage to attack that which public opinion has pronounced good , and therefore pitches into the editors for omitting work which he himself has approved of .

		Such procedure would be especially easy in dealing with anything so indefinable as mystical verse in fact , it is too easy to be worth doing .

		For the sake , however , of keeping up a useful tradi - tion , we may express a slight surprise that no place has been found for
Whittier	LOCATION	among the American poets included .

		Emerson and Whit - man are generously represented , and there are characteristic poems by
Madison Cawein	PERSON	,
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, Father
Tabb	PERSON	, and others .

		Among the work of living Englishmen we could wish that room had been made for
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's strange `` Prayer of
Miriam Cohen	PERSON	'' and for more of
G. K. Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		His `` Holy of Holies '' is given , but we miss `` The Beatific Vi - sion '' and other poems in which the most robust and controversial of modern mystics declares his faith .

		The thought of
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	awakens us to a realization of the most remarkable feature of most of the poems in this collection their clar - ity .

		Their mystical quality is due to elevation of thought , not to woolly-mindedness .

		Some poets are vague and mysterious simply because they can not or will not think clearly , but most of the writers here represented are as lucid and uncon - fused as
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		Only rarely notably in
Aleister Crowley	PERSON	's `` The Quest , '' every stanza of which requires at least one footnote to explain its symbolic meaning do we feel that the poet is overdoing the thing .

		The true mystic can make his vision plain without footnotes .

		For the present reviewer the reading of this volume has had at least one permanent result .

		A vague impression as to the identity of the two greatest lyrics other than elegies in the Eng - lish language has been changed to a certainty .

		Every poem in this collection is thoughtful and sincere , many are in the highest sense inspired , but the two which tower above every rival as Shakespeare towers above all other English dram - atics are the `` Ode on the Intimations of Im - mortality '' and `` The Hound of Heaven . ''

		After rereading them in direct comparison with all the best English verse of a similar nature , we lay the book aside with the conviction not only that they represent the highest flight of sustained lyric inspiration in nineteenth century poetry but that they are the most perfect religious poems in the whole range of our literature .

		Another Irish Dramatist FIVE PLAYS .

George Fitzmaurice	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		It is quite the fashion to cast slurs at the later Irish dramatists .

		I hold no brief for the manu - facturers of folk-melodrama after the school of
Lennox Robinson	PERSON	; but it seems to me mean - spirited to ignore the peculiar handicaps under which contemporary Irish playwrights work , and unjust to close our eyes to any possible merits in their plays .


William Boyle	PERSON	and
Lady Gregory	PERSON	,
Padraic Colum	PERSON	,
Yeats	PERSON	, and
Synge	PERSON	have left a perilous legacy .

		Their successors must be very able to carry forward even their ordinary efforts .

		More - over , a change has come over Irish drama .

		Since
1908	DATE	the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, its very heart , has of necessity been commercialized .

		It has become a huckster trading in any catchy Irish play , writ - ten in any Irish dialect , by any dramatist with a good Irish name .

		Real Irish dramatists are peculiarly at the mercy of the Irish theatre , for the best folk-drama withers and loses its savor transplanted to a strange stage .

		I am not framing an apology for the plays of
George Fitzmaurice	PERSON	, for they need none ; but to judge fairly any dramatist , especially a real Irish dramatist , we must remember his dramatic traditions and the stage and public for which he writes .

		Mr.
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	is a connecting link between the earlier and the later writers of the Irish dramatic movement .

		In his technique , he is a contemporary Irish dramatist ; in his simpler point if view and freer imagination , he is a true son of the pioneers .

		His vivid dialogue and char - acter-drawing surpass most contemporary work .

		For sheer beauty , either of thought or expres - M'OII .

		he does not equal his predecessors .

		As a
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL realist , he writes in the modern vein ; as a fan - tast , in the spirit of the earlier men .

		His realistic plays have simple plots .

		`` The Country Dressmaker '' is the story of
Julia Shea	PERSON	, who for ten years has kept a romantic troth with
Pats Connor	PERSON	, her girlhood lover who emigrated to
America	LOCATION	.

		Pats , having long since forgotten
Julia	PERSON	, returns to
Ireland	LOCATION	and , upon hearing the story of her faith , resolves to live up to her ideal .

		Even the complications to this simple plot , fur - nished by the schemes of an influential neighbor who angles for Pats 's American-made fortune with his two daughters , are quite obvious , and their obviousness is accentuated by the fact that the two Clohesy girls and their parents are cari - catures rather than characters .

		This fault mars other plays .

		Mr.
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	is given to sketch - ing his lesser people in a few bold strokes with - out enough background to furnish us with true portraits .

		When he does take pains , however , he can draw a splendidly rounded character .

		It is the careful character-studies of
Eugene Guerin	PERSON	, his parents , and his uncle ,
Malachi Cantillon	PERSON	, that save his other long play , `` The Moonlight - er , '' from being merely an agrarian melodrama of the type made familiar by Ray ,
Murray	PERSON	,
Casey	PERSON	, and the rest .

		In this play , too , are some of the most delicious bits of dialect , a feature of Mr.
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	's work that Irish critics have praised , not for its faithfulness in detail , but for its true , vivid spirit .

		An American can ap - preciate this criticism when he reads the `` Yankee - isms '' employed by
Pats Connor	PERSON	.

		His `` I reckon I can corroborate Mr.
Quilter	PERSON	's remarks '' is not a speech of
Mister Dooley	PERSON	, but to a
Dublin	LOCATION	audience it would sound more typically Irish - American .

		It is in his three short plays that Mr.
Fitz	PERSON	- maurice is at his best .

		`` The Pie-Dish '' is a convincing study of struggle for artistic expres - sion , cast in a realistic and startlingly unusual mold .

		Old
Leum Donoghue	PERSON	, a peasant , has worked for twenty years modelling a pie dish .

		When his masterpiece is nearly done , he is stricken .

		His family call the priest , but the artist thrusts the priest aside to finish his work .

		He feels death near and in agony prays to God for time .

		Heaven failing him , he calls on the Devil and drops dead , his precious pie dish slipping from his hands to break on the floor .

		Mr.
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	's two highly imaginative plays , `` The Magic Glasses '' and `` The Dandy Dolls , '' are strangely akin to the realistic `` Pie - Dish . ''

		The efforts of
Jaymony Shanahan	PERSON	's fam - ily to save him from the spell of the magic spec - tacles with which he retires to the loft to see glorious visions are reminiscent of the efforts of old
Leum	PERSON	's daughters to save him from damna - tion ; and his prosaic pie dish , which Death will not let him finish , is a forerunner of the be - witched dolls of
Roger Carmody	PERSON	, whose wind - pipes , as soon as he finishes making them , are always stolen away by the Hag 's Son .

		These last two plays are pure fantasies , dealing with wierd , supernatural forces , not lightly or tim - idly , but firmly and boldly .

		As a result they have a dramatic intensity that more delicate , sug - gestive fantasies
Yeats	PERSON	's `` The Land of Heart 's Desire , '' for example lack .

		They prove their author to be a master-dramatist of Celtic phan - tasmagoria .

		These `` Five Plays '' justify the hope that , if only the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	will cease trying to be a Hibernian branch of
Drury Lane	ORGANIZATION	, it can still produce real Irish dramatists .

		To-day 's reciprocal obligations in regard to culture continue to multiply .

		This is one of the pleasure-pains of cosmopolitanism .

		Mr.
Fenol	PERSON	- losa 's records of his conversations with the re - viver of the classical drama of
Japan	LOCATION	tell how he gave the ancient man a brief account of the classic drama of
Greece	LOCATION	: `` he already knew , '' adds this
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	adventurer into the lore of the
East	LOCATION	, `` something about opera . ''

		Now , if the Oriental shows a disposition to familiarize him - self with
Euripides	LOCATION	and
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	to say nothing of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, and Oscar Wilde shall we not exert ourselves in turn , and show a willingness to go beyond
Hokusai	PERSON	and Hiroshige ?

		The `` Noh '' drama , as shaped in
the fifteenth century	DATE	and saved through
Japan	LOCATION	's transition to the new day , is the complete negation of all literalism and of the merely mimetic .

		It scorns both .

		It relates to the well-known school of the Danjuros about as the classical school of Chinese painting relates to the color-prints of 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	Ukiyo-ye .

		It is noble , not plebeian ; spiritistic , not realistic : it squares with the fundamental principles of all good art , rather than with the thoughtless passing fashion of any particular day .

		Fenollosa , on his death , left a large body of notes and translations concerned with this school of drama .

		Most of his material was got , first hand , from
Umewaka Minoru	PERSON	, descendant of a long line of esteemed actors , who made it the work of his later years to rescue the ancient and honorable traditions of the classic stage from the shock which , in
1868	DATE	, inaugurated the era of Meiji .

		This mass of material passed into the hands of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, whose treatment of it is briefly explained in his `` Note . ''

		Says he : `` The vision and the plan are
Fenollosa 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the prose I had had but the part of literary executor ; in the plays my work has been that of translator who has found all the heavy work done for him and who has had but the pleasure of arranging beauty into the words . ''

		Gather his method from a passage in one of the fifteen short pieces which the book presents , that called `` Nishikigi '' -LRB- The Love-Charm Wands -RRB- .

		Here is
Fenollosa	PERSON	's prose : It is strange , seeing these town-people here .

		I might suppose them two married people ; and what the lady gives herself the trouble of carrying might be a piece of cloth woven from birds ' feathers , and what the man has is a sword , painted red .

		It is indeed queer merchandise .

		Here is Pound 's verse : Strange indeed , seeing these town-people here , They seem like man and wife , And the lady seems to be holding something Like a cloth woven of feathers , While he has a staff or a wooden sceptre Beautifully ornate .

		Both of these things are strange ; In any case , I wonder what they call them .

		This play , `` Nishikigi , '' though -LRB- like most of the others -RRB- largely spiritistic , should easily be intelligible to the Western mind : it has a `` love interest '' which ought to help us take hold and feel at home .

		A `` wandering priest , a standard character in `` Noh , '' meets two ghosts in ancient attire in a remote village .

		They tell their story .

		The man , for three years , had offered charm - sticks , those `` crimson tokens of love , ''
night after night	TIME	, and finally died of despair .

		The woman , oblivious or ignorant , or from mere coquetry , had sat at her weaving within her house .

		The man was buried in a cave , with all his wands .

		The woman repented of her cruelty if such it was and died also .

		The two have been dead for a century , and have not yet been united .

		The priest visits the cave .

		But the night is too cold for sleep , and he enters upon a ritual before the cave 's mouth .

		His warm respect for the old tale begins to produce its effect .

		The lovers come to life within the illuminated cavern , a kindly chorus cooperates with the priest , and the lovers finally accomplish a spirit union before the final moment which prophesies a void waste `` a wild place , unlit , and unfilled . ''

		Considering the `` Noh '' in its essence , the ancient and loyal Japanese historian should have had little difficulty with the Greek drama , what - ever headway he may or may not have made with the opera .

		For the two stages , the two schools , have much in common .

		Each had an independent growth from miracle playsone from the plays of the worship of Bacchus , the other from the plays of the worship of Buddha and of the Shinto deities ; each prefers to deal with a tale or legend already well known ; each accomplishes a wide generalization that rises gravely and scornfully above the petty mimetics and realisms of the day ; each employs a chorus ; each involves danc - ing , and each practices a play-sequence , the Greeks , one of four parts and the Japanese , one of six , which last presents , as Mr.
Pound	PERSON	phrases it , `` a complete service of life . ''

		The mere dialogue is but one feature among several ; the singing and the dancing must always be con - sidered if one is to reach a clear understanding and a complete aesthetic appreciation .

		The order , as shown by
Fenollosa	PERSON	's notes , is this : a congratulatory piece , or ceremonial address to the gods ; a battle-piece , with due mind - fulness for the emperors ; a `` wig-piece '' for females ; a spirit-piece , since the spirits form the vague but lasting background of man 's transi - tory and tristful experiences ; a moral piece , inculcating the various virtues ; lastly , another congratulatory piece , to call down blessings on the lords present , on the actors themselves , and on the scene of their endeavors .

		Thus the cycle is closed .

		Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, in his notes and comments , writes with his usual unceremonious directness : if he is sometimes rugged , blunt , and downright , one at least gets a strong sense of primary impact from a man who is duly , even vastly , concerned .

		And as the volume is made by the Clarks , of Edin - burgh , a `` serious '' house , one notes , with grati - fication , an almost complete suppression of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's tendency toward typographical wilful - nesses and eccentricities .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 211 Primitive Emotion HELEN OF FOUR GATES .

		By An Ex-Mill-Girl -LRB-
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The attempt to express primitive emotion in - tensified and made vivid by circumstance is al - most the severest test that an author can undergo .

		He must either succeed or he must fail abjectly .

		And if he has the power to succeed , his novel may fail of a hundred estimable qualities ; it at least has truth .

		Of course the supreme example of this expression is `` Tess , '' and only in less degree Hardy 's other works , `` The Woodlanders '' in particular .

		That works of such epic sweep should come irresistibly to one 's mind throughout the reading of this novel by an unknown author is a sufficient proof of its power .

		``
Helen	PERSON	of Four Gates '' is set in the aged moors of the Druid country , in
north Lancashire	LOCATION	one imagines , where among the respectable little lives of the villagers it seems more possible than elsewhere for some spirit to gleam out who has absorbed in her veins all the passionate heritage of the land , which turns life so easily and so in - evitably into tragedy .

		For `` she were made to live an ' love , an ' give an ' take , more 'n most , as if to make her suffer more . ''

		That was
Helen	PERSON	.

		`` My father did n't bring me up like a turtle - dove , '' she herself said .

		`` An ' I 'd no saints wi ' leets round their heads , an ' faces like they 'd no blood ... I 'm made the other way , somehow allus th ' other way runnin ' after what should run after me , runnin ' awa ' fro ' what I should run to . ''

		In short , it is pure , undisciplined nature that the author represents in a threefold struggle ; first , against the respectability and pride grafted upon her own nature by its contact with Four Gates ; secondly , against the hatred and cruelty personified in the man she had been told to call her father ; thirdly , against the cold human rea - son of the man who loved her and whose fear of inherited madness in her was a stronger thing than his love .

		It is something more than a merely human struggle that the author has represented , consciously or not .

		It is the eternal struggle of all elemental , living things to maintain their birthright to freedom of expression in living terms .

		This is the truth that the `` Ex-Mill - Girl '' makes you feel .

		She has run a certain amount of danger in making you feel it , but a danger that you leave unrealized in the reading .

		The fact stands that we take her
Helen	PERSON	as she is revealed to us .

		There are other fine things about the novel besides its truth , but I think that they are subor - dinate to it , probably derived from it .

		The author has built her book , you feel , out of her own emo - tion , perfectly controlled .

		She herself must have experienced to an unusual degree the sense of a common heritage with all sentient and growing things .

		She gives you with a deep , intuitive understanding the life of the countryside in its moods of blustering , desolate darkness when `` night with a laugh of anarchy blotted out the symbols of law and order , gave infinity for acres , reclaimed for a short time the wild that was half tame , and lent a sense that here fierce dark deeds had been done , and might be done again '' ; or when it turns its face to morning and to laugh - ter in the dawn of another day `` in a world that knows nothing but the present '' ; or in the envel - oping mantle of still snow when everything hu - man that is not outcast turns to glowing fires in the well-swept kitchens , to baking things and drowsiness .

		All human desires and actions are pointed and often in reality swayed by these throbbing and cruelly unconscious changes upon the face of things .

		They were so much a part of
Helen	PERSON	that to have transplanted her from her hills would have been like uprooting the heather and the furze .

		The denouement , however , is distinctly disap - pointing , below the level of the rest .

		The author has prepared us through her pictures of old Ma - son 's cruelty to his `` daughter , '' through the har - rowing months when the prospect of
Martin	ORGANIZATION	's desertion is growing into a dread certainty , through her year of marriage to
Mason	ORGANIZATION	's willing tool , for a tragedy that seems as inevitable and as complete as one of
Hardy 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book would have ended better with
Helen	PERSON	and
Martin	PERSON	wait - ing on the hillside in the dawn for their doom than with all the fortuitous accidents , deaths , and recoveries that give it its unearned happy ending .

		Such an ending , constitutes , indeed , a heavy drain upon the resources of the gods of chance .

		One hopes it was not a concession to the gods of credulity that rule our modern mar - ket .

		For the qualities I liked best in this story were qualities that are not modern that make a story , whether it is a year or a hundred years old , live in our memories for its truth and its humor and its imagination , that give it poignancy and distinction .

September 13	DATE	BKIF.FS ON XEW BOOKS WHY
ITALY	LOCATION	ENTERED INTO THE GREAT WAR .

		By
Luigi Carnovale	PERSON	.

		Italian-Amer -
ican Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		A work of marked value for the study of one phase of the present world-conflict is Luigi Car - novale 's bi-lingual volume , `` Why
Italy	LOCATION	Entered into the Great War , '' or , in its other form , `` Perche 1 ` Italia e Entrata
Nella Grande Guerra	PERSON	. ''

		The author 's concern is with the particular angle of the struggle that involves
Italy	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, and his book is essentially a defence of
Italy	LOCATION	's course .

		Each of the two corresponding sections of this large endeavor is in four parts .

		The first part deals with recent history with the relations be - tween
Italy	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	for the past century and portrays in detail the arrogances , injustices , and inhumanities of the long Austrian domina - tion .

		The second part comprises a longer his - torical retrospect one of two thousand years and is designed to prove the essentially Italian character of the borderlands in dispute between the two countries .

		The third part gives an ac - count of the diplomatic doings which immediately preceded the declaration of war a complete and compact presentation of the actual documents .

		The fourth and concluding part gives the rea - sons a dozen or so which justified
Italy	LOCATION	in breaking with the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	and in join - ing
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		One feature of the book a feature illustra - tively picturesque is a plate giving in facsimile the famous `` Tavola Clesiana , '' a bronze tablet which was discovered at Cles , in mid-Tyrol , in
1869	DATE	.

		This tablet contains a decree of the Em - peror
Claudius	PERSON	,
A. D. 49	PERSON	, determining the essen - tially Italian character of the inhabitants of that region .

		The find was viewed in situ by
Theodor Mommsen	PERSON	, who published a pamphlet on it and declared himself convinced that the district of Trent was Italian and properly belonged to
Roman Italy	LOCATION	.

		The proofs with regard to
Trieste	LOCATION	and to the strong Italian affiliation of the
Trien	PERSON	- tines are equally cogent , as presented by the author .

		If the same were the case with the Triestine hinterland -LRB- which is predominantly Slav -RRB- , the question of
Italia Irredenta	ORGANIZATION	might be much simplified .

		Mr.
Carnovale	PERSON	, who has a reputation as a journalist both in
Italy	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, is one of the younger school of radical reformers .

		He is against not only the
Papacy	LOCATION	but also the
House of Savoy	ORGANIZATION	; and against not only the
House of Savoy	ORGANIZATION	but also the capitalistic forces which -LRB- as depicted by
Anatole France	LOCATION	in his `` He des Penguins '' -RRB- often take an undue part in orig - inating and in furthering wars .

		As a resident of
Chicago	LOCATION	, he casts his eye not only over the Great War , but over some of the lesser wars which , in our own city and country , have been caused by economic injustice .

		He pronounces the pres - ent war `` the logical and natural epilogue of the evils committed by the privileged class during its long dominion over the world , '' and looks for - ward hopefully to a better day guided by better men .

		ITALY AT WAR .

		By
Alexander Powell	PERSON	.

		Scribner 's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In his latest book Mr.
Alexander Powell	PERSON	has unreservedly adopted
Davis	PERSON	's maxim `` to use similes that the man at home can understand .

		If
China	LOCATION	is not home bring it there . ''

		He says that
Verdun	LOCATION	looked `` as though it had been \ is - ited simultaneously by the
San Francisco	LOCATION	earth - quake , the
Baltimore	LOCATION	fire , and the
Johnstown	LOCATION	flood . ''

		He speaks of lunching in the under - ground citadel as being like eating `` in a
New York	LOCATION	subway station . ''

		While this trick has a tendency to become tiresome , Mr.
Powell	PERSON	de - serves little but praise for the way in which he has presented the outstanding features of the Italian campaign its political preparation , its division into the four great theatres , the novel methods introduced by warfare on the roof of the world , the blasting of trenches in ice and rock , the communication by means of the tele - ferica , the cable lines by which men , munitions , and food must be swung aloft to the front lines .

		That the Italian line when straightened is longer than the entire western front , that the Italians alone of the allies are now fighting almost en - tirely upon enemy ground , and that they have gained this position through forcing their way upward in the face of a superior enemy all these facts exhibit the sturdy determination of the people who are fighting for
Italia Irredenta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Theirs has been a stupendous task , a task that no people without national imagination and adaptability could have contemplated .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	adds chapters on the British in
France	LOCATION	, the French at
Verdun	LOCATION	, the Russians in Champagne , and the re-formed Belgian army in
Flanders	LOCATION	.

		He has a talent for collecting inter - esting scraps of information and adapting tech - nical details of artillery or aviation to the com - prehension of the uninitiated .

Cravath	PERSON	's short account of `` Great

		Already familiar to readers of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times , '' these short , crisp chapters now appeal to a still larger public ; and at the present juncture , unforeseen when they were written , they will have a peculiar interest and may teach a useful lesson .

		`` We shall doubtless continue , '' concludes the author , `` to hear much of blunders that
England	LOCATION	is making and of blun - ders that she is not making , but some day the world will wake up to a realization that
England	LOCATION	and her allies have won the war .

		Even then the critics in and out of

		A STUDENT IN ARMS .

		Second Series .

		By
Donald Hankey	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` A Student in Arms '' proved that war litera - ture need be neither journalistic nor sentimental .

		Mr.
Hankey	PERSON	's `` Second Series '' of the book fur - ther shows the effect of the war on a nature that was singularly refined , instinctively timid , but victorious over the common dangers and fears and vulgarities of soldiering not by reason of any dulling of the sensibilities , but rather through a determined calm and an undistorted insight into the true values of life at the front .

		This view enabled Mr.
Hankey	PERSON	to understand and to con - demn the weaknesses of his fellow-men without condemning their too natural manifestation .

		It enabled him to appreciate the full horror of trench life with its perpetual and exhausting strain without becoming pessimistic over the tem - porary necessity for such things nor their final result .

		He could not bring himself `` to loathe militarism in all its forms , '' for he appreciated the good side of militarism , which is the laying down of the trifling search for self-realization .

		`` For though the part of the great push that it fell to my lot to see was not a successful part , '' he wrote , `` it was none the less a triumph a spir - itual triumph .

		The war correspondent can only describe the outside of things .

		We who are in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, who know the men as individuals , who have talked with them , joked with them , censored their letters , worked with them , we see below the surface ... The man has become humble , but in proportion the soldier has be - come exceeding proud .

		He has learnt to sacri - fice everything which belongs to him individu - ally to a cause that is far greater than any per - sonal ambitions of his own can ever be . ''

		To recognize romance when it comes disguised in the form of an urgent demand for a quiet life , is a thing that few of us can compass .

		It is the thing that makes all the difference in the world between Mr.
Hankey	PERSON	's book and most of the others .

		THE WAR AFTER THE WAR .

		By
Isaac F. Marcosson	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The picture that Mr.
Marcosson	PERSON	here paints is depressing .

		But it provokes thought , and thereby serves its purpose .

		The picture is that of the nations of the world locked in deadly commercial contest after the present titanic con - flict of arms shall have ceased .

		After the war will begin in ' earnest , we are told , the struggle for markets , for shipping , and for industrial ad - vantage .

		`` Embattled commercial groups will supplant embroiled nations ; boycotts , discrimina - tions , and exclusions will succeed the strategies of line and trench ; the animosities fought out today with shell and steel will have their heri - tage in ruthless rivalries . ''

		The point to the volume is obvious : the
United States	LOCATION	will be subjected to an economic competition such as she has never known ; she will pass almost instantly from the exceptionally favored position she occupied during the first two years and a half of the war to a position in which every trader 's hand will be against her ; she must lose no time in calculating her future policies , and in matching military with economic preparedness .

		Mr.
Marcosson	PERSON	wrote before the
United States	LOCATION	entered the war , and on the as - sumption that she would not be drawn in .

		But his major thesis is not notably affected by the change of circumstances .

		His argument is , on the whole , plausible ; and he states it in a
Sunday	DATE	- supplement style which may be expected to give his book a considerable vogue .

		The danger of commercial isolation and decadence of the
United States	LOCATION	seems , however , exaggerated .

		It is true that war is waste , that `` some one must pay , '' and that the embattled nations will be feverishly anxious after peace is restored to re - build their industries , rehabilitate their shipping , and regain or extend their foreign markets .

		But for some time a very great portion of the ener - gies of reconstruction will have to be expended at home ; sheer exhaustion will hold back com - mercial operations abroad .

		It is not clear that the relative position of the
United States	LOCATION	, even if she herself is somewhat weakened by war , will be greatly altered .

		Three years ago she was in many respects commercially backward .

		Her manufacturers , merchants , and bankers were only beginning to awaken to their lack of progressiveness in meeting the competi - tion of German , French , and British capital .

		Mr.
Marcosson	PERSON	's admonition to American pro- ducers and traders to bestir themselves is to the point .

		But so it would have been , in almost equal degree , before the war began .

		Readable sketches of
Lloyd George	PERSON	and the doughty Aus - tralian premier ,
William Hughes	PERSON	, are fairly dragged in ; but they close the volume pleasantly .

		The author examines German the - ories of international law as they are expounded by the jurists , as they are formulated in the Ger - man military code , and as they have been applied in practice during the present war .

		These the - ories embrace such doctrines as that might makes right , that in war the end justifies the means , that the rights of belligerents are older than those of neutrals and must take precedence , that the employment of all means that will contribute to the attainment of the object of the war is permissible , and so on .

		All these and similar ideas the author condemns , and he justly remarks that it is the glory of the human race from its earliest origins to have striven to restrict as far as possible the uncontrolled sway of violence and brute force .

		As violence and terrorism in war are a part of the German military code , so imperialism is one of its dominating political ambitions .

		On the pretense that
Germany	LOCATION	must have `` a place in the sun '' the pan-German propagandists are advocating the forcible absorption of all terri - tories belonging to other nations , and this move - ment
M. Dampierre	ORGANIZATION	examines in detail .

		A large part of his book is devoted to a study of the German policy of spoliation and terrorism in
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and on the basis of evi - dence gathered from German sources , especially from diaries kept by German soldiers in accord - ance with the field-service regulations , M. Dam - pierre convicts the Germans of numerous atroci - ties which their government has repeatedly de - nied .

		Facsimile reproductions of extracts from many of these incriminating diaries are pub - lished by the author and their authenticity would seem to be beyond question .

		RUSSIA OF YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW .

		By
Baroness Souiny	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		We have here an absolutely recent picture of
Russia	LOCATION	, in which we see the great mass of igno - rant peasants , the pleasure-loving nobles , the timid czar , and the intriguing politicians .

		Most interesting is the author 's reaction to the revolu - tion .

		She makes it very plain that she has little faith in the lasting powers of the democracy .

		She asserts that the people are too ignorant to understand what a democracy really is .

		They see it as a government that will give them more cows and chickens and absolute freedom .

		They do not realize that they will still have to submit to simple laws ; they do not see that a republic is primarily a business enterprise organized for utilitarian purposes .

		Enslaved as they have been , they over-idealize liberty .

		Moreover , they can - not respect a man whom they themselves have put into office .

		To their simple religious minds , their ruler must be one who reigns by divine right .

		If the democracy does succeed , the Bar - oness can only see the Russians being transformed into unimaginative cogs in a dreary industrial machine .

		There are also chapters on `` The Military Party , '' `` The Russian Court , '' `` The German Influence in
Russia	LOCATION	, '' ``
America	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, '' and so on chapters filled with evidence of the author 's perspicacity and journalistic ability .

		There is not a little social and political gossip , too : stories , more or less scandalous , touching many people in high places .

		Among other word pictures is one of the monk ,
Gregory Rasputin	PERSON	.

		The
Baroness	PERSON	sees him as a simple peasant , ab - solutely patriotic and religious , a `` Russian Billy
Sunday	DATE	'' who brought peace and self-confidence to the czar and czarina when they most needed it .

		She admits that he loved the things of the flesh , but that does not spoil him in her eyes .

		Taken as a whole , these impressions of
Russia	LOCATION	by a Russian are necessarily more authoritative than those of a foreigner .

		Nevertheless we hope that her fears that her people are '' unready for self-government are baseless .

		THE LIFE OF THE GRASSHOPPER .

		By
J. Henri Fabre	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		When a man has been called the Homer of his subject , it would seem either that the last word of praise has been said , or that the man is in need of resuscitation .

		There is something narcotic , as well as glorious , about the word Homer and the revivifying touch can not be wholly out of place .


J. Henri Fabre	PERSON	, author of the famous and popular volumes on the lives of insects , is as alive and interesting as
George M. Cohan	PERSON	.

		An attentive reader of any one of
Fabre	PERSON	's books will be nothing less than awed by the tireless observation which is the background of his simple narrative .

		He thought it but pleasure to sit through whole days and nights waiting for some indifferent bug to perform one of its functions .

		And he was little short of a genius when it came to experimentation , when the need came for a device or trick to catch his pets at their singing or mating .

		In reporting what he had at last seen , he was again unusual : he reported with the hand of the common per - son , he took almost extreme care to choose the everyday word , and the ludicrous aspect thus thrown upon Latin terminology is one of the of his books .

		Fabre was above all a plain human being ; his studies had made him what all lv makes all worthy men , humble and wor -
1917	DATE	-RSB- 215 shipful in the face of the mystery of life ; and he could not resist a kindly dig now and then in the ribs of the pedagogues and pedants .

		To give any idea of the charm of his work , of his infusion of the human into his record , of his own personality as it is delightfully shown in his pages , would be impossible in a brief review .

		His is one of those books that can only be grate - fully recommended .

		Do WE NEED A NEW IDEA OF GOD .

		By
Edmund H. Reeman	PERSON	.

		Jacobs ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		The war , productive of so much reactionary opinion in certain directions , opens up liberal thought and statement in others .

		Theology at present feels its liberating influence .

		Many pious people have watched with growing wonder the devastating course of three years of terrific world-strife without a single clear manifestation of God 's intervention ; and they are now well prepared for such a book as Mr.
Reeman	PERSON	's .

		The author suggests his purpose in the first words of the preface as `` a reinterpretation of life and a restatement of religious faith in the light of democratic outreach and impulse . ''

		This sounds commonplace enough and many disappointing and boresome books have begun with similar high enterprise .

		But this book makes good .

		`` There are ... many who feel that the great dem - ocratic uprising of the world can not be without its effect upon our thought of God , and who are finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile the oligarchic and monarchial elements that predom - inate in our common God-ideas with modern democratic urge and impulse . ''

		The key to this pragmatic statement is `` democratic , '' and it also suggests the striking difference between this book and the most prominent current pronouncement on the same subject
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's `` God the Invisible King . ''

		Both books are good on the destructive side , with the balance decidedly in favor of
Wells	LOCATION	.

		Constructively , however , the British writer seems , in comparison , vague , tru - istic , naive , and dogmatic .

		Though a socialist , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	still conceives God as the archaic head of a monarchy of men 's souls ; the purpose of Mr.
Reeman	PERSON	is mainly to combat that con - ception .

		The chapters `` God and Democracy '' and `` The Nature of the
Life Force	ORGANIZATION	'' contain much of the important argument and most of the finest eloquence .

		Both writers conceive of God as finite , holding up men 's hands and being held up by them , but Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is vague in differen - tiating God from the
Life Force	ORGANIZATION	and maintain - ing his personality , while Mr.
Reeman	PERSON	is per - fectly clear in identifying the two and in giving the doctrine of Divine Immanence a modern pragmatic meaning .

		`` A God in an easy chair , or upon a monarch 's throne ; a God in a distant heaven and with a court and retinue of angels ; a God working by the easy method of direct fiat and command ; a God seeking only from men the idle flattery of lip homage and temple wor - ship and moved and swayed in action by the selfish prayers of men ; a God incarnate in but one human form and dying but one death for the emancipation of the race ... will not fit , and can not anyhow be made to fit , in the presence of this unspeakable cosmic struggle by which alone the thought of a larger life has been won . ''

		`` The only God-thought , I believe , that can fit our needs and the facts of our knowledge of the great cosmic struggle is the thought of a God dying a thousand deaths daily and pouring out His life 's blood unceasingly in continuous struggle the God , in a word , of a mighty eter - nal urge and effort and of the struggle itself , with Whom our highest relationships and com - munion , if to such we are to attain at all , must be those of comrades and fellow-workers in the building of a universe and in the translation into ethical values of physical forces . ''

		The new `` At - one-ment '' is easily imagined from the following : `` Human history , indeed , as I read it , is the story of a long and painful outreach toward good - ness on the part of men , and not at all the story of a long continued and wilful rebellion against God . ''

		On the whole a most tactful and satisfactory book !

		THE PRINCE OF PARTHIA : A Tragedy .

		By
Thomas Godfrey	PERSON	.

		Edited with an In - troduction by
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	.

		It seems strange that while so many early American writings of less importance have been reprinted , the first tragedy written by an Amer - ican should heretofore have been available only in the original edition of
1765	DATE	.

		At last an at - tractive reprint appears on the occasion of the one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the first stage representation of the play in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Pro- fessor
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	, of
the University of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, furnishes an extended introduc - tion .


Thomas Godfrey	PERSON	, the author of `` The Prince of Parthia , '' is usually associated with his native city of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, but his new editor stresses the fact that the play was written at
Wilmington	LOCATION	,
N. C.	ORGANIZATION	a city , as the reader is more than once reminded , `` noted afar for its lavish hospitality and the polite learning of its inhabi - tants . ''

		Notwithstanding the reputation of the elder
Godfrey	PERSON	as a mathematician and that of the younger as a poet , biographical information re - garding either is meagre .

		The picture of the father in
Franklin	LOCATION	's `` Autobiography , '' the memoir of the son by his fellow-poet ,
Nathaniel Evans	PERSON	, and the references in the life of Provost 216 -LSB-
September	DATE	13
William Smith	PERSON	are fairly well known .

		Profes - sor
Henderson	PERSON	has made careful search in more obscure places , and is able to add some data regarding
Godfrey	PERSON	's life , and especially regarding the performance of the play .

		Authenticated facts are , however , less numerous than inferences , and it is evident that to a professor of pure mathe - matics `` doubtless '' in the statement of a con - clusion means something far different from `` Q. E. D. '' When a real nugget is found , the most is made of it .

		It is an interesting , if not an important bit of information , that in
1760	DATE	the name of the poet appears in a list of delinquents who did not work out their road tax as required by law .

		But was it necessary to add : ``
Thomas Godfrey	PERSON	, like many of us , cared more for poems than for picks , for spondees than for spontoons .

		Perhaps , '' etc. , etc. ?

		It would have been more profitable if the editor had developed farther his few excellent comments on the young drama - tist 's literary relationships .

		Godfrey was in no sense a great poet , not even a poet of great promise ; but he was re - markable for the number and the variety of the English masters whom he was able , at the age of twenty-three , to echo in a way that showed appreciation if not originality .

		It is still worth while to inquire how far this feeling for the truer English poetry was common in the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and the
Wilmington	LOCATION	of his day , and how far he was , notwithstanding his few advantages and his early death , an individual prophet of better things in the literary development of his section of the country .

		Many known facts go to show that his real importance in the history of eighteenth-century American literature has not been adequately recognized .

		AN ESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE 'S RELATION TO TRADITION .

		By
Janet Spens	PERSON	.

		Black - well .

		Dr.
Spens	PERSON	has given us a stimulating and suggestive treatment of a subject too little un - derstood .

		Her book is a distinct contribution to the group of works dealing with the evolution of literature .

		We are now grown accustomed to the idea of evolution in literary types ; we know the steps by which the Greek drama was evolved out of the worship of Dionysus and the English out of certain parts of the church serv - ice ; but we had not thought it necessary to go a step further and admit the evolution of the stuff or content of literature .

		Indeed , supposing orig - inality to be a great and shining virtue , we have insisted on the ugliness of the sin of plagiarism and have felt rather perplexed , not to say shocked , at the way Chaucer and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	helped themselves to the great `` common store - house of nature . ''

		Now along comes Miss Spens and convinces us that we had considerably under - estimated
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's debt to his predecessors .

		It is not the sort of debt , however , that detract * from his greatness ; on the other hand , it tends to increase our admiration for the manner in which he transmutes the base metal of popular games and customs and characters into the pure gold of his plays .

		Miss Spens finds many traces of folk-plays survivals of early religious rites in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		The fool , for example , is not merely a courtly appendage ; he is in origin the old year , and in his death at the hands of his sons , as in the Revesby sword-play , we `` see dimly the story of the decay and death and re - birth of life in man and beast and dumb na - ture . ''

		In the second part ,
Miss Spens	PERSON	shows how the ancient scapegoat passes into the hero - sufferer -LRB- CEdipus -RRB- , who in turn passes into the man-god , and finally into the Senecan human monstrosity , whom the divine mania , descending on him , enables to perform superhuman deeds .

		Shakespeare , though rejecting the superhuman , deals essentially , in
Hamlet	LOCATION	,
Lear	LOCATION	,
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, Coriolanus , and
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	, with the same con - ception of honor , the performance of a deed which shall make the hero equal to the gods .

		Thus it may be said that essentially the revenge plot had its origin in those dim ages of the past when there was no difference known between the human and the divine , when Jahve walked in the garden , and Prometheus stole fire from heaven .

		THE LIFE OF LAZARILLO DE TORMES .

		Translated by
Louis How	ORGANIZATION	.


Mitchell Ken	PERSON	- nedy ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The story of Lazarillo 's experiences with his many masters and his piquant satire of society in sixteenth century
Spain	LOCATION	is too famous to need a summary .

		`` Great secrets , Lord , are those that thou makest and people are ignorant of !

		Who will not be deceived by that fair appearance and decent cape and coat ? ''

		It is the intention of the author to reveal those secrets and expose the torn lining of that decent cape .

		He accom - plishes his task in the most picturesque language , and one wonders whether the charm this first of Spanish picaresque romances continues to hold for translators is not often as much in its diffi - culty as in its intrinsic merit .

		Mr.
How	PERSON	has attempted a literal version ; he goes so far as frequently to sacrifice smooth English in his ef - fort to keep the construction of the original .

		The result is occasionally a racy bit of phrasing , but too often the reader misses the craftsmanship of the anonymous author .

		The notes , by Mr.
Charles P. Wagner	PERSON	, will be of interest to serious students of Spanish .

		Some of the latter will doubtless wish to quarrel with Mr.
Hmv	PERSON	over a few of his renderings .

		It would seem that attention should be called to pla \ s on words
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 217 even if they can not be translated .

		For instance , on page 36 , Mr. How makes Lazarillo say of his second master : `` to make use of my dodges I had no chance , because I had nowhere to make him jump , '' thus alluding to the young scamp 's vengeance on the blind beggar .

		This may be accepted as one meaning , but the Spanish phrase is por no tener en que dalle salto and signifies also `` because he had nothing of which I could rob him . ''

		The art of translation is more diffi - cult than is commonly realized and Mr.
How	PERSON	's version , though creditable , is not the final one .

		THE LIFE OF
JAMES J. HILL	PERSON	.

		By
Joseph Gilpin Pyle	PERSON	.

		Doubleday , Page ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		Empire-building , whether it be done by an
Alexander	PERSON	, a
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	, a
Napoleon	LOCATION	, or a modern captain of industry , is an attractive field for his - torical writers .

		It is only in recent years , how - ever , that the captains of industry are coming to their own .

		Some of these captains have combined industry and politics , leaving out war .

		Among the comparatively recent additions to historical literature based on modern empire-building may be mentioned the life of Lord
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	and the autobiography of Sir
George Reid	PERSON	.

		To this list Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	now adds his `` Life of
James J. Hill	PERSON	. ''

		All three men came directly or indi - rectly out of the British Isles .

		The first two continued to build for the mother country , the first in
Canada	LOCATION	, the second in
Australia	LOCATION	.

		The third was born in
Canada	LOCATION	, but crossed into the
United States	LOCATION	and figured largely in the build - ing of the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		His chief inter - est was in fuel and transportation .

		In both , he generally had the business acumen to see just a little farther than anybody else .

		This is par - ticularly true of the connection between coal and railroads .

		In the early days when the roads were cording wood along the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, Mr.
Hill	PERSON	was cataloguing the quality and quantity of coal in
Minnesota	LOCATION	.

		In the
' 70	DATE	's when some railroad builders needed the best coal deposits of
Iowa	LOCATION	, they were , says Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	, `` amazed to find 2300 acres of valuable coal lands in one county under lease by
James J. Hill	PERSON	. ''

		While Mr.
Hill	PERSON	was monopolizing the coal lands , others were com - bining the railroads .

		In
1870	DATE	the
Northern Pacific	ORGANIZATION	began buying up other lines .

		Separate or - ganizations were maintained , but the directorates were identical , not simply interlocking .

		This was the day of high financing .

		Company No. 1 would make a contract with itself as Company No. 2 and then issue bonds , the proceeds of which for building often amounted to less than
50 per cent	MONEY	.

		Then came the panic of
1873	DATE	, after which Mr.
Hill	PERSON	bought up the bankrupt roads and finally decided to make railroading , not fuel , his major business .

		At a time when other men thought the project foolish , he decided to extend his road to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		The connection was made and , presto , an empire was built .

		Of the transportation feature of that empire Mr.
Hill	PERSON	was the master .

		The world is now at war .

		One of the parties to this war is fighting for democ - racy .

		When the future historian comes to write of democracy-building , let us hope that he will be able to tell of the democratization of industry , as well as of war and politics .

		RAILROAD VALUATION .

		By
Homer Bews Vanderblue	ORGANIZATION	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The reader of this book leaves the volume with a feeling of inevitable depression .

		Dr.
Vander	PERSON	- blue has made the economics of transportation his special study , and his thesis for the doctorate , of which the present work is a revised version , is particularly concerned with the problem of finding a satisfactory basis for ascertaining a fair method of finding the valuation of a road , which valuation is to serve as a basis for deter - mining a just return for services rendered .

		The book is depressing because Dr.
Vanderblue	PERSON	makes the reader wonder just how far we have pro- gressed since the
Interstate Commerce	ORGANIZATION	Com - mission undertook to work out a rule for determining reasonable rates ; and since
1913	DATE	how much good has really been done by the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	in its assigned task of making a physical valuation of the railroads of the coun - try a valuation to include such items as orig - inal cost , cost of reproduction anew , cost of reproduction less depreciation , and also intangi - bles , such as `` going value , good will , and fran - chise value . ''

		Dr.
Vanderblue	PERSON	says : `` But the statute commits
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to no theory of val - uation .

		The entire burden of weighing the elements of value is thrown upon the
Commis	PERSON	- sion . ''

		`` Railroad Valuation '' is a discussion of these theories of valuation and the elements of valuation .

		In successive chapters replacement value , the unimpaired investment , depreciation , land values , and intangibles are treated in a thorough fashion .

		It is to be noted in passing that this book deals perforce with many legal problems of the past , and Dr.
Vanderblue	PERSON	covers these phases in a clear and praiseworthy manner .

		The un - fortunate point is that the entire work appears colorless .

		It is a pity that Dr.
Vanderblue	PERSON	has not given a more individual treatment embody - ing his own ideas on a subject so much in the public mind .

		The present work is rather on the order of a summary of what has been accom - plished , but as such it should help many a ris - ing economist and public official to avoid the `` circles '' in the reasoning of some of our com - missioners and justices .

		218 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	LETTERS OF
ARTHUR GEORGE HEATH	PERSON	.

		With Memoir by
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	.

		Long - mans ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Nothing forces upon one more strongly the wantonness and the waste of war than the con - templation of the innumerable young lives of promise cut off on battle-field and in hospital during the past three years .

		No more lovable or gifted personality is to be found in this mel - ancholy list than
Arthur George Heath	PERSON	,
Fellow of New College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, and Lieutenant in the Royal West
Kent Regiment	PERSON	, who fell on the eighth of
October , 1915	DATE	, his twenty-eighth birth - day .

		Distinguished for his scholarship and his proficiency in music , he was loved for his noble qualities of heart and character , and both ad - mired and loved for the high courage with which he animated the men under his command .

		The last person one would have selected for a mili - tary career , he applied for a commission a few days after the declaration of war , and threw himself whole-heartedly into the necessarily ab - horrent task , to carry it through or to die at his post .

		Gentleness and humor , forgetfulness of self and thoughtfulness for those at home , with a scholar 's studiousness and earnestness , mark these letters from the field , mostly to the writer 's mother , now collected and prefaced with a warmly appreciative memoir by Professor
Gil	PERSON	- bert
Murray	PERSON	, fellow Oxonian and fellow col - legian of
Heath 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		And so the book takes its place beside similar memorials of
Dixon Scott	PERSON	and
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	and scores of others , as a sad reminder of high possibilities of achievement sacrificed without a murmur , and also of high actualities of achievement in a great cause .

		DOING MY BIT FOR
IRELAND	LOCATION	.

		By Mar - garet
Skinnider	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		It is one thing to read about the Great War ; it is quite another to plunge into a fight having all the qualities of drama excitement , irony , and beauty , which the world war seems to lack .

		Perhaps these things are the peculiar product of revolutions , of conflicts between a small op - pressed group and a large powerful group , or between a great inarticulate mass and a sophis - ticated minority .

		When one reads
Margaret Skinnider	PERSON	's account of the heroic labors of the Irish leaders , the pluck of the girl dispatch-bear - ers , of whom
Miss Skinnider	PERSON	was one of the cleverest , and of the bitter end which these hot nationalists met at
England	LOCATION	's hands , one recalls the unhappy stories of another revolution , trust - ing that if the Irish have suffered defeats like the Russians they may more quickly realize Rus - sia 's victory .

		For
Miss Skinnider	PERSON	's brief story of Easter Week and its subsequent stupid tragedy is not so much an indictment of
England	LOCATION	as a revelation of Irish potentialities .

		Her de - scription of the misery suffered by innocent people , misery which one only touches when one has heard it with all dignity from their own lips , and of the fine courage and liberal hopes of these men and women , leaves a profound impression on the mind .

		One of the chief vir - tues of Miss Skinnider 's simple recital is that it makes the Irish revolutionists live for us , espe - cially their executed leaders , so that the Irish question presents itself as an essentially human problem , and the rights of small nations changes from a battle cry to a demand for constructive thought .

		PHILISTINE AND GBNIUS .

		By
Boris Sidis	PERSON	.

		Badger ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	's little book first appeared in
1911	DATE	.

		The present issue is not much changed except for the addition of a preface in which the author appears unduly impressed by the fact that he had predicted the Great War at that time -LRB- in com - pany with perhaps five hundred other writers of the last two decades -RRB- , and a chapter on `` Pre - cocity in Children . ''

		The arraignment of the American `` system '' of education is now so well known , and the main points in the indictment have been so long admitted that one finds it a little difficult to warm to what seems like the spectre of some antediluvian monster .

		In
1911	DATE	it had more novelty .

		To-day reading that `` our whole educational system is vicious '' sounds like Mr.
Britling	PERSON	's be - lated discovery of a God that thousands of pragmatists have known for a generation .

		Page after page about `` mandarin-schoolmasters , '' `` goody-goody schoolma'ams , '' `` pettifogging offi - cials , '' `` blind college owls , '' and `` philistine peda - gogs '' grows tiresome , partly because these expressions have become truistic , but mainly be - cause the author 's fundamental assumption is silly ; namely , that school and college exist to develop genius .

		This can not have any truth in a democracy .

		Perhaps if Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	had taken the trouble to define genius , he would have suc - ceeded better .

		It is surprising that a scientific man could produce so unscientific a book ; no - where is there the slightest evidence to support the unceasing flow of invective against the bogey of our `` system . ''

		What he wants is no system but inspired parental instruction instead , which might work well enough in a few enlightened households .

		The one thing of positive value in a book full of negative invective is this : `` The cultivation of the power of habit-disintegration is what consti - tutes the proper education of man 's genius . ''

		This > od , but even here you must know before - hand what the author means he gives no help .

		This lack of definiteness and evidence gives the whole an air of mediaeval ifise dixit .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 219 GRAPES OF WRATH .

		By
Boyd Cable	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Boyd Cable and Ian Hay have given us a large part of our knowledge of what lies behind the meagre official reports of the war , of the daily humor and hardship and achievement of the average British Tommy in the trenches .

		`` Grapes of Wrath , '' Mr. Cable 's latest contri - bution , describes in general terms the Somme battle and more particularly the adventures of four modern musketeers , whose point of view is that of the average infantry private .

		`` The wust of this blinkin ' show is that nobody seems to know nothin ' and the same people seem to care just about the same amount about anything '' says
Billy Simson	PERSON	, describing the most common feeling of the soldier in the trenches .

		When he helps capture a trench , he frequently does not know whether the enemy is before him or behind him , whether he is in comparative safety or in great danger , where he is , or why he has done what he has done .

		Often the sentiment that inspires him to fight is no loftier than that of Pug , who , having received a slight wound which entitled him to a week at the Base , ran back to join his company in the capture of a difficult piece of trench , and when remonstrated with in emphatic and picturesque terms , explained : `` All the time I 've bin out ` ere I 've never ` ad a chance to see the inside of a German trench : an ' now there was a fust class chance to git into one , an ' a chance maybe of pickin ' up a ` elmet for a soo-veneer , I thought I 'd be a fool not to take it .

		I want a blinkin ' ` elmet see and wot 's more , I 'm goin ' to git one . ''

		The men do not love war , but they make the best of it .

		And when a man `` stops one , '' as he has known all the time he should some day do , he accepts his fate just as all the rest of that strange life is taken , with unquestioning resignation .

		THE
ATLANTIC	LOCATION	CLASSICS .

		The
Atlantic Monthly Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Among the many and various impressions re - ceived from the essays in this volume there is one that is general and uniform : consciously or oth - erwise the most popular contributors to the `` At - lantic Monthly , '' for so they are named in the short preface , follow what might be called the
Atlantic	LOCATION	outline .

		Just what or where are the sources of this impression is difficult to say , so difficult that the reader hesitates to express his feeling .

		But the feeling is none the less definite and it grows so persistent before the essays are finished that to leave it unexpressed is critical pain .

		This is not at all to say that the essays are monotonous , nor that they are alike ;
Dallas Lore Sharp	ORGANIZATION	's `` Turtle Eggs for Agassiz , '' with its originality and movement , is as far from
Ralph Bergengren	PERSON	's burlesque `` In the Chair '' as the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' is from the ``
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post , '' and although
Owen Wister	PERSON	's `` Reminiscence with Postscript '' and
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	's `` The Provincial American '' have their likenesses , there is still that subtle difference which makes the essay an everlasting joy .


Cornelia A. P. Comer	PERSON	's `` Intensive Living , ''
Zephine Humphrey	PERSON	's `` The Passing of Indoors , ''
Lucy Elliot Keeler	PERSON	's `` The Contented Heart , '' and
Margaret Sherwood	PERSON	's `` The Other Side '' are distinctly made to fit the
Atlantic	LOCATION	outline ; and there are those who con - sider
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	the very essence of that conservatism which the `` Atlantic Monthly '' has so consistently upheld .

		The preface says that the editors aimed to have this volume `` constitute a kind of
Atlantic Anthology	LOCATION	, preserving the mag - azine 's flavor and character and offering , as it were , a sample of what it aims to be . ''

		This is accomplished .

		MENTAL CONFLICTS AND MISCONDUCT .

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The thesis of this volume is well sustained .

		It proceeds upon the case method .

		It sets forth that the provocations to social misconduct in unstable personalities are mental repressions , shocks , and difficulties of adjustment .

		There is a mechanism at work which links cause and effect , and discloses the sources of what , for lack of analysis , is called crime .

		The deepest emo - tional disturbances are those of sex .

		The achieve - ment of sexual poise is the critical phase of maturing , and by that token is fraught with mis - chance .

		Of the forms of evidence supplied by Dr.
Healy	PERSON	, the most typical and convincing is the association of sex shock or delinquency with stealing .

		It is hopeful that at times , even com - monly , with the recognition of the source of the trouble and its acknowledgment , relief sets in .

		The unsettlements of adolescence , masking their true source in the irritations and perversions of sex , lead to wayward and irregular periods of behavior in the most normal , and in the sus - ceptible or neurotic take the more severe form of anti-social transgressions .

		It is the illustra - tion of this theme in the concrete that con - stitutes the high value of this volume .

		The detailed study differentiates types of cases and shows the difficulties of diagnosis .

		The book forms a notable contribution to the group of writings , mostly of American origin , distinctive of the applied psychology of crime .

		It is char - acteristic that the American genius , sensing the practical value of principles enunciated by others , is peculiarly fertile in bringing the study to a valuable issue in an important phase of social insight and control .

		In this movement Dr.
Healy	PERSON	is recognized as a distinguished leader .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	No i i > o \ N I : N \ Fn TION `` Christine , '' by
Alice Cholmondeley	PERSON	-LRB- Mac - millan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , purports to be a series of letters written by a young Englishwoman studying mu - sic in
Berlin	LOCATION	during the
Summer of 1914	DATE	.

		Their authenticity is attested by the author 's mother , who publishes them , she says , `` just as they came to me , leaving out nothing , '' because the three years that have passed since
Christine	PERSON	's brief ad - venture and tragic death have `` been more full of actions on
Germany	LOCATION	's part difficult to explain except in one way and impossible to excuse '' ; and she felt that `` these letters , giving a picture of the state of mind of the German public im - mediately before the war , and written by some one who went there enthusiastically ready to like everything and everybody , may have a cer - tain value in helping to put together a small corner of the great picture of
Germany	LOCATION	which it will be necessary to keep clear and naked be - fore us ... if the world is to be saved . ''

		The publisher 's announcement regarding the alteration of some names further emphasizes the genuineness of these letters , as do their small personal touches and occasional irrelevancies to the progress of the story .

		The doubt as to their legitimacy comes when one reads the initial one , which , like all first letters in epistolary novels , retails to the ostensible recipient all the facts the reader needs to know .

		And as one reads on , the natural development of events , the study of the actions and reactions of different classes of Ger - mans to war and then to the war , no less than the fluency of the style , seem to indicate that `` Christine '' is a clever , interesting , but fabri - cated , narrative .

		This curiosity about its authoritativeness is largely due to its being a fresh indictment against
Germany	LOCATION	, the more terrible because it is written by a young woman whose personal charm and musical genius should have brought her any - thing but the disagreeable and disconcerting treatment which she received at the hands of her fellow-boarders , her casual acquaintances , and the
Junker	PERSON	relatives of her Prussian fiance .

		The picture of a whole people , fighting-mad , organ - izing for war , bellowing for war , rejoicing over war , as boys organize and shout for and exult over a boat-race , remains somewhat incredible .

		Christine believes that `` the world is to be saved '' only if
Germany	LOCATION	is `` beaten ... so beaten , so punished ... that she will be jerked by main force into line with modern life ... taught that the world is too grown up now to put up with the smashings and destruc - tions of a greedy and brutal child . ''

		One closes the book with the hopeless feeling that the only way out is the crushing of the German people It is a tribute to the persuasiveness of `` Christine '' that one forgets for the moment that the letters deal with
Prussia	LOCATION	rather than with
Germany	LOCATION	, with Junkers and their deluded adherents rather than with the thousands of disappointed liberals u ho will play their part in building a sounder
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Kathleen Norris	PERSON	has an uncomfortable way of making you feel that the problem is the important thing in her books , whereas it is not her contribution to the discussion of divorce , and of women 's rights or duties or temptations , that ^ r i \ rs her her claim to recognition .

		These she discusses competently and conventionally ; tlu - > are her title , her literary tag .

		Just which one is responsible for the birth of `` Martie the Un - conquered '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- is of no consequence ; whereas her handling of character and her power of rendering the details of village life are worthy of attention .

		The picture < > r
Malcolm Monroe	PERSON	's household , dominated by the suspicions of a petty tyrant , is an excellent bit of domestic comedy .

		Bonestell 's drugstore , where the young folk of
Monroe	PERSON	gather for pink sodas ; the library ' steps where they meet and shyly depart on
Sunday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	walks ; the drab existence of
New York	LOCATION	boarding-houses and flats ; the dull reality of the mediocre actor 's days and nights , these scenes and this youth are part of our American life and they are sketched with a skill that is really notable .

		If you are one of those people who can de - tect a periscope in a drifting lobster-pot , and un - mask the treachery of a whole wireless system in a roof-garden clothes-reel , you will enjoy `` My Country , '' by
George Rothwell Brown	PERSON	-LRB- Small ,
Maynard	LOCATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		For not only are we allowed submarines , and collapsible wireless stations , and code telegrams , and great
Danes	PERSON	, and German lieutenants , and disguises , but
Washington	LOCATION	itself stands `` hands up ! ''

		while we go through official pockets .

		It is unfortunate that the author should have allowed the conspirators to escape so easily , and we must hope that the final allegiance of
Frieda	ORGANIZATION	will be a lasting one , considering her achievements , but the story is a thrilling one and offers a serious idea or two besides .

		Strange that the English , steeped in ancestry and civilization , should write so far more poign - antly of the hold upon man of the primitive and the things of earth , than we , the pioneers .


Mary Webb	PERSON	is one of these more sympathetic English .

		In `` Gone to Earth '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- she writes of her corner of the Welsh moun - tains with a very real understanding of the country folk , and also , alas , with unmistakable sentimentality .

		This is the more regrettable in that her earlier novel was free from false emo - tionalism and exaggerated pathos .

		`` Gone to Earth '' suffers from both these faults .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 221 CASUAL COMMENT THE PUBLISHER OF THE DIAL wishes to reiterate the policy which he is seeking to follow in the present crisis .

		From his own experience he understands how difficult it is not to give oneself over to complete hatred and loathing in the presence of Prussian barbarism .

		Neverthe - less , it is his firm conviction that the winning of a permanent peace does not lie through the emo - tional indulgence of hate .

		Indeed the desire for revenge and punishment , reasonable as it seems to be , is actually treacherous to the ideals now at stake in this war for democracy .

		If anyone has the privilege of hatred at this time , it is those men who have voluntarily put aside the continued assurance of health and well - being , and have taken up the business of pre - paring themselves in the Officers ' Camps for participation in the war .

		Yet there was no trace of this hysteria ; instead , the camps were charac - terized by a superb feeling of consecration to a duty which loomed bigger than personal welfare or comfort .

		If , then , these men who are about to engage in the actual terrors and hazards of war are above the hysteria of hatred , is it for those who remain securely at home to yield to an easy emotionalism ?

		However the war started it has now clearly resolved itself into a war `` to deliver the free peoples of the world from the menace and the actual power of a vast military establishment controlled by an irresponsible government . ''

		The President has stated again and again that `` this power is not the German people . ''

		Unless each one of us resists the easy and popular inclination to hatred , passion will blur our national vision and the purpose of the war will be defeated .

		We are fighting for a liberalized world , one in which democracy is safe and practical .

		Peace can be made only upon that basis .

		It is not pos - sible to consider dealing with the Prussian mili - tary government , but it is necessary that we deal with the liberalized German people .

		The Ger - man people have in actuality suffered as much from Prussianism as have the Allies .

		But it must be perceived that
Prussianism	PERSON	is a habit of mind rather than a concrete institution or group of people , and as such its ultimate defeat will be on the plane of the intellect rather than of brute force .

		It is therefore the duty of every one of us behind the firing line to rise above blind , unrea - soning , indiscriminate emotionalism and perceive that the real issue of the war is an intellec - tual issue .

		It is necessary that military force be met with military force ; that is being done by our men at the front .

		But unless we back them up with clear , constructive thinking , we shall not only hinder their success but actually betray them ; for without such thinking peace will see a return to a world of mutual distrust , suspicion , and hatred .

		Is this war to have been in vain ?

		Is all the human anguish to be wasted ?

		It is for us here at home to determine .

		We can continue `` straf - ing '' the enemy .

		We can plunge deeper into mob hysteria and the insanity of cowardly bit - terness .

		Or we can rise above the present tragedy and see the ultimate solution .

		That solution , which now begins to assume the aspect of a vast stride forward in the spiritual and social life of the world , is an intellectual solution , which can only be attained by the impartial , dispas - sionate analysis of the philosophic mind .

		Only so can the creative work of democracy be carried forward out of the confusions and clamor of battle to permanent and enduring peace .

		THE MEMORIAL HOTEL may be accepted as a commemorative novelty , though hostelries bearing the names of families locally prominent are to be found in many of our large cities .

		Yet a hotel reared to the memory of a literary man and named for him may be taken as unique .

		A syn - dicate of
North Carolina	LOCATION	capitalists has arranged to erect at
Greensboro	LOCATION	, in that state , a seven - story edifice to be known as the
O. Henry Hotel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The idea commends itself .

		Memorial statues and memorial libraries are alike commonplace .

		The South may need statues , and it may need libraries still more ; but it needs good hotels more than either .

		It is fitting enough that a roof for attracting and harboring the various phases of life should be spread in memory of a man whose writings reveal so much interest in the miscella - neous characteristics of our humankind as it runs ; and it is likely enough that
O. Henry	PERSON	's spirit , if still cognizant of mundane affairs , will take pleasure in the ebb and flow of the human tide through the big and hospitable caravan - serai that is to bear his name .

		When will there be a
Whitcomb Riley Hotel	ORGANIZATION	for
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, a
Bailey Aldrich Hotel	ORGANIZATION	for `` Rivermouth '' ?

		TOWARD WHAT is JOHN
GALSWORTHY	PERSON	HEADED ?

		In his earlier days the social interest engaged predominantly his attention , as witness `` The Man of Property , '' `` The Country House , '' `` The Patrician , '' and such plays as `` Justice '' and `` The Silver Box . ''

		Latterly the social in - terest seems to have become subordinated to the sexual interest .

		The change first became mark - edly noticeable in `` The Dark Flower , '' and it is still more so in his latest novel , `` Beyond . ''

		Is it his taste and purpose to enter yet farther into the saffron penumbra of sex , and if so , why ?

		The 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 13	DATE	novel fully justifies itself when , like a bas-relief , it deals with many figures in their general rela - tions and connections ; no imperative need to limit oneself to a small group isolated and han - dled intensively `` in the round . ''

		Does Gals - worthy , as a fictionist past his youthful strength , select the sexual line as the line of least resistance as the course able to yield the maximum effect with the minimum expenditure of effort ?

		Or has he , in the latter stages of his career , come to feel , with
Hardy	PERSON	, that the fundamental , elemental re - lation between man and woman is the only rela - tion which , in the end , profoundly matters ?

		It is well to remember that , while man and woman may be but man and woman when envisaging each other , there are many other phases of human relationship involved , and that the novel may detach and specialize to the detriment of its essen - tially social nature and to the partial negation of its possibilities and even of its duties .

		MUST THE READING WORLD FORM AN ANTI- LOVE-LETTER ASSOCIATION ?

		Shall we go on al - lowing ourselves full liberty to consume in print the amatory effusions of distinguished men lately dead ?

		Shall we make no stand against the ready cooperative enterprise of survivors and publish - ers ?

		A disquieting report is in circulation that a collection of letters written by
James Whit	PERSON	- comb
Riley	PERSON	to a woman he was once engaged to marry may soon be issued in print .

		The period covered is none too recent , being from
1877	DATE	to
1885	DATE	, but the death of the poet is ; and his let - ters , written `` at the rate of three per week '' -LRB- such is the commercial intimation as to the bulk of the material -RRB- , may impinge rather unpleas - antly upon the sensibilities of a surviving circle of relatives and friends and may even prejudice a fame recently consolidated and consecrated by death .

		This sort of thing is becoming too fre - quent , and is being carried too far .

		How many will join in a solemn , decorous oath not to read these letters if they are published ?

		THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON PRINTING - OFFICES AND TYPE-FOUNDRIES may be felt in an urgent advertisement which appears in an Eng - lish booksellers ' organ : `` A Duty , '' it cries in big black-face .

		There is a scarcity of lead , it seems ; the supply is insufficient to keep shrapnel - bullet manufacturers and other munition-makers at full pressure .

		Many publishers and printers have under their control stocks of old type , old stereotypes , old electrotypes , and .

		so on , which they are hesitating to discard , or which they find difficulty in releasing owing to shortage of labor .

		As the
Ministry of Munitions	ORGANIZATION	controls lead and practically fixes the price , which is unlikely to rise and which if the end of the war appears even remotely in sight is likely to fall , owners are urged to sell without delay .

		`` We offer full market value for these metals , '' says the foundry advertising , `` and would use them for the manu - facture of shrapnel bullets . ''

		Per contra , there is a caution from another quarter against allow - ing old films to get out of the count ry and to reach
Germany	LOCATION	, where the material could be used in the manufacture of munitions .

		Thus in these days of general depletion all sorts of scraps and leavings are coming to have their value .

		BOOKSELLING AS A STUDY is receiving in - creased attention in various parts of the world .

		The
Leipzig Book Trade Institute	ORGANIZATION	offers a pro- fessional course of one year , under the patronage of the
Saxon Ministry of Instruction	ORGANIZATION	, at
Dres	ORGANIZATION	- den .

		Eligible students are those who have had some practical experience or who can present a one-year certificate of Voluntariat such unpaid service with a publishing or bookselling house as was common , a few years back , among young Germans in
London	LOCATION	.

		The French have a
Book Trade Instruction Course	ORGANIZATION	under the auspices of the
Paris Cercle de la Librairie	ORGANIZATION	.

		This course runs for two years and seems to lay less stress than the other on literature and literary history and more on the actual manufacture of the book : at least the course in literature -LRB- French literature alone -RRB- comes in the
last half of the second year	DATE	.

		In fact , the French booksellers seem to have arranged an attack in force on
Leipzig	LOCATION	, whose extraordinary position in the book world is well known : from this town ,
Hfl Hachette	LOCATION	, thirteen thousand booksellers obtain their wares , and one of its firms has a stock of 30,000,000 volumes .

		In our own country ' this educational movement was first taken up in
Phil	LOCATION	- adelphia , where the
William Penn Evening High School	ORGANIZATION	has lately completed , with thirty-six stu - dents , its first annual course in bookselling and library training .

		None of its graduates , it is re - ported , have had any difficulty in securing posi - tions .

		A similar course , more or less directly influenced by Mr.
Huebsch	PERSON	, is arranged for the
Julia Richman High School	ORGANIZATION	, in
New York	LOCATION	.

		This is described as a forty-week course : a twenty weeks ' survey of American literature from the bookseller 's standpoint , and with reference to demands in a bookstore ; it also includes classifica - tion , cataloguing , and indexing .

		Then , a twenty weeks ' study of the purely trade side of book - selling store-organization , advertising , card-cata - loguing of customers , and such-like details .

		It appears that book-buying , after the return of peace , may have its own comforts and amenities .

		A rare piece of Americana has been obtained by
Charles F. Heartman	PERSON	, of 36
Lexington Avenue	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is entitled `` The Isle of
Pines	LOCATION	, or a Late Discovery of a fourth
Island	LOCATION	in
Terra Aus	ORGANIZATION	- tralis ,
Incognito	LOCATION	, being a True Relation of Certain English persons who , in the dayes of Queen Eliz - abeth , making a voyage to the
East India	LOCATION	, were cast away and wracked upon the
Island	LOCATION	. ''

		It is a small quarto of nine pages , is without place , and was printed by `` S. G. for
Allen Banks	ORGANIZATION	,
1668	DATE	. ''

		`` S. G. '' was
Samuel Green	PERSON	, a printer at Cam - bridge ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		His partner ,
Marmaduke Johnson	PERSON	, was fined by the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	for print - ing this book without permission .

		He appealed to the Governor and the
General Council	ORGANIZATION	, by whom the fine was remitted .

		This edition was a lost book until it turned up at the sale by
Sotheby 's	ORGANIZATION	, in
London	LOCATION	, on
July 30	DATE	, of Bishop White
Kennett	PERSON	's collection of Americana .

		Bishop
Kennett	PERSON	was deeply interested in mission - ary work in
America	LOCATION	and other lands .

		He pub - lished a catalogue of his American books , the earliest , or one of the earliest , on record .

		His signature is on the title-page of this work , which adds to its interest and value .

		It was described in the Sotheby catalogue as without frontispiece , which was one of the reasons why it sold cheaply .

		The
Cambridge	LOCATION	edition , however , appears to have had no frontispiece .

		Mr.
Heartman	PERSON	, aware of the value of the book , instructed his
London	LOCATION	agent , Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	, to obtain it for him if possible from the buyer .

		This was done .

		The catalogue attributed the work to
Henry Neville	PERSON	.

		It has also been attributed to
George Pine	ORGANIZATION	and to
Cornelius van Sloettes	PERSON	.

		There 1 is nothing in it about
America	LOCATION	.

		It is a romance after the fashion of Swift and
Defoe	PERSON	and
Baron Munch	PERSON	- hausen .

		It enjoyed some popularity and was printed in
America	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and Ger - many .

		It consisted originally of nine pages , but was extended to thirty-one pages in later editions .

		A copy of one of these editions , dated the same year and printed in
England	LOCATION	, is in the
John Carter Brown	PERSON	library .

		Mr.
Heartman	PERSON	believes that the book is worth
$ 2000	MONEY	.

		He will consult with the book-auction firms and may put it in a sale if they think as he does about it .

		Otherwise he will issue a reprint of it and probably present the orig - inal to
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
American Art Association	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, has not yet decided on its plans for 1917-18 .

		The opening sale will not be held before
November	DATE	.

		The war conditions will govern its actions .

		The engagement of American troops on the European battlefields and any heavy loss among them would necessarily affect auction prices greatly .

		The New Poets of
France	LOCATION	Although 1 am impatient to come to the contemporary poets , who give expression to the soul of the young men who are my comrades , I shall first review rapidly the recent past .

		It is indispensable to say from whom we descend , who were our elders and our masters .

		Another reason for calling attention to some important figures of the last period is that their value has not yet been fully recognized , and American readers will find an immense benefit in herborizing in this partly untrod - den garden .

		It is difficult for you to realize how little success depends upon merit , in
France	LOCATION	less than anywhere else .

		One explanation of this lies in the fact that talent being abun - dant , success could only consecrate it when it was joined with some social or commer - cial cleverness .

		But a better reason was the extreme division of the public into little classes who did not easily adopt one another 's admirations ; a man who was known and silently admired by the best might remain all his life unrecognized ex - cept by two hundred people , sometimes fewer .

		The consequence was that for a time the true artists refused to compete for popularity and made a system , a doctrine , of their isolation .

		Thus , instead of be - ing recognized after their death , like most of the great artists , they become known only after the passage of a generation of disciples .

		Now we can perceive rather clearly what were the characteristics of the best schools of
1890	DATE	, which are to-day a part of
France	LOCATION	's classical past .

		First , they cared extremely for a perfect , orig - inal , rare form .

		They despised easy sources of inspiration .

		They looked for an art that was entirely sufficient to itself , that regarded life as ugly and poor .

		Art was a reaction against life and an evasion of it .

		A revenge against it .

		This is almost exactly the principle of Poe , for whom reality was poison ; and it produced the perfectly pure and detached work of Mal - larme , among others .

		The result of that period was to leave some admirable poems , like `` L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune '' or
Rimbaud	PERSON	's `` Bateau Ivre , '' which are still the possession of but few admirers .

		Another result was the conquest of new forms in poetry .

		These poets did not ac - cept the formal laws of versification ; they discovered and adopted new ones .

		And the new exigencies of modern verse are perhaps more strict than the old uniform rules of metre and rhyme .

		Free verse -LRB- the name is far from happy -RRB- introduced into poetry many possibilities and nuances that the regular Alexandrine verse did not afford .

		Irregular verse is of course nothing new , since it is said to have de - scended from La
Fontaine	PERSON	and from the versets of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Now poetry is being appreciated according to the qualities of lyrism rather than to the degree of obedi - ence to fixed material rules .

		Let us rapidly recall to mind the names of
Henri de Regnier	PERSON	and of
Francis Viele-Griffin	PERSON	-LRB- who is an American by birth -RRB- as being the initiators of these re - forms .

		Jean Moreas stood faithful to strict metrical tradition .

		In the first rank of those who had influence and were fol - lowed by disciples , stands
Francis Jammes	PERSON	, who has some of
Virgil	PERSON	's blood running in his simple and harmonious poems .


Comtesse Mathieu de Noailles	ORGANIZATION	has more pride and also more anxiety , but she is near to
Jammes	LOCATION	, whom she deeply ad - mires , in many aspects of her work .

		She is a great , noble , restless soul , with an extraordinary power of projecting mag - nificence around her .

		A decidedly power - ful influence on present French literature is
Paul Claudel	PERSON	's .

		His genius is so strong and so new that a long preparation is nec - essary to approach and define him .

		Six years ago , he was known only to a few score .

		To-day he is famous .

		Other im - portant figures among these who were our 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 27	DATE	immediate elders are
Paul Fort	PERSON	, author of the many `` Ballades Francises , ''
Andre Suares	PERSON	,
Andre Spire	PERSON	, and
Henri Gheon	PERSON	.

		Each of these deserves a long appreciation , which can not find place here , but an enumeration of the influences acting upon us could not omit their names .


Charles Peguy	PERSON	has a place among the poets , owing to his `` Mysteres , '' the first being a deeply beautiful study of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc 's childhood and vocation .

		The two masters whose influence I regard as the most decisive on the inspiration and work of the young are
Andre Gide	ORGANIZATION	and
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		Them I shall but mention in this article , because I suppose them to be known already , and because their influ - ence on the artists I know has been so multiform and so subtle that it would be vain to try to indicate it in a rapid analysis .

		Readers must themselves open `` Nourri - tures Terrestres , '' `` La Porte Etroite , '' `` Pretextes , '' `` Nouveaux Pretextes , '' etc. , and turn to the books of the great Belgian who died last year in so tragic a manner .

		French literature of to-day shows the marks of one American influence which may well be called decisive .

		Walt Whit - man 's blood runs in the veins of the young writers of
France	LOCATION	.

		We first knew `` Leaves of Grass '' in the translation of
Leon Bazalgette	PERSON	, which was published in the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' ; then we read it in English .

		Shall I call our young poets disciples of his ?

		Whitman would smile at this .

		The old master , whom they never saw but can imagine , never cared for dis - ciples in the narrow sense of that word .

		Maybe they know little of him and mis - understand him still they understand him well enough not to call themselves dis - ciples !

		Some of our writers used a verse very similar to his .

		But his influence on a few poets is little compared with his influence on the mentality of the young in general .

		It is more vital than the dis - covery of a new resource in rhythm or in melody .

		It is a matter of immensely re - newed inspiration that is one of the treasures of our times .

		His voice and
Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	's answer each other , as did
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	's star and
France	LOCATION	's in the poem written in
1871	DATE	by your prophet of Democracy .

		I remember the word of
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	's little son when he saw Ivan 1 ur ^ etu-v coming into his fa - ther 's house , arm in arm with Gusta \ e Flaubert : `` But all your friends are giants , then ? ''

		These giants who dictate the rhythm of our literary life have opened to the world 's poetry a new field ; and what a field !

		That of modern life .

		They sang of the cities and the industrial work and the physical effort .

		Their teaching is the one that will be demanded by the men returned from the war a teaching of strength , fervor , and simplicity .

		But we did not wait for the war to read and admire them .

		The universe seems to be wider since their voices praised its vari - ous parts , countries , creatures , construc - tions , details ... We are no more t lu - men we were before we read `` Song of Myself . ''

		Let me quote from one of the best poems of
Charles Vildrac	PERSON	's `` Livre d' Amour '' -LRB-
Nouvelle Revue Franchise	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as translated by Miss
Elizabeth Eyre	PERSON	: The Conquerors .

		Behold the cavalier without a horse , hut whoever sees him pass will know him for a Knight Behold the pilgrim with neither staff nor brevi - ary , but whoever sees him pass will know that he is more than a crusader Behold the chief who does not command , but whoever listens to him will know him for a captain .

		Behold the conqueror without an army , but the only conqueror he who knows how to talk with everybody , both men and women ; and can make good tears shine in their eyes again , and can give back to them the clear laughter of children .

		His best weapons are his friendly eyes , his thoughtful and surprising kindnesses , it is the wa \ his voice gives help to his words , it is the way his spirit dances like a torch .

		He is prodigal and bare as a tree in the
spring	DATE	, his heart is warm as a greenhouse in winter ; and one abandons oneself to whatever he says , again it is he who .

		when he takes , gives .

		He will come wherever you are .

		He will not sit down beside you as do those to whom the half of your face and but one of your shoulders are enough .

		But he will sit down opposite you , his knees touching your knees , your hands within reach of his hands , and his eyes bearing upon your < forcing them to uncover .

		And you will say : Where have I seen him before ?

		As in singing under a vault one discovers the single note which makes the whole vibrate and become its warm voice .

		So his words agitate in your lifted throat the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 259 beautiful voice that it imprisons , of which you had no suspicion , your best voice , your only voice .

		He will love you in your own way , with the presents you would have chosen , with his bluntness , with his laughter , his humility or his pity ; he will love you as much as it is necessary to soften you and win you .

		You will wonder : What does he expect from me ?

		What will he ask of me to-morrow ?

		And you will be troubled , never suspecting that really , without knowing it himself , he expects from you the reason for his existence ; that you are neces - sary to him as the words one speaks , the ears that receive them , as beautiful things to the eyes that surround them .

		For conquest is his great desire ; like heroes and like women , he loves to feel himself fondled by the scattered thoughts of men , which , from a great distance , lean towards him as benumbed fingers stretch towards a fire .

		Or our cities will remain in ashes , and our dead unburied !

		We find ourselves at the edge of the fresh ridge The seed that we hold is very different And then will other conquerors unexpectedly arise , and as there have been a hundred con - querors , so now must one become a hundred times a lover , a hundred times beloved .

		... And those that have been conquered a hundred times will also turn to conquer .

		And the time will come in the country , the time of the great conquest , when people with this long - ing will leave the thresholds of their doors , to go the one to meet the other .

		And the time will come in this country , when history will be made of nothing but choruses of songs , but dances hand in hand , but one combat and one victory !

		Vildrac belongs to the group of the
Unani	PERSON	- mists , whose chief was
Jules Remains	PERSON	.

		They looked for inspiration not so much in individual feelings and passions , as in the life and movement of collectivities .

		In `` La Vie Unanime , '' by Romains -LRB- Mer - cure de
France	LOCATION	-RRB- , we find verses which perhaps most absolutely formulate this creed .

		I wish to quote a fragment of an unpublished chant `` To America , '' which was written in
1917	DATE	by a very young poet , Mireille Havet : Glorious cities of
America	LOCATION	, Tumultuous cities , and well populated , Cities rich with the future which will cover us all , I salute you , to-day , from my little corner in
France	LOCATION	, From my corner of a city in
France	LOCATION	, From the corner of mv table .

		Ah , never was it graver to be young Graver to be impatient With that conquering desire which comes from the pride to be the last ones ... The last of all , when the others were living ... The first , now that we are alone !

		And the words shall come from us Or eternally remain silent And judgment shall come from us , and action ,
America	LOCATION	, let our generation be the piers of a bridge Stretching itself between the various nations .

		Let our hands grasp each other Let us stand firm And be worthy of this
Earth	LOCATION	, which men , until now , Did but divide between themselves in a bloody fashion .

		I salute you , well-populated cities of
America	LOCATION	, And my heart goes to you Leaping with hope .

		There are many names which I would give :
Saintleger Leger	PERSON	, who wrote the strange and splendid `` Eloges '' ;
Leon-Paul Fargue	PERSON	, whose power over words is magic ;
Rene Arcos	PERSON	;
Frangois Porche	PERSON	with `` Le Dessous du Masque '' ;
Georges Duhamel	PERSON	with several books of poems and dramas , these are among the chief figures of our time .

		But let me turn to
Henri Franck	PERSON	, who died at 23 , before the war , leaving that long , unfinished poem , `` La Danse devant TArche , '' and who would lead our troop to-day if he was still among us .

		The first part of the poem ended with this affirmation of enthusiasm before the Uni - verse .

		I quote from a translation by
Miss Virginia	LOCATION	Hale : Adolescent runner with unwearied heart I shall reach the clearing where one comes upon God .

		One day I shall know the thing I so strongly desire , And my spirit will be multiplied and stretched with the waiting ; For nothing exists in earth or heaven That the determination of my seeking wisdom may not know .

		One day I shall find the divine current , And with the feel of its powerful flow against my back , A joyous bather abandoning myself to the sweep of the stream , On this glorious bed , between the superb banks of the Universe laden with houses and fruits .

		Supple of body , light of heart , swift of spirit , In the turbulent water of life I shall swim with power and pleasure .

		And in the last part , reaching a higher point of knowledge and wisdom , without losing his power or fervor , he can say : Truth is enthusiasm without hope , Ardor unquenchable , Joy that mounts straight up into the black sky .

		The perfect happiness of fervour without recom - pense , 260 Till - : DIAL -LSB- Septemlv The high happiness of feeling keenly one 's existence , Of being alive !

		The fragments I have chosen to quote are not the most perfect I could have found , but the ones which seemed to me to give the sense of our next tendencies in poetry ; and I find many of the same char - acteristics in the living American poets whom I read .

		There is no reason why
France	LOCATION	should not give cordial recogni - tion to poets like
E. L. Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
E. A. Robinson	PERSON	,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	,
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	,
Witter Bynner	PERSON	,
Ridgely Torrence	PERSON	, and others .

		I am strangely impatient to see the dav when I shall try to give to a few in 1 ` aris an idea of the movement and rluthm of `` The Congo '' or '' -LRB- Jcncral Booth , '' by
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	.

		Lindsa \ \ muse essentially belongs to
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, and knows no other snores , but that is precisely why we shall be glad to welcome her , with her bright cheeks and well-knit muscles and her surprise to find herself among us .

		This is not mere curi - osity or dilettantism .

		What we really love will become a part of us , as Poe and
Whitman	PERSON	did in the past .

		PIERRE DE
LAM \ Henry James	ORGANIZATION	: A Rhapsody of Youth I have wondered how it feels to `` have read
Henry James	PERSON	for the last twenty-five years . ''

		During the short time I have been reading him I have seen critiques , favorable and otherwise , that have ap - peared about him , contributed I suppose by those superior souls who `` have read him for the last twenty-five years . ''

		None of them states the point of view of youth fresh in the experience of knowing
Henry James	PERSON	, and I propose therefore to say what is in my heart of his books by way of variety , to express one or two of the primitive motifs of the rhapsody which has been strumming in my mind .

		One afternoon -LRB- I was in college at the time -RRB- I was listening to the talk of a so - cial dowager , who said , to point a bit of gossip , that a certain girl whom T knew was a `` type of American like Daisy Mil - ler . ''

		Within the week I read `` Daisy Miller . ''

		That was my first experience reading
James	PERSON	.

		Since then I have read him much ; and I find that his people are so real to me , so sentiently or so spiritually alive , that in writing about them I am bound to speak of them as one speaks of the living of those who can answer our criticism , or be embarrassed by our praise .

		I had not gone far into `` Daisy Miller '' before the girl herself was clearly visible before me , a picture of American grace and loveliness .

		I had recently been to
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope and this experience furnished me a lens through which to view with greater clearness her effervescent , ardent person - ality , suffused with the radiant sunshine of the Roman atmosphere .

		Very soon I sensed an inappropriateness in the fusion ; felt how it was loaded with tragedy from the beginning .

		I wondered what
James	PERSON	would do ; I felt there was nothing one could do to save
Daisy Miller	PERSON	from her - self and her mother .

		A lurking feeling whispered the author would find a \ vav .

		Reflection came afterward , and ration - ality , arguing that an artist finds in his art a stinging moral whip ; and that , as leader of the
Opposition	ORGANIZATION	, he can not belie his con - science .

		Thus torn between impatience that things should be so , and exasperation at
James	LOCATION	's cold impersonality in present - ing the situation , I read through the story .

		And when
Daisy Miller	PERSON	was dead ; when I could reflect , I knew that underlying
James	PERSON	's artistic impersonality was a strongly diffusive element of morality : that , although he was thoroughly an art - ist , whether or not he intended he had re - vealed a delicate New Englander 's ideal of moral beauty .

		I finished the book in the .

		evening at the library .

		I confess I had been weeping .

		I was sadly depressed about
Daisy Miller	PERSON	, and all simple , inexperienced American girls with trainings which equipped them to meet only American men with safety , and with fools for mothers .

		I decided to walk , and not go home to dinner .

		I was in no mood to meet the raillery of a crowd of undergraduate students .

		With reverence I felt I had come upon a great writer .

		Here was a man who viewed a shallow countrywoman , saw
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 261 through her glaring , superficial faults into the depths of her very soul , where he found , if not pure gold , at least very beau - tifully colored pebbles , and sparkling , variegated sands .

		By the magic of his imagination he presented her faithfully , vividly , for the reader .

		Indeed it was be - cause he looked at her , into her , and all around her that he could write the truth ; but to write the truth with added touches of beauty that I thought was the marvel - ous performance .


Daisy Miller	PERSON	, reveal - ing as she did the crude manners of the nouveau riche , was portrayed as a very much alive , beautiful , and in her way aspir - ing girl ; she reflected in spite of her sorry social trappings a soul pure , frank , good , delightful .

		These were the values which interested me , which carried me away from the present , from myself , and let me see only one set of immediate circum - stances
Daisy Miller	PERSON	's fatal stepping through a social fog over a parapet to inevitable destruction .

		There ,
James	PERSON	seemed to say , after the story had been written , that is life .

		Look at it carefully ; in this particular case view it with sympathy ; but let us never be the least bit sentimental about it .

		I grant that it is tragedy ; but there you are .

		I was deeply impressed .

		Life , which had seemed troubled to me before , was , if anything , more troubled .

		And yet from that experience came a thoughtful fatal - ism which transferred me from the excited individuals who were seeing life , not at all steadily , but much as one sees his fel - low-passengers on a ship in a rough gale over to the quieter people who , in spite of their apparent indifference , were nev - ertheless more profound , more subtle , more human than their stormy-souled brethren who were charging up and down the field of life .


Henry James	PERSON	became for me par excellence one of these quieter souls .

		There was a new vista , really ; and if there were quiet fields and peaceful scenes , and apparently superficial people who dared to criticize life -LRB- without oh unpardonable interference !

		`` giving something in return for that which they took away '' -RRB- , there was , I found , a keener criticism , a better charity , a wider knowl - edge of the world 's humanity .

		I did not read
James	PERSON	again for a long time , until a `` charter Jacobite '' friend asked me to read `` The Portrait of a Lady '' ; writing that she considered
Isabel Archer	PERSON	's one of the most poignant spirit - ual histories in all literature , and
Ralph Touchett	PERSON	the most interesting man in fic - tion .

		With extra enthusiasm I began the book .

		But alas , after fifty pages I put it down .

		I looked upon myself reproach - fully , but I could n't go on .

		I was n't intol - erant ; I was impervious .

		Thus I looked at the book for a year , until at length , piqued by defeat , I began again .

		This time it was all very different .

		I had ar - ranged my reading finally so as to `` save '' the book so many pages before going to sleep .

		There was a breath in the story of spir - itual adventure , of eternal discovery in characters complex and unfathomable , which gave the book its charm for me , and made the reading my daily reparation .


Ralph Touchett	PERSON	grew to be a friend .

		That is , I attached him .

		I should have told him the sacredest things of my life .

		I had the vivifying sensation that he would have responded to my affection , that it would have been mutual .

		But this is both debat - able and personal .

		Touchett is the kind of man to whom the phrase `` a fine fel - low '' -LRB- ordinarily so vapid in meaning -RRB- in its proper signification most fittingly ap - plies .

		He is genial , tolerant , high-minded .

		I was captivated by Isabel from the mo - ment I found her sitting in the gloomy library of her father 's
Albany	LOCATION	house .

		I watched her with keen interest , with pleas - ure , eventually with amazement .

		For I saw into the deep , the covered life of a woman the essence which is usually hidden from vulgar inspection and I was fascinated .

		It was so evident that I scarcely needed to be told that `` Suffering , with Isabel , was an active condition ; it was not a chill , a stupor , a despair , it was a passion of thought , of speculation , of response to every pressure . ''

		I felt sorry for Isabel , but I did not dare to pity her .

		At each spiritual revelation in her hard experience I was as shocked as Isabel her - self ; I felt painfully embarrassed to find myself seeing her given first one torturing stab and then another .

		In imagination I 262 THI - : ember 27 left , stealthily , without letting her know I had been a witness .

		To see her soul in pain was more than I could bear at times .

		I felt toward Isabel at the next meeting exactly as I should feel in actual life ; that I knew her better and was therefore priv - ileged , regardless of my embarrassment , to apprise her of my attitude of deeper affection and sympathy with as little ex - hibition of feeling as possible not at all if I could n't manage it without being clumsy .

		The pity of it all was that I could do absolutely nothing to relieve her life of a part of its bitterness .

		Her pride closed all avenues through which sympa - thetic offerings might travel .

		It was ter - rible .

		I could only say again and again to myself : that is life .

		The tragedy of
Isabel	ORGANIZATION	's condition was awful because her `` crime '' consisted ,
James	PERSON	says , of this : `` She had a certain way of looking at life which he -LSB-
Osmond	PERSON	, her husband -RSB- took as a personal offence . ''

		Saddest of all because there is a touch of the heroic about it was the fact that her way of looking at life was the fine , the just , the moral way .

		Isabel `` could see that he was ineffably ashamed of her ... she simply believed that he hated her ... he was not violent , '' and so `` of course it was not a physical suffering ; for physical suffering there might have been a remedy . ''

		Finally Isabel meets her spiritual crisis the peak of her load ; she is called to
England	LOCATION	to see
Ralph Touchett	PERSON	, her cousin , who is dying .

		I suffered until I knew whether .

		she would go ; and when she told
Osmond	PERSON	her news , and the cruel devil , with measured meanness , spoke to her as if she had been ignoble , I trem - bled .

		But I had to listen while he spewed forth venomous words from his poison - ous , egotistical character .

		At length Is - abel left the room ; she had not said she would not go ; I felt a vicarious ela - tion at her spiritual victory .

		I wanted to get her out of the house away from further indignity and affront ; to start her for
London	LOCATION	hoping , praying she would never come back to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		From the very first , though , there was a vague impression of
Isabel	ORGANIZATION	's soul which terrified me with the conviction that she would return to that life almost more unendurable than death .

		And when slu - did return , after
Ralph	PERSON	's death giving up happiness for an idea I who had been carried to a climax of anxiety , felt myself dashed by her inevitable action to a help - less , inert will .

		I could only murmur : There is nothing I can do ; there you are !

		I nun these `` growing pains of a
Jacob	PERSON	- ite '' I suffer more than my accusers .

		When one has thought deeply about , has felt in - tensely with ,
Ralph Touchett	PERSON	, with
Chris	PERSON	- topher
Newman	PERSON	, with Strether -LRB- especially with Strether -RRB- , there is opened a reser - voir of enthusiasm from which the ten - dency is to pour forth streams of volubility .

		But this kind of speaking is dangerous ; its current should be directed through the channels of artists no less skilful , really , than
Henry James	PERSON	himself .

		Masters are very hard to find , however ; and it is quite as true of letters as of life that `` what the great will do the less will prattle of . ''

		JOHN \ BIKRI.LL .

1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 263 The Mind of
Germany	LOCATION	HURRAH AND HALLELUJAH .

		The Teaching of
Germany	LOCATION	's Poets , Prophets , and Preachers .

		`` Hurrah and Hallelujah '' is the name of a book of war poems from the inspired pen of a Ger - man pastor ,
Konsistorialrat Dietrich Vorwerk	PERSON	.

		`` I find , '' says Dr. Bang , who is a Danish clergy - man of distinction and good sense , `` in this com - bination something so absolutely characteristic of the German spirit that I have adopted it as the title for this book . ''

		No one , however , who reads the book can be satisfied with the title .

		The ex - cerpts , citations , and summaries of which it consists suggest something more intense than `` hurrah '' and more sinister than `` hallelujah . ''

		For `` hurrah '' goes with exuberant vitality , grat - ulatory good will , a certain openness of spirit , and a certain tolerance .

		`` Hallelujah '' utters , at worst , the piety of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the feeling for which `` hurrah '' stands here is not exuberant vitality , nor good will , nor openness , nor tolerance ; it is fierce passion , persecuting mis - sionary passion , grandiose , egomaniac , blind .

		The feeling for which `` hallelujah '' stands is not piety , not gladness in the bounty of God ; it is the iden - tification of German being with divine being , of German purpose with divine purpose , the glori - fication not of God , but of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The mild - est statement of `` Hurrah and Hallelujah '' is the oft-quoted couplet by Geibel : Und es mag am deutschen Wesen Einmal noch die Welt genesen .

		With this sentiment of grandeur goes another feeling , which seems to be its complement , but which `` hurrah '' and `` hallelujah '' do not sug - gest at all .

		This other feeling is of persecution by unworthy enemies , enemies who not only cause but are the disease of the world , and as such must be extirpated by the healing might of
Germany England	LOCATION	the jealous and hypocrit - ical ,
France	LOCATION	the degenerate ,
Russia	LOCATION	the barbarous , all to be purified by German force and healed by German Kultur .

		Thus : HURRAH AND HALLELUJAH Though the warrior 's bread be scanty , do Thou work daily death and tenfold woe unto the enemy .

		Forgive in merciful long-suffering each bullet and each blow which misses its mark !

		Lead us not into the temptation of letting our wrath be too tame in carrying out Thy divine judgment !

		Deliver us and our Ally from the infernal Enemy and his servants on earth .

		Thine is the kingdom , the German land ; may we , by aid of Thy steel-clad hand , achieve the power and the glory .

		Thou who dwellest high above Cherubim , Seraphim and Zeppelins in Thy Heaven , Thou who art en - throned as a God of thunder in the midst of light - ning from the clouds , and lightning from sword and cannon , send thunder , lightning , hail and tempest hurtling upon our enemy , bestow upon us his banners , hurl him down into the dark burial-pits .


Dietrich Vorwerk	PERSON	, `` Hurrah and Hallelujah . ''

		But the deepest and most thought-inspiring result of the war is the `` German God . ''

		Not the national God , such as the lower nations worship , but `` our God , '' who is not ashamed of belonging to us , the pe - culiar acquirement of our heart .


Max Lenz	PERSON	has al - ready testified to the revelation of the `` German God '' and Luther 's hymn , `` Ein feste Burg ist unser
Gott	PERSON	, '' merely expresses the same idea in other words .

		Re - port of an address by a German theological professor , in the Berliner `` Lokalanzeiger . ''

		We could draw many instructive parallels ; we could say that as Jesus was treated , so also have the German people been treated .

		They envy us our freedom , our power to do our work in peace , to excel in virtue of ability , to fulfil our appointed task for the good of the world and humanity , to heal the world by the German nature , to become a blessing to the people of the earth .

		Wher - ever the German spirit obtains supremacy , there free - dom also prevails .

		And have not our enemies to fall back upon lies and venomous calumnies in the en - deavor to justify their assault in the world 's eyes and their own ?

		Does this not prove that the truth , too , is with us ?

		Truth and freedom , those two great bless - ings , are in our Gospel promised by the Lord Him - self .

		Here we come upon the old intimate kinship be - tween the essence of Christianity and of Germanism .

		Because of their close spiritual relationship , therefore , Christianity must find its fairest flower in the German mind .


H. Francke	PERSON	, a pastor in
Liegnitz	LOCATION	.

		My friends , when
England	LOCATION	, `` Christian ''
England	LOCATION	, akin to us in blood , was so shameless in her naked egoism , that she by her declaration of war would rather hand us over to Muscovites and semi-Asiatics than contend with us , in honest peaceful rivalry , for the palm of Kultur , it struck a hard blow to our soul , and all our wrath and pride rose up against this de - generate cousin ...
London	LOCATION	is the hearth and the heart of this terrible world-war , there sit the ministers who have precipitated
Europe	LOCATION	into misery , there is the witch 's caldron , in which fresh misery is ever brew - ing for the peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	, already bleeding from a thousand wounds .

		To attack
London	LOCATION	is to attack a den of murderers .


Karl Konig	PERSON	, `` Six War Sermons . ''

		Against us stands the world 's greatest sham of a nation , whom , with German good nature , we have much too long called the `` English cousin , '' the Car - thaginians of the
North Sea	LOCATION	, in whom we trusted that blood would have proved thicker than water : the Judas among the nations , who this time , for a change , betrays Germanism for thirty pieces of silver .

		Against us stands sensual
France	LOCATION	, the harlot amongst the peoples -LRB- die Dime unter den Volkern -RRB- , to be bought for any prurient excitement , shameless , un - blushing , impudent , and cowardly -LRB- ! -RRB-

		, with her worth - less myrmidons .

		Against us stands
Russia	LOCATION	, inwardly , indeed , rotten , mouldering , masking its diseases under outbursts of brutality , but capable of employing any means , devoid of all feeling not dangerous of her - self , but becoming a menace when leagued with oth - ers , like a beast raging from the fever of wounds , deceitful , never to be trusted .

		The great thing is therefore for us to stand , so that 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 27	DATE	God may surround us with His protection , like a cov - ering wall , because our defeat i * oulci also mean the defeat of Hit Son in humanity .

		What a difference is there between armies , one of which carries its God in its Heart , whilst the others think they can conquer by the weight of their num - bers , by canning tricks of devilish cruelty , by shame - less contempt for the provisions of international Javr -LRB- I -RRB- .

		OF GERMAN THOUGHT It has been said that it is un-Gerraan to wish to be only German .

		That again is a consequence of our spiritual wealth .

		We understand all foreign nations ; none of them understands us , and none of them can understand us .

		No nation in the world can give us anything worth mentioning in the field of science or technology , art or literature , which we would have any trouble in doing without .

		Let us reflect on the inexhaustible wealth of the German character , which contains in itself everything of real value that the Kultur of man can produce .

		Professor
W. Sombart	PERSON	,
H. U. H	ORGANIZATION	.

		The efforts directed towards the abolition of war must not only be termed foolish , but absolutely im - moral , and must be stigmatized as unworthy of the human race ... The weak nation is to have the same right to live as the powerful and vigorous nation !

		The whole idea represents a presumptuous encroach - ment on the natural laws of development .

		General
v. Bernhardi	PERSON	,
G. N. W	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our German Kultur has , in its unique depth , some - thing shrinking and severe -LRB- Sfrodes and Herbes -RRB- , it does not obtrude itself , or readily yield itself up ; it must be earnestly sought after and lovingly assimi - lated from within .

		This love was lacking in our neighbors ; wherefore they easily came to look upon us with the eyes of hatred .

		Professor
R. Eucken	PERSON	, I. M .

		We desire , and must desire ... a world-empire of Teutonic -LRB- germanisch -RRB- stock , under the hegemony of the German people .

		In order to secure this we must -LRB- a -RRB- Gradually Germanize the Scandinavian and Dutch Teutonic States , denationalizing them in the weaker signification of the term .

		-LRB- b -RRB- Break up the predominantly un-Teutonic peo - ples into their component parts , in order to take to ourselves the Teutonic element and Germanize it , while we reject the un-Teutonic element .


J. L. Reimer	PERSON	,
E. P. D	ORGANIZATION	.

		If our area of colonization does not coincide with our political boundaries , the healthy egoism of our race commands us to place our frontier-posts in for - eign territory , as we have done at
Metz	PERSON	.

		Professor
E. Hasse	PERSON	, D. G .

		The sentiment of grandeur and the sentiment of persecution are as these quotations , chosen practically at random , show the ruling passions in the material of both Dr. Bang 's and Mr.
Arch	PERSON	- er 's books .

		I have spoken of Dr. Bang 's only , be - cause Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's has in its title a very obvious and natural animus .

		His quotations , however , are more than confirmed even by the material Dr. Bang handles with such courteous objectivity .

		But Dr. Bang 's book possesses a significance which Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's does not , because it devotes itself so largely to the sermons of the clergy .

		The sermon , particularly in those countries which boast established churches , is the last entrench - ment of the commonplace .

		Of all the non-pro - ducing classes , the clergy are the most admirably passive and inert .

		For this state their preoccu - pation with the infallibilities of religion is partly responsible , but only partly .

		A non-producing class obviously must reenforce the sources of its living if it is to go on living : doctrine , conse - quently , which appears in sermons is doctrine become completely commonplace , doctrine ac - cepted and acceptable .

		Sermons , hence , are pos - sessed of evidentiality which can not accrue to philosophies like
Nietzsche	PERSON	's , or histories like
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's , or rcal-politik like
Bernhardi	PERSON	's .

		The sermons of a people utter the set mind of a people .

		We have , then , in these citations , the mind of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Prior to and until the time of their collection , it had been an unusually single mind , with the inflexibility of outlook and of feeling that is associated with abnormality .

		Indeed , the two sentiments of which it is conspicuously com - posed define , in the individual , what is known as paranoia , and men and women who suffer from paranoia are classed among the criminally insane .

		The disease is incurable .

		But that a whole people should bear the stig - mata of an incurable criminality is , of course , absurd .

		That
Germany	LOCATION	was not always so , that there is a
Germany	LOCATION	of gemiithlichkeit , learning , science , poetry , and democratic aspiration , and that that
Germany	LOCATION	is the original and lasting
Germany	LOCATION	, everybody whom the war has not turned paranoiac on his own account , will not only concede but assert .

		If the President 's words are to be taken at their face value , it is for the sake of this
Germany	LOCATION	, which so many of us Americans have known and loved and received benefits from , no less than for the sake of Bel - gium and
Serbia	LOCATION	and the other small nationali - ties , that we are trying to `` make the world safe for democracy '' by force of arms .

		Forty years this
Germany	LOCATION	has been repressed .

		The social history of
Germany	LOCATION	during these forty years may be summed up in the word verboten .

		And pro- hibitions were not only impersonal and lepal ; they were personal and social .

		The spontanei - ties of men were forced under on all sides ; an omnipresent and thoroughgoing police system held them down in the daily life of labor and citizenship ; an equally omnipresent and arrogant military and land-holding caste clamped them down in the daily life of personal contacts and social play .

		Precedence and etiquette replaced friendliness and good manners .

		Resentments ac - cumulated , but could not be expressed .

		1917 -RSB- THE ; DIAL 265 The life of the German people began to alter .

		The repressed spontaneities had to find some out - let ; the accumulated resentments clamored for utterance .

		The life and letters of
Germany	LOCATION	, with her stupendous number of children suicides , her barbarous attitude toward women , her misprision of the foreigner , her elaboration of eroticism , and her worship of the superman , are the effect .

		Resentment that you could not express against your `` betters , '' you vented upon your `` inferi - ors '' ; spontaneities you could not use in free cre - ative action in your communities of friends you gratified by compensatory formulations in your art and your philosophy .

		As the pressure of the militaristic machinery grew heavier , this became more and more the case .

		The tribalism of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	, the ruthlessness of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, the imperialism of
Bernhardi	LOCATION	, became compensatory liberations in idea for restrictions and repressions in fact .

		Furthermore , the engine of repression , the
State	ORGANIZATION	, with the
Kaiser	PERSON	and his staff as it 's symbol , was a thing , after all , not completely alien .

		There took place , consequently , a change in the German mind which the psychologists call `` projection . ''

		By this change repressive instru - ments are often made identical with the things they repress .

		The gods , for example , are pro- jections of this sort ; they stand both for all that man has the inner wish to be and for the circum - stances that do not permit the being ; they do and enjoy all things that man might and would if he could .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	became the god of Ger - many .

		What in countries with free institutions , like
England	LOCATION	, or
France	LOCATION	, or the
United States	LOCATION	, the individual might achieve in himself was pro- jected upon the
State	ORGANIZATION	, through which he thus ex - ercised his spontaneous powers vicariously .

		On the other hand , the evil that the
State	ORGANIZATION	wrought was projected outward , to the enemies of the
State	ORGANIZATION	and
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	particularly were credited with motives as surprising to them as the world 's judgment of
Germany	LOCATION	is unin - telligible to Germans .

		When , furthermore , the rulers of
Germany	LOCATION	proceeded to turn these com - pensatory sentiments into the dynamic of their political programme , the war , with its atrocities , mendaciousness , and unintelligence , became in - evitable .

		How far the German people have been disillu - sioned in the course of it , no one can say .

		So much , however , is certain .

		The President 's de - mand for internal changes as a preliminary con - dition for the discussion of peace , is absolutely sound .

		The restoration of
Germany	LOCATION	to mental health and the possibility of the German achieve - ment of whatever mission the Germans may claim , rests simply and entirely on the elimina - tion of the agency of repression that has so distorted the mind of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The real Ger - many is democratic
Germany	LOCATION	, the
Germany	LOCATION	of the free individual .

		It exists , although it exists in the shadow .

		Freedom will show it clear .

		Until
Germany	LOCATION	has been democratized , terms of peace are scraps of paper , and for the same reason that agreements with abnormal individuals are scraps of paper .

		In the old days , and perhaps the custom is still extant , parents were in the habit of apply - ing to their refractory offspring the hard and chastening rod , and with each application they would assure the prostrate but incredulous youngsters that the beating hurt them , the par - ents , more than it did the children and that it was for the good of the youthful soul .

		In the old days , too , men were piously burned and tor - tured for the good of their souls .

		And so pow - erful is the effect of repetition , in manners as well as in studies , that , at one period in the evolution of civilization , men of saintly character became firmly convinced that the royal road to salvation led through the trials of martyrdom .

		Some of us , in these days of grace , have come to doubt the efficacy of the rod and the regener - ating power of suffering .

		The Diabolonian spirit is abroad .

		Patience and long-suffering have be - come cardinal vices and lead straight away from heaven .

		Men who , not many years ago , experi - enced the knout in dumb resignation have grown so proud that they refuse to bear a coddling bureaucracy .

		And strange to say , they find in these rejections the road to salvation .

		They rebel in the name of idealism , of regeneration , of a finer , truer life ; they have not changed their faith or transferred their loyalty .

		Theirs is the old hope of man , reborn .

		Some call them rebels , but they are unwavering in their allegiance .

		The Russians as a people have long been known for their humility and submissiveness -LRB- smirenie -RRB- and for their forbearance and long - suffering -LRB- dolffoterpenie -RRB- .

		Dostoevsky rejoiced 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 27	DATE	in these virtues of the terrible meek .

		And
Stephen Graham	PERSON	's heart goes out to the mystic and unworldly strain in the Russians .

		For him
Holy Russia	LOCATION	is a living fact , as he himself says .

		He fears that
Russia	LOCATION	will some day become `` a non-Christian democracy like
France	LOCATION	. ''

		And in one place he writes : If

		It is so diffi - cult to be heroic , odd , mediaeval , and bizarre in this workaday world .

		And all to please the fancy of a few alien pilgrims who seek the balm of
Gilead	ORGANIZATION	in a crass and material age !

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's book , a volume of short sketches , was written before the Revolution .

		To-day one can believe whole-heartedly in
Holy Russia	LOCATION	as a living fact .

		Freedom will make Rus - sia holy , as many Russians and lovers of
Russia	LOCATION	knew all along .

		There is no mistaking the out - spoken desire of the people to found a Christian democracy .

		The high , spiritual feat -LRB- podvig -RRB- of patience , love , and prayer will still be dearer to the Russian heart than the podvlg of battle and struggle .

		But , for the complete liturgy of life , battle and struggle can not be renounced .

		Fascinating glimpses of
Russia	LOCATION	on the eve of revolution are given in Mr.
Ruhl	PERSON	's delightful work , `` White Nights . ''

		Mr.
Ruhl	PERSON	is perhaps the best equipped , in sympathetic understanding , charm of style , and intellectual preparation , of the American journalists now in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		These things far outvalue knowledge of the language .

		The writer takes us with him on his journey to
Russia	LOCATION	, stopping on the way to introduce us to
Ellen Key	PERSON	, then on to the white nights of
Petro	PERSON	- grad , and from there to the turmoil of the war on the Russian battle front .

		We return inland , to
Moscow	LOCATION	, and are initiated into the mysteries of the
Moscow	LOCATION	Art Theatre .

		Hastening back to
Petrograd	LOCATION	we visit the
Taurida Palace	ORGANIZATION	, where the Duma sat , and we meet the prominent depu - ties , some of whom have since become world figures .

		The final stages of the pleasant journey of discovery take the reader down
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's river , the
Volga	LOCATION	, to the industrial sections of the country , and into
Rumania	LOCATION	.

		Throughout the trip Mr.
Ruhl	PERSON	keeps
America	LOCATION	in mind , and his contrasts and comparisons with life in our own land help to throw into relief the manners and i-u-stoms of a foreign people .

		Nowhere does a premonitory sound of coming events disturb the silence of the white nights .

		No threatening cloud tells of the approaching storm .

		It is not the hush of expectancy .


Russia	LOCATION	, though at war , is at peace with itself .

		And yet this is
Russia	LOCATION	`` on the eve , '' as
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	said .

		A few brief months , and
Russia	LOCATION	felt the shock of the vast upheaval .

		Present-day
Russia	LOCATION	is almost as enigmatic and puzzling as was the
Russia	LOCATION	of yesterday .

		The Revolution has lost its simplicity .

		To our anxious vision it appears huge , stumbling , in - choate , and unaimed .

		Some have the graver fear that conditions in
Russia	LOCATION	are hopelessly and irre - mediably anarchic .

		But we must recognize the fact that a painless consummation of a people 's freedom is impossible .

		In time of war sensi - bilities become acute and fears intensified .

		In addition to the sharper apprehensions of war - time , there is our nearness in time to profound and as yet uncrystallized events .

		In his `` His - tory of the Revolution of
1905	DATE	, ''
Khrustalyev	PERSON	- Nosar , president , in those days , of the
Petrograd Council of Workingmen	ORGANIZATION	's Deputies , writes : `` Mass movements are like gigantic frescoes .

		Seen from near , the outlines of the picture dis - appear , the colors are fused into a number of separate , screaming spots ; the creative idea of the artist is lost ... Only at a distance does the fresco return to life and speak of the force and power of artistic genius .

		It is in the same \ va \ that we must proceed to an estimate of a mass movement . ''

		We are far from having a long and untroubled perspective .

		But surely , some of our present fears are no more than horrible im - aginings .

		It is true that in
Russia	LOCATION	to-day , so much is at stake for the world 's democracy that a soft , easy sense of security is dangerous .

		There are many forces striving , openly or by devious \ va \ s. to undo the first accomplishment of the Revo - lution .

		Among the enemies of a democratic Rus - sia are many self-styled `` friends '' of the Russian people , who would rescue them from `` the grave menace '' of republicanism .

		We in
America	LOCATION	must remember that the Russian Revolution is the fir > r great victory , in the war which is now our war , for the Allies and for the world .

		It is a victory so tremendous and inspiring that we .

		who have seen it come about in our own day , can not fore - see its full sweep or compass its immeasurable effects .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 267 Psychoanalysis as a Pathfinder THE PSYCHOANALYTIC METHOD .

Oskar Pfis	PERSON	- ter .

		Authorized translation by
Charles Rock	PERSON	- well
Payne	PERSON	.

		The Freudian psychology has travelled a course that might have been predicted with tolerable certainty .

		At first received with mingled de - rision and disgust , it has now attained a position not only of virtual security but , one is almost tempted to say unfortunately , of very genuine and widespread popularity .

		Whitmanesque po - ets sing paeans to Jung 's libido , one of the metaphysical offshoots of the psychoanalytic movement , while half-baked doctors fearlessly disentangle homosexual `` complexes '' at the end of a first half-hour 's consultation with hysterical patients .

		Those who are profoundly convinced of the epoch-making importance of the psycho - logical mechanisms revealed by Freud and , even more , of the extraordinary suggestiveness of numerous lines of inquiry opened up by psycho - analysis , without , at the same time , being blind to criticisms that need to be made of certain aspects of psychoanalytic theory , can only hope and pray that this not altogether healthy over - popularity of the subject prove no hindrance to the study of the perplexing problems with which the Freudian psychology bristles .

		What is sorely needed at the present time , or will be before many years , is a thoroughly objective probing into the new psychology with a special view to seeking out the paths of reconciliation with the older orthodox psychology of conscious states and to the rigorous elimination of all aspects of Freudian theory that seem dispensable or ill-substantiated .

		The present militant attitude of the psycho - analysts toward their skeptical schoolmasters is naturally but a passing phase .

		The opposed schools of psychological interpretation will have to meet each other half way and effect a common modus vivendi .

		For the present it is obvious that the personal bias of the brilliant founder of psychoanalysis has given the Freudian psychology more than one twist that is not altogether necessitated by its in - valuable kernel the proof of the existence in the unconscious mind of emotionally toned `` com - plexes , '' repressed trends that are directly elabo - rated out of the instinctive life and that leak out into consciousness in a large number of superfi - cially dissimilar psychic phenomena , for example , dreams , automatic and compulsive reactions , neu - rotic symptoms .

		A firm belief in the validity of the main lines of psychological theory set forth by Freud by no means necessitates an unreserved adherence to such incidental concomitants as his apparently one-sided interpretation of sexual per - versions or his general conception of the com - pound nature of the sexual instinct .

		At the least , very radical shiftings of emphasis are certain to emerge .

		An analogous development has char - acterized the history of the theory of organic evolution .

		Only recently has the original Dar - winian bias toward an overemphasis of the fac - tor of natural selection yielded to the proper eval - uation of other factors .

		The inertia of impetus given by the founder of a radical scientific depar - ture is , indeed , one of the most humiliating , one of the most ironically human , things about the history of science .

		So far there seems to be a disposition on the part of psychoanalysts to accept the whole Freudian programme at prac - tically its face value .

		What criticism there is within the ranks is chiefly on matters of rela - tively minor import .

		Even the Jung sedition , of which so much is made , consists of hardly more , it would seem , than a tendency to gener - alize and carry further some of the more doubt - ful elements of
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's theoretical groundwork .

		I refer particularly to
Jung	ORGANIZATION	's handling of sym - bolization as an interpretative principle and to his reckless application of the principles of indi - vidual psychoanalysis to cultural phenomena .

		We shall be disappointed if we turn to Pfis - ter 's extensive treatise in the hope of finding such a critical and reconciliatory survey of psy - choanalytic research .

		It does not advance the subject very perceptibly in the direction indi - cated .

		There is , to be sure , a fair amount of critical comment en passant on particular
Freud	PERSON	- ian positions , but the whole is mainly a summary , and a very convenient and useful one , of the typ - ical psychoanalytic interpretations .

		The greater part of the book deals with the analysis and mechanism of repression , constant use being made of case material .

		The latter portion deals with the application as a practical technique of the theory developed in detail in the preceding pages .

		What particularly distinguishes `` The Psychoanalytic Method '' is the emphasis placed upon the usefulness and future possibilities of psychoanalysis for pedagogic purposes , curative and prophylactic .

		We learn , for instance , that lack of success in the business of teaching is to no inconsiderable degree due to the presence of powerful repressions in teachers themselves .

		May we hope that when pedagogues and students alike 268 THE DIAL I > r | .

		trml > T J7 shall have had the obstructive cobwebs cleared out of their unconscious by psychoanalytic exam - ination , we shall be able to bid welcome to an educational regime that with conscious intelli - gence frames a pedagogical technique bearing a genuine relation to the life problems of its sub - jects ?

		The book , while nowhere rising to the bril - liance of some of the Freudian writings them - selves , is probably the most careful and inclusive presentation yet published in English of the re - sults attained and the theories elaborated by
Freud	PERSON	and his followers .

		It excels in this respect such works as
Brill	PERSON	's `` Psychanalysis '' and
Hitsch	PERSON	- mann 's `` Freud 's Theories of the Neuroses . ''

		Un - fortunately , Dr.
Payne	PERSON	's translation can claim only a moderate measure of success .

		The over - literalness of the renderings has given numerous passages an irksome awkwardness and , occasion - ally , obscurity .

		One needs sometimes to trans - late back to the German to arrive at the intended nuance of meaning .

		Let us turn , now , to the theoretical structure reared by the psychoanalysts .

		We are entitled to ask : Leaving all questions of analytic detail and technique to one side , what are some of the basic contributions of the Freudian school to psychologic thinking ?

		First and foremost , I should say , is the new spirit of attitude and method that psychoanalysis has introduced into the study of the mind .

		The orthodox psychology , for all its disavowal of the older faculty-mon - gering , has never really succeeded in grasping the vast network of individual mental phenomena as a single growth rooting in the most primitive type of mental life we know of , the instinctive life .

		It would be too much to say that psycho - analysis has succeeded in reconstructing the order of differentiation of mental phenomena , but it has taken a more patient attitude toward the actual dynamics of the individual mind and is thus in a better position to ferret out gradually the development of the fundamental instincts into the higher forms of mentality .

		Psycho - analysis takes hold of chunks of mental life as they present themselves in experience ; it does not abstract driblets of mental experience for the purpose of classifying them and examining them under the microscope .

		In brief , the older psy - chology is an anatomy of mind , sometimes re - fined ; psychoanalysis is an entering wedge toward a physiology of mind , generally quite crude for the present .

		From the clear recognition of this difference of method results the conviction that the two types of psychologic inquiry are not in any true sense opposed to each other .

		They merely attack their subject-matter from distinct viewpoints .

		They will , each of them , in the long run be found to be indispensable and mu - tually reconcilable .

		The second point of capital importance that we must set down to the credit of psychoanalysis is the light it has thrown on the nature and functioning of the unconscious .

		To psychoanaly - sis the unconscious is not merely a negative deus ex machina which does convenient service in the explanation of memory and in the positing of a continuity of personality .

		It is a very real and active domain from which are worked the strings that move about the puppets of the conscious self .

		The naive assumption of a self-contained con - sciousness whose motivation is safely interpret - able in terms of conscious data alone has been exposed by the Freudian psychology as a huge fallacy .

		One of the most interesting and promising vistas that have been opened up , though I find it but little stressed by the psychoanalysts themselves , is the quantitative consideration of emotion and will .

		I am not referring to the measuring of reactions under controlled experi - mental conditions .

		When psychoanalysis tells us that the emotion belonging to a certain trend is not always discharged in consciousness but may in part be inhibited in the unconscious or transferred to other reactions , we are evidently confronted by certain quantitative implications .

		It seems difficult to avoid the inference of a cer - tain specific , theoretically measurable , sum of emotion or volitional impulse which can be di - vided up and distributed in a great variety of ways .

		The elaboration of the concepts that fol - low on the heels of this hypothesis has been but begun .

		It would not be surprising if this glim - mer of a quantitative understanding of mental functioning blossomed out in time to an exact - ness of comprehension of psychological processes such as we have hardly an inkling of at present .

		Among the more readily defined and generally recognized insights that we owe , directly or indi - rectly , to
Freud	ORGANIZATION	are the genetic analysis and the treatment of the neuroses , to a much smaller extent also of the psychoses -LRB- forms of insanity -RRB- ; the frequency and radical importance of symbol - formation in the unconscious mind , understand - ing of which is sure to prove indispensable for an approach to the deeper problems of religion , m < l arr ; the analysis and interpretation of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 269 dreams ; the basic importance of the psychic sex - ual constitution , not merely in its proper func - tional sphere , but also in connections that seem unrelated ; the far-reaching importance of infan - tile psychic experiences in adult life and the ever-present tendency to regression to them ; and the general light thrown on the problem of men - tal determinism .

		Many other points might be enumerated , some clearly defined , others contro - versial .

		Indeed , there has scarcely ever been a new road opened in science that so spontaneously and fruitfully branched out into tributary trails .

		It is true that hardly anything is known ' of the psychoanalytic problems and solutions with abso - lutely satisfying clarity .

		Yet it takes no bold man to assert that enough has been glimpsed to promise perhaps the greatest fructification that the study of the mind has yet experienced .

		There is a world which science knows nothing about and of whose existence intellect is igno - rant .

		It must be known immediately if at all ; it must be tasted , savored .

		Intellect gives us only knowledge about , and that is why it fails to reveal the more vital , the more real world familiar to those who know the ineffable joy of direct , warm contact with the reality which lies within and beyond what the blurring senses and the nibbling intellect disclose .

		The poverty of occidental life , the failure of western civiliza - tion , the restlessness of modern man and woman , all these are due to our infatuation with the clothes of the world and our disdain of the living personality within .

		After some such fashion ar - gues
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	.

		There is , of course , nothing startling or new in this appraisal of human intelligence .

		The his - tory of speculation is full of it .

		If there is any - thing novel about
Tagore	PERSON	, it is to be found in the way he attempts the liquidation of the bank - rupt West by drawing upon the spiritual riches of the
East	LOCATION	.

		And there , too , is the difficulty .

		Although
Tagore	PERSON	would lead us from the wrong philosophy of life to the right , and although he uses language as a medium , he refuses to define his terms .

		To define , he tells us , is to abstract and to kill .

		One must sense , taste , experience the truth or miss it quite .

		Real knowledge is not from without through appearance , but from within through sympathy .

		Man faces the world as body , with its hungers and thirsts ; as mind , with its craving to find out reason in things ; as per - son , with its needs of love .

		As the mind does not eat bread , leaving that to the body , so the person does not subsist on abstract facts , leaving those to the mind .

		`` It is the highest in man , this personal man .

		And it has personal relations of its own with the great world , and comes to it for something to satisfy personality . ''

		And here , urges
Tagore	PERSON	, science and logic give place to the creative impulse , that is to say , to art .

		`` When a feeling has been aroused in our hearts which is far in excess of the amount that can be absorbed by the object which has produced it , it comes back to us and makes us conscious of ourselves by its return waves . ''

		This conscious - ness of self , or personality , requires an outpour of expression , and thus art arises .

		Art is the display resulting from the consciousness of the wealth of personality .

		Consequently , in artistic creation man reveals himself rather than his ob - jects .

		Moreover , he reveals another world .

		As science arrives at a world of facts , forces , and laws , so art , through its creations , discloses a world of personality .

		For the consciousness of the inexhaustible abundance of personality which gives rise to art is awareness of a more than self ; it is awareness of the infinite in the personal man .

		`` In art the person in us is sending its answers to the
Supreme Person	ORGANIZATION	, who reveals Himself to us in a world of endless beauty across the light - less world of facts . ''

		This `` World of Personality '' is reserved for separate discussion in the second chapter .

		I have to confess that I make nothing of it .

		There are some pleasant passages and now and then a bit of penetrating criticism of occidental life , but for the most part metaphor steps on the heels of metaphor , ex cathedra assertions elbow , one another , lame analogies hobble on supported by the arm of occultism , and what I fear is beauti - ful verbiage is offered as profound wisdom backed by the authority of
Isha Upanishat	PERSON	.

		Words appear to have just meaning enough to enable the author to employ them in the demon - stration that they have no true meaning at all , and reason is reliable only when disproving its reliability .

		Formal definition is frowned upon , but snap definitions abound , and while scientific analysis and rigorous logic are asserted to be avenues of error , analysis and logic are not dis - pensed with .

		How could they be in an argu - 270 mi : DIAL -LSB-
September	DATE	J7 ment aiming to show us wherein and why man - kind is going astray and whither lie the happy isles ?

		No ; analysis and logic remain , but become irresponsible .

		In this regard
Tagore	PERSON	is true to the mystical type .

		There is a willingness , con - sciously or unconsciously , to make use of intel - lectual instrumentalities , but a refusal to accept the responsibility which goes with their use .

		As an example of how differently the thing may be done , one turns to
Samuel Butler	PERSON	's argument for the same thesis in his `` God the Known and God the Unknown . ''

		Starting , as does
Tagore	PERSON	, from the refusal of the human being to be psy - chically alone in the universe ,
Butler	PERSON	avowedly accepts the advantages and risks of intelligence and proceeds logically to prove that the universe is a person .

		Butler 's little volume should be read with
Tagore	PERSON	's `` The World of Personality . ''

		But as long as Tagore writes such vital , color - ful English as he does in places even in this chapter , he will be read , whatever faults he may be guilty of .

		This for a sample : From the beginning of his history man has been feeling the touch of personality in all creation , and trying to give it names and forms , weaving it in legends round his life and the life of his races , offer - ing it worship and establishing relations with it through countless forms of ceremonials .

		This feeling of the touch of personality has given the centrifugal impulse in man 's heart to break out in a ceaseless flow of reaction , in songs and pictures and poems , in images and temples and festivities .

		This has been the centripetal force which attracted men into groups and clans and communal organizations .

		And while man tills his soil and spins his cloths , mates and rears his children , toils for wealth and fights for power he does not forget to proclaim in languages of solemn rhythm , in mysterious symbols , in structures of majestic stone that in the heart of his world he has met the Immortal Person .

		In the sorrow of death , and suffering of despair , when trust has been betrayed and love desecrated , when existence be - comes tasteless and unmeaning , man standing upon the ruins of his hopes stretches his hands to the heavens to feel the touch of the Person across his darkened world .

		If the same man who wrote the second chapter wrote the third ,
Tagore	PERSON	is a striking case of dual personality .

		For the chapter entitled `` The Sec - ond Birth '' is not only clear and coherent where the preceding chapter is muddled and topsy - turvy , but is a well-sustained study in place of a hodgepodge of dubious , more or less related , observations .

		`` The Second Birth '' is written by a man who has experienced , observed , and thought , and not in average measure .

		And it makes sense , although the topic is profound .

		Moreover , it appears to differ in doctrine from what precedes .

		The senses and the intellect are no longer in such utter disgrace .

		On the con - trary , the life of the senses , of the intellect , of the spirit are so many planes of cooperating en - deavor in man 's effort to create a world in which he can feel at home out of the world which has been given him , and which is foreign and opprr > - sive .

		There is no break between the struggle for food , the craving for knowledge , the longing for union with the Universal One .

		Each leads through conflict with obstacles to a consciousness of self , the two former to a consciousness of self as desiring things other than they are ; the latter -LRB- that is why it is the second birth -RRB- , to a consciousness of self as striving to desire what should be desired .

		We thus find a defence instead of a denunciation of science , and the m \ > - tical experience of union with the Supreme Per - son is not isolated and insulated from all other experiences , but is the crowning success of an unbroken , though differentiated , creative effort reaching from the struggle of animals to adjust themselves to their physical environment to man 's consciousness of the Person in the world .

		The discussion of `` The Second Birth '' repre - sents the climax of the book .

		Three other chap - ters follow : an interesting one on the author 's school in
Bengal	LOCATION	, established for the purpose of educating youth toward rather than away from the life of the spirit ; another , evidently intended for disciples , entitled `` Meditation '' ; and the last , `` On Woman . ''

		The present age , this last chapter teaches , is a masculine age , an age of economics , politics , and their consequent mili - tarism .

		The absurdity of this type of civiliza - tion , thinks
Tagore	PERSON	, has become evident even to man , and there is hope that the lost social balance will be restored by putting the full weight of woman into the creation of the human world .

		Not , however , by encouraging the fem - inist movement , which is a symbol of vacuity and unrest , but by making possible the free play of woman 's superior socializing power .

		And this is to be secured through the passive quality which `` has given woman that large and deep placidity which is so necessary for the healing and nour - ishing and storing of life . ''

		Tagore deplores the \ \ extern woman 's loss of interest in the common things of life , and says , if I understand him , with more breadth of outlook to be sure , but with the - amc finality , what was asserted long ago by a member of the race which is just now without the bounds of our sympathetic imagination : Die voman 's blace is on der sthove .

1917	DATE	.

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	; 75 cts . -RRB-

		The Imagists come forward once more with their annual Anthology , and the publishers place a proper perhaps a necessary typographical emphasis on the date .

		The little group remains the same , whether in composition or in spirit : early rebels are still in the outer darkness , and no new converts have been admitted .

		Nor is the offering of
1917	DATE	very different from that of
1916	DATE	.

		Here they all are , very much like them - selves : the two A 's ,
Richard Aldington	PERSON	and his wife -LRB- `` H. D. '' -RRB- ; the two F 's , Fletcher and
Flint	LOCATION	; and the two L 's ,
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	and
Amy Lowell	PERSON	.

		Three are English ; three are American ; and if three , instead of two , were women , the symmetry , in all ways , had been com - plete .

		If poetry , in general , exacts the union of the intense -LRB- or concentrated -RRB- and of the sensuous ; if Imagist poetry , in particular , demands a short succession of brief , clean-cut pictures , with unifi - cation and humanization either permeating it or secured somehow before the end , then
Richard Aldington	PERSON	's `` Inarticulate Grief '' may be taken as a nearly perfect paradigm .

		Here is a sketch of it nine lines of its eighteen : Let the sea beat its thin torn hands In anguish against the shore ; Let it .

		.

		shriek out its agony Across waste sands and marshes ; .

		Let it sob and scream and laugh In a sharp fury , With white salt tears Wet on its writhen face ; ... For the sea is the cry of our sorrow .

		`` H. D. '' keeps to the Greeks Adonis , Pyg - malion ,
Eurydice	LOCATION	.

		Her sands run staccato through the reader 's mental fingers ; golden , per - haps , but yet sands .

		Some sweat of the reader 's mind is required to produce the moisture for remoulding all this yellow dryness into the form which it may have possessed in the mind of its creator .

		Perhaps no one of `` H. D. 's '' four elab - orate pieces quite equals `` The Shrine , '' of last year 's volume a poem which -LRB- on a second or third reading -RRB- declares itself a kind of criterion for the Compleat Imagist .

		Here are lines from `` The God , '' whose face is dark , set beneath heavy locks , circled with stiff ivy-fruit , clear , cut with great hammer-stroke , brow , nose and mouth , mysterious and far distant from my sense .

		I asked : can he from his portals of ebony carved with grapes , turn toward the earth ?

		The `` blasphemy '' of this last inquiry was re - buked ; the god could and did .

		The war is heard throughout the present vol - ume : in
Aldington	LOCATION	's `` Field Manoeuvres , '' in Fletcher 's `` Armies , '' a sombre yet vivid thing , and in
Flint	LOCATION	's concern with `` Searchlight '' and `` Zeppelins . ''

		From the latter : What is that behind the trees ?

		A flame-colored circle of light that glows and grows brighter and dimmer by turns .

		Is it an airship on fire ?

		It turns on , and moves nearer , slowly ; it swings clear of the trees the moon !

		Mr.
Flint	PERSON	, to a degree not shared by all his group , has a consciousness of human relationships and some concern for expressing them ; in his `` Dusk , '' particularly , and in his `` Soldiers , '' ad - dressed apparently to

		As `` H. D. , '' though of the New World , is always consistently anthological , and as
Amy Lowell	PERSON	is represented here solely by a series of Japanese pieces -LRB- already made familiar by `` Poetry '' -RRB- , the American note is struck by
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	alone .

		Two noteworthy things of his must be mentioned the `` Lincoln , '' in which a method that , to many , will still seem alien is applied with picturesqueness and pathos to a theme conspicuously indigenous ; and his `` Blackberry Harvest , '' a Bacchic revel with berry-picking children upon , it may be , the hill - sides of the poet 's native
Arkansas	LOCATION	: And there wells up in me a drunken impulse of autumn , To fling myself into the tangle ; ...

D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	is represented by a single rather long and elaborate poem , `` Terra Nuova , '' which might be vulgarly translated , `` The New Deal . ''

		Here , like some of the others , he passes through the smoke of war ; and here , as in his `` Erinnyes , '' of last year , he is concerned with war 's havoc .

		He ends as `` dead , '' `` trodden to nought , '' and then , with every vestige gone then I am here , discovered , setting my foot on another world ... Mr.

HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		English Sports and
Foreign Temperaments BEYOND	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is an intellectual aristocrat who has rebelled against his own class and yet presents it with self-evident justice and authority .

		He has drawn the iniquities of the lords of the earth , sometimes with bitter keenness , sometimes with sad gravity .

		And among those lords he has found a type which has always commanded the respect of Englishmen and Americans and is the justification of the class .

		This type is the good sport .

		The good sport is different from the gentle - man .

		He is better and stronger , including the gentleman and something more .

		For a gentle - man may be undeniably a fine gentleman and yet have too delicate nerves or be physically ill or timid or socially shy .

		The good sport is all there .

		He may be narrow-minded and not deeply educated , but he has a kind of mental courage ; and he takes physical courage for granted .

		He may be a Philistine , indifferent to the arts , but he has good bearing , social grace , and cultivated speech .

		He makes an excellent leader of soldiers .

		He maintains a calm manner in difficult circum - stances and keeps a stiff upper lip under the buf - fetings and sorrows of life .

		He is capable of deep passion , which goes with strong physique , and if necessary he conceals it with perfect self - discipline .

		As a matter of course he is honest , true to his word , and tries to be just in his treat - ment of equals and inferiors .

		He is not a snob , because well , because he is just too good a sport to be a snob .

		HD \ V often this admirable character appears in English society I , as a not much travelled Amer - ican , do not know .

		But we have met him fre - quently in the finer English novels , romantic and realistic .


Henry Esmond	PERSON	is a good sport ; the scene in which he denounces the prince is a classic exhibition of the English sportsmanlike attitude toward a fellow , a Frenchman , who has not played the game fairly .

		Such unlike individuals as
Trollope 's Duke	ORGANIZATION	,
Meredith	PERSON	's
Evan Harring	PERSON	- ton -LRB- who , you remember the point of the story , is not technically a gentleman -RRB- , and
Nevil Beau	PERSON	- champ , are all true to the type .

		Mr.
Gals	PERSON	- worthy 's Patrician is a perfect specimen .

		`` Beyond '' is a study of two good sports , father and daughter , who love intensely , suffer greatly , and bear their loss with fine fortitude .

		The story is a tragedy of sex , two tragedies indeed , cruelly moving and relentless , touched with some - what the same color that makes `` The Dark Flower '' so sombrely glowing .

		It is a greater story than `` The Dark Flower , '' and so is `` The Patrician , '' because the characters are stronger , their natures contain many forces besides sexual passion .

		Those who see in the story only a sen - sational appeal to our sexual emotions miss the theme .

		`` Che faro senza ? ''

		That is the motive .

		What shall I do when I have lost ?

		Take the blow with an unbowed head , pull through , and live for the other things and the other people that make up life .

		It is the gospel according to
Browning	PERSON	.

		Stake everything and pocket your losses without whimpering .

		Stoicism is an old philosophy , often enough repeated in abstract terms .

		The novelist here has shown real people , dominated by passion , terribly hurt by it , then dominant over their sorrow , and not so small as to indulge in regrets .

		It is a superb piece of work , so honestly and manfully conceived that I felt a momentary desire to assassinate the `` lit - erary editor '' of a
Boston	LOCATION	newspaper who ex - pressed the piously prudish hope that in this book Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	had sung his `` swan song '' of sex .

		If the English novelist finds among his own countrymen models of steady-headed , sound - hearted , thoroughbred heroes who are , however , human , passionate , liable to taste the Heaven and the Hell of illicit relations -LRB- and so shock lit - erary editors who ought to be in a nunnery -RRB- if the English novelist feels that a man like Win - ton in `` Beyond '' is English to the backbone , why does the novelist always have to go abroad
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 273 for the contrasting , irresponsible `` artistic tem - perament '' ?

		Is the country that produced
Byron	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	not regarded by its own novelists as capable of producing erratic geniuses ?

		I suppose Svengali had to be , or pretend to be , a Pole , and the pianist in
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's `` Sa - cred and Profane Love '' had to be the same sort of mongrel -LRB- Scotch and Danish plus a Spanish stepfather ! -RRB-

		, and
Galsworthy	PERSON	's `` fiddler fellow , '' whose music snares Gyp , had to be a Swede .

		That
England	LOCATION	- is not prolific of musicians is a matter of fact , and it is true that musicians , because of their art , are plausible perturbers of English girls and dramatic foils to unmusical Englishmen .

		But , aside from the enchantments of music and the supposed wildness o ' f musicians , the Englishman seems to regard erotic vivacity and romance as extra-English , continental , even Scotch or Irish , but not English .

		When Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	wishes to give to Major
Winton	PERSON	's daughter a little more of the artistic and romantic than appears in her equally peccant but four-fourths English father , he provides her with an Italian maternal grandmother .

		That , added to difference of sex , accounts for anything in Gyp that is not in her sire .

		-LRB- And Gyp is perfectly her father 's daughter a rare thing in fiction , as
Stevenson	PERSON	said of
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	and his mother . -RRB-

		Another added foreign touch which makes Gyp understandable to English - men among whom prevails the greater than the great commandments : `` Really , you know , it is n't done ! ''

		is her name .

		A girl whose name is Gyp can defy English society , whereas a girl named
Anne or Ruth	PERSON	-LRB- as a much bolder girl might be named -RRB- would be simply smothered .

		I do not mean to be flippant in discussing this point or any point connected with such a sincere book as `` Beyond . ''

		This apparently trivial ques - tion goes to the heart of international issues , which are terribly vexed just now .

		Mr.
Gals	PERSON	- worthy calls her Gyp , which to my mind sug - gests a Frenchwoman -LRB- is it not the nom de guerre of a modern French novelist ? -RRB-

		.

		Would Gyp have done what she did if her name had been
Lydia ?	PERSON

		Or did her parents name her Gyp because they subconsciously selected the name appropriate to the kind of character they were transmitting ?

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's heroine in `` Sacred and Profane Love '' is named
Carlotta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Did you ever know an English girl or an American girl of
New England	ORGANIZATION	stock named Gyp or Carlotta ?

		Car - lotta 's nice , respectable aunt is named
Constance	PERSON	, of course .

		What would have happened if the aunt had been named
Carlotta	ORGANIZATION	and the niece ,
Constance	PERSON	?

		How does the title of Meredith 's novel sound if we change it to `` Mabel of the Crossways '' ?

		This is not a play with names .

		It is a play with the romance which is around names and with the habit of English novelists of ascribing romantic ideas and ethical irregu - larities to foreign-sounding names , even when the names designate persons of pure or prepon - derant English stock .

		Is the reason for this that the nations find in other nations villainies and indecencies unknown at home , and also romance unknown at home ?

		Is it possible that villainies and indecencies and romance go together because we all like them ' but do not dare indulge them at home ?

		Do we not assimilate to ourselves and our na - tion all the respectable virtues and impute to for - eigners things that are not quite nice and proper , even when for some of the things that are not nice and proper we have a secret liking ?

		We suspect our neighbors , dare not be as they are , or , assuming superiority , would not be as they are .

		One aspect of this idea is gently satirized in ``
Beauchamp	PERSON	's Career '' ; the misgivings which
Beauchamp	PERSON	's love affair causes in the hearts of his good English relatives are partly due to the fact that
Renee	PERSON	is a Frenchwoman .

		I do not know -LRB- for one person can not know the literature of all the nations -RRB- how far con - tinental novelists show a corresponding feeling of contempt , or suspicion , or romantic strange - ness , for each other and for
England	LOCATION	.

		There is a story by
Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, the name of which I forget , which turns on a Frenchman 's detesta - tion of all things English ; that , of course , is not
Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's attitude but the attitude he as - scribes to his character .

		A
Spaniard	ORGANIZATION	told me that in his national literature there is no trace of such hostility to the English as English liter - ature betrays toward the Spaniard .

		Is it too much to hope that after the war we may begin to rid ourselves of the superstitions of national su - periority , and at the same time to discover and prize the fine shades of difference which arise from and give value to independent national de - velopment ?

		Not only may our state of mind im - prove ; the English have already learned that Frenchmen , Belgians , and Poles can be good sports : but the facts of national life may im - prove ; perhaps in time
England	LOCATION	may have musi - cians as great as her novelists .

		JOHN MACY 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 27	DATE	Discipline MARCHING MEN .

		By
Sherwood Anderson	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		It is a curious , mixed , provocative , and occa - sionally exasperating book , this second novel of Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's ; but it is also interesting chiefly , to my mind , as the exhibition of a tem - perament and the setting forth of a point of view that is highly idiosyncratic .

		Naturally all brief characterizations are unfair , but I suppose `` Marching Men '' might be described as a pasan to order and -LRB- quite incidentally , I hope -RRB- a naked and somewhat febrile celebration of force .

		It is , in fact , too insistently , too stridently and re - morselessly dedicated to the main theme to make a wholly satisfactory novel .

		Nevertheless , it seems to me only natural that a book celebrating order , even a little shrilly , should have grown out of all the clutter and confusion of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and no doubt we should have had such a book even if Mr.
Wells	PERSON	had n't long since set the fashion .

		In the days following the World 's Fair Chi - cago began to accustom itself to criticism none too tolerantly at first .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	was able to raise the dust by his mild animadversions on the architectural peculiarities of
Cottage Grove Avenue	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such criticisms were easily dismissed as the morbidities of a sense refined , and possibly over-refined , by a prolonged familiarity with softer European surfaces , the vagaries , in short , of a delicate ego .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	, on the con - trary , although he studies the
Chicago	LOCATION	of the same period , has little to say of our aesthetic lapses .

		No ; what troubles him is our spiritual untidiness , our stupidity in the sphere of social integration , our vast welter of meaningless and frustrate lives .

		He is expressing , in other words , what has become the conventionality of the mo - ment , but expressing it with a great deal of pas - sion and in a way that is distinctive enough to excite interest .

		It is worth noting that neither our crudity nor our violence disturbs him .

		Force indeed , far from repelling him , fascinates him with what I can only call a slightly pathological fascination .

		His hero is a Berserker with a big fist , whose most potent argument is always a blow .

		There is a corresponding violence in Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's own method .

		He sets his theme , for example , on the third page .

		`` Standing in the doorway and looking up and down the bleak village street , some dim realization of the dis - organized ineffectiveness of life as he knew it came into the mind of the McGregor boy . ''

		And on the next page , the boy reflects : `` If I could form the men of this place into an army I would lead them to the mouth of the old
Shumway	PERSON	cut and push them in ... ''
McGregor	PERSON	is then a lad of fourteen or so , living in
Coal Creek	LOCATION	,
Penns	LOCATION	\ I - vania .

		I daresay there are bespectacled little monsters with a premature appetite for political philosophy who might muse so ; but a boy simply bursting with vigor , a boy like `` Cracked '' Mc -
Gregor	PERSON	's son ; no , no !

		The love of order has always seemed to me to be distinctly a middle - aged virtue , associated with flagging vitality and the inability to absorb shocks .

		By this failure of the retrospective imagination , we are earlv warned to expect no nuances in Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's book , and so we are prepared for other reflections of this untaught miner 's son .

		Men of Coal Creek ... listen to the voice of Mc -
Gregor	PERSON	.

		I hate you ... I hate you because you are weak and disorganized like cattle .

		I would like to come among you teaching the power of force .

		I would like to slay you one by one , not with weapons but with my naked fists .

		If they have made you work like rats buried in a hole they are right .

		It is the man 's right to do what he can .

		Get up and fight .

		Fight and I 'll get on the other side and you can fight me .

		I 'll help drive you back into your holes .

		An adolescent
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	might conceivably have heated his brain with such flights , but
McGregor	PERSON	is throughout the foe of intellect .

		Why talk ?

		Babbling makes a man loose-jawed and flabby .

		`` On and on through life we go , socialists , dream - ers , makers of laws , sellers of goods and believers in suffrage for women and we continuously say words , worn-out words , crooked words , words without power or pregnancy in them . ''

		When McGregor arrives in
Chicago	LOCATION	as a youth of eighteen or so , he is already filled with contempt for the talkers and there runs in his head the thought of marching men a troop of soldiers that had put down a riot at
Coal Creek	ORGANIZATION	.

		That vision is the nucleus of his whole philosophy the `` goose-step '' is the way to solidarity .

		And so he sets the workers of
Chicago	LOCATION	to marching .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's is surely the last word of anti- intellectualism ; for the men who follow Mc -
Gregor	PERSON	do not know why they are marching or whither .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	doubtless took his cue from the solidarity of the peoples at war , but he forgets that if the leaders of those men are quite as cynical as McGregor with regard to the think - ing-powers of their men , they are still careful to supph substitutes .

		They manufacture public opinion and attach men to necessary purposes by
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 275 holding forth the lure of ideals .

		So far as I am able to see , McGregor offers the marchers no end beyond the manifestation of power the power of the workers .

		Marching satisfies a deep disposition .

		Very well , let them march , and trust to luck that the collectivist mind will emerge .

		To present a programme would be only to repeat the old intellectualist fallacy of the socialists and the organizers .

		The habit of thinking in terms of groups and masses has rather blunted , I fancy , Mr.
Ander	PERSON	- son 's sense of the intimate and the personal .

		There are fugitive glints of tenderness here and there , such as McGregor 's attachment to the memory of his father or his yearning toward the once despised miners who follow his mother 's coffin up the hillside ; but on the whole his emo - tional life , even in the most intimate relations , as those with the tuberculous girl , the plow - manufacturer 's daughter , and the little milliner whom he finally marries , is disturbingly arid .

		With a dim sense of his mission in life , Mc -
Gregor	PERSON	instinctively fears love .

		Women are re - morselessly possessive .

		And so McGregor sets himself the problem of loving without yielding to love .

		He rejects as contemptible the easy solu - tion of the artistic barber , who prowls by
night	TIME	and ogles by day .

		He often poses the problem , but in the end he does not solve it : he marries the little milliner , who has become a habit and will not divert his attention , rather than the plow-manufacturer 's daughter , who has awak - ened his passion .

		You are left to infer , if you like , that McGregor ends as he had begun by distrusting passion as the lure of the gods seeking to snare men for their own purposes .

		Take the scene in which the two women struggle for Mc -
Gregor	PERSON	's love : `` Stop , '' she cried .

		`` I do not want you .

		I would never marry you now .

		You belong to her .

		You are
Edith	PERSON	's . ''

		McGregor 's voice became soft and quiet .

		`` Oh , I know , '' he said ; `` I know !

		I know !

		But I want children .

		Look at
Edith	LOCATION	.

		Do you think she could bear children to me ? ''

		A change came over
Edith Carson	PERSON	.

		Her eyes hard - ened and her shoulders straightened .

		`` That 's for me to say , '' she cried , springing forward and clutching his arm .

		`` That is between me and God .

		If you intend to marry me come now and do it .

		I was not afraid to give you up and I 'm not afraid that I shall die bearing children . ''

		And after the decision is made
McGregor	PERSON	says : One struggles to keep a thought in mind , to be im - personal , to see that life has a purpose outside his own purpose .

		You have perhaps made that struggle .

		You see I 'm making it now .

		I 'm going to take
Edith	PERSON	and go back to work .

		There is an insensitiveness here that reflects itself even in the words .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's anti- intellectualism will allow him to leave nothing to the reader ; he ca n't trust us to understand , and therefore he shouts instead of whispering .

		But I venture to doubt whether even a parish - ioner of the Reverend
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	or a disciple of Professor
Pearson	PERSON	really takes the great leap in quite that spirit .

		To offset such deficiencies , Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	has the skill to make you feel the thick press of life in great cities .

		The background of that clut - tered , disorderly , and violent life of the old South Side , with its Red-Light district that was notor - ious from
Shanghai	LOCATION	to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, is effec - tively realized .

		Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	knows how mixed was the whole network of influences that en - meshed the town , from highest to lowest , and he shows very well the kind of civilization Chi - cago had then achieved .

		His touch in the boule - vards seems to me less sure , but then I should think the boulevards interest him very little , and he will not mind having such an impression recorded , especially since it is as far as possible from being an expert one .

		But when all is said Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	's book interested me chiefly as the expression of a vigorous and sincere mind , a thoroughly individual mind , that stirs one to argument and tempts one to forget the author 's own contempt for the chattering animal that is man -

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS
ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE	PERSON	, Per - sonal Recollections by his cousin , Mrs.
Dis	PERSON	- ney
Leith	PERSON	.

		Putnam 's ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		A first feeling of disappointment comes when one discovers , at page 38 , that the recollections are finished .

		The disappointment is a compound of surprise at their short length and mild anger at their lack of interest .

		No comment can sur - pass , no , nor equal , the certain effect of quota - tion .

		Here are two bits : `` When he was at Brooke my mother and I went to see him after he was established there .

		He carried me off up to his own room , which he exhibited with great glee , saying : ` Everything in this room is mine . '

		I immediately pointed to a very large family portrait of a lady and child , saying : ` Is that yours ? '

		` No but everything else is . ' ''

		That is quoted as an example , presumably , of
Algernon	PERSON	's early aptness at repartee .

		And this , `` And what - ever his religious opinions were or were not , however much they had departed from those of 276 THE DIAL -LSB- Septembr our upbringing as doubtless they did in later days I never , in our years of unfettered and most familiar intercourse , remember him to have said anything to shock or distress me , or any - thing that was undesirable for me , as a child or girl , to hear , '' gives us the comforting assurance that one of
England	LOCATION	's great poets never shocked his female cousins .

		The remaining 218 pages are given to letters of little or no interest , which contain no particularly valuable references to people or events .

		The whole volume contains practically nothing that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has not pre - sented , in one way or another , in his recent biog - raphy of the poet .

		THROUGH
RUSSIA	LOCATION	IN WAR TIME .

		By
C. Fillingham Coxwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Scribner 's ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Political
Russia	LOCATION	is of more vital interest than physical
Russia	LOCATION	; but at the moment when the fate of that nation seems to centre in one city , it is not amiss to remember that
Petrograd	LOCATION	is one of the least representative cities of the new republic and that behind all its changes and its transitory emotions there lies the great mass of the Russian people , sturdy , industrious , and im - movable .

		To consider them steadies one 's sense of proportion .

		Mr.
Coxwell	PERSON	's book enables one so to consider them , for he has had a rare op - portunity for observation , since he travelled in
1915	DATE	from
Petrograd	LOCATION	to the
Crimea	LOCATION	, and back by way of Tiflis , the Caspian , and the
Volga	LOCATION	, to
Finland	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		He has seen life in the cities and in the tents of nomad peoples .

		Nor did an imperfect acquaintance with Russian de - ter him from undertaking any journey that prom - ised returns in the matter of interest or of amusement .

		The faithful recital of his experi - ences in all these places forms a volume of un - usual interest in spite of a rather stilted manner , and the fact that the examination of a passport receives as much conscientious attention as a voy - age up the
Volga	LOCATION	or a visit to a Kalmuck village .

		The book is proof that the simple truth may be interesting , but in general we are willing to as - sume this without proof .

		THE CONSTITUTION OF
CANADA	LOCATION	.

		By
Wil	PERSON	-
liam R. Riddell	PERSON	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		During the past academic year the lectures on the
Dodge Foundation	ORGANIZATION	at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	were delivered by Judge
Riddell	PERSON	, of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of
Ontario	LOCATION	.

		The subject discussed was the con - stitutional system of
Canada	LOCATION	, and the four lec - tures have now been published .

		The brevity of the book is such that only an outline of historical development is possible ; even `` The Constitution in its Actual Workings '' and `` A Comparative View '' are set forth only on broad lines .

		Fur - thermore , the subject is treated with a non-legal audience always in mind .

		The student of history and government , as well as the student of law , will gain little from the volume , although a leu comparisons of the advantages and disadvam of the constitutional systems operating on the two sides of the Great Lakes challenge attention .

		Persons knowing nothing of the Canadian gov - ernment and desiring a brief , simple treatise on it , will find the little book useful .

		Generaliza - tions are indulged in with much freedom , and some are open to question .

		It certainly is not true , for example , that the American power of impeaching the President is `` as dead as the royal veto '' in
England	LOCATION	.

		THE EMANCIPATION OF
THE AM ERR CITY	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Walter Tallmadge Arndt	PERSON	.

		Duf - field ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		A delightful book to read is this , both because of the ease with which the author expresses him - self , even when dealing with matters of complex municipal finance , and because of his evident fa - miliarity with the city as an industrial , social , and political community .

		Home rule appears to the author to be the first step toward a solution of the many problems of the modern city .

		Not only is the achievement of this step necessary to enable the city to direct its affairs in its own interest , but it is indispensable to the training of its citizens in moral self-direction .

		Concentra - tion of business and political responsibility through commission government -LRB- or its equiva - lent -RRB- , the short ballot , separation of local from national political issues , the substitution of inde - pendent for partisan tickets , an adequate and irreproachable civil service , the regulation and curtailment of public-utility franchises , the ra - tionalization and standardization of the finance methods of the city within the limits at least of solvency these are some of the most important reforms explained and urged .

		Such other more or less familiar topics as the initiative and refer - endum , the recall , preferential primaries , and reformed taxation are not forgotten .

		The view - point of the author is decidedly sane and pro- gressive , and the book may be trusted to hold the interest of the average reader .

		MUNICIPAL FUNCTIONS .

		By
Herman G. James	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		`` Municipal Functions '' is the twelfth number in the `` National Municipal League Series . ''

		It is popular in style , practical in aim but scientific in method , and will give the general reader an excellent perspective of the modern problems of dty government .

		Among the most important Chapters are two entitled `` Public Morals '' ami `` Social Welfare . ''

		Here the author definitely
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 277 asserts the responsibility of the municipal govern - ment for better morals and greater welfare .

		He takes a liberal attitude toward
Sunday	DATE	amuse - ments .

		As regards the saloon and liquor prob - lem , he comes to the rather regrettable conclusion that this issue should be decided locally .

		Ade - quate provision must be made for suitable public recreation and in such a programme adults are not to be overlooked .

		He favors a board of censorship which shall examine moving-picture films before production , and thinks that in view of the difficulties involved in controlling the com - mercial dance halls , the city might experiment with municipal dance halls .

		He also urges vigor - ous action for the elimination of the social evil .

		Better housing is discussed but unusual em - phasis is laid on the limitations of municipal action and on the necessity of fundamental social reform to meet the real need .

		Cities can do much to lessen unemployment and to improve working conditions , though they alone can not solve the problem , and there is need of better free medical care and legal aid for the poor .

		COMMUNITY DRAMA .

		By
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	; 50 cts .

		There is a gap that is not to be bridged be - tween the written and the spoken language .

		An address set down in cold print , lacking the warm , dramatic appeal furnished by the speaker , is likely to prove an unsatisfying husk at best .

		At the worst and this is especially true of the in - timate and emotional , of the more informal , ad - dress its very form puts the reader on his guard against being cozened into accepting something fraudulent .

		It is rather hard to realize precisely what the value of such a book as Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's may be .

		In its original form , as an address delivered be - fore the
American Civic Association	ORGANIZATION	, it may have fulfilled its purpose of interpretation and sug - gestion .

		Printed , it is too slight to be of much value to the student of sociology or of the drama , nor specific enough to be of service to those in - terested in the practical aspects of the pageant or community play , and too emotional too senti - mental to carry conviction to the intellectually aware .

		Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	undoubtedly has something to say about community drama .

		His belief in its revolutionary character is worth a hearing .

		His suggestion that cooperative drama , in our military training camps and in our towns and cities and rural communities , should prove a democratizing influence deserves consideration .

		If , in his very real enthusiasm , he is over sanguine with regard to what community drama may be able to ac - complish in the way of helping to establish the `` International Mind '' and of affording an outlet for self-expression other than war that is easy to forgive .

		But it is difficult to find justification for a presentation so sentimental , so inadequate , so not quite worth while , as this .

		WOMEN OF
BELGIUM	LOCATION	.

		By
Charlotte Kel	PERSON	- logg , with an introduction by
Herbert C. Hoover	PERSON	.


Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Readers who delighted in the vivid pictures of
Belgium	LOCATION	given to us by
Charlotte Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	in the `` Atlantic Monthly '' under the title of `` A Ci - nema of the C. R. B. , '' will be pleased to see them reappear with the addition of new `` reels . ''

		Mrs.
Kellogg	PERSON	, the only American woman mem - ber of the
Committee for Relief	ORGANIZATION	in
Belgium	LOCATION	, worked in that country for several months among the French and Belgian women , and , at the request of Mr.
Herbert Hoover	PERSON	, she has written of their work .

		There are many angles of vision , of course , from which one may consider the conditions in
Belgium	LOCATION	, and Mrs.
Kellogg	PERSON	has elected to put her emphasis , not upon the source of the Belgian calamity , but rather upon the spiritual reaction of the women to the set of circumstances imposed upon them .

		For , as Mr.
Hoover	PERSON	says in his introduction to this volume , `` At first the morale of a whole people was crusht ... but slowly and largely by the growth of the
Relief Organi	ORGANIZATION	- zation and the demand it has made upon their exertion and their devotion , this morale has re - covered to a fine flowering of national spirit and stoical resolution . ''

		The particular work of the women has consisted -LRB- to quote Mr.
Hoover	PERSON	again -RRB- in the `` discrimination of the destitute from those who can pay , and the determination of their needs . ''

		By the convincing method of telling of inci - dents of which she was a witness , Mrs.
Kellogg	PERSON	has paid a great tribute to the women of Bel - gium .

		For example , in describing the soup can - tines , she speaks of the women who had ladled out soup for seven hundred days without inter - mission .

		She says , `` That day , a woman who had not before served on the soupes offered her services to the seasoned workers .

		They were grateful , but smilingly advised her to go home , fill her bath-tub with water , and ladle it out to repeat this the following day and the following , until finally she might return , ready to endure the work , and above all not to retard the ` Line ' five unnecessary minutes !

		Two and a half years have not dulled the tenderness of these women toward the wretched ones they serve . ''

		One notes many touching expressions of devotion toward the unfortunate : the conversion , for instance , of the
Antwerp Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	into a sewing-room for those greatly in need of employ - ment , where the favorite baritone `` of this one - 278 THE DIAL f
September 27	DATE	time concert-hall comes twice a week to stand in the midst of the packing-cases behind his ac - customed footlights to sing to this audience driven in by disaster and to teach them the beau - tiful Flemish folk-songs . ''

		For the Belgians set great store by their astonishing sense of rhythm , and they still preserve their feeling for decorative effect .

		The conditions which Mrs.
Kellogg	PERSON	describes are new to most of us .

		The Belgian women have been even more heroic than we realized , and their frugality , which she tells of at length , especially in regard to the use of foodstuffs their ability to `` present variety from apparent uniformity '' - is full of suggestion for the patriotic housekeeper .

		THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION OF AX AMER -
ICAN	ORGANIZATION	CITIZEN .

		By
Francis Greenwood Pea	PERSON	- body .

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The homelessness of the American boy .

		the religion of the college student , the relation of universities to the social conscience , American character , its debits and credits , the failure of pessimistic , institutional Christianity , all these topics suffer from the decrepitudes of age ; but in
Francis Greenwood Peabody	PERSON	's new book they re - ceive a very frank , comprehensive , whole-visioned treatment .

		Dr.
Peabody	PERSON	was something like a radical twenty years ago .

		and unlike many former radicals of the clergy , he is still at least a pro- gressive .

		`` For one educated youth who is alien - ated from religion by the persuasions of science , philosophy , or art , ten , we may be sure , are es - tranged by an irrational or impracticable teaching of religion . ''

		`` To do for others has seemed to the tradition of the Church a superadded and secondary effect of religion , rather than one of its essential and original factors . ''

		`` Much
Chris	PERSON	- tian teaching is still in effect social pessimism . ''

		These and much besides stamp the author as more than usually keen and genuine .

		Some patent defects that one grieves so often to find in religious writers of prominence are an over-reliance on pretty verbosities , a habit of glib mosaic of Biblical quotation designed to fit into modern problems -LRB- going back for its warrant to the infallibility of the scriptures -RRB- , and a trait that naturally goes with the latter an odd com - bination of sound and serious reflection with ramshackle logic .

		But there is plenty of meat in this book .

		Chapter four , `` The Universities and the Social Conscience , '' is good reading de - spite the opening claim that the present genera - tion has `` discovered '' the social conscience .

		This is true only in the sense that the age of Elizabeth discovered
America	LOCATION	.


John Smith	PERSON	is no further from
Columbus	LOCATION	than the `` present generation '' from the early socialists .

		Chapter five , giving its title to the book , is also extremely suggestive .

		True , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is given credit for origin - ating the observation that Christianity has `` nut been tried and found wanting , but found difficult and never tried . ''

		Though the words are Ches - terton 's ,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, and if one mistakes not .

		Pascal before him .

		gave the idea currency .

		`` The Conversion of Militarism '' is an excellent com - mentary for our times on
William James	PERSON	's sug - gestion of a `` Moral Equivalent for War . ''

		Those who years ago admired `` Christianity and the Social Crisis '' as who did not ?

		will welcome this book with the same satisfaction .

		BRAZIL TODAY AND TOMORROW .

		By
L. G. Elliott	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		Long acquaintance with , and an intimate knowledge of , Brazilian affairs , industrial , finan - cial , and commercial have equipped the author of this work to write not only with fulness , , r fact , but also with a perspective of values not often found in any encyclopaedic compendium .

		It is a handbook of information culled from reliable sources and illustrated with many ex - amples drawn from a rich experience of residence and travel in this the largest of the American republics .

		The author is interested primarily in trade rather than in nature and man .

		He portrays the history of this land to whose stocks not only the aborigines and the best strains of the Portuguese and Spanish peoples have con - tributed but also Germans , Italians .

		French .

		Dutch , British , Russians ,
Syrians	LOCATION	, and Japanese , to say nothing of the large negro element brought as slaves .

		The self-exiled Americans who emigrated to
Brazil	LOCATION	at the close of our Civil War have all vanished .

		The rapid rise of American trade and commerce has brought to this sister republic , however , an increasing con - tribution from our civilization .

		Lack of com - munication and diversity of climatic conditions and agricultural interests tend to isolate the na - tional groups , with the result that there is less fusion of cultures and of sentiment in Bra/il than in our own melting-pot .

		The author 's analysis of these results of coloni/ation is par - ticularly illuminating in view of the present crisis in the provinces of the south , where Teu - tonic influences predominate .

		The greater part of the book deals with matters of transportation .

		industry , and finance , with internal and foreign rommerce , and with the problems of the develop - ment of the vast and as yet almost untouched irces of this great empire .

		The author is not blind to , nor oblivious of , the ha/anU which attend the utili/ation of such resources nor un - appreciatixe of the qualities of enterprise , re - sourcefulness , and skill demanded of those who seek to control nature in the tropics .

		One finds here a very full account of railroad de \ elopment
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 279 in
Brazil	LOCATION	, of the coffee , rubber , matte , cotton , tobacco , sugar , and cacao industries , and of the movements of trade and industrial developments in
Brazil	LOCATION	in the last decade .

		A SOLDIER OF
FRANCE	LOCATION	TO His MOTHER .

		Translated by
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	.

		A.
C. McClurg	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	, in his
Paris	LOCATION	letter of some time ago to THE DIAL and in the introduction to his own admirable translation of these `` Lettres d'un Soldat '' has said with grace and judgment nearly all there is to say about this `` picture of the in - terior of a soul . ''

		It is composed of a series of letters and jottings sent from a sensitive young artist-soldier to his mother during the period from
August 6 , 1914	DATE	to
April 6 , 1915	DATE	, upon which latter day the author `` disappeared . ''

		It must be a source of great comfort to the mother to feel that , after all , her son achieved in these letters something like complete artistic expres - sion of his noble nature , to know of the wide recognition they have had in
France	LOCATION	, and to learn that now they are given in English to
America	LOCATION	, which needs their lesson and their inspiration .

		They represent the reaction to the tedium and horror of war of a mind trained in artistic and intellectual pursuits , unused to contact with the sordid side even of peaceful life .

		One might suppose that such a man could reap only a sorry harvest of despair from out the trench mud and cannon shock .

		But he contrives so to adapt him - self to his new surroundings that out of his experiences there rise flights of spiritual song , renewed consecrations to a task difficult , even repugnant , and glorified visions of a steadfast faith in the ultimate good of things war in - cluded .

		In the
autumn months of 1914	DATE	, the writer speaks oftenest of the companionship he finds in Nature .

		His words , as they paint the scenes of pink and gold and blue that his brush could not catch , are the words of an artist ; his meditations , like those of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, to whom indeed he has been compared , are assured and tranquil , transcending in their sustained flight all the roar of guns and the cries of wounded , even all self .

		In
February	DATE	and
March	DATE	there comes a tempo - rary depression .

		There is one haunting plaint for the days and the way of life that he begins to see are no more .

		Then once more he mounts to more serene heights than he has known , where he learns that total self-abnegation is the sure way to knowledge .

		As
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	says , in the preface to the French edition , `` What counts for him through these weary weeks , what he loves to recall afterwards , what he would ever find again and never lose are those supreme moments in which he felt self-forgetfulness because he had felt the ineffable . ''

		PORFIRIO DIAZ .

		By
David Hannay	PERSON	.


Henry Holt	PERSON	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The life of
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	is the latest addition to the series , `` Makers of the Nineteenth Cen - tury . ''

		The events of the last six years might lead one to doubt whether
Mexico	LOCATION	is yet fully `` made . ''

		But Mr.
Hannay	PERSON	wisely cautions his readers to remember that
Diaz	PERSON	or any other who would labor for the betterment of that country must inevitably find the average native a most discouraging obstacle to progress .

		His natural characteristics , mental inertness , a fondness for pulque , and an attachment to community life , three centuries of repression under the Spanish colonial system , and a century of exploitation at the hands of local caciques and military dicta - tors , hardly prepared him for rapid acquisition of culture and material prosperity at the close of the nineteenth century .

		Neither were the re - sources of the country adequate to the task , nor its physiography favorable for a united effort toward those desirable ends .

		But
Diaz	PERSON	did his best , and if he wrought more rapidly than wisely , with more reliance upon force than upon persua - sion , he at least afforded his country one gener - ation in which exploitation took a peaceful turn .

		If this is the best that one can say for his rule , it is at least a welcome contrast to the half-cen - tury of anarchy that preceded it , or the six weary years of strife that have followed his exile .

		The story of
Diaz	PERSON	's own life is a fascinating one .

		The steps by which the humble farrier 's son became a law-student , the local political boss of his district , the successful general , the astute national politician , the leader of a successful re - volt -LRB- apparently a necessary step in Latin Amer - ica -RRB- , the chief magistrate of
the Republic	ORGANIZATION	and its acknowledged dictator , are told with sufficient clearness , and with a grasp of fundamental causes that makes the book doubly acceptable .

		One misses the sickening eulogies of a decade ago , and also the bitter tirades of more recent times , though the author is apparently familiar with both , and with contemporary life in Latin Amer - ica .

		Mr.
Hannay	PERSON	is not sympathetic ; neither is he savagely critical .

		He does not seem to have much hope of immediate betterment in
Mexico	LOCATION	, nor does he unduly blame
Diaz	PERSON	for not training a successor , when such an individual must prove an immediate rival and break down his work in his own lifetime .

		If this actually happened , despite his utmost efforts to forestall such a catastrophe ; if his material creations largely fell into ruins along with the heavy-handed police power that he exercised , it was because
Diaz	PERSON	, after all , was but a man , and not the super - human being that imaginative writers formerly created for us .

		280 THE DIAL -LSB-
September	DATE	J7 N. .

		I i > ON N I u I 'M I M.N `` Bromley Neighborhood , '' by
Alice Brown	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is not a story of the war , though , since it takes place in
1914	DATE	, it must , as its author explains , be colored by the Great War `` as all life will henceforth be colored forever - more . ''

		It is the story of such a community as may be found in
New England	LOCATION	and occasionally out of it a community shut off from the rest of the world as a result , not so much of geogra - phy as of an essential insularity of spirit .

		All its passion was spent in its youth .

		In comfort - able middle age , warmed by pride of blood and pride of acres , it sits , if not oblivious of , at least indifferent to , the world that roars outside .

		Au - tomatically , individuals narrow themselves to its confines grow old and mellow or old and tart in the charmed circle they have drawn for them - selves .

		Occasionally youth breaks away , but the community remains unchanged .

		The lives of the little group of families that compose the community called
Bromley Neigh	ORGANIZATION	- borhood furnish Miss
Brown	PERSON	with a theme that is almost epic .

		Her story is the story of a race of men , not of individuals .

		She follows the intertwined destinies of her characters with a consciousness of the past in which they are so firmly rooted , that is so vivid as to make the story seem sometimes almost symbolic , if not scientific a study in heredity .

		Halfway through the book , the war enters .

		America is not yet a participant ; but to all the characters in the book that amount to anything , the war is already `` our '' war .

		What Miss
Brown	PERSON	calls the spirit of old
New England	LOCATION	incites them to a holy mili - tarism .

		They are ready , as their ancestors of yore , to give all they have for freedom for the Right as they see it .

		And their new faith , which takes them far beyond the narrow spiritual con - fines of their neighborhood , is bright enough to furnish light for the unravelling of tangled per - sonal problems .

		War does , after all , give indi - viduals a chance to save their souls .

		Perhaps the men and women of
Bromley Neighborhood	ORGANIZATION	are a little too consistent , even for
New England	LOCATION	, where consistency is said to be so common a jewel as to pass unnoticed ; perhaps
Miss Brown	PERSON	is a shade unsympathetic toward those characters in whom the spirit of
New England	LOCATION	has shrunk and crystallized into something different .

		But on the whole , the people of
Bromley Neighborhood	ORGANIZATION	are real people with reactions that are , on the whole , true deadly true .

		In spite of the almost ecstatic hope of the book , indeed because of that hope , it leaves the unbeliever hopeless .

		People will not give to peace the passion that they give to war .

		There are many neighborhoods whose only professed pacifists are men whose peace is the `` peace of those who have convinced themselves that noth - ing is worth fighting for . ''

		Most of the youth and ardor and high purpose of the world is beinp spent gloriously ,
Miss Brown	PERSON	would have us believe in destruction .

		`` Bromley Neighborhood '' will be recom - mended as a `` good '' book .

		It is , too , a sincere and moving story , told with more than average skill .

		But to the unbeliever , `` Bromley Neigh - borhood '' is a depressing document , offering fresh proof that the day when wars shall cease is yet far off .

		It is not often that an American writer ven - tures into what may be called native material .

		Doubtless too much imagination is required to discern the elements of a good story in the com - monplace commercial life of every day , or it may be that too much hard work is needed to hold the 1 reader 's attention in a story about ordinary people .


Elaine Sterne	PERSON	has ventured into this field in `` The Road of Ambition '' -LRB-
Britton Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lishing Company ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- and has written the sort of story which we are glad to have from an American novelist .

		She has chosen to write about a laborer in the steel mills , a man with imagination and a passion for power .

		Such a story could have been written more effectively by a man , but one is willing to pass over certain feminisms in the discussion of business for the sake of the story itself , which is engrossing .

		To the credit of the author be it said that she has not depended on the trick of coincidence or chance to build a plot .

		She has found the ma - terials for plot and denouement in the characters of her story , just as she has found her story in the life of American industry , and that is as it should be .

		Those of us who know
England	LOCATION	have known since the start of the war that something fine and enduring would come out of the throes of conflict , that somehow
England	ORGANIZATION	would emerge purged in spirit .

		Two books have been written thus far which indicate that this process is go - ing on .

		Both books should be read by everyone who wishes a sane analysis of the effects of the war upon individuals who have suffered actual experience , with some hint of the ultimate con - sequence socially and nationally .

		These books are
Hugh Sdincourt	PERSON	's `` A Soldier of Life '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- and
Stephen McKenna	PERSON	's `` Sonia : Between Two Worlds '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Neither of these novels has any sug - < > n of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's pyrotechnic omniscience , both of them are characterized by a deep sense of human character and its reaction under Gar - gantuan crises .

		`` A Soldier of Life '' is a study of ; i man who has been invalided home , only to i \ rr that the readjustment to the sweetly tic and complacent life of the old order is
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 281 impossible .

		The spiritual contrast drives him to the verge of insanity and it is in the working out of his understanding of the deeper signifi - cance of life that he wins sanity and happiness , for he discovers that it is more wonderful to live than to kill and that life , if it be truly lived , demands as great discipline , as great sacrifice as does war .

		`` Sonia '' is less mystical in its interest , perhaps more typically British for that reason .

		It is an excellent example of those novels of school and college life which only the English know how to write , perhaps because the English are the only ones who know how to live that life .

		But it is more than charming narration and de - lineation ; it has a sense of the traits in British character which make it survive .

		The very qual - ities which appear in the public-school life , which make gentlemen and sportsmen , are the qualities which make soldiers and which later will make citizens of a truly democratic society .

		Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Kenna	PERSON	writes with charm and brilliance .

		His name is new to
America	LOCATION	, but this novel will place him well forward in that group of younger nov - elists who before the war had started the foun - dations of a new epoch in the English novel .

		No one will gainsay the publisher 's statement on the jacket of `` Saint Seductre '' -LRB- by Exile X ,
Liberty Publishing Association	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- that , it is the duty of every true American to acquaint himself thoroughly with each particular element of the Teutonic peril .

		The purpose of this story is to acquaint the American reader with a cer - tain element in Prussian officialism , and as such it offers material which ought to be borne in mind in whatever discussions of peace the future may see .

		The book was written in the white heat of intellectual conviction , rather than pas - sion .

		Terrible as is the picture of the sufferings of the prison camp , the emphasis is not put upon physical tragedy so much as upon the chicanery and deception of those officials whose best inter - ests lie with the survival of Prussianism after the war , even in the guise of democracy .

		Unfortu - nately the book is in the form of a dialogue and the average reader is unwilling to concentrate sufficiently to follow a narrative stripped bare of superfluous description or narration .

		But it is well worth anyone 's time to read these short , terrible conversations which concern a prison - camp plot and its tragic culmination .

		To read this book is to gain an idea of that terrible men - ace ,
Prussianism	LOCATION	, which when all is said and done has made the German people themselves , as well as the Allies , suffer the atrocities of war .


Leona Dalrymple	PERSON	in `` Kenny '' -LRB-
Reilly & Brit	ORGANIZATION	- ton ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- has written an
American E. Temple Thurston	ORGANIZATION	novel ; and although the comparison between the two may not be wholly in her favor , it is not meant to be derogatory .

		For nothing is so difficult for an American writer , so relent - lessly difficult as the expression of charm in personality .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	has given us his inter - pretation of
New York	LOCATION	's bohemia ; Miss Dal - rymple now gives us hers , and , to tell the truth , it pleases us more .

		The two peripatetic , mutu - ally adoring , ever-quarreling Irishmen ,
Kenny	PERSON	and his son , belong to the romantic rather than to the realistic world , but their wanderings and their ways gave us far greater delight than if they had stepped straight out of the Village with the paint of their acquired personalities still wet .

		Their personalities appear to be inbred .

		Their adventures are told with liveliness and sympathy .

		A thrilling story with a groundwork of com - mon sense !

		Such is the impression which re - mains after the pleasurable excitement of reading
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	's `` A King in Babylon '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- has subsided .

		The story concerns a moving-picture producer and his determination to introduce imagination and art into his work .

		-LRB- Would to heaven that every scenario-writer , producer , and actor in the coun - try would read the stinging criticism of their wooden-headed efforts ! -RRB-

		This producer used genuine imagination in building a plot about
Henley	PERSON	's lines , I was a King in Babylon And you were a Christian Slave .

		The production carried him and his company to
Egypt	LOCATION	, where a suitable setting was found in a royal tomb practically excavated by an American archasologist .

		It is at this point that the seem - ingly supernatural enters into the tale , giving an extraordinarily weird and gripping turn to the story .

		But the author , and we hereby render him our thanks , instead of yielding to the easy trick of invoking the supernatural in order to gain his effect , skilfully erects a framework of logical ex - planation on which one may stand and enjoy the spectacular climax without danger of doing his intelligence injury .

		It is not often that a reviewer finds himself in a glow over an American novel , but such is the present writer 's experience with
Stuart Mac	PERSON	- lean 's `` Alexis '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		When a reviewer finds himself in this unwonted condi - tion , it is difficult to explain his feeling .

		It does not suffice to say that this story has attractive subject-matter ; many books are quite as attractive in this respect as this story of a music critic who discovers in the son of his washerwoman some - thing bordering on genius ; nor is it enough to say the story is exceptionally well written , or that the characters are deftly drawn , or that there is a lot of splendid talk about music and musicians .

		There is something beyond these qualities , per - 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
September 27	DATE	haps best defined as a sense of human warmth .

		There is between the lines an indefinable quality of ardor , of the eagerness and intensity of youth and youthful ambitions .

		One knows from the start that the story will be a happy one and that all will be well in the end .

		Fancy that the hero .

		is your own protege .

		With what vivid pleas - ure you would see him working out to success !

		That is exactly the feeling inspired by this ex - cellent story of music , and those who have to do with real music .

		`` From Death to Life , '' by
A. Apukhtin	PERSON	-LRB- R. Frank -RRB- , is a charming fantasy from the brain of a poet little known in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is the tale of a soul 's wandering , from the moment of its release from the body of a prince to the moment , a few hours later , when it found breath in the body of a child born to the favorite maid of the prince 's wife .

		The extravagance of the central idea in no way detracts from one 's enjoyment of the piece .

		The prose is simple and direct and the images are poetic .

		Franklin Booth sup - plies seven pen-and-ink drawings that help ma - terially to translate the spirit and delicacy of the little story .

		The slender volume is Number 1 in a series of `` Gems of Russian Literature , '' which Mr.
Frank	PERSON	intends to bring out .

		To those who have found war too gloriously represented in fiction , to those who would like to know a few of the typical fighting men of the eastern and western fronts , shorn of their civ - ilized demeanor and expressing in action the purely elemental impulses , we recommend `` The Fighting Men , '' by
Alden Brooks	PERSON	-LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		In these stories the Parisian of the Boulevards is shown rallying from his acquired inertia to the pitch of daring that has made his country famous .

		The Russian peasant is por - trayed with all his faults and not a few telling virtues .

		The Belgian , the Prussian , and the American of the Ambulance and the
Foreign Legion	ORGANIZATION	are shown very much as one would expect them to appear .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	has had the op - portunity of knowing his men at first hand , and his imagination is as fertile as it is grim .

		`` Mrs. Hope 's Husband , '' by
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	-LRB- Century ;
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- , is a delightfully humorous com - edy of manners and character .

		We have always been led to believe that among the candidates for divine reward the wife of a genius stood high .

		We now perceive our mistake ; her claim shrinks to insignificance beside that of the husband of a famous woman .

		How he may mitigate his suf - ferings is one of the things that an acquaintance with Mr.
Hope	PERSON	has taught us .

		But more espe - cially would we recommend this little book to the flourishing Mrs. Hopes of the universe , who can not , unaided , appreciate the pathetic condition of being a husband .

		CASUAL , COMMENT THE DEATH OF
HENRY E. LEGLER	PERSON	, head of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is not only a serious loss , but one that comes much too soon .

		Mr.
Legler	PERSON	was only fifty-six having been born of Swiss-Italian parentage at
Palermo	ORGANIZATION	, in
1861	DATE	and should have remained a serviceable factor in the higher life of the community for more than the brief eight during which he served .

		But he never spared himself in his work , and his work wore him out .

		He was a man of initiative and of ideas : `` Only start a thing and somehow it will go through '' might have been his motto .

		He came to
Chicago	LOCATION	from journalistic and libran work in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		His chief success here \ \ as in the enlargement of library service through the extension of the branch system : it was his aim to `` carry the book to the people . ''

		His latest effort was to found the movement for supplying our soldiers and sailors with libraries a work which , initiated in
Chicago	LOCATION	, has been taken up by the libraries and reading public all over the country .

		Mr.
Legler	PERSON	was a finely sympathetic personality , beloved by his staff and deserving of high appreciation from a public faithfully and intelligently served .

		* A SCENT FOR SOCIAL WRONGS has been in - dulged once more , on a large scale , by
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	.

		He is publishing a novel about the life , the work , and the surroundings of the men , women , and children who live in the coal-mining camps and earn their livelihood there .

		`` King Coal '' is the book 's rather journalistic title .

		If this new book is as honestly and earnestly meant as `` The Jungle , '' one hopes it will not have the same bad luck of being wrenched somewhat from its purpose .

		`` The Jungle , '' written to expose human conditions `` behind the yards . ''

		was taken as a mere sensational disclosure of repellent man - ufacturing processes .

		For interest in the worker there was substituted an interest in the product .

		If the same ill luck again befalls , we shall have , instead of the reform of serious social evils among our newer citizenry , only a document on the pro- duction and distribution of our winter 's fuel a burning question , to be sure , but not quite the same as the plaint of the becoming American under unfair conditions in days of doubt and stress .

		A BOOK OF BIBLE LOVE-STORIES , in the man ner and idiom of `` Billy ''
Sunday	DATE	, is on the wav and seems calculated to arouse apprehension - .

		Mr.
Sunday	PERSON	has arranged a series of narratives which deal with
Ruth	PERSON	,
Esther	PERSON	,
Rachel	PERSON	,
Rcbekah	PERSON	.

		Delilah , and other heroines of Scripture .

		Thev will doubtless have their own air .

		Well , other times , other manners ; other days , other tones
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 283 and tempers .

		If we but concede that old tales must be retold for newer generations in the taste of the period , that old garments must be given a new cut and hang for the mental shoulders and limbs of the
Latest Comers	ORGANIZATION	, and that novel col - ors and timbres are justly demanded by the hu - man run-of-the-mine in its newest psychical development the rest is easy .

		But
Ruth	PERSON	pre - sented in the parlance of vaudeville or
Esther	PERSON	squared to the taste of the bleachers well , does the prospect quite please ?

		A SHEAF OF DIVORCE PAMPHLETS FROM ENG - LAND helps to remind us of the crying need of one social reform in
Britain	LOCATION	and of the checks and delays which the war is occasioning .

		The
Divorce Law Reform Union	ORGANIZATION	still issues its leaf - lets and its annual reports .

		Its officers have been asked why they have not , like so many bodies dealing with controversial questions , accepted a truce and closed their doors during the great struggle .

		They reply that the chief opponents of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, those who .

		insist on taking the re - ligious -LRB- or even the ecclesiastical -RRB- view of mar - riage , have increased their activities against the extension of the divorce laws ; also , that many of the domestic problems raised by the war are a direct result of the marriage and divorce laws at present in force .

		The Union , despite the op - position of such tories as Lord
Hugh Cecil	PERSON	, will continue , then , to present marriage in a secular aspect , and to promote procedures which shall act to assimilate British laws to those of other and more liberal countries , and which shall re - sult in making divorce easier for the poor by means of reduced costs and the establishment of local divorce courts .

		A WAR CATECHISM IN A FASHION MAGAZINE could scarcely fail to arrest the attention .

		`` Do you believe in slavery ? ''

		the author begins ear - nestly .

		`` Do you think the Germans are wrong or right ? ''

		and , `` If wrong , would you like to live under German rule ? ''

		he continues .

		Then , further : `` Is American blood more precious than French blood ?

		If so , why ?

		Why have the French women stopped dancing during the war ?

		Have French women a better sense of the fit - ness of things than American women ?

		If so , why ?

		If your men go to the war , what are you going to do besides let them go ? ''

		After some thirty questions of like tenor , one turns the leaf and finds ... ?

		A page of brides in full bridal splendor .

		Opposite them `` the advance guard of the
Paris	LOCATION	openings . ''

		Close at hand `` a continuance of straight skirts , perhaps a bit longer and narrower . ''

		Then pictures of `` loose coats of green velours de laine , '' and so on .

		One judges that American women do believe in sla - very , that they are unlikely to forego the pride of life until the pinch of war becomes much more acute , and that a worldly journal of fash - ion and society is not the vehicle for effective protest against carrying the pomps and vanities of peace times into days of war .

		A PROTEST AGAINST THE HAPPY ENDING , as well as against the servile editor who would bestow on such termination a value and conse - quence hardly its due , may be found in the recent publication of a volume of short stories .

		There are a dozen or more of them , by different au - thors ; and their grim and gruesome character has made them , despite merit , impracticable for the magazines as now conducted .

		Therefore the authors now sally forth in company and ask a general verdict from the public itself .

		How - ever , the taste of the public in stories and in story-endings may be got more easily and more conclusively than from the printed book .

		A few evenings among the films will make the point perfectly clear .

		We ask for the amiable and the optimistic .

		Perhaps not one movie story in a hundred `` ends badly '' ; our public will not stand it .

		The final turn toward happiness however foolish and illogical that turn , whatever violence it may do to likelihood or even to the essential character of established works of fiction must be accomplished somehow .

		Perhaps our associated authors are but asking that , in a world of clashing and cruel realities , we summon up enough fortitude to endure the logical and the true .

		WHERE WILL THE CLOSE OF THE WAR LEAVE BAEDEKER ?

		The admirable guidebooks pub - lished at
Leipzig	LOCATION	have long been among the most agreeable and serviceable manifestations of the German spirit .

		With peace declared , will the Anglo-Saxons use them as docilely as before ?

		Possibly not .

		Word comes that a series of Eng - lish `` Baedekers '' is projected , to be `` done '' by British editors formerly employed by the house of Baedeker itself .

		Doubtless Mr.
J. F. Muir	PERSON	- head , the able author of `` Baedeker 's Handbook for the
United States	LOCATION	, '' will have an important share in the new series .

		Its publishers have acquired the rights to the travel-guides of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	and of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		One trusts that the volumes of the new venture may be more like the
Leipzig	LOCATION	prototype and less in the fashion conceived by
London	LOCATION	: to use
Murray	PERSON	after having used
Baedeker	PERSON	was always a vexation .

		The first issues of the new series will deal ' with
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	, and
Northern France	LOCATION	.

		The two last , obviously , will be in great demand and will supplement the post-war tourist arrangements which are already being shaped by the French government .

Bouton	PERSON	to

		Two important manuscripts are owned by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		One is a sketch of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, written by himself on fourteen octavo pages .

		At the top of the first page is the following note in his hand - writing : `` In ` Mark Twain ' Mrs.
Clemens	PERSON	wishes you to ask
Sam Moffett	PERSON	, my nephew -LRB- Editor of The
New York	LOCATION	Journal -RRB- , to write the biographical sketch from these notes and then she would like to see it before it is printed .

		S. L. C. '' The manuscript is edited by Mrs.
Clemens	PERSON	.

		The other manuscript is by
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, is entitled `` How I get around at 60 , '' and is written on eleven octavo pages .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has also a contemporary manuscript of the trial in Star Chamber of
John Wrenham	PERSON	, gentleman , on charges that he had alleged falsely that the Lord Chancellor , Sir
Francis Bacon	PERSON	, had `` done injustice unto His King 's Majesty . ''

		The document is dated
April 29 , 1618	DATE	, and is a decla - ration of the whole proceedings of information .

		It gives the statements of the king 's counsel , Sir
Henry Yelverton	PERSON	, and of
John Wrenham	PERSON	, speeches of other members of the court , and the summing up of the case , with the court 's decree .

		The manu - script is in binding by
Sangorski	ORGANIZATION	and
Sutcliffe	PERSON	.

		There is only one other contemporary copy of these proceedings , and that is in the
Public Record	ORGANIZATION	office in
London	LOCATION	.

		The verdict was against
Wrenham	PERSON	, who was fined
1000	DATE	.

		It was also ordered that his ears be clipped .

		In
1621	DATE	charges of corruption were brought against
Bacon	PERSON	, who confessed .

		He was fined , degraded , and imprisoned .

		The first sale of 1917-18 by the
Anderson Auc	ORGANIZATION	- tion Company , of
New York	LOCATION	, will probably not take place until about
November 15	DATE	, owing to the delay in getting the old
Arion Club	ORGANIZATION	building in shape for auction sales .


Patrick F. Madigan	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, has just sold to a collector of autographs the following letter of
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	: Sir , As in our conversations on the important subject of a representation in the ensuing
Congress	ORGANIZATION	I had the pleasure to perceive that you were inclined to pursue a moderate and accommodating line of conduct ; and as I have reason to believe that representations will be made of the sense of this city calculated to nour - ish a spirit of pertinacity on the majority of the Assembly which may counteract the prudent views you entertain , I have thought it might be useful to possess you of a true state of facts on this head , of which you may make such use as you think proper .

		The general sentiments of the citizens are that the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	are right in the principle for which they con - tend ; but a considerable number are of opinion that it would be better for them to depart from it than to hazard a loss of the seat of government for want of a representation on the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		This , however , though an extensive sentiment is far from being universal .

		I verily believe and I have taken great pains to as - certain the matter that a more considerable number hold that the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	ought to persevere at every haz - ard .

		This I take to be a true account of the state of things here , and you may venture confidently to hold it up in opposition to the exaggerated stories with
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 303 which the violent partisans will endeavor to preclude the possibility of accommodation .

		But if the case were in reality such as it will be represented to be what ought to be the inference from it ?

		Will it therefore be reasonable to sacrifice the interests of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to a humour utterly averse to all compromise or accommodation ?

		Perhaps it may be supposed that in this situation of affairs the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	will be induced to yield the point .

		I sincerely wish that an illusion of this kind may not be productive of mischief which we may all have occasion to regret .

		I flatter myself , you will believe me , Sir , when I assure you upon my honour that from everything I know of the disposition of the members of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, I am led to conclude that the majority will in no event accede to the unqualified idea of a joint ballot .

		I am thus emphatical in my assurances on this point because I think it is of the utmost importance that there should be no mistake about it ; and that if an adherence to that plan is resolved upon it - may be under the full impression that a representation will not take place .

		And while I make this declaration I can not but flatter myself that however it may be imagefied that I miscalculate the firmness of the Sen - ate it will at least be believed that I am incapable of an attempt to deceive under the sanction I have used .

		Truly , Sir , this is a matter of serious moment .

		And allow me to hope that you will dispassionately weigh all the consequences of an obstinate adherence to the ground taken in the Assembly .

		I am far from wish - ing that house to sacrifice its dignity ; but I am satis - fied that this can not be the case by coming into the compromise we have talked of .

		The
Senate	ORGANIZATION	will in this , as far as principle is concerned , give us more than the Assembly .

		Permit me to observe that how - ever violent may become certain characters , your sit - uation calls upon you to be an umpire between the zealots of all parties .

		You , Sir , as well as myself have assented to the
National Constitution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Your rep - utation , as well as mine , is concerned that the event shall justify the measure and that the people shall have reason from experience to think we have acted well in making them parties to that Constitution .

		And this can only be done by pursuing such measures as will secure to them every advantage they can prom - ise themselves under it .

		The vanity and malignity of some men may be gratified by embarrassing the outset of the government ; but this line of conduct would be a species of political suicide in every man who has in any shape given his assent to the system .

		I can not doubt , Sir , that this observation will strike you as of great and real force and that you will readily perceive a vast dissimilitude between the sit - uation of those who have concurred in establishing the Constitution and those who have uniformly opposed .

		An alliance between these two descriptions of men is unnatural and if closely pursued will certainly give cause of repentance to the former .

		In taking the liberty to make these remarks I per - suade myself you will discover nothing of a dispo - sition unfriendly to you .

		I am much mistaken if we do not now or shall not at a future day agree on the prudence of the suggestions contained in this letter .

		I remain , Your obedient and humble servt. ,
A. Hamilton	PERSON	.

Hewson L. Peekc	PERSON	, of
Sandusky	LOCATION	, O. , the possessor of one of the largest collections of books and pamphlets in the
United States	LOCATION	relating to inebriety .

		In the opening chapter on `` Customs based on Race Source or Population , '' Mr.
Peeke	PERSON	says : The drinking habits of the Dutch colonists were excessive .

		Tempered in their tastes somewhat by the universal brewing and drinking of beer , they did not use as much as the Puritans of
New England	LOCATION	, nor drink as deeply as the
Virginia	LOCATION	planters , but the use of liquor was universal .

		A libation was poured on every transaction , at every happening of the com - munity ; in public as well as private life
John Bar	PERSON	- leycorn was a witness in the drawing of a contract , the signing of a deed , the selling of a farm , the purchase of goods , the arbitration of a suit .

		If a party backed out from a contract he did not back out from the treat .

		Liquor was served at vendues and made the bidders expansive .

		It appeared at weddings , funerals , church openings , deacon ordainings and house raisings .

		No farm hand in haying , no sailor on a vessel , no workman in a mill , no cobbler , tailor , carpenter , mason or tinker would work without some strong drink or treat .

		In the chapter on `` Bench and Bar , '' Judge Story is quoted as saying : Our intercourse is perfectly familiar and unre - strained and our social hours , when undisturbed with the labors of law , are passed in gay and frank con - versation which at once enlivens and instructs .

		We take no part in
Washington	LOCATION	society .

		We dine once a year with the President , and that is all .

		On Mon - days we dine together and discuss at table the ques - tions which are argued before us .

		We are great ascetics and even deny ourselves wine except in wet weather .

		What I say about the wine gives you our rule ; but it does sometimes happen that the
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	will say to me when the cloth is removed : `` Brother Story , step to the window and see if it does not look like rain . ''

		And if I tell him the sun is shining brightly Justice
Marshall	PERSON	will sometimes reply : `` All the better for our jurisdiction extends over so large a territory that the doctrine of chances makes it cer - tain that it must be raining somewhere . ''

		The Chief was brought up on Federalism and
Madeira	LOCATION	and he is not the man to outgrow his early prejudices .

		In the chapter on `` Church and Clergy , '' there is a letter from
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	`` to ye Aged and Beloved Mr.
John Higginson	PERSON	, '' dated
September	DATE	`` ye 15 ,
1682	DATE	, '' in which he says : There is now at sea a ship called the
Welcome	ORGANIZATION	, which has on board an hundred or more of the here - tics and malignants called Quakers , with
W. Penn	PERSON	, who is the chief scamp , at the head of them .

		The
General Court	ORGANIZATION	has accordingly given secret orders to Master
Malachi Huscott	PERSON	, of the brig Porpoise , to waylay the said Welcome , slyly , as near the
Cape of Cod	LOCATION	, as may be , and make captive the said
Penn	LOCATION	and his ungodly crew , so that the Lord may be glori - fied and not mocked on the soil of this new country with the heathen worship of these people .

		Much spoil can be made by selling the whole lot to
Barbadoes	LOCATION	, where slaves fetch good prices in rum and sugar , and we shall not only do the Lord great service by punishing the wicked but we shall make great good for his ministers and people .

		Master Huscott feels hopeful , and I will set down the news when the ship - back .

THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL .

		THE DIAL JfortmstJtlp journal of Utterarp ton , anb SnformatfoiL Ibsen :
Journeyman Dramatist Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, like
Wagner	PERSON	and
Manet	PERSON	, has lived down his commentators , and is now ready to be examined and enjoyed for what he actually was , namely , a first-rate journeyman dramatist , perhaps the best that ever lived .

		Twenty years ago he was hymned and damned as anything and everything else : symbolist , seer , prophet , necromancer , maker of riddles , rabble - rouser , cheap shocker , pornographer , spinner of gossamer nothings .

		Fools be - labored him and fools defended him ; he was near to being suffocated and done for in the fog of balderdash .

		I know of no sure cure for all the sorrows of the world , social , political , or aesthetic , that was not credited to him , read into him , forced into his baggage .

		And I know of no crime against virtue , good order , and the reve - lation of God that he was not accused of .

		The product of all this pawing and bawl - ing was the Ibsen legend , that fabulous picture of a fabulous monster , half
Nietzsche	PERSON	and half Dr.
Frank Crane	PERSON	, drenching the world with scandalous plat - itudes from a watch-tower in the chil - blained North .

		The righteous heard of him with creepy shudders ; there was bold talk of denying him the use of the mails ; he was the
Gog	ORGANIZATION	and Magog , the
Helioga	LOCATION	- balus , nay , the downright
Kaiser	PERSON	, of that distant and pious era .

		No such
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, of course , ever really existed .

		The genuine Ibsen was anything but the Antichrist thus conjured up by impudent partisans and terrified oppo - nents .

		On the contrary , he was a man whose salient quality was precisely his dis - trust of , and disdain for , any and all such facile heresies ; a highly respectable gen - tleman of the middle class , well-barbered , ease-loving , and careful in mind ; a very skilful practitioner of a very exacting and lucrative trade ; a safe and sane exponent of order , efficiency , honesty , and common sense .

		From end to end of his life there is no record that
Ibsen	PERSON	ever wrote a single word or formulated a single idea that might not have been exposed in a news - paper editorial .

		He believed in all the things that the normal , law-abiding citi - zen of
Christendom	LOCATION	believes in , from de - mocracy to romantic love , and from the obligations of duty to the value of virtue , and he always gave them the best of it in his plays .

		And whenever , mistaking his position , someone charged him with flout - ing these things or with advocating some notion that stood in opposition to them , he invariably called the plaintiff to book , and denied vehemently that he was guilty , and protested bitterly that it was outrage - ous to fasten any such wild and naughty stuff upon a reputable man .

		Had he been , in truth , the extravagant iconoclast that a misinformed rabbinism tried to make him out , he would have re - mained , to the end of his career , a mere freak and blank cartridge in the theatre , and of no more influence than such ex - tremists , say , as
Max Stirner	PERSON	,
Arthur Go	PERSON	- bineau , and the
Marquis de Sade	ORGANIZATION	.

		So long , indeed , as he was generally held to be such an iconoclast , he actually suffered that fate .

		But when it began to be no - ticed , first by other dramatists and then by a widening public , that his ideas , after all , were really not extraordinary that what he said , in the last analysis , was sim - ply what every reasonably intelligent man thought that his plays , for all their smashing air , were not actually blows at Christian culture when this began to be understood , then he began to make his way , and all the serious dramatists of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope began to imitate him .

		But they saw him , with their keener professional eyes , more clearly than the early and so absurd Ibsenites had seen him .

		They saw that he was not a brummagem prophet , but a play-maker of astounding skill one who had a new and better method to teach 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	them .

		And so , when they set out to fol - low him , what they imitated was not the imaginary mystifications that foolish fu - glemen had read into his dramas , but his direct and adept manner of clothing sim - ple and even self-evident arguments in un - usually lucid and brilliant dramatic forms in brief , his enormously effective tech - nique as a dramatist .

		He did n't teach them to think extraordinary thoughts ; he taught them to put obvious thoughts into sound plays .

		All this must be plain to anyone who goes through his so-called social dramas to-day , despite the confusing memory of all the gabble that went about in the high days of the Ibsen uproar .

		What ideas does one actually find in them ?

		Such ideas , first and last , as even a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	profes - sor might evolve without bursting his brain for example , that it is unpleasant and degrading for a wife to be treated as a mere mistress and empty-head ; that pro- fessional patriots and town-boomers are frauds ; that success in business usually in - volves doing things that a self-respecting man hesitates to do ; that a woman who continues to cohabit with a syphilitic hus - band may expect to have defective chil - dren ; that a joint sorrow tends to dampen passion in husband and wife , and so bring them together upon a more secure basis ; that a neurotic and lascivious woman is apt to be horrified when she finds that she is pregnant ; that a man of fifty-five or sixty is an ass to fall in love with a flapper of seventeen ; that the world is barbarously cruel to a woman who has violated the seventh commandment or a man who has violated the eighth .

		If you are discon - tented with these summaries , then turn to summaries that
Ibsen	PERSON	made himself that is , turn to his notes for his social dramas in his `` Nachgelassene Schriften . ''

		Here you will find precisely what he was trying to say .

		Here you will find , in plain words , the ideas that he started from .

		They are , without exception , ideas of the utmost sim - plicity .

		There is nothing mysterious in them ; there is not even anything new in them .

		Above all , there is no idiotic sym - bolism in them .

		They mean just what they say .

		As I have said ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	himself was under no delusions about his dramas of ideas .

		He was a hard-working dramatist and a man of sense : he never allowed the gro - tesque guesses and fantasies of his advo - cates to corrupt the clarity of his own purpose .

		Down to the time he lost his mind he was then at work on ``
John Ga	PERSON	- briel Borkman '' he never wrote a line that had any significance save the obvious one , and he never forgot for an instant that he was writing , not tracts , but stage plays .

		When the sentimental German middle classes mistook `` A Doll 's House '' for a revolutionary document against mo - nogamy , and began grouping him with the preachers of free love , he was as indig - nant as only a respectable family man can be , and even agreed to write a new end - ing for the play in order to shut off that nonsense .

		A year later he wrote `` Ghosts '' to raise a laugh against the alarmed mor - alists who had swallowed the free lovers ' error .

		The noise of combat continuing , he decided to make an end of it by burlesqu - ing the Ibsenites , and the result was `` The Wild Duck , '' in which the chief figure is a sort of reductio ad absurdum of the mod - ern
Drama Leaguer	ORGANIZATION	.

		In `` The Master Builder '' he took a holiday from social ideas , even the most elemental , and put himself into a play , shedding a salt tear over his lost youth .

		And in ``
Hedda Gab	PERSON	- ler , '' as if to confute the Ibsen talmudists forever , he fashioned a thumping drama out of the oldest , shoddiest materials of
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	, Scribe , and Feuillet , nay ,
Meil	PERSON	- hac and
Halevy	PERSON	, as if to prove , once and for all time , that he was a dramatist first and last , and not a windy evangelist and reformer , and that he could meet any other dramatist , however skilful , on equal terms , and dispose of him neatly and com - pletely .

		Ibsen 's chief interest , from the begin - ning to the end of his career as a dram - atist , was not with the propagation of ethical ideas , but with the solution of aes - thetic problems .

		He was , in brief , not a preacher , but an artist , and not the moony artist of popular legend , but the alert and competent artist of fact , intent upon the technical difficulties of his business .

		He gave infinitely more thought to questions
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 325 of practical dramaturgy to getting his characters on and off the stage , to build - ing up climaxes , to calculating effects than he ever gave to the ideational content of his dramas .

		Almost any idea was good enough , so long as it could be converted into a conflict , and the conflict could be worked out straightforwardly and effec - tively .

		Read his letters and you will find him tremendously concerned , from the start , with technical difficulties and expe - dients and never mentioning morals , les - son , symbols , and that sort of thing at all .

		So early as the time he wrote `` The League of Youth '' you will find him dis - cussing the details of dramatic machinery with Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, and laying stress on the fact , with no little vanity , that he had `` accomplished the feat of doing with - out a single monologue , in fact without a single aside . ''

		A bit later he began de - veloping the stage direction ; go through his plays and observe how he gradually increased its importance , until in the end it almost overshadowed the dialogue .

		And if you would get , in brief , the full measure of his contribution to the art of the drama , give hard study to `` A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Here , for the first time , his new technique was in full working .

		Here he deposed Scribe and company at one blow , and founded an entirely new order of dramaturgy .

		Other dramatists , long be - fore him , had concocted dramas of ideas and good ones .

		The idea in
Augier	PERSON	's `` Le Manage d'Olympe '' was quite as sound and interesting as that in `` A Doll 's House '' ; the idea in
Augier	PERSON	's `` Les Ef - frontes '' perhaps exceeded it in both ways .

		But
Ibsen	PERSON	got into `` A Doll 's House '' something that
Augier	PERSON	and Feuillet and
Dumas	PERSON	fits and all that crowd of Empire dramatists had never been able to get into their plays , and that was an air of utter and absolute reality , an overwhelming conviction , a complete concealment of the dramatic machinery .

		And how did he conceal it ?

		Simply by leaving it out .

		Scribe had built up an in - ordinately complex dramaturgy .

		His plays were elaborate and beautiful mech - anisms , but still always mechanisms .

		He had to sacrifice everything else reason , probability , human nature to make the machine run .

		And
Augier	PERSON	,
Feuillet	PERSON	, and
Dumas	PERSON	, better men all , followed docilely in his tracks .

		They were better observ - ers ; they were more keenly interested in the actual life about them ; they managed , despite the artificiality of their technique , to get some genuine human beings into their plays .

		But that technique still hung around their necks ; they never quite got rid of it .

		But
Ibsen	PERSON	did .

		In `` A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	'' he threw it overboard for all time .

		Instead of a complicated plot , work - ing beautifully toward a foreordained climax , he presented a few related scenes in the life of a husband and wife .

		In - stead of a finely wrought fabric of sus - pense and emotion , nicely balanced , neatly hanging together , he hit upon an action that was all suspense and all emotion .

		And instead of carefully calculated expla - nations , involving the orthodox couriers and prattling chambermaids , he let the story tell itself .

		The result , as
William Archer	PERSON	has said , `` was a new order of ex - perience in the theatre . ''

		The audience that came to be pleasantly diverted by the old , old tricks found its nerves racked by a glimpse through a terrifying keyhole .

		This thing was not a stage play , but a scandal .

		It did n't caress and soothe ; it arrested and shocked .

		It did n't stay dis - creetly on the stage ; it leaped out over the footlights .

		The audience gasped and went out gab - bling , and the result was the Ibsen mad - ness , with its twenty years of folderol .

		But there were dramatists in the house who , with professional eye , saw more clearly what was afoot , and these drama - tists , once they could shake off the Scribe tradition , began to imitate
Ibsen Jones	PERSON	and
Pinero	PERSON	and later
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	;
Hauptmann	PERSON	and Sudermann in
Germany	LOCATION	;
Gorki	PERSON	and many another in
Russia	LOCATION	; Her - vieu ,
Brieux	PERSON	, and their like in
France	LOCATION	; a swarm of lesser ones in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, and
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Ibsen , in brief , completely overthrew the well-made play of Scribe , and set up the play that was a direct imi - tation of reality .

		He showed that the illusion was not only not helped by the elaborate machinery of Scribe , but was actually hindered that the way to sure and tremendous effects was by the route of 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	simplicity , naturalness , ingenuousness .

		In `` A Doll 's House '' he abandoned all the old tricks save two or three ; in `` Ghosts '' he made away with the rest of them , and even managed to do without a plot ; by the time he got to `` Little Eyolf '' there was nothing left of the traditional dra - maturgy save the act divisions .

		It was not , of course , an easy reform to put through .

		The habits of mind of audi - ences had to be changed ; the lunacies of the Ibsenites had to be lived down , and the moral ire of the anti-Ibsenites ; above all , the actors of the time had to be untaught all that they knew about acting , and taught a lot of new things that vio - lated their vanity and hurt their business .

		But
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's notions had logic behind them , and they had the force of novelty , and there was in them a new and superior op - portunity for the dramatist who really had something to say , and so , in the end , they triumphed in the world .

		To-day the methods of Scribe are so archaic that they excite laughter ; only the Broadhursts and Kleins of Broadway stoop to them .

		If an intelligent dramatist were to expose a play built upon the plans of `` Verre d'Eau '' or ``
Adrienne Lecouvreur	PERSON	, '' even the newspaper critics would laugh at him .

		All that sort of thing now belongs to archaeology .

		But
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, as I have said , was a drama - tist first and last , and not a tin-pot agitator and messiah .

		He depicted the life of his time and he made use of the ideas of his time ; he had no desire to change those ideas , nor even , in the main , to criticize them .

		`` A dramatist 's business , '' he used to say , `` is not to answer questions , but merely to ask them . ''

		He asked a ques - tion in `` A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		He asked an - other , ironically , in `` Ghosts . ''

		He asked others in `` The Lady from the Sea , '' `` The Wild Duck , '' and `` Little Eyolf . ''

		In `` The Master Builder , '' rising , so to speak , to a question of personal privilege , he abandoned his habit and ventured upon a half-answer .

		But is there any answer in ``
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	'' ?

		Surely not .

		The play is still chewed and belabored by advocates of this answer or that ; the very lack of agreement shows the dramatist 's neutral - ity .

		`` It was not my desire , '' he once said , `` to deal in this play with so-called prob - lems .

		What I wanted to do was to depict human beings , human emotions , and hu - man destinies , upon a groundwork of cer - tain of the social conditions and principles of the present day . ''

		That is to say , here is your state of society , here is your woman , here is what she does what do you think of it ?

		So , again , in `` Pillars of Society . ''

		Here is your society , here are your pil - lars , here are their rascalities what have you to say of it ?


Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, another great artist , once put the thing admirably .

		`` My task which I am trying to achieve , '' he said , `` is , by the power of the written word , to make you hear , to make you feel it is , before all , to make you see .

		That and no more , and it is everything . ''


H. L. MENCKEN	PERSON	.

		The Limits of Tolerance Bitter thoughts are in the minds of members of minorities nowadays , even where their lips are guarded against bit - ter words .

		War breeds intolerance : its business is stern , and its measures are se - vere ; with the same harsh pressure it drafts men to fight and shuts the mouth of opposition ; its high enterprise demands concentrated cooperation and renders at once impossible the social laxity and bick - ering normal to times of peace .

		Freedom of action , of speech , even of conscience , all are subjected to violent shift by mili - tary undertaking and its regime , and as a result of the shift men become suddenly and rawly conscious of the interference with their custom , and , in democratic countries , jealously sensitive of their rights .

		Dark prophets have long been saying that the Allies will crush militarism only by becoming militaristic , that a de - feated
Germany	LOCATION	will seize the victor 's iron and weld therefrom the fetters of civic liberty .

		Since the
United States	LOCATION	entered the war the ugly boding is swollen : where is our pride of free speech ?

		where is our tolerance of opinion ?

		where is our good - humored companionableness and partisan - ship without rancor ?

		A world `` safe for democracy '' were hollow indeed if the safety be secured at the cost of that lib -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 327 erty of the individual which is democra - cy 's soul .

		Six months of being at war , six months of mounting suspicions and sharpening in - quisition on the part of the public , of raids and suppressions on the part of officials , and of rumor of secret service astounding honest ears , has made every American realize the hitch between his peace-trained theory of the state 's activities and its bel - ligerent practice .

		Naturally , there have been accusations of intolerance , and preaching of tolerance ; certainly , too , sup - pression has produced cankerous in - growths of disloyalty .

		But , with it all , has there been -LRB- what a sane treatment calls for -RRB- that diagnosis of the powers and pur - poses of the state , in time of war , which shall enable us to set rational limits to tol - erance , preventing officials through un - derstanding from overstepping their country 's need , and satisfying citizens of the justice of official action and the safety of their rights ?

		Assuredly , the symptoms call for a verdict .

		In times of peace the limits of tolerance are defined by custom .

		In democracies laws are made and conduct is controlled by temporary majorities .

		It is the fact that these majorities are temporary , that they submit their rule periodically and frequently to electoral tests that define party strength , which gives a sense of pub - lic fairness and insures the equilibrium of the state .

		Furthermore , the minority has always at its disposal certain recognized means of converting itself into a major - ity , chief among them free speech and free party organization .

		The system thus rests upon the assumption of perpetual dif - ferences of `` issues '' relative to the control of the conduct of citizens ; and in - deed , if these `` issues '' did not exist , democratic government would cease .

		An agreement to disagree -LRB- within limits -RRB- is thus the very core of institutional democ - racy ; and the thing we call `` democratic tolerance '' is our name for the range of disagreement which we normally permit .

		For tolerance , even in times of peace , has clear limits .

		There are acts and con - ditions that can not be tolerated and soci - ety still endure .

		We recognize readily a human duty to be intolerant of , and to suppress and extinguish even at a cost of force and bloodshed , crime and sin : our criminal code is the profession of such an intention .

		Less consciously , but more tyrannously , the burden of a public will is imposed upon the individual in multitudes of details of our economic and social life , which we bear , for the most part , com - fortably , as we wear collars and shoes , not realizing that they are fetters .

		All this is quite as it should be : if we would be men , we must recognize moral obliga - tion and acquiesce in social restraint .

		In time of war the latitudes of differ - ence which we permit in the midst of peace are stringently narrowed ; and it is this narrowing of the latitude of action to which we are accustomed that stirs sensi - bility and arouses the jealous suspicion of outraged rights .

		Nor is war the only con - dition which entails such consequences ; other perils , as pestilence and flood and even the humanly created discomforts of economic strife , call for their own types of limitation of privilege and read - justment of rights .

		In them all is a cer - tain common character : they represent , as compared with the normal life of society , a sharp simplification of social ends and a great compression of social endeavor .

		The presence of peril acts immediately to define the near and major task of the body politic ; the complex and divergent activi - ties of normal times become temporarily but emphatically subordinated to the great activity of the preservation of their con - dition , and , as a consequence , the main force of society sweeps into a single chan - nel .

		Small wonder if the swollen major - ity becomes tyrannous , for its effort is at once more intense and backed by huger power than in the ordinary .

		Under ordinary conditions most men will accept as a reasonable rule of polit - ical conduct that opposition to the will of the majority should extend to its policies , but not to its execution of them , until the majority has been reversed by election .

		This is the rule of `` politics , '' of parlia - mentarism ; it is the assertion that laws are the friends of the citizen , or , with
Aristotle	PERSON	, that `` men should not deem it 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	slavery to live under the constitution , for it is their salvation . ''

		This rule , from the side of the government in power , is equiv - alent to the statement that it will tolerate all opposition which does not interfere with the execution of the tasks decided upon by the ruling majority .

		In brief , the range of tolerance is directly proportional to the demands of efficient government .

		This is the rule of political conduct in normal peace .

		In time of peril , war , or pestilence , it should be not different in principle , much as its practice must neces - sarily differ .

		But there is a complication .

		In the presence of pestilence there is an almost unanimous fear and willingness to submit to governmental guidance .

		War is man-made , and it is difficult to define its partisanships by national boundaries .

		Nor is its threat so transient ; there is fear of post-bellum alterations , modifying the whole order of life , a fear , on the whole , justified by history .

		Men , therefore , do not submit to military regimentation with the same resignation with which they un - dergo sanitary regulation .

		Passion poi - sons reason ; copperheadism develops into political disease ; and , on the side of the government , the legitimate limitation of individual privilege in accordance with the needs of efficient action is too readily re - placed by a vengeful constraint , which is the only true intolerance .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	to-day we have not as yet come to a bad pass , either in regard to the draft or to free speech .

		The will of the majority is unambiguous ; the causes of the war are generally felt as justifying causes and the government is generally be - lieved to be honest and competent .

		But this is not to say that we have no problem , nor that it is not developing .

		There is a minority , composed of the resentful igno - rant and the embittered opposition ; and the majority have not invariably shown the tact and judgment in the exercise of their prerogative which would diminish the resentment and the ignorance .

		Cer - tainly , the condition is not malignant , but before it has the opportunity of becoming so , there is needed such clear thinking-out and clear expression of our national poli - cies as shall reassure the doubting and comfort the opposition with respect to that one point in which they are entitled to as - surance the preservation of their minor - ity rights .

		The practical problem is twofold .

		On the part of the minority it calls for indi - vidual self-restraint .

		Its members should remember not only that they owe all citi - zenship rights to the state , but that they owe to it their essential humanity as well ; for , as
Rousseau	PERSON	shrewdly remarked , not only is man a political animal , but he is never truly man except as political .

		From this it follows that human `` personal lib - erty '' is liberty of the civic person , and must be defined by civic relations ; and again it follows that that relation of com - munication which is `` freedom of speech '' does not mean the right to unlimited hear - ings nor to command of the public ear .

		Further , the member of the minority should bear in mind that the contract of citizenship is not lightly drawn ; it is signed , as it were , when the first ballot is cast , and its terms are such -LRB- as once more
Rousseau	PERSON	notes -RRB- that the citizen binds himself to take what punishment the rules of its operation may bring upon him .

		He will remember , perhaps , that such a per - sonality as Socrates chose , as the lesser evil , to die under an unjust condemnation rather than break his country 's laws .

		With such precepts and example he should not find conformity hard , provided al - ways that he is convinced that the other member to the contract is acting in good faith .

		The obverse of the problem is the obli - gation of the majority .

		First and clearly , it is the duty of the government to be frank as to its policies and as free as the performance of its task will permit in its statement of current fact : news-doctoring in the interests of policy is the straight road to damnation , as
Germany	LOCATION	is illus - trating .

		In living up to this duty , our gov - ernment at present stands square ; the prestige which the
United States	LOCATION	has at - tained is almost entirely due to the frank - ness with which the President has stated our policies .

		Nevertheless , there is a form
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 329 of assurance , internal rather than external , which the times demand and which the government has not given .

		War is an unusual national enterprise , calling for an unusual majority supporting the govern - ment that is waging it a majority by no means represented by the alignment of the parties of normal times of peace .

		In
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean democracies this fact has been re - flected in the formation of coalition min - istries .

		Our cabinet is no responsible min - istry ; nevertheless , the obvious fact that the war party in
America	LOCATION	is enormously bulkier than the controlling political fac - tion ought to have been recognized should now be recognized by the forma - tion of at least a bi-partisan cabinet , com - prising those men of the two parties who most command the public confidence .

		The reason for doing this is here as in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope less for the conduct of the military enterprise than for the reassurance of the citizenry at home .

		For the best guarantee that our government can give , not only that we are engaged in war for no meanly political ends , but that the peace rights of our citizens are not to be imperilled by any post-bellum militarism , is the respon - sible participation in the national councils of the broadest representation possible .

		This would be a governmental pledge of faith .

		Thus the limits of democratic tolerance appear in the nature of democratic gov - ernment .

		It is not , however , out of place to note that Christian charity may add a virtue of even political value .

		Christian - ity teaches that no man in the flesh is be - yond hope of redemption ; hence , it is infinitely charitable of sinners , though never of sin .

		Similarly , tolerance , as a virtue , extends to men , never to their mis - deeds ; and above all , it extends to the ig - norance of men .

		Applied to the present , this means that we should hate injustice and atrocity , but not Germans .

		Certainly it is difficult to direct the emotions in ab - stracto , but if we can succeed in doing so we shall have given ourselves the deepest possible assurance of the security of our national ideals .


HARTLEY B. ALEXANDER	ORGANIZATION	.

		Literary Affairs in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- Special Correspondence to THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Fifty years ago the
last day of last month	DATE	,
Charles Baudelaire	PERSON	died in
Paris	LOCATION	, where he was born in
1821	DATE	, and consequently , in accordance with French law , the copyright on his works ended with the advent of the present month .

		So , notwithstanding the war , the poet has been much in evidence of late in the French publish - ing world , in
Paris	LOCATION	periodicals , and among the literary critics of the capital .

		It is not forgotten how , when some thirty years ago there began a tendency to apotheosize the author of the fa - mous , some would and do say infamous , `` Fleurs du Mai , '' Brunetiere and Faguet led in the op - position and indulged in virulent attacks on the man and his verse .

		In `` Nouveaux Pretextes , ''
M. Andre Gide	PERSON	is considered to have refuted the latter , while the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' has dis - covered in an article of the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' for
June 1 , 1887	DATE	, an amusing blunder in which the always rather magisterial future editor of that periodical says that when
Baude	PERSON	- laire wrote `` Les Fleurs du Mai '' he was `` in one of those fits to which specialists have applied a word which never better suited the case , periode clownique '' Brunetiere mistook clonic , a medical term for spasm , for the English word clown , used so commonly in French !

		Nor does Baudelaire to-day , a half-century after his death , escape from the critics , though for every friend and reader during his lifetime , he now probably has a thousand .

		Even
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	, generally so amiable toward him , said recently that `` there was in this poet-innovator a substratum of philistinism and a touch of the church-warden ; and what is most lacking in his writings is manly firmness . ''

		On a single
Paris	LOCATION	daily , `` Le Petit Bleu , '' are two contrib - utors who are especially severe in their judg - ment on the moral effect of
Baudelaire	LOCATION	's poems on the general public .

		`` Such articles are signs of the time , '' remarks the `` Mercure '' somewhat contemptuously .

		One of these rather straight - laced censors ,
M. Jean Hess	PERSON	, considers `` the erotic perfume of `
Les Fleurs du Mai	ORGANIZATION	' a ver - itable danger , a national peril '' ; while another ,
M. Jacques Nargaud	PERSON	, himself a poet , who some twenty years ago brought out at `` La Plume '' a volume of verse , `` Soliloques , '' dedicated to
Baudelaire	LOCATION	, though still an ardent admirer of him `` I collect everything I see which speaks of this unique poet , '' he once said to me dilates 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	in one of his recent articles on `` the poisoned bouquet of `
Les Fleurs du Mai	ORGANIZATION	. ' ''

		But another contemporary French poet ,
M. Ernest Raynaud	PERSON	, seems to sweep aside all this depreciation when he informs me that he is busy on a volume `` whose aim is to refute all the accepted lies about the poet . ''

		More interesting perhaps , or at least less apt to cause discussion , are some notes which I have accumulated concerning the various editions of `` Les Fleurs du Mai . ''

		Writing me from the
Paris	LOCATION	office of the
Societe des Poetes Francois	ORGANIZATION	, of which he is the vice - president ,
M. Ernest Raynaud	ORGANIZATION	says : If one considers solely the order of the poems and their typographical form , the only editions which count are those published during the lifetime of the poet , which he could supervise .

		AH the posthumous editions of his works have been done rather care - lessly .

		But if we are to have regard to the value of the documents bearing on the subject and to critical observations , none satisfies me completely .

		In the matter of different readings , Prince
Ourousoff	PERSON	's work is interesting , while the notes of Van
Bever	PERSON	show him to be a ferreter with a cautious and conscientious mind .

		But so far nothing of capital importance , noth - ing that is decisive , has been printed in this field of
Baudelairiana	LOCATION	.

		Most of the publishers of new edi - tions repeat the old faults without attempting to cor - rect any of them .

		And what a lot of foolish things have been said about Baudelaire , beginning with the famous Preface of
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	, which might astonish us by its incompetency and its nonsense if we did not know that it was written in this way on purpose .

		Some day I may explain the true inward - ness of the pretended friendship between Baudelaire and
Gautier	PERSON	.

		The whole subject of Baudelaire is so interesting that I have found a volume , `` Le Cinquan - tenaire de Charles Baudelaire '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Meunier	PERSON	, 3 fr .

		SO -RRB- , necessary to present properly all that I have to say .

		At the end of the volume will be found a bibliography giving all the articles which I have been able to find concerning him and which I have made as complete as possible in other respects .

		To return to the question of the different edi - tions of
Baudelaire	LOCATION	,
M. Jacques Nargaud	ORGANIZATION	writes me as follows : The most widely sold edition of `` Les Fleurs du Mai '' is that of Calmann-Levy , issued at the end of the sixties , being a volume of the Complete Works , which include the translations from Poe .

		But it is far from perfect from all points of view .

		I say noth - ing of the first and second editions , printed in the fifties by
Poulet Malassis	PERSON	, one of which it is difficult to find and both of which are very costly when found .

		A little before the war , the publisher Cres put on the market a limited edition of `` Les Fleurs du Mai '' which has always seemed to me to be the best But copies of this , too , are not easy to get .

		The cheap edition just issued by Calmann-Levy is not handsome typographically , nor does it contain the fine introduction by
Gautier	PERSON	found in the edition men - tioned at the beginning of this paragraph .

		Those who wish to make a serious study of
Baude	LOCATION	- laire should see a volume by
Charles Asselineau	PERSON	, published by
Lemerre	PERSON	but long out of print , and es - pecially the volume of souvenirs by Crepct , issued by
Messeiu	ORGANIZATION	, which it would be hard to obtain at present , however , as
M. Messeiu	ORGANIZATION	is in the army and his shop closed .

		The
Lemerre	PERSON	edition of `` Les Fleurs du Mai '' appeared in the collection `` Petite Bibliothequc Litteraire , '' but is now out of print , though a new edition is under way .

		`` This edition , how - ever , ''
M. Lemerre	PERSON	writes me , `` is the same as regards the text , as that issued by my fellow - publisher , Calmann-Levy . ''

		I might add that this last mentioned book will now be largely replaced by the new `` popular edition '' issued by this same publisher -LRB- at 1 fr .

		25 -RRB- and referred to above by
M. Nargaud	ORGANIZATION	.

		I would further add that the numerous little errors in the text of the first impression have been practically all removed I myself have compared with care the two im - pressions in the volumes now on the market .

		The
National Printing Office of France	ORGANIZATION	set up a year and a half ago a rich edition of `` Les Fleurs du Mai , '' partly as an official tribute to the memory of a great French man of letters .

		But the director informs me that copies can not be obtained from him but from two
Paris	LOCATION	pub - lishers ,
Vollard	LOCATION	, 6 rue Laffitte , and
Helleu	PERSON	, 125
Boulevard Saint-Germain	ORGANIZATION	; and the latter writes me in this connection : `` Mine is a typographic edition , simply decorated , and sells at 25 francs , whereas the
Vollard	ORGANIZATION	edition , which came out at the end of
1915	DATE	, is illustrated by
Bernard	PERSON	and sells for from 300 to 600 francs . ''

		But here again the admirers of Baudelaire and good typog - raphy have not been wholly satisfied , largely because of a faulty arrangement of some of the verses , the blame for which , it would seem , should be laid rather to the
National Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	than to the publishers .

		But I believe that
M. Helleu	PERSON	has removed these blemishes from his volumes .

		I may close these notes with these reflections of
M. Andre Fontainas	PERSON	on some of the editions just mentioned : There are several rich editions of `` Les Fleurs du Mai , '' limited as regards the number of copies printed , largely subscribed for in advance and quickly out of print .

		To my mind , their most striking characteristic is the badness of the illustrations .

		The truth is , it seems to me , that there is no really good edition of `` Les Fleurs du Mai . ''

		Cres 's edition , which was first published at 10 francs , now fetches , I believe , from 80 to 100 , when a copy can be found .

		But it , too , is full of faults .

		But the proverbially strong taste of the French for poetry has not been confined during the past months wholly to the dead poets , though Shake - speare and Baudelaire have monopolized much attention .

		Considering the all-absorbing influ -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 331 ences of the war , much new verse has been pro- duced ; and none of the singers has surpassed
M. Paul Fort	PERSON	, the `` Prince of Poets , '' at least as re - gards quantity .

		M.
Paul Fort	PERSON	's most recent volume is `` Si Peau d'Ane m ` etait conte '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Emile	PERSON	-
Paul	PERSON	, 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- , described by the author as `` tales , written in war time , for Jacques Bon - homme , '' with this pretty thought forming the whole of the author 's preface : `` In this book of fairy tales and poems , the only fairy is the au - thor 's imagination . ''

		From
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's pref - ace , which the literary world on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	should meditate , I take these lines :
Paul Fort	PERSON	is perhaps the only complete poet we possess , ... which is at once his glory and his mis - fortune .

		He can only write poetry and can do noth - ing else .

		So he publishes one after the other , with disastrous abundance , a dozen or more volumes ... It is high time that he were given , while still alive , the glory that is his due .

		We shall not have him always among us , and the remorse and amends will come when it is too late .

		Maeterlinck does not exaggerate
Paul Fort	PERSON	's excessive literary productivity .

		Besides the vol - ume just mentioned , he has published during the present year `` Anthologie des Ballades Franchises '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Mercure de
France	LOCATION	, 4 fr . -RRB-

		, selections from twenty volumes issued during a period of twenty years , from
1897	DATE	to
1917	DATE	; `` Poemes de
France	LOCATION	, '' which he calls `` my lyrical war bulle - tin '' ; and `` Deux Chaumieres au Pays de 1 ` Yvel - ine . ''

		These last two volumes I have not seen .

		In the meantime , he has been preparing for , or seeing through , the press three other volumes .

		In
October	DATE	will appear `` Que j' ai de plaisir d'etre Frangais , '' about which he writes me : I have just corrected the proofs .

		To express my intense love for
France	LOCATION	, I took as the subject of this new book the three trips which I have made in Tou - raine and to
Blois	LOCATION	and
Vendome	ORGANIZATION	, which are as decid - edly French as are the He de
France	LOCATION	, Champagne , and
Picardy	LOCATION	, about which I have sung a thousand times .

		In
November	DATE	will appear `` L'Alouette , '' a vol - ume made up of popular songs , `` or at least songs written in the note of the old Gallic ballads . ''

		The poet thus describes the volume which he expects to have out in
January	DATE	: At the present moment I am giving the last touches to `` La Lanterne de Priollet ou 1 ` Epopee du
Luxembourg	LOCATION	, '' in which I recount my childhood and adolescence , the awakening in me of a soul for poetry .

		I there affirm the `` divinity '' of children and tell all my love for that garden of gardens , our fairy
Luxembourg	LOCATION	, where more than at school I was formed , found myself , and discovered that I was a poet .

		So you see that though a soldier , an auxiliary , I have not been idle with my pen these last months , for two good reasons : first , because I like to sing , and secondly , because I must live , and I am a poet , noth - ing but a poet .

		War does n't bring gold to the pockets of troubadours .

		In
France	LOCATION	, if they would live even modestly , they must sing , and it is all the worse for them if they do not always feel in a singing mood , which often happens to me .

		So do n't be astonished at the number of volumes .

		I must live !

		Thus during
1917	DATE	,
M. Paul Fort	ORGANIZATION	will have printed or finished in manuscript not less than seven volumes , not to speak of two others which one of his publishers announces as `` being under way . ''

		This almost equals the elder
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	, with the marked difference however that
Paul Fort	PERSON	has not a basement-full of `` collabora - tors '' preparing novels which `` the master '' simply touches up .

		No wonder , therefore , that so far in his career ,
Paul Fort	PERSON	has had to have half a dozen different publishers .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and the Anglophobe WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS : A STUDY OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A LITERARY ARTIST .

		By
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Harvey	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
Alexander Harvey	PERSON	writes some two hundred and sixty pages of jottings about Chin - gachgook , Mr.
W. C. Brownell	PERSON	,
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, the late
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	,
Philistin	LOCATION	- ism , Genius ,
Boston	LOCATION	, Woman , Quackery in Literature , and a host of other Cabbages and Kings , all of them so equally and energetically dealt with that it is more than a little difficult to tell the Cabbages from the Kings .

		Having fin - ished the collection , he has the whimsical thought to call it ``
William Dean Howells	PERSON	: A Study of the Achievement of a Literary Artist . ''

		No sooner thought than done : to have a thought is , for Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	, to execute it .

		The result , so far as the relation to a nominal subject is con - cerned , is a critical counterpart of `` The Life and Opinions of
Tristram Shandy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This is slightly exaggerated , of course , Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	would be the last person to mind that , but it is the truth that is exaggerated .

		The author 's text is not so much a book as a tirade , not so much a tirade as a miscellany , and not so much a miscellany as the preface to an index .

		For Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	has his own idea of indexes , as of most else : he has `` long suffered at the hands of the makers of indexes , '' and he strives to `` give those hacks a lead . ''

		One may cite selectively , to show both his idea of `` thunder in 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	the index '' and the pet aversion on which his book hinges : BRITONS , IMBECILITIES OF THE .

		A large topic !

		I can do no more than glance at it .

		I ought to say in fair - ness that I dislike Britons heartily , although it is true that they have many noble qualities .


LONDON	LOCATION	.

		Its pontifically final attitude to ourselves in literature .

		MISSISSIPPI .

		That sublime river is mentioned by way of illustration .

		In the average index the name would be set down and a number would follow it .

		This is too absurd .

		Such are the consequences of following a British literary example .

		NOVEL .

		It deteriorates in the
British Isles	LOCATION	.

		VICTORIANS , THOSE .

		Confound them !

		This cluster of items will suggest that Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	has undertaken to prove himself the most implacable of Anglophobes .

		His book is an indictment of `` the British literary superstition , '' as he calls it , and as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	called it a quarter of a century before him .

		The British literary superstition is that perverse humility which induces American newspapers , critics , pro- fessors , schools , and the great American public to swallow all literary opinions imported from
London	LOCATION	, and to despise all things American until they have the pontifical sanction of the British Isles .

		It is , as described by Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	, our imbecile deference to the artistic prejudices of a nation incapable of art , a nation of non-thinkers and sentimentalists , wrapped in impenetrable self - esteem and childishly enthralled by a national literature which is the laughingstock of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The English are pitiable because of their pre - tensions to literary judgment ; we Americans are pitiable because of our deference to the English pretensions .

		Such is the main thesis ; and the book is written primarily to undermine our defer - ence by riddling the pretensions .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, the most American and at the same time the grandest and most spacious phenomenon we have produced in letters , is used as a mere handle to the argument .

		Now , the
American Anglophobe	ORGANIZATION	, whether he realizes it or not , and Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	often seems not to realize it , is in a pretty difficult position .

		Whether his general estimate of British taste be right or wrong , he never escapes the weakness of having to relate everything to an aversion .

		The centre of his cosmos is a dislike ; by that dislike he measures and evaluates everything else ; in it he moves and has his being .

		He likes things , not for what they are , but for what they are against .

		We feel this weakness in Mr.
Har	PERSON	- vey .

		His praise of
Howells	ORGANIZATION	is unstinted , extrava - gant , a measure pressed down and running over .

		Howells is the greatest living master of fiction ; he is the consummate stylist ; he creates women as great as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ; his dialogue is un - matched ; he is superior to
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Dostoevsky	LOCATION	; he has the ultimate magic as a narrator ; he maintains `` that perfect balance of all factors which is the secret of the equilibrium of the universe . ''

		Yet somehow the superlatives ring strangely hollow .

		Because
Howells	PERSON	is praised and overpraised to serve a vindictive ulterior purpose , this very enthusiasm of the critic does more to belittle him than even a very temperate estimate could do if it were disinterested .

		But this is by no means the most serious dilemma of the American Anglophobe who makes the brunt of his argument fall on Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		It happens that , of the three generations of Ang - lophobia represented by
Poe	ORGANIZATION	,
Howells	PERSON	, and Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	, only the second is really American .

		Poe had no anchorage in either space or time : he was almost strictly extramundane .


Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- phobes of the younger generation are cosmopoli - tan ; they arc anti-English simply because they are anti-provincial .

		But Mr.
Howells	PERSON	happens really to believe in and love
America	LOCATION	.

		He is alone among Anglophobes in that he definitely chooses one kind of provincialism , which is American , against another kind , which is Eng - lish .

		All the rest choose cosmopolitanism against provincialism in general ; and when they make of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	their heaviest bludgeon , merely be - cause he has agreed with them so far as to denounce the British literary superstition , they commit strange distortions and fall into strange inconsistencies .

		Here is Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	, for example .

		He likes
America	LOCATION	best when he is thinking about
England	LOCATION	because
America	LOCATION	is not
England	LOCATION	.

		But when he looks at
America	LOCATION	directly , she fails to stand the test of his exacting cosmopolitan standards .

		It is a rather pathetically homeless state of mind , this cosmopolitan skepticism .

		Its loyalty to one tradition is based on distrust of another ; and yet its own tradition seems not to bear analysis any better than the other does .

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	is rather like an atheist becoming a member of the English Church out of pure temperamental aversion to Dissenters .

		America is not
England	LOCATION	: therefore it must be Utopia .

		But , on second thought ,
America	LOCATION	is Philistinism ;
America	LOCATION	is the American newspaper ;
America	LOCATION	is critical taste dictated by an advertising policy ;
America	LOCATION	is the Victorian family system ;
America	LOCATION	is
Boston	LOCATION	;
America	LOCATION	is the
New England	LOCATION	conscience ; Amer -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 333 ica is a vile subservience to British literary pre - judices : therefore
America	LOCATION	is not fit to live in .

		Not even in direct treatment of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, idolatrous as his treatment is , can Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	wriggle free of such contradictions .

		On one page
Howells	PERSON	is the supreme artist .

		On another , `` the art of Howells is barren '' ; it is `` art and nothing more . ''

		`` Howells will not be superseded because there is nothing about him to supersede .

		He has not made anything original even in the way of a mistake . ''

		We hear
Howells	PERSON	praised for having read the inmost soul of
America	LOCATION	; then we hear
America	LOCATION	scorned for having no soul , nothing but surface .

		In one passage , `` his knowledge of character is manifest in his feminine portraits ... he has a precious insight into the heart of woman ... the art with which their souls are bared to us is the authentic art that has come down to us through the few masters of the written word . ''

		Here , of course , Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	is thinking of
Howells	ORGANIZATION	's superiority to British novelists .

		Later , though , `` the genius of Howells is objective and not subjective ... He does not think .

		He merely observes and jots down impressions ... Topography , objects , mate - rial items , are his all in all .

		He does not get below these physical manifestations of life to the life itself , the essence , the soul . ''

		And , crime of crimes , he has created and sponsored the `` Sissy School . ''

		He , more than any other one writer , has rendered contemporary American literature a thin syrup , perfumed to a feminized taste . ''

		Thus , throughout , Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	tries to have his cake and eat it too .

		Hills are marched up and then marched down again ; superlatives deny each other with crushing emphasis .

		And , to palliate the inconsistencies , there is nothing whatever except a well-worn ruse of that very academicism which the author himself denounces on suitable occasions : namely , the barren dis - tinction between the `` art '' in fiction and the substance .

		As though there could be any great art except that which leans on great truth !

		After all , one likes Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	, who writes a preface to an index , a great deal better than one likes Dr.
Dryasdust	PERSON	, who only writes an index to an index .

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	diverts even while he irritates ; and often he is unsurpassably acute , as when he says : `` The supreme object of the earthly existence of men and women in a
Howells	LOCATION	atmos - phere is to have things go on as usual .

		There is an agitating possibility that they may not . ''

		We ask for bread and are given by no means a stone , but , let us say , a cocktail .

		The alert reader of the book can extend and amplify this analogy for himself .

		Suffice it to add , the bread which Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	might have given us is a generous recognition of the extent to which all literature , including the British , is being
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peanized .

		Whatever English fiction has been , it is to-day integral with a world tendency .

		One of the great achievements of
Howells	PERSON	was his revolt against the narrow obtuseness and self - love of British fiction when those qualities really had a threatening prestige .

		But the last two de - cades have seen
Britain	LOCATION	's fiction broadened , inter - nationalized in both method and purport .

		All intellectual
Britain	LOCATION	revolts against its own former obscurantism ; and when we look about our world for the positive and constructive Anglophobe who has the strongest claim to our notice , lo !

		he is none other than the British novelist of the younger generation .

		The present war must be won in field and fac - tory before it can be won in the trenches .

		An army has become , as never before , only the out - ermost point or apex of a pyramid of organiza - tion of which the base is the country 's industrial and agrarian system .

		The maker of victory is the laborer far more than the soldier .

		That this remark has become a commonplace does not relieve one of the necessity of re - peating it , and still repeating it , and repeat - ing it again .

		For it is a commonplace which the manufacturer and contractor have regarded thus far as defining only the duty which the workman owes ; and they have denied and ignored the duty which they and the government owe the workman .

		Already his assertion of his just rights , of what are , indeed , the indispensable conditions of his effective serving , are met with `` slacker , '' and `` disloyal , '' `` pro-German , '' while the attempt properly to tax war profits has failed and that extraordinary piece of impudence , the petition of a group of manufacturers which de - clares that the workman is not meeting his re - sponsibilities , and that his demands for better wages and right shop-standards should be force - fully restrained and arrested , is regarded as 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	`` patriotic . ''

		In wartime , as always , that is `` pat - triotic '' which decorously cloaks one 's private interest under pleas for the public weal , and that is disloyal or `` pro-German '' which is likely to interfere with one 's private interests , even when it most successfully serves the commonwealth .

		Hence , the fact that the basic maker of vic - tory is the laborer in field and factory has not resulted in the improvement of the conditions of production of food and weapons to which it points .

		The whole country is solicitous about the health , the happiness , and the future of the soldier .

		He is guarded against disease , against unnecessary fatigue , and if the insurance bill is passed , as it should be , against the hazards of battle and death .

		Not so the workman .

		He is left to shift for himself , to conduct his rather blind and ill-conceived strikes , to meet fatigue and disease and maiming and death as best he may .

		The German government , whom we are fighting , has known better .

		Its military ruth - lessness abroad is grounded upon its industrial considerateness at home , and it has held out so long precisely because it has guarded its work - ing masses against fatigue and disease and maim - ing and death .

		But the German government is an autocracy , responsible to no one , and may act as it will .

		So it not infrequently deviates into intelligence .

		The governments of
England	LOCATION	and of the
United States	LOCATION	, being of democratic consti - tution , act as they must , and the compulsion upon them is very various public opinion , the inertia and circumlocution of departmental tradition , the interests of the `` invisible government , '' and , per accidens , also intelligence .

		Mostly , how - ever , democratic governments learn only by the method of trial and error .

		They have short memories and can not easily profit by the past , particularly if the past is not their own .

		They are consequently wasteful of treasure , life , and time you need only regard the history of Eng - land in this war to realize how much and how stupidly .

		Those who desire consolation may consider the idea that democracies are built for comfort , not for speed ... The record of the handling of labor in Eng - land for the period of the war is a characteristic piece of British muddling .

		The history of labor in the
United States	LOCATION	since this country entered the war is a characteristic piece of American thoughtlessness .

		There was , and there is , the example of
England	LOCATION	before the public officials and the private industrial magnates ; there were and there are before them the various findings of
the Health of Munition Workers Committee	ORGANIZATION	; also the various reports of the Chief Factory Inspector .

		They were aware of the remarkable document on which
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	sustained the
Oregon	LOCATION	Eight Hour Law ; they were aware of the varied testimony of the efficiency experts of
America	LOCATION	.

		But they went their own way , regardless , with the con - sequence that there have been more strikes in the three months past than in the last three years ; delay instead of promptness , inferior work instead of excellence , disorder instead of order , and dis - content instead of cooperation .

		And as we shall be deeper in before we are farther out of this war , the future looks promising .


Britain	LOCATION	's handling of the labor situation is on a par with her handling of the Gallipoli cam - paign .

		But Gallipoli is a costly error which may be retrieved , while there is a `` no thorough - fare '' at the end of all the ways with which the British government has dealt with its labor prob - lem up to the present .

		When the war came trade-unions in
England	LOCATION	had a strong and pe - culiarly influential position .

		They had achieved power in politics and their relations with the employing class were governed by what Mr.
Webb	PERSON	describes as `` a complicated network of usages and regulations , differing from district to district , and often from establishment to estab - lishment . ''

		These had grown up as `` necessary defences against a progressive degradation of their standard of life , '' and their role in the in - dustry of the nation was like that of the British constitution in the political affairs of the nation a very complicated , unwritten tradition , the winnings of a struggle between the possessing and the dispossessed , and the palladium of such liberties , industrial or political , as Englishmen currently chose to secure and to defend .

		War found
England	LOCATION	altogether unprepared for its exi - gencies , and her industrial unpreparedness was worse than her military .

		War compelled , there - fore , an industrial reorganization of
England	LOCATION	, a reorganization , Mr.
Webb	PERSON	declares , tantamount to a revolution .

		Nothing less could have served to bring production to the point where the enemy could be met , at least , on equal terms .

		A revo - lution accordingly took place .

		The trade-union network was swept away ; labor was `` diluted '' ; non-union women workers and unskilled men were set to work ; single processes were broken up into parts and given to separate workers ; automatic machinery was introduced ; the hours of labor were lengthened ; holidays were abol -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 335 ished ; machinery was sped up .

		The industrial organization of
England	LOCATION	was , as one trade-union - ist put it , Americanized .

		This was done with the good will and consent of the whole British labor organization .

		At a stroke it sacrificed for the good of the nation , the hard winnings of three-quarters of a century of industrial conflict .

		All that it required in return was , as Mr.
Montagu	PERSON	, then Minister of Muni - tions , said in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	on
August 15 , 1916	DATE	, `` a scrupulous record and recognition of what they were conceding . ''

		This was prom - ised them , and more , by minister after minister .

		The `` more '' was a pledge completely and abso - lutely to restore trade-union conditions after the war .

		And an act of Parliament made the prom - ise the promise of the nation .

		It is not a promise that can be kept .

		British industry , both war and non-war industry , has been completely transformed .

		The new ma - chines , the use of piecework , the standardization of processes , the great increase in new labor , which will remain in the field after the war , all mean a new situation which the old `` trade-union network '' can neither meet nor control .

		More - over , in spite of the many solemn promises , the record of the customs , usages , and standards abol - ished has in most instances been very laxly kept , in some instances not kept at all .

		The ministry of munitions has been tender about compelling em - ployers to abide by this part of their contract .

		It seemed to hold in its mind 's eye heaped-up moun - tains of munitions , and gave little thought to the quality of human nature which heaps such moun - tains up .

		The Munitions of War Act had `` pro- hibited strikes and lockouts in war industries , '' writes
Miss Walter	PERSON	, `` and substituted compul - sory arbitration . ''

		Workmen were required to show `` certificates of discharge '' from their em - ployers and were subject to trial by local muni - tions committees for anything `` tending to re - strict production . ''

		There ensued a heyday of exploitation by profiteers .

		This was followed by the inevitable conse - quences .

		Workers could not be recruited and held in sufficient numbers to insure an adequate supply of munitions ; while those at work `` slacked , '' missed days , and otherwise fell short .

		Finally , in
September , 1915	DATE	, there was appointed , under the
Ministry of Munitions	ORGANIZATION	,
the Health of Munition Workers Committee	ORGANIZATION	, with Sir
George Newman	PERSON	as chairman .

		Its findings are grouped by Miss
Walter	PERSON	under five heads hours of la - bor , health and hygiene , general welfare , employ - ment of women , juvenile employment .

		The findings are the expected .

		That exces - sive hours , continuous labor , overtime , night work , all decrease the output , while shorter hours , with appropriate periods of rest , increase it .

		That fatigue , accumulated , retards produc - tion , spoils work , causes accidents , sickness , lost time , and staleness , and that it was the cause of much that the employers denounced as slack - ing .

		That accidents are due also to unguarded machinery , the lack of safety appliances , absence of regulation of dangerous processes , inadequate lighting , dirty machinery , uninstructed employees .

		That disease is also due to inadequate attention to slight wounds and abrasions , to insufficient protection against poisonous material , and to the lack of proper washing facilities , ventilation , heating , and lighting .

		That output depends on good housing , easy transportation , proper nour - ishment , humane incentives to work .

		That the existence of right conditions is indispensable where women and children are employed .

		The report may be summarized as pointing out that the human machine at work is at least no worse than other machines , that it is , like other ma - chines , subject to deterioration and wastage , and that it consequently should have at least the same constant , careful examination and repair as the others if it is to be kept at maximum utility .

		But there is this unhappy paradox : human be - ings are not merely machines .

		That is why they get worse treatment , and are , in addition , blamed for not doing so well as machines .

		Hence , al - though the
Newman	PERSON	committee did its work thoroughly , its effect has not been great .

		There has been some improvement , but things are very much as they were , and , as is usual in such mat - ters , are likely to grow worse rather than better .

		The English government has organized its indus - tries , but it has alienated the workers .

		It has failed even to maintain the human part of the industrial machine at adequate efficiency .

		It has made the workers a pledge that it can not keep after having received at their hands the greatest sacrifice to national welfare that any social class has yet made .

		There is distrust in
England	LOCATION	, and when the war is over there will be worse .

		`` Up and down the country , '' says Mr.
Webb	PERSON	, `` the workmen will be very angry ... In every branch meeting ... at every labor conference , the tale will be discussed of how , when the government was in a hole , and the employers were eager for 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	war profits , the opportunity was taken to play upon the workmen 's patriotic feelings to induce them to make what the responsible minister de - scribed as perhaps as great a sacrifice as has ever been asked of any community ; of how the Trade -
Union Leaders	ORGANIZATION	, in the name of the workmen ... made this sacrifice ... in reliance on the pledge of the government and the employers that the ` pre-war conditions ' ... would in their integrity be restored ; and of how , when the time came , the nation and the employers , hav - ing secured all the advantages , broke their word , and the workmen found themselves done ! ''

		War , in a word , can not go on forever , and no state , not even the German , can live by war alone .

		The democracy for which the world must be made safe is industrial democracy even more than other kinds , and the British way of making the world safe for democracy in industry has too close a family resemblance to
Jonathan Swift	PERSON	's solution of the Irish problem .

		England may , of course , go on muddling .

		The authorities may , Mr.
Webb	PERSON	suggests , deceive the workmen .

		They may effect a sham restoration , and so intensify the class war , keep real wages down , and put a premium on the practice of `` ca 1 canny '' or limit - ing the output .

		Both employees and employers will suffer , and the country will suffer .

		The way deeper in is here obviously not at all the way out .

		The way out is another way alto - gether .

		It is the way of a return to first prin - ciples , and first principles demand a reconsider - ation of the motives and energies of human life and the value of the machinery of society in enlarging and perfecting them .

		Mr.
Webb	PERSON	's proposals consequently derive from an implicit and daring assumption that working people are men and women first and carpenters , or ladlers , or cartridge-fillers afterward , and that they be - come the latter in order to preserve the former .

		They want , in a word , to live , to express their spontaneous energies , to find happiness .

		To do this well , they must be insured against unem - ployment , against destruction of their standards of life , against assault on their collective inter - ests .

		And they must be guaranteed the right to strike .

		Their livings , in short , must serve to emphasize their lives .

		This is really what trade - unionism aims at .

		Against this need is the employers ' demand for `` a progressive increase in industrial effi - ciency . ''

		Sir
George Newman	PERSON	's committee has shown that far from being opposed , these two interests are interdependent .

		To secure the max - imum to both Mr.
Webb	PERSON	suggests a new indus - trial charter to replace the unrestorable `` trade - union network . ''

		The first article of such a charter is the prevention of unemployment through such a programme of public work , cov - ering the first decade after the war , `` as will maintain approximately level from year to year the aggregate wage total of the kingdom . ''

		The second is the maintenance of standard rates of wages .

		The third is a constitution for factory and industry , involving in principle and in or - ganization industrial democracy within a given trade .

		The fourth is the result of the first three the abolition of `` ca ' canny . ''

		The fifth is the freedom of men and women to enter or leave trades , with the public guarantee of skilled craftsmen against unemployment and against re - duction of standards .

		Such is Mr.
Webb	PERSON	's modest proposal mod - est , this time , not in Dr.
Swift	PERSON	's sense .

		What bearing have this proposal and the con - ditions that evoked it upon the wartime indus - trial situation in
America	LOCATION	?

		Here industrial conditions are in many respects very different from those in
England	LOCATION	, and American trade-unionism differs from British both in influence and in vigor .

		In
England	LOCATION	the political action of organized labor is direct ; in
America	LOCATION	it is indirect .

		Ameri - can labor organizations are without the English experience in cooperation , productive and distrib - utive , in the significance and value of education , in political insight .

		The American trade-union is still a very primitive thing merely a battle - formation in the class war , designed to wrest better wages , hours , and working conditions from the employing classes .

		It is not , as it is in so many cases in
England	LOCATION	, an agency in the creative reorganization of the workman 's life .

		It is without responsibility in the industry which it serves , without traditions , and not so resistant to innovation .

		Thus , `` efficiency engi - neering , '' unknown in
England	LOCATION	until the war , is an American profession , and plants like the
Ford	ORGANIZATION	or the
Franklin	PERSON	are primarily American phenomena .

		Trade-unionism is still far from being what it should be in American industry an automatically accepted constituent in the country 's industrial life .

		The primitivism of union organization in
America	LOCATION	is a limitation , but a limitation which is also an opportu - nity .

		The evil effect of the limitation showed itself in the munitions works in
Bridgeport	LOCATION	,
Connecti	LOCATION	- cut .

		Although
Miss Hewes	PERSON	's study is confined
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 337 to the subject of women as munition-makers , its social and economic findings apply generally .

		It is a study limited in scope because the authori - ties at the plant refused the Russell Sage Foun - dation permission to make an exhaustive study of the industrial situation in the plant .

		When such a study as could be made `` was submitted in manuscript in advance of publication , to officials of the
Remington Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge Company	ORGANIZATION	for their criticism ... '' they suggested `` that no study could be accurate which was not based on data obtained in the plant itself . ''

		Thereupon , once more , `` the Foun - dation offered to make a supplementary inquiry before publishing the report .

		This offer was refused . ''

		The findings of the report show why .

		Conditions in
Bridgeport	LOCATION	during the
summer of 1916	DATE	echoed `` those under which English women worked for the first year or more of the war with such bad effects upon themselves and upon efficiency of production .

		^ ' In the
summer of 1915	DATE	, when war orders began to accumulate and `` rumors of fabulous war profits '' spread , a series of strikes established , `` in spite of strong opposition of the
Manufacturers	ORGANIZATION	' Association of
Bridgeport	LOCATION	, '' the eight-hour day and higher wages .

		But the unions were not strong enough to enforce a closed shop , and night work was on the increase .

		The lure of higher pay , however , made of
Bridgeport	LOCATION	a boom town and brought upon the heads of its administration all the problems of housing , sanitation , education , recreation , and so on , that a boom town creates .

		Everything went up with the wages , and far outdistanced them , so that in effect , the actual wage of the workers was lower , not higher , than before the boom .

		In the shops , moreover , accident-prevention has not gone far enough ; mutilation and indus - trial poisoning were frequent .

		Said one muti - lated girl : `` I often had to complain about that machine , but they did n't put guards on it until after I was hurt . ''

		There was little regard , it will be noted , for the need of safety appliances .

		For sanitary precautions there seems to have been less : `` One worker employed in a process in which she handled fulminate reported that em - ployees in her department were forbidden to wash their hands until after the factory whistle blew for dismissal , and that the only washing fa - cilities were long troughs with a number of spigots .

		She also said that no towels were pro- vided . ''

		Nor was the eight-hour day long retained .

		The women in the factories were `` unable to offer effective resistance when little by little they were robbed of the gift -LSB- the eight-hour day -RSB- , their schedules of working hours being modified , first by frequent overtime , and later by the com - pany 's regarding this overtime as part of the reg - ular daily hours . ''

		In many instances the period for luncheon was fifteen minutes , and was not lengthened when the eight-hour , was dishonestly changed to a ten-hour , schedule .

		And the workers were also defrauded of their higher wages .

		`` When once the larger force was organized , the eight-hour day was gradually lengthened .

		So , during the
summer of 1916	DATE	, the management appeared to be engaged in the policy of reducing rates of pay .

		` We used to get \ 2 l /
2 cents	MONEY	a thousand , ' said an inspector , ` and that certainly did make slick pay for a girl .

		But now they only give us
nine cents	MONEY	for the same work . '

		Even where piece rates were not reduced , the tremendous speed at which the machinery was driven , according to the testi - mony of many of the girls , so injured the ma - chines that they could not turn out as much as they used to . ''

		Only the lifeless machines were repaired when they were injured .

		The upshot of the boom , thus , was , primarily and chiefly , the exploitation of the workers , and the deterioration of the town and its inhabitants .

		Here , however , the citizens of
Bridgeport	LOCATION	took a hand .

		`` The merchants and manufacturers , the educators and the physicians , the
Chamber of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, civic and philanthropic associa - tions united for action .

		They got expert advice and went to work . ''

		A bond issue was sanc - tioned by popular vote for a budget covering the items of education , public safety , sanitation , streets , roads , and parks .

		A recreation and hous - ing commission was appointed , and the Bridge - port Housing Company was formed .

		Nothing , however , could be done to improve the indus - trial conditions .

		`` Women still work at night ... and protection against accident and indus - trial disease in munition shops is still inadequate , as is the amount of compensation for disability due to industry . ''

		The industrial situation in
Bridgeport	LOCATION	is rep - resentative .

		Our participation in the war has aggravated it , not changed it .

		The pre-war ma - chinery of adjustment and conciliation of the
Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	is too small and too weak to cope with it , and even if it were strong enough , it could affect only symptoms , not causes .

		The new machinery , consisting of the Commit - 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	tee on Labor of the
Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defense	ORGANIZATION	, departmental ad - visors , and special committees like that headed by Mr.
Louis Kerstein	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, is not co - ercive and therefore impotent .

		The readjust - ment which war conditions demand is a read - justment in principle , not in single cases .

		Merely to maintain the standards that existed before our entry into the war and this is the ruling pur - pose which the committee on labor has defined for itself requires a deference to a complex sit - uation of which all the factors are constantly changing .

		Changes in wages are accompanied by changes in all the conditions of existence .

		We face a situation in which rising wages go with falling standards of living .

		Now if the war worker is as significant as the soldier , he should receive the same care as the soldier .

		This care might be exercised at least through rigid government inspection of all plants where war work of any sort is done , and by a system of graded fines for failure to maintain definitely fixed minimum standards .

		Failure might be pilloried in the public press with `` piti - less publicity . ''

		The report of Sir
George New	PERSON	- man 's committee failed in its effect , precisely for lack of such publicity .

		The administration of such a measure might well be entrusted to the committee on labor .

		But such inspection and publicity are only be - ginnings .

		Standards of working conditions and standards of living are very different things .

		A return to first principles must take into con - sideration standards of living .

		Men and women will work more efficiently and devotedly if they have the assurance that the future is guarded against the great fears that beset all proletarians the fear of unemployment , of accident , of ill - health , of penniless old age , and of death .

		* In - dustrial insurance in all war work is even more imperative than the proposed military insurance , and should follow the same lines .

		Only so can la - bor acquire anything but a hysterical interest in its share of the conduct of the war as a technique .

		But even this is a bare beginning .

		A real and enduring interest would require labor to become both responsive and responsible in the conduct of the war , and this implies on labor 's part in - itiative far more than obedience .

		Consequently , a constitution , such as Mr.
Webb	PERSON	recommends for British labor after the war , is a desirable instrument to enhance American labor 's produc - tivity during the war .

		Mr.
Justice Brandeis	PERSON	's famous protocol in the garment-industries contro - versy is the American instance of an industrial constitution .

		The traditionless character of American labor-organization gives it a leeway for action that the English organization does not possess .

		Labor itself should , wherever possible , be accountable for shop-conditions , for insurance , for maximum production .

		In those trades par - ticularly where the government supplies the raw materials , or the tools , or both , contracts might be made directly with the labor-unions , and they be left to themselves in carrying out the contracts .

		In the garment trades it is particularly easy to initiate such a movement .

		An advance among the war workers will force an advance in the whole industrial world .

		If , as is declared , strikes are fermented by agents of the enemy , it must also be remembered that both employers and the government give the enemy aid and comfort so long as they tolerate conditions that make strikes necessary .

Enrico Ferri CRIMINAL SOCIOLOGY	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Enrico Ferri	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	. -RRB-

		More than thirty years ago a young professor in the
University of Sienna	ORGANIZATION	brought out a new work on the offender which he called `` Criminal Sociology . ''

		This book still remains the most distinguished general contribution to the subject of criminology , though much of its data and some of its conclusions are now out of date .

		The remarkable fact about this work , which brought it such immediate as well as lasting fame , is that it broke largely with the older anthropological theories of crime and became the textbook of the newer sociological school of crim - inology .

		This older school was known as the positivist or Italian sometimes , from its greatest exponent , the Lombrosan school .

		The positiv - ist thinkers had in their day marked a distinct advance over the views of the classical or free - will theorists , which had persisted and dominated well into the nineteenth century .

		This older school had based its theory and treatment of the criminal upon a theory of the freedom of the will , holding that the offender is individually responsible for his acts and that the point of at - tack in repression or in reformation is upon the will itself rather than upon biological and en - vironmental factors .

		There is , of course , much
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 339 truth in such a view , but when pushed to an extreme , it neglects just those factors , environ - mental and hereditary , which are now most em - phasized .

		Lombroso saw the weakness of the free-will or classical theory of criminal causation as a final explanation and sought to locate the causative factors in the physical and mental make-up of the criminal himself , assuming after the fashion of his time that such characteristics were inherited rather than acquired .

		This ex - plains
Lombroso	PERSON	's dominant emphasis upon his several varieties of the `` born criminal . ''

		Valuable as was this line of investigation , which sought to establish definite and measurable data of criminal causation , it finally became ri - diculous in the hands of its over-zealous sup - porters .

		Purely external characteristics , such as the shape of the head , the color of the skin , and the like , were urged as causes of criminality .

		This theory practically disregarded the factor of environmental causation , just as the older clas - sical school had failed to see both heredity and environment in accounting for crime .


Ferri	PERSON	was only one of many scientific think - ers in the field of criminology and sociology who revolted against this one-sided emphasis , but he was one of the ablest of them all .

		After some years of study of both the environmental and hereditary factors , part of which time was spent as a pupil of
Lombroso	LOCATION	, he brought out his re - markable work in the first edition of
1882	DATE	.

		By doing so he gave form to the synthetic or soci - ological theory of crime .

		He emphasized the neglected factor of environment more strongly even than he did the anthropological or heredi - tary ones .

		He continued to use much of the old terminology , including
Lombroso	PERSON	's phrase the `` born criminal '' and the term `` insane criminal , '' but he read a new content into these forms .

		To
Ferri	PERSON	there is , strictly speaking , no such thing as a born criminal , though there are offenders who owe much of their criminal development to bad heredity as well as to defective environmental conditions .

		The influence of this new viewpoint in criminology , and especially of
Ferri	PERSON	's effective presentation of it , can not easily be overestimated .

		Just as the new outlook of the positivist school stimulated anthropological investigation , this so - ciological school did much to develop a science of environment , both as a starting-point for the study of criminal causation and as a basis for the formulation of a new penology and a revision of penal law .


Ferri	PERSON	's sympathy with the socialist philosophy he was an active socialist and held political office did much to predispose him to a greater appreciation of environmental influ - ences .

		A scientific criminology , and therefore a scientific penology , was not possible until due weight could be given to such factors in crim - inal causation .

		Though the heart of
Ferri	ORGANIZATION	's contribution is in his new and stimulating interpretation of the genesis of the criminal , many other contributions set forth in his book should not be neglected .

		For instance , his theory of penal substitutes , which is an early form of our modern emphasis upon prevention , has had a marked influence upon our constructive attitudes toward the of - fender .

		So simple were his proposals that we should reform our institutions , laws , govern - ments , and economic and social conditions as a substitute for our elaborate machinery of punish - ment , thus preventing the growth of most crim - inality , that it is surprising that such methods were not earlier appreciated and insisted upon .

		In the field of practical programmes he is mainly interested in the reform of criminal procedure , especially as it affects the conduct of the trial and the jury .

		He also devotes brief discussions to the problems of prison administration , penal colonies , deportation , prison architecture , and the like .

		His training was more on the legal and psychological than on the administrative side , a fact which accounts for his dominant interests .

		Ordinarily a mere translation of a book pre - sented to a foreign public some thirty years after its first publication would not call for extended comment , but too much can not be said of
Ferri	ORGANIZATION	's contribution even at this date .

		While most so - ciologists have accepted the new viewpoint and emphasis he has given us , popular thinking and the legal mind lag behind in the umbra of codes which are based upon the philosophy of the classical school of criminology .

		AN APRIL ELEGY .

		By
Arthur Davison Ficke	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Mitchell Kennerley	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Far apart as they are in other respects , these two long poems have one fault in common .

		Both lead the reader to expect narrative , and both , in different ways and degrees , disappoint that ex - pectation .

		In both , the psychology is brilliant and searching .

		Swift pencils of light are flashed 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	again and again upon strange creatures that we dimly knew inhabited somewhere in the human heart and brain but whose faces we have never seen before .

		In `` Merlin , '' however , the story is blurred , impeded , and dull .

		In `` An
April	DATE	Elegy '' it is trivial and hackneyed .

		Potentially , of course , the Arthurian cycle re - mains for the poet of to-day what it has always been , perhaps the richest and most alluring body of legend in the world .

		But Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	has not availed himself of this wealth .

		By the very nature of his endowment , perhaps , he could not .

		Highest and rarest of all is the dramatic genius which draws character out of events and deduces events from character , making us see the two as only the outer and inner aspects of one insepa - rable whole .

		But Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	, though his dramatic powers are by no means negligible , pre - fers to choose one static situation and to revolve his persons about and about its central light , allowing them to catch from it here and there what glints they may of expression and signifi - cance .

		His strength lies in the close delineation of human types , studied usually in attitudes of imminent or actual failure .

		Though his deline - ation is close , he never attempts to make it com - plete .

		Where the shadows fall he lets them lie , and he studies his subject not directly but as one should look at a dim star , with the more sensi - tive outer fringes of the retina .

		So it was that he studied Captain
Craig	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	PERSON	and The Man Against the Sky , investing them first of all with mystery and shadow , out of which there gradually grew some scattered gleams of quintessential interpretation .

		For the rest , Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	writes like a man who is moved to speech only slowly and with dif - ficulty , like one whose imagination constantly smoulders but seldom breaks into bright , clear flame .

		His best poetry is almost never caught out of the flying lyric moment , but is the slow accretion from intense , long brooding over past experience .

		The highly characteristic , highly successful `` Flammonde '' illustrates a method which has become almost a formula .

		Thus Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	makes poetry , so to speak , out of his very reluctances and inhibitions .

		There can be no critical impertinence greater than that which tries to imprison a poet within the circle of his own past performance , and , de - spite our satisfaction in feeling that we have a writer adequately ticketed and shelved away , there are few of Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's readers who would not be glad to see him enter and possess some new field with the same mastery he has shown in the old .

		Nevertheless , one must feel it was a malicious elf that suggested Arthurian romance as a subject for his pen .

		The subject is new to him , but his method and manner are unchanged .

		Subject and method do not harmon - ize .

		Upon a style which has shaped itself in the delineation of modern types of mind complex , eccentric , intensely individualized is laid the task of depicting certain very unmodern charac - ters which throughout a long and
august	DATE	tradi - tion have been treated as simple , conventional , naive .

		The result , in less skilful hands , would have been burlesque .

		Only one character in the poem ,
Sir Lamorak	LOCATION	, reminds us that the
Arthur	PERSON	- ian hero was a man of deeds rather than of words , and he is so hemmed about with voluble carpet knights who hint , guess , infer , surmise , and query in the style of
Henry James	PERSON	, that he himself can do little more than talk of action .

		And where are the jostle and press , the flashing color and sonorous din which five centuries of English poetry , going back to `` Gawayne and the Green Knight , '' have made us feel we have a right to expect ?

		They are sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought .

		Where is that
Merlin	PERSON	who loomed so hoary and hirsute upon one 's childhood , the king-making , empire-building , cloud-compelling Merlin ?

		`` Gone , faded out of the story , the sea-faring friend I remember . ''

		We do not so much object that he should com - mit spiritual suicide , if only he had been allowed to `` do it beautifully . ''

		But this perfumed , pur - ple-frocked , groomed , and barbered
Merlin	PERSON	, with vine-leaves in his hair !

		One feels defrauded of a birthright .

		If , for a moment , we allow ourselves to be - lieve in Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's people , they suddenly appear amused and perplexed at themselves , as when
Vivian	PERSON	complains of
Merlin	PERSON	's beard : `` O , that hair ! ''

		She moaned , as if in sorrow : `` Must it be ?

		Must every prophet and important wizard Be clouded so that nothing but his nose And eyes , and imitations of his ears Are there to make us know him when we see him ? ''

		And again she says , scarcely in the tone of any traditional Vivian : Go on , and tell me all about the King ; I 'll bet the
King	ORGANIZATION	had warts or carbuncles Or something wrong in his divine insides , To make him wish that
Adam	PERSON	had died young .

		This is clearly the amused play of a modern mind upon the mediaeval characters , with the satire in the mouths of those characters them - selves , a recipe for excellent fooling , as Mark
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 341 Twain 's
Connecticut Yankee	ORGANIZATION	showed , but in this instance the artist does not want his people to step from the canvas and criticize the picture .

		The fault is that of inadequate dramatic projec - tion .

		The poet is himself amused and perplexed .

		It is his unmistakably modern and all too idio - syncratic accent that we hear , the voice of the man who , in `` Miniver Cheevey , '' has phrased to a nicety his estimate of sentimental mediae - valism .

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's habitual obscurity has never seemed less justified than it does in the present poem .

		There is no discoverable reason why
Vivian	PERSON	should choose to ensnarl her meaning in the following tangle of words : You are the only one who sees enough To make me see how far away I am From all that I have seen and have not been .

		Here there is no great depth or intricacy of meaning , but merely a failure to make words do their work .

		Neither does this devious verbiage individualize the speaker , for it pervades the en - tire poem .

		In other places the reader is per - plexed by such things as the inordinate length of a sentence , ingeniously tortured sentence struc - ture , or the trick of the transferred epithet .

		When one sees that a poet is struggling with a meaning really beyond the reach of simple lan - guage , he is willing to do his part , especially in these days when clarity has come to connote the elementary , but it is hard to be patient with the mere mannerisms of profundity .

		Eventually we ask the man who assumes a mysterious and cryp - tic air for some commensurate enlightenment .

		In reading this poem , we do not get it .

		The arcana are dark to the end , and we are forced to think of other poems in which Mr.
Robin	PERSON	- son 's inveterate obscurity has had more excuse .

		He resembles his own
Merlin	PERSON	, who has much to say about what he has seen and known with - out giving much notion of what it is , and who seems to rely upon our remembrance that he has been impressive in other scenes .

		Because it is all talk , leading no-whither , be - cause it is nearly void of external action , the poem seems inordinately long .

		It is , in fact , 168 pages of supple , vigorous , often daring , blank verse .

		Here and there the clouds lift to give us brief glimpses of memorable beauty .

		There is one picture of
summer	DATE	woodland and another of
Vivian	PERSON	's park the like of which Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	never found in the pages of his master .

		And , finally , there is one simile almost beautiful enough to redeem every fault that has been mentioned .

		Merlin , foreseeing a dismal end of all for
Arthur	PERSON	and himself , is bidding farewell to Vivian : `` I was wrong that other day , For I have one more story .

		I am old . ''

		He waited like one hungry for the word Not said ; and she found in his eyes a light As patient as a candle in a window That looks upon the sea and is a mark For ships that have gone down .

		The plot of Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's poem reminds one as strongly of
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	as the dialogue in `` Merlin '' does of
Henry James	PERSON	.

		So far as plot is concerned and here it should be said that Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	seems to hold the extreme romantic view that one 's choice of subject is of no conse - quence the poem is as mawkish as the dream of a sentimental schoolgirl .

		A man and a woman , he a budding musician and she a young libertine of sensation somewhat world-weary after many conquests , encounter each other one morning by the sea .

		She invites him , an utter stranger , to enter her `` little light-winged boat , '' and they sail out to sea for some four and twenty hours , with amorous results which are swift , perfervid , and catastrophic .

		Then she disappears in quest of further frivolities , leaving him to a long de - bauch of his habitual melancholy brooding , edged now with passionate recollections , and to his pipe-organ .

		After some months during which he tortures himself with alternate longing and well-founded doubts of the girl 's honesty , he sees her again for the second and last time .

		But the girl , an arrant and unabashed sensationalist , thinking it impossible ever to `` recapture the first fine careless rapture , '' bids him a long and last farewell .

		The whole-hearted sentimentalism of this tale , for which one is tempted to suggest the title `` Two Nights , '' will certainly recommend it to many , though scarcely to those readers whom Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's real powers and previous perform - ance fit him to address .

		Considered as a story , it is `` fine lady '' literature , with just the proper tincture of the pornographic .

		There are other readers who will find in its fever and ague of passion and in its treatment of situations which Puritans , and some others , tend to ignore , in - dubitable signs of what they understand as `` realism . ''

		In fact , the story is wildly unreal .

		But those capable of appreciating the many pas - sages of rare beauty and insight which the poem contains will understand that the story , taken by itself , is simply the old familiar `` fiddling of harmonics upon the strings of sensualism . ''

October 11	DATE	An English View of the President PRESIDENT
WILSON	PERSON	FROM AN ENGLISH POINT OF VIEW .

		By
H. Wilson Harris	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In presenting an English view of President
Wilson	PERSON	, Mr.
Harris	PERSON	has performed a service as valuable for American as for English readers .

		We of the
United States	LOCATION	, observing the inevi - table inaccuracies and deficiencies in the con - sideration of our politics by a careful British student , may have a renewed comprehension of the greater depths of our ignorance of English politics .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	attempts an unadorned biography of
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	and a simple exposition of his presidential policies .

		What may appeal to most Americans as a fundamental error is his assumption that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is primarily an in - itiating leader .

		A leader of exceptional power he undoubtedly is , but one who customarily takes the lead after a project has been formulated and organized and advanced to the dignity of either majority or strong minority support .

		This ap - pears to be his self-chosen role .

		He does not waste his energy or influence in seeking out new roads and persuading the doubting hosts to follow .

		He watches mass opinion closely , and with the certainty of genius waits for and recog - nizes the gradual emergence of mature convic - tions and issues from the confused discussion of unhealthy or undeveloped policies wherein demo - cracy thinks out loud .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	observes , for example , that the President changed his deprecation of prepared - ness in
1914	DATE	to a fervent advocacy before
1916	DATE	, but lays the change largely to the education of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	by the events of
1915	DATE	, giving the im - pression that the President then transmitted his enlightenment to the people .

		More accurately he might have written that the events of
1915	DATE	, interpreted by the propagandists of preparedness , had enlightened the American people .

		A mass opinion demanding increased armament was formed , not with Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's aid , but consid - erably despite his very powerful resistance .

		The President , a high type of pacifist , reluctantly ac - cepted the changed public opinion as his mentor .

		He took the lead with obvious hesitation , ex - hibited notably in his controversy with Secretary of War Garrison , but public opinion massed it - self in increasing strength behind even this doubt - ing leadership and when the break with
Germany	LOCATION	came the President was able to swing it against a stumbling , irresolute
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, driving through his vast programme with enheartening ease .

		Mexico furnishes perhaps a more vivid ex - ample of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's quality on the negative side .

		The American people formulated no policy with regard to
Mexico	LOCATION	and the President in con - sequence , like the people , adopted `` watchful waiting . ''

		The President had splendid ideals of Pan-Americanism , but ideals are not policies and it is a certain touchstone for Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's ad - ministration to note that his ideals are translated into policies only after the democracy , whose great servant he aspires to be and is , has formu - lated an opinion which can be relied upon to support an executive programme .


Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	the statesman combines a patient firmness in action , and an intellectual self-sufficiency in counsel , with an amazing and seemingly inconsistent responsiveness to public opinion .

		To interpret the public will seems to be his chosen ideal for a leader of democracy .

		To write successfully the life of such a man re - quires an intimate knowledge of the politics and politicians of his time .

		This knowledge Mr.
Harris	PERSON	admittedly lacks .

		His minimizing of the profound influence of Progressivism , and the
Progressive Party	ORGANIZATION	upon the President is peculiarly irritating to anyone well acquainted with the
last decade	DATE	of American politics .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	refers to Senator La Follette , who bitterly op - posed the
Progressive Party	ORGANIZATION	and supported Wil - son , as `` one of the founders of the Progressive Party . ''

		He describes the Progressive plat - form , which sounded an absolutely new note in American politics and attacked vigorously both the old parties , as `` a curious amalgam of the Republican and Democratic . ''

		An inclination to be harsh with Mr.
Harris	PERSON	should be restrained because of the clear sin - cerity and good intention of his work .

		He writes of recent American politics without a comprehension of the powerful influence of Col - onel
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and of the magnitude and depth of the struggle between him and Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	.

		The two men are utterly different in character and method , and the conflict between them is inevitable and elemental .

		The life of neither can be written without a fair knowledge of the other .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	labors under the handicap of having only superficial information concern ing both .

		His book will have the largest value for Americans in his interpretation of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's international polity .

		Here , with a better com -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 343 prehension of the issues and factors involved , he interprets more skilfully .

		Here , also , he is de - lineating a
Wilson	PERSON	who is less the speaker of , and more the speaker for , democracy .

		The American people comprehend so little of inter - national relations that they are accustomed to accept without controversy the presidential de - terminations of their will toward other peoples , The abrupt reversal of a policy of national isola - tion aroused little opposition , because to the masses `` isolation , '' ``

		The Balkan question will mean nothing to us as a people until it begins to cost us blood and money .

		Upon international questions Mr.

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's exposi - tion of

DONALD R. RICHBERG	PERSON	.

		The Belgian Carthage THE NEW
CARTHAGE	LOCATION	.

		By
Georges Eekhoud	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		After reading this work by the Belgian nov - elist ,
Eekhoud	LOCATION	, one wonders whether it would have been translated if it had been written by anyone but a Belgian .

		One wonders further why this should have been the specimen of
Eekhoud	ORGANIZATION	's work chosen for translation .

		There is a certain irony in the contrast between the `` profound homage '' with which the translator dedicates his work to the Belgian King , and this very unsavory picture of modern
Antwerp	LOCATION	, told by a passionate radical .

		If only good should be spoken of the martyred , some readers will not care to learn of the hatred of the people for the conscript army , of the miserable , exploited industrial serfs of
Belgium	LOCATION	, of the greedy and soulless upper - class society of
Antwerp	LOCATION	.

		But to the translator , Mr.
Lloyd R. Morris	PERSON	, any Belgian book is evi - dently a good book , and he sends this one forth duly expurgated of those franknesses in which `` Anglo-Saxon and Gallic taste are at variance . ''

		Even this neatest excuse for prudery , however , leaves in the book many of those `` sensual aspects of life '' which Mr.
Morris	PERSON	in his preface tells us are of the
Fleming	ORGANIZATION	's genius .

		One could wish that a novel written about the great port on the
Scheldt	LOCATION	, so cruel , opulent , de - generate , with its grasping bourgeoisie and its swarming youthful workers , had made that life more vivid before our eyes .

		Eekhoud writes un - doubtedly with strong anti-capitalist feeling , with hope for the day when
Antwerp	LOCATION	will `` be restored again to her true children . ''

		He has a great theme , and he knows his city through all its turbulent layers .

		But he does not fuse the life really into artistic form .

		One thinks of `` Ger - minal , '' and one misses the power and deep ref - erence and social orientation of Zola .

		One thinks of `` Pillars of Society '' and one misses the cold , cutting subtlety of Ibsen in his exposure of that greed of the capitalist which sweeps away all human consideration .

		And one thinks of `` Pelle '' and misses the palpitating mass-life with its hunger , and its pathetic struggle against its masters and the elements .

		Eekhoud , in using these themes , suffers immeasurably by contrast with these greater books .

		His individuals are too unrelieved in their villainous materialism .

		They become stagy and thin .

		The city is uncon - vincingly fantastic in the Carthaginian flavor at - tributed to it .

		The separate scenes are not worked out , and the plot has little firmness of fibre .

		The city is seen through the eyes of the sensitive young Laurent , who leaves the unsym - pathetic relatives with whom he is brought up and follows a roving life , first with a group of radical artists and writers and then with poor workmen and the `` runners '' of the wharves .

		The thread of story is carried along through his love for the beautiful and wealthy
Gina	PERSON	, his cousin , who marries a vile speculator ,
Bejard	LOCATION	, trafficker in emigrants and war supplies , and grinder of child workers .

		The story passes to a melodramatic end in the sinking of the rotten ship which
Bejard	ORGANIZATION	has loaded with deluded emi - grants among whom were Laurent 's friends for
Brazil	LOCATION	, and the destruction of Laurent and his enemy in the explosion of the latter 's cart - ridge plant .

		Yet this ending has not half the tragic power of that even more melodramatic denouement of `` Germinal , '' after we have followed for so long the pathos of individual lives set in the inexorable horror of modern industry .

		Eekhoud 's novel is more the brave attempt of a writer who is a soci - ological prophet rather than an artist .

		Like a true socialist , he feels classes rather than indi - vidual lives .

		The best things are always the racy pictures of peasants , conscripts , dockers , 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	young criminals , and prostitutes .

		Here is the col - orful type that he feels , the pulsing movement of the crowd .

		Read as a series of picturesque sketches of the life of the old port , the book is keenly interesting .

		Yet somehow in these groups , vividly and distinctly as they are felt , the sense of both the city as a whole and of the breathing significance of individual lives caught in the clash of groups , is strangely missing .

		The groups somehow delightfully live , but not the city which they compose nor the people who compose them .

BOURNE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whims UNICORNS .

		By
James Huneker	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner ' t Sons ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	has developed of late an un - restrained fondness for apocalyptic beasts .

		His totem in the present volume is the Unicorn , but he has not wholly abandoned his Ivory Apes and Peacocks , and when he essays to volplane peril - ously through the
Fourth Dimension of Space	ORGANIZATION	, it is on the back of the Hippogriff , `` with its liberating wings . ''

		The Unicorn , says Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	, enables us to feel `` the nostalgia of the infinite , the sorcery of dolls , the salt of sex , the vertigo of them that skirt the edge of perilous ravines ... '' He is cosmopolite and ideal - ist and easily filled with ecstasy in the presence of the Seven Arts .

		He is , you may infer , a humorous projection of Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's own ego the symbol of his life-long search for the beautiful .

		To anyone curious about the growth of our culture Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's case is worth attention .

		He went abroad to saturate himself in the atmos - phere of art somewhere near the beginning of the eighties .

		It was a great period for the devotee and he was a born devotee .

		The cult of art was never more resplendent or developed on a scale more grandiose and imposing .

		There was a touch of the mysticism of religiosity , a sacred ritual , and the austerity of personal sacrifice .

		Art then had its popes and its celibates .

		The incomparable Flaubert died in that period and was straightway canonized .

		`` Madame Bovary '' was the breviary of the novice .


Huysmans	PERSON	was on the point of exhibiting the true source of much of this exaltation by writing `` A Rebours '' and preparing to merge the asceticism of the artist in that of the churchman .

		Whether the writer dealt with life directly or only dreamed about it in the studio , his vocation expressed a passion to separate himself from his fellows , from the vulgar mediocrity of the herd .

		To epater le bourgeois was not simply a pleasure ; it was a duty and a badge of caste .

		The pontiffs of that shining period were as remorseless as the most violent of the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	.

		Not being able to annihilate the bourgeoisie , they found it convenient to pil - lory them and to amaze them by the extrava - gances of art .

		A little later on , with
Mallarme	PERSON	, the crown was to be bestowed for unintclligibility .

		It was a world soaked in the delusion of grandeur .

		The phenomenon of Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's style can - not be explained without reference to those years in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He has lived through a transitional period , and he has come a little way along the new road .

		With what reluctance the reader is left to guess .

		He has , for example , a con - siderable indulgence for the bourgeois .

		He no longer sees him as the black beast with hoofs and long furry ears .

		But he ca n't avoid trying to shock him now and then by the extravagance of his language , any more than he can avoid instructing him in the course of the arts .

		Daisy
Miller	PERSON	was abroad in the period of Mr.
Hune	PERSON	- ker 's novitiate and there is plenty of evidence on which to base the suspicion that he met her and took the measure of her limitations .

		She still represents his compatriots for him an eager but innocent crew , who need a Baedeker in the realm of the arts .

		This sense of our limitations has been a handicap to Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	.

		It has betrayed him into making of his work a curious pastiche a mosaic of facts , dates , gossip , and criticism , with quotation predominating .

		The resulting pattern is bizarre , and it must give foreigners an exaggerated notion of the gaps in our national culture .

		Open his latest book at random and you come upon such passages as this : At old
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	used to say : such books are false , nature is not like that .

		How keenly he saw through the humbug of `` free love '' a romantic tradition of George Sand 's epoch may be noted in his comment that
Emma Bovary	PERSON	found in adultery all the plati - tudes of marriage .

		Ah !

		that much despised , stupid , venerable institution , marriage !

		How it has been flouted since the days of
Rousseau	PERSON	the father of false romanticism and that stupefying legend , the `` equal - ity '' of mankind .

		-LRB- O !

		the beautiful word , `` equality , '' invented for the delectation of rudimentary minds . -RRB-

		Or this bit on George Sand : She had charm .

		She had style , serene , flowing , also tepid and fatuous , the style detested by
Charles Baudelaire	PERSON	, and admired by
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	and
Kenan	PERSON	and Lamennais .

		Baudelaire remarked of this `` best sel - ler '' that she wrote her chefs d'oeuvres as if they were
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 345 letters , and posted them .

		The `` style coulant , '' praised by bourgeois critics , he abhorred , as it lacked accent , relief , individuality .

		`` She is the Prudhomme of im - mortality , '' he said not a bad definition and `` she is stupid , heavy , and a chatterer . ''

		She loves the proletarian , and her sentiment is adapted to the intel - ligent wife of the concierge and the sentimental har - lot .

		Which shows that even such a versatile critic as Baudelaire had his prejudices .

		It is all in the same manner , obligingly in - formative and genially casual .

		It has the com - pactness of pemmican .

		It is guaranteed by the authority of great names , and shows an agile intellect dovetailing epigrams .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	has never escaped from the blight of cleverness that characterized the nineties .

		He has the air of a bon-vivant who dines nightly with the Muses and has to store up dinner-table witticisms to keep them from yawning like the weary business man .

		To be sure , he borrows more than he invents , but even that is a strain on the memory unless he keeps a card catalogue or a secretary .

		One trembles to think of what would happen if the memory were to go blank or the card cata - logue to go up in smoke .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's pages would look like dispatches that had gone through the hands of the censor .

		If we turn from the manner to the under - lying philosophy , we see that Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	sweeps here , too , with a wide net that takes in metaphysics , science , sociology , and political philosophy .

		`` Science only attains the knowledge of the correspondence and relativity of things no mean intellectual feat , by the way but not of the things themselves ... '' `` Man must no longer be egocentric .

		The collective soul is born .

		The psychology of the mob , according to Professor Le Bon , is different from the psychol - ogy of the individual ... Mob psychology is always false psychology .

		The crowd obliter - ates the ego . ''

		`` His birth , breeding , and tem - perament made Mallock a foe to socialism , to the promiscuous in politics , religion , society , there - fore an apostle of culture , not missing its precious side ; witness Mr.
Rose	PERSON	in The New Republic , and one who abhorred the crass and the irre - verent in the New Learning . ''

		`` Withal , the didactic side of our fiction is overdone .

		I set it down to the humbug about the ` masses ' being opposed to the ` classes . '

		Truly a false antithesis ... As if a poor man suddenly enriched did n't prove , as a rule , the hardest taskmaster to his own class .

		Consider the new-rich .

		What a study they afford to the students of manners . ''

		and so on , and so on .

		To compensate for a suspicion of staleness in these high realms , Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	shows his hospi - tality by embracing `` Creative Involution '' and turning joyous somersaults in the
Fourth Dimen	LOCATION	- sion of Space .

		But that , I am sure , is only his way of escaping from the tyranny of the actual , and we may fairly lay the blame on the Unicorn and the Hippogriff and suspect that he has his tongue in his cheek .

		Even a ghostly and dimin - ished passion to epater le bourgeois is likely to tempt a man to keep a strange menagerie about the premises , especially a man who loves a joke as well as Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	.

		His great merit is that he has banished solemnity and cant ; he talks about books because he loves them , and there is n't an ounce of pedantry in his whole nature .

		A Tar able of Toleration THE COMING .

		By
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Fiction can express almost any idea of which the human mind is capable , certainly all ideas relating to human character , intercourse , social relations , and government .

		A novel can not in - clude a treatise on vector analysis , but if a novel - ist wishes to do such a strange thing and knows how to manage narrative , he can make one of his characters a professor of mathematics and through the professor 's talk indicate that vector analysis is , or is not , of value to humanity .

		We do not expect to find in a love story a discourse on free trade or any other formal division of economics ; yet a novelist can make his young man and the girl 's father political opponents and so bring out any idea about free trade that he wishes to impress on the reader .

		It all depends on how skilfully the novelist manages the talk of his characters , how deeply he interests us in the persons who hold this opinion or that .

		English and American novelists have dealt with all manner of political , social , and religious ideas .

		Dickens ,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Charles Reade	PERSON	,
Trollope	LOCATION	,
Meredith	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	,
Howells	PERSON	, not to mention Wells ,
Galsworthy	PERSON	, and the many other young , alert students of life , have found the novel a palatable vehicle for ideas that in straight doses are hard to digest .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	, where ideas if put in the expository form most suitable to them used to be suppressed , the novel - ists wrapped a pill that would have been bitter to the government , in the sugar of romance .


Aylmer Maude	PERSON	quotes in his `` Life of Tolstoy '' a letter from
Drouzhinin	PERSON	, a Russian critic : An Englishman or an American may laugh at the 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	fact that in
Russia	LOCATION	not merely men of thirty , but gray - haired owners of two thousand serfs sweat over stories of a hundred pages , which appear in the magazines , are devoured by everybody , and arouse discussion in society for a whole day .

		However much artistic quality may have to do with this result , you can not explain it merely by art .

		What in other lands is a matter of idle talk and careless dilettantism , with us is quite another affair .

		Among us things have taken such shape that a story the most frivo - lous and insignificant form of literature becomes one of two things : either it is rubbish , or else it is the voice of a leader sounding through the empire .

		In
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	official restriction of thought has not yet become so strangling as it was in
Russia	LOCATION	before the revolution .

		But in both the so-called Anglo-Saxon democracies there are disheartening signs of a disposition on the part of officialdom and of `` public opinion '' to throttle the ideas of the liberal minority ; such signs are the treatment accorded by the British govern - ment to the temperate and high-minded pro- tests of
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	and others , and , in this country , the utter disregard , by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and others in authority , of the constitutional guaran - tee of freedom of speech and press and of the right of peaceful assemblage .

		If Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	had set forth in direct exposition or argument the essential ideas of `` The Coming , '' he might even now be confined , like his mystical hero , in a state institution for lunatics , or more likely in a penal institution , along with
Morel	PERSON	and the rest .

		Probably it was not so much a considera - tion of this danger as the artist 's knowledge that the parable , a form at least as old as the
Bible	LOCATION	, can be artistically as well as ethically effective , which led him to cast his ideas in the mould of fiction .

		The least favorable thing that can be said about `` The Coming '' is that the personages in whom the ideas are embodied are not sufficiently specific and individual .

		The clergyman is a con - ventional clergyman , he is generalized , provin - cial `` vicarism , '' as compared with
Trollope	PERSON	's clergymen who , as
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	himself said , with his sure instinct for character , are men first , who happen , as a secondary matter , to be priests .

		Dr.
Jollife	PERSON	is a conventional Irishman .

		Murdwell , the American inventor , is not only the American as the Englishman conceives the type , clothes , manner , breeziness , and all , but also the literary man 's conventionalized idea of the inventive , scientific genius .

		The mystical , Messianic hero does not quite emerge visibly and audibly a creature of flesh and blood ; but vagueness and unreality are , to be sure , in character with this strange superhuman being .

		And the parabolic nature of the story perhaps justifies the general - ization of all the characters , who are meant to stand for types of ideas .

		The miraculous cure and the mysterious Well - sian discovery of the inventor are unnecessary - burdens on probability ; they threaten to drive it outside the frame of reality .

		In this respect the story is inferior to
Artzibashef	ORGANIZATION	's `` Death of
Ivan Lande	PERSON	. ''

		In that story the forces which the idealist encounters and before which he finally succumbs are the plain everyday facts of life .

		This is what would happen to the saint , and what , in the greatest case in history , did happen .

		Yet though the individual perishes , the ideas survive , for there is the
Bible	LOCATION	, and there is your novelist , the modern parabolist , who in the very act of recording the death or defeat of a character preserves the ideas for which he died ; they `` arouse discussion in society for a whole day , '' perhaps for many a day .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	makes his idealist triumphant by the too easy device of endowing him with dramatic genius which takes the world by storm and revolution - izes the theatre .

		I will believe that when Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	writes the wonderful play that wins the Nobel peace prize and finds an idealist under the waistcoat of an American theatrical manager .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	's saint converts his enemy and makes a real Christian of him .

		That is barely possible , but it is asking a good deal of human nature , of that kind of human nature which he ascribes to the vicar .

		He would have served ideas as well if he had worked them out as the Russian did in ``
Ivan Lande	PERSON	, '' and not made them so immediately and practically victorious .

		For the essential ideas are good , and at pres - ent it is real service to have presented them in an attractive way .

		Those ideas are so simple , so humane , the commonplaces of two thousand years , that it is bewildering to think that they seem insane to an insane world and wicked to a wicked world .


John Smith	PERSON	has the audacity to quote some of the charitable and pacific sen - timents of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Therefore he is blasphe - mous .

		He is a poet , and speaks in parables , riddles , mystic metaphors .

		Therefore he is in - sane .

		He has a vision , which he regards as a reality ; Goethe appears to him and says , `` I have come to pray for
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		`` Certainly , ''
John Smith	PERSON	, `` I am very glad to pray for Ger - many . ''

		Therefore he is a traitor , to be prose - cuted , if he be intellectually responsible , under the
Defense	ORGANIZATION	of the Realm regulations .

		The offi - cial attitude toward German literature -LRB- Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	reserves this ironic thrust for the end of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 347 the book -RRB- is that of the representative of the
Royal Academy of Literature	ORGANIZATION	who said at a pub - lic meeting that `` he had done with Goethe for - ever . ''

		The vicar stands for ecclesiastic and civil authority .

		He is all for duty , justice , and kind - ness .

		He and the English have Christ and the right on their side ; the Germans are the incarna - tion of wrong ,
Antichrist	LOCATION	.

		Minister of a religion which deals in parables , visions , poetic indirec - tions , sublime impracticalities , he has not imagina - tion enough to have caught the spirit of the idiom which he employs every
Sunday	DATE	.

		All that sort of thing happened in the world long ago , once for all ; that anything like it should be embodied in a modern man is inconceivable , worse than that , sacrilegious .

		There seem to be many Christians like the vicar on both sides of the con - flict ; you are at liberty to share Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	's optimistic confidence that they can be brought to see the light .

		The inventor ,
Murdwell	ORGANIZATION	, represents the sui - cide of science by its own prowess .

		The devil - ish ingenuity of invention has been turned to the destruction of the world .

		A horrible agent of death which
Murdwell	ORGANIZATION	has discovered fortunately dies with him .

		This expresses the literary ideal - ist 's despair of scientific achievement , the old contest between knowledge and spirit .

		The character is not convincing , but the problem it suggests is interesting , whether the conquest of natural forces by human intelligence will result in the annihilation of the race or will be directed to constructive ends .

		The best character is the squire who has come home from the war paralyzed .

		He hates war , hated it before he went into it , but did his part faithfully and accepts his invalidity without com - plaint .

		He does not hate people , even Germans , and he is baffled and distressed by the animosi - ties of civilians who are more bitter than the men in the trenches .

		Though it is unlikely that soldiers on either side are wasting much affection on their enemies , yet there is evidence that the actual business of fighting does not engender a permanent spirit of revenge ; that American officer who counselled his men that they must learn to be `` dirty fighters '' has not yet been in the trenches .

		There are abundant records of fraternization between
Union and Confederate	ORGANIZATION	soldiers during the Civil War , cer - tainly soon after the war .

		It may be that we shall have to wait for the soldiers to come home to chasten the odiums of militant civilians .

		JOHN MACY .

		BRIEFS IN GOOD COMPANY .

		By
Coulson Kerna	PERSON	- han .

		Lane ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		A poet who had just published a volume of verses was asked whether
Theodore Watts-Dun	PERSON	- ton was likely to review the book in the ``
Athen	LOCATION	- aeum . ''

		`` God forbid ! ''

		was the poet 's reply , as recorded by Mr.
Kernahan	PERSON	.

		`` He would simply make my unfortunate book the peg upon which to hang a wonderful literary robe of spun silk and fine gold .

		He would begin omitting all mention of me or my book with some general - isation , some great first principle , whether of life , literature , science or art , no one , other than himself or the God who made him , could ever be sure beforehand ... Then he would launch out into an essay , incomparable in knowledge and in scholarship , that would deal with everything in heaven or earth other than my unhappy little book ... I should deem myself fortunate if , at the end of the review , I found my name as much as mentioned ... if there were as much as one line in the whole four-page essay about my book . ''

		Mr.
Kernahan	PERSON	's recollections offer many a tempting `` peg . ''

		The paragraph just quoted , supplemented by
Watts-Dunton	ORGANIZATION	's own similar , though soberer , version of his method of review - ing , is a challenge to a discussion of the func - tion of the critic .

		The statement , made rather mournfully , that
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's `` magnum opus must be looked for , not in literature but in friend - ship , '' and that his best books stand upon our shelves with the names of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	and
Algernon Charles Swinburne	PERSON	on their covers , invites a tribute to those uncelebrated artists whose genius - finds expression in the ephemeral art of being .

		The somewhat naive speculation as to whether Oscar Wilde 's sins may not be traced , literally , to demoniacal possession demands a jeremiad on the unconquerable propensity of hu - man beings to overestimate the importance of the irrelevant .

		Most of all , the epigram of some famous unknown , with which the foreword be - gins '' ` Recollections ' are generally written by people who have either entirely lost their mem - ories or who have never , themselves , done any - thing worth remembering '' is an opening for a discussion of the place of the literary gossip in literature .

		All of which is by way of saying that Mr.
Kernahan	PERSON	's book , like all good company , is stim - ulating and provocative .

		It is too often dull ; it is marred by mysterious hints at things the author might tell an he would , and by a very wearisome and embarrassing an almost servile self-depre - ciation .

		And yet the glimpses that it affords of such ever-interesting figures as
Swinburne	LOCATION	, Watts-Dunton ,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, and the mountain - 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	eer and scientist ,
Edward Whymper	PERSON	, who are the subjects of the best of the sketches , are amaz - ingly lifelike .

		THE LATIN AT WAR .

		By
Will Irwin	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		The habit of rilling up column space will always be a menace to newspaper writers .

		The present book should be cut down to half its size .

		The author is a good observer , he has had excel - lent opportunities to see the French and Italian armies , and he paints some graphic scenes ; but his pages are cluttered up with long descriptions of things that do not count .

		If the reader will skip everything up to the author 's arrival at the Italian front , he will be saved much weari - ness and will be inclined to read on .

		This is the best part of the book .

		The author describes in a stirring manner his visit to the Alpine heights , through trenches in the snow and dug - outs in the solid rock , among batteries on moun - tain peaks where one would hardly believe guns could go .

		The Italian officer as we find him here is a most attractive figure , courteous , digni - fied , cheerful , and ever solicitous for the safety of his guest .

		These scenes will be new to most readers of war books .

		The later chapters are given up to the French again , largely around
Verdun	LOCATION	and in
Lorraine	LOCATION	.

		THE HEART OF THE BALKANS .

Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		There are two kinds of travel books .

		In one the author devotes himself to matter-of-fact in - formation regarding routes , hotels , what to see , and so on .

		In the other kind , the writer treats all that he sees subjectively and , consciously or unconsciously , creates literature .

		`` The Heart of the
Balkans	LOCATION	'' is in the latter class .

		It would make a poor guidebook indeed , but it is some - thing better .


Demetra Vaka	PERSON	and her brother travel through
Albania	LOCATION	,
Montenegro	LOCATION	,
Servia	LOCATION	, and
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, which means a trip on mules or ponies over roads that are hardly more than paths , and among a people barely civilized , where the best and cleanest hospitality is offered by the village priests .

		The men consider fighting the chief business of man .


Demetra Vaka	PERSON	's concern , however , is primarily with the women : what they are like mentally and physically , and what their economic status is .

		She puts the various nationalities before us with great insight and lit - erary power .

		She herself is a Greek , born in
Constantinople	LOCATION	, so she is well fitted to speak of these peoples .

		A CHARACTER SKETCH OF GENERAL THE HON.
J. C. SMUTS	PERSON	.

		By
N. Levi	PERSON	.

		Long - mans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		General
Smuts	PERSON	is only forty-seven years old , despite the long record of varied achievement to his credit , and so the time has not yet come to write his biography , in the full sense of the word .

		But a very good beginning to such a work is furnished in this `` character sketch '' written by a South African journalist friend of
Jan Smuts	PERSON	, whose admiration for his hero sums itself up in the closing assertion that `` we are too close to our mountain to appreciate its altitude . ''

		The versatility of the man is attested in the brief aummary : `` In law he shone most brilliantly during the years that came after the Boer War , when he had still a private practice .

		As a poli - tician he may be said to have done his best work hitherto as a Minister of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, but we do not know what lies ahead .

		Few will doubt that he would have been an eminent divine , a great chemist , a famous surgeon , a Gargantuan tiller of the soil , had he not entered public life .

		His adaptability as a warrior is exemplified by what is happening at this very moment . ''

		Never - theless one may safely doubt whether he would have been preacher , chemist , surgeon , and far - mer , all in one , had not public life claimed him .

		The author speaks of some who `` delight in paint - ing him as an overintelligent Frankenstein , stalk - ing through the human throng with scarcely a human feeling in him . ''

		But it was not

		THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CITIZENSHIP .

		By
Arland D. Weeks	ORGANIZATION	.

		McClurg ; 50 cts .

		Words of special emphasis should be reserved to commend this small but unusually able and attractive book .

		Professor Weeks has succeeded in carrying a message of vital significance , in phrasing it in an effective style , and above all in selecting for emphasis the focal points of interest to the understanding of the mind of the citizen .

		This is popular psychology directed with skill to problems of daily concern .

		The emphasis upon the mind of the citizen means that social purpose can be accomplished only in so far as the task is accepted and understood by the intelligence of the average citizen .

		The limitation of reasoning must thus be admitted in addition to the need - less limitations that affect social progress .

		Social inertia makes the most difficult and expensive variety of modern education , that of educating
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 349 aldermen and legislators and others concerned with communal interests .

		The psychology of citizenship is profoundly affected by the use of machinery , for this acts directly upon the human mind .

		The enormous significance of the mode of labor and its conflicts , the effects of modern publicity in shaping opinion , the peculiar char - acter and disabilities of the legal mind , the domi - nations of the sense of propriety , the difficulties of establishing other varieties of human value , all these form a part of the psychology of citi - zenship , and are set forth with extraordinary skill in this manual .

		A CONCORDANCE TO THE POEMS OF ED - MUND SPENSER .

		By
Charles Grosvenor Osgood	PERSON	.

		The Carnegie Institution of Wash - ington ;
$ 20	MONEY	.

		The publication of a concordance to a great poet is an important event in literary criticism .

		Such a work provides an extended and instruc - tive commentary on the diction and subject-mat - ter of the poet ; facilitates research and a better understanding of all poets and poetry ; tests criti - cal judgments and opinions ; enhances the value of other concordances in the search for literary relationships both agreements and differences ; and by thorough analysis prepares the way for original creation .

		The number of concordances has in recent years rapidly increased as their value has become apparent ; yet Spenser has been missing from the list , a fact the more noticeable because of his rank in an age preeminent in Eng - lish literature , and because of the vast influence which he has exerted on later poets .

		As a cor - rective of much shallow , general , and misleading Spenserian criticism ; as an aid in discovering the full significance of the poet 's intricate allegory ; and finally , as a means of arriving at his real values `` that his cultural and spiritual power may be enlarged among readers , '' a concordance to Spenser easily justifies its existence .

		Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's task involved a vast amount of mechanical labor and many perplex - ing problems .

		The absence of an authentic basic text necessitated much textual criticism in adapt - ing and collating three others .

		Spenser 's incon - sistent use of hyphened compounds , his lawless orthography , and his use of archaic forms and dialect suggest some of the difficulties faced by the editor in his efforts to make a most service - able work , and overcome by him with rare pa - tience and scholarship .

		With their accustomed efficiency and thoroughness the
Carnegie Institu	ORGANIZATION	- tion of
Washington	LOCATION	have , as publishers , left nothing undone that would add to the attractive - ness and dignity of the volume .

		To both editor and publishers all students and lovers of poetry owe a lasting debt of gratitude .

		OUR PART IN THE GREAT WAR .

		By
Arthur Gleason	PERSON	.

		Stokes ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		The outstanding feature of this book is its col - lection of extracts from the war diaries of cap - tured German soldiers .

		Mr.
Gleason	PERSON	is said to be the only person not a government official of
France	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	who has been allowed free access to this unique library of unprinted war literature ; and the fact of his having had this free access is proved by facsimile pages presented with translations in sufficient number to carry conviction .

		Significant indeed are these attes - tations of deliberate atrocity from the perpetra - tors themselves .

		Reluctance , abhorrence even , are often evident ; but disobedience to the high command is apparently unthinkable .

		`` That is what we were ordered to do , '' writes one sol - dier at the end of his shameful record , and other similar entries are not wanted in other diaries .

		`` The people of
Germany	LOCATION	have bowed their will to the implacable machine .

		They have lost their soul in its grinding , '' says Mr.
Gleason	PERSON	.

		`` Our part '' in the war , so far as the book describes it , is necessarily nothing further than the volun - tary part of the thirty thousand who did not wait for national action , for these chapters were written before the present energetic preparations for ending the war had fairly begun .

		But even so there was enough to tell for the purposes of an animated and engrossing narrative .

		The author has seen service as an ambulance man , and is now special correspondent in the war zone .

		A SEASONAL INDUSTRY .

		By
Mary Van Kleeck	PERSON	.

		Russell Sage Foundation ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The trade of making women 's hats is interest - ing not alone because 134,000 people in this country are employed in it , more than one-tenth of whom work in
New York City	LOCATION	alone .

		It is one of the most markedly seasonal of our indus - tries , is highly subject to sweating , is dependent upon the whims and fluctuations of fashion as few trades are , while organization of labor within its limits meets with few permanent successes and wages are relatively low .

		All these facts nat - urally lead to disturbed domestic conditions , low standards of living , and many other problems of social adjustment which are pressing .

		Miss Van
Kleeck	PERSON	's handling of these problems is character - istic of her usual insight and thoroughness as the most experienced investigator of the condi - tions of women 's work in this country .

		She brings a point of view and a directness of attack to her field of study which make her conclusions convincing .

		Especially is this true of her de - mand for some sort of effective public regulation of the trade in the interest of the welfare of the workers .

		350 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 11	DATE	ALASKA : THE GREAT COUNTRY .

		By
Ella Higginson	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		One can not read of
Alaska	LOCATION	without sharing the thrill of the Arctic traveller , and his feeling of the great , cold , wind-swept places , the high , snow-capped peaks , and the pounding surf .

		Mrs.
Higginson	PERSON	's descriptions and her photographs of fir-tipped points , of swirling rapids , Eskimos in their parkas , and dog teams harnessed for their run across the frozen spaces , all make one long poignantly for bracing northern air and life among hardy , simple people .

		She has travelled from
Dixon Entrance	ORGANIZATION	north along the coast out to the far
Aleutian Islands	ORGANIZATION	and up to
Nome	LOCATION	.

		She has gone inland over the famous White Pass from
Skagway	LOCATION	to
Lake Bennett	LOCATION	and
White Horse	ORGANIZATION	.

		To-day
Skagway	LOCATION	, like
Dawson	PERSON	, is a peaceful , dull , respectable little town .

		But in the nineties
Lake Bennett	PERSON	was a scene of wonder .

		As Cyanide Bill described it to the author , `` Tents !

		Did you say tents ?

		Hunh !

		They was so thick it took a man an hour to find his own . ''

		Settlers other than gold-seekers are commonly repelled from
Alaska	LOCATION	by the poor reputation of its climate .

		But
Alaska	LOCATION	in reality offers fruitful opportunity to the farmer , its prevailing damp - ness making for an almost unequalled luxuriance of vegetation .

		Nothing , in fact , is niggardly in
Alaska	LOCATION	, neither the prices nor the generosity and cordiality of the people .

		Moreover , with its background of Russian ownership and Rus - sian luxury , with the history of the early ad - venturers around its difficult shores , with the achievements of the missionaries , and the min - gling of native races ,
Alaska	LOCATION	offers a rich field for the historian and the anthropologist .

		THE BIBLE 'S PROSE EPIC OF EVE AND HER SONS : the `` J '' Stories of Genesis .

		By
Eric S. Robertson	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	apparently had several ends in view when writing this work , and he has at - tained them with varying degrees of success .

		In the first place , as the title indicates , he wished to study the `` J '' document of Genesis -LRB- those parts where God is spoken of as Jahveh -RRB- as an epic .

		He frequently speaks of it as a `` morality play '' and of its author as a `` dramatist . ''

		Admitting willingly that the events recorded are mythologi - cal , not historical , he tries to show what the author meant to teach by these myths .

		Such is certainly the way in which the document ought to be studied , but the author has not always suc - ceeded , nor is he always consistent with the gen - eral principles laid down at the beginning .

		Thus , in his chapters on
Abraham	LOCATION	, he discusses at length recent theories about Ur of the Chaldees and the laws of
Hammurabi	LOCATION	; it is as though a mod - ern commentator on `` Hiawatha '' should try to show the poet 's meaning by quoting the latest discoveries of anthropologists , for it is certain that the author of `` J '' knew no more of Ham - murabi than
Longfellow	PERSON	knew of the `` Report of the
American Bureau of Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	for
1917	DATE	. ''

		In the chapter on Eve , on the other hand , the original sin of our first parents is interpreted in a way which certainly never occurred to the `` dramatist '' or anybody else previous to Philo the Jew .

		Secondly , the author has attempted to sketch the early history of the Hebrews .

		He has assembled a number of odds and ends , espe - cially from
Robertson Smith	PERSON	and Sayce , which are not widely known , and which are most in - teresting .

		This part of the book is not carefully done , however , and there is no attempt to make a systematic study of the early Hebrews .

		On reading the book , one gets the impression that all this paraphernalia of scholarship is merely a pass - port to recommend the book to modern readers , while the author 's real interest lies in moralizing and exegesis of the time-honored variety which allows one to deduce anything under the sun from no matter what text .

		Examples of this are found on every page .

		But when the author starts talking on his own account , he really does say many original and interesting things .

		Thus , in one chapter , he discusses the question of mar - riage apropos of Eve in a most unprejudiced manner and makes many excellent remarks on the subject .

		In another chapter he discusses temperance in the same spirit .

		Elsewhere , he lays the blame for the origin of war on private prop - erty .

		The results of his exegesis are excellent , but his method , though he dignifies it with the title of `` reconstructive criticism , '' is that of the old-fashioned preacher .

		Why did he not simply write a book on `` Wine , Women , and War , '' and leave the `` J '' document to the archaeologists and folklorists to whom it belongs ?

		CONDITIONS OF LABOR IN AMERICAN IN - DUSTRIES .

		By
W. Jett Lauck	PERSON	and
Edgar Sydenstricker	PERSON	.


Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		In recent years elaborate investigations by the federal government , the various states , and pri - vate agencies have disclosed an enormous amount of information relative to labor and its prob - lems .

		Usually , however , the separate reports are practically inaccessible to the majority of people , and therefore some summary of these studies has a place in sociological literature .

		The purpose of this book is to meet this particular need .

		The au - thors used nearly thirty different investigations and reports in the study of wages , which closes with the disquieting conclusion that before the war began two-thirds at least of all male wage-earners eighteen years of age and over earned less than
$ 600	MONEY	annually .

		The budget of the laboring man 's family has been the subject of a number
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 351 of important investigations .

		The tables presented deal chiefly with the sources of income and dis - tribution of expenditures .

		Among the significant conclusions are the following : the wages of many men must be supplemented by those of their wives and children ; the income of the girl living at home is often a main factor in the family budget ; the high cost of living is forcing laborers to expend an increasing proportion of their in - come on food , since the subsistence wage has risen about
$ 200	MONEY	since
1900	DATE	.

		The authors as - sert that the increased cost of living has largely nullified the advantage of higher wages .

		The book does not attempt to pass upon the validity of the information presented in the various re - ports used but generally accepts the statistics as trustworthy .

		ENGLISH DOMESTIC RELATIONS ,
1487	DATE	-
1653	DATE	.

		By
Chilton Latham Powell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Co -
lumbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The subject of matrimonial relations appears to possess a perennial interest and certain recent studies have added much to our knowledge of the long history of the human family and to the appreciation and understanding of its many per - plexing problems .

		The most recent scholar to venture into this field is Dr.
Chilton Latham Powell	PERSON	, of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, who be - gins his investigation with the publication of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's `` Booke of Good Manners '' in
1487	DATE	and closes his work with
Cromwell	PERSON	's divorce legisla - tion in
1653	DATE	.

		The title-page of Dr.
Powell	PERSON	's book promises `` a study of matrimony and fam - ily life in theory and practice as revealed by the literature , law , and history of the period '' ; but the performance is scarcely equal to the promise .

		The second half of the volume deals with the literature of the subject and , though the author discusses a number of important but little-known writings , this part of the work is scarcely more than a critical bibliography .

		The important part of the study comprises the first three chapters , in which the author discusses the history and law of marriage in
England	LOCATION	, the development of opinion as to the nature of the family institution , attempts at divorce legislation , and kindred sub - jects .

		The field was harvested a dozen years ago with some thoroughness by Professor How - ard in his monumental `` History of Matrimonial Institutions '' ; but Dr.
Powell	PERSON	has discovered sev - eral unused literary sources and has been able to correct Professor
Howard	PERSON	's conclusions on vari - ous important points .

		The author 's most notable contribution is his discussion of the attitude of the different Puritan sects and factions toward the nuptial union : some were inclined to hold that marriage is most properly solemnized in the presence of the Christian congregation ; but the Independents took the extreme position that mar - riage is a civil contract and nothing more .

		Of peculiar interest is Dr.
Powell	PERSON	's conclusion as to
Milton	LOCATION	's well-known attitude toward the ques - tion of marriage and divorce : he shows conclu - sively that this did not originate in the poet 's own domestic unhappiness but was a matter of conviction and was in complete agreement with the Independent thought of the period .

		THE RUSSIAN PROBLEM .

		By
Paul Vino	PERSON	- gradoff .

		Dutton ; 75 cts .

		`` History is not a science enabling us to pre - dict coming events with exactness , but it does make a significant difference whether we con - sider facts of social life as detached experiences or as links in a chain of development .

		In the first instance we shall hardly have anything to guide us but the impressions and appetites of the mo - ment .

		In the second , we are able to obtain a wide perspective and a basis for rational plans . ''

		So , Professor
Vinogradoff	PERSON	on the second page of his study of the psychology of the Russian people and their future after the war .

		And he goes on : `` I may add that whatever may have been the shortcomings and the blunders of the Russian government , it is a blessing in this decisive crisis that Russians should have a firmly-knit organi - sation and a traditional centre of authority in the power of the Tsar .

		The present Emperor stands as the national leader , not in the his - trionic attitude of a War Lord , but in the quiet dignity of his office .

		He has said and done the right thing , and his subjects will follow him to a man . ''

		Is it necessary to add that this book was written before the Revolution ?

		The facts have written their own ironic comment on the mar - gins of almost every page .

		By

		In this day even a formal budgetary study of living-costs may be of interest .

		Miss

New York	LOCATION
A. I. G. P.	PERSON	, studied the living con - ditions and family expenditures of seventy-five widows and their three to five children for one year , in order that she might be able to advise the poor with reference to wiser expenditures and planning of meals .

		Good results were seen in the improvement of health in these families as a result of the better balancing of diet and the diminished use of tea and coffee a serious drain upon the purses of the poor without adequate returns in energy , especially in the children .

$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		is intended for the amateur who is starting a collection , and as such it is a satisfactory handbook .

		The author gives a brief survey of the history and production of prints , mentioning only the better-known artists .

		In the cases of
Hokusai	ORGANIZATION	and Hiroshige the various series , states , and editions are enumerated .

		The book contains much useful information , and ought to arouse those who are interested in collecting to a realization of the fact that the art of color printing in
Japan	LOCATION	is to-day a lost art and that it is their privilege as collectors to preserve the products of that art and to carry forward its best traditions to the future .

		Those wishing to have the President 's recent messages in convenient form will find that
Stanton	PERSON	and
Van Vliet	PERSON	's volume , `` President
Wilson	PERSON	's Great Speeches , '' is excellently suited to their need .

		Not only are the messages to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	since the declaration of war included , but also a number of the President 's speeches on other occasions which are most significant in showing his attitude toward the principles involved in the world crisis .

		A valu - able feature of the book is the collection of import - ant notes passing between this country and foreign powers , as well as the speeches on the occasions of the visits of the several foreign commissions in this country .

		While the new work is briefer than the others , giving about 340 pages to English writers and 200 to American , it is not a mere condensation ; it covers the ground afresh .

		It has the same general qualities as its predecessors , including excellent illustrations .

		It is presumably intended for use in high schools .


Newell L. Sims	PERSON	is professor of sociology and political science in the
University of Florida	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book , `` Ultimate Democracy and Its Making '' -LRB- McClurg ;

New York City	LOCATION	.

		It is well written , modestly and smoothly , yet it covers much , from

		Professor
Sims	PERSON	is well read in the mod - erns , notably
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	,
Croly	PERSON	, and

		He has hopes but recognizes all the old weaknesses of democracy , opposed as it is by `` a compact body with great unanimity of purpose and action Ignorance , Indifference , Unsocialized Individual - ism , Love of Inequality , Militarism , Aristocracy , Autocracy , and all the rest of them . ''

		Few will read
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	,

Veblen	PERSON	all through , and here is a way to supply the deficiency .

		Pro- fessor
Sims	PERSON	quotes excellently .

		The association of the physician with the clergy - man no longer brings a sense of surprise , since the initiation of the

Moffat	PERSON	, Yard ;

		The double intention of the work appears in the reconciliation of interest in
Christ	LOCATION	's service as a healer with modern mental therapeutics .

		Both the book and the movement which Dr.
Batten	PERSON	repre - sents arc free from extreme positions , and express a commonsense appreciation of the kinds of ail - ments aided by mental methods .

		While not ex - tending the knowledge of the subject very far , the work is acceptable as a modest contribution .

		`` If one has anything to say , one might as well put it into a chair , '' said Mr.

		Ken - tucky 's feuds are , in any large sense , over .

		Some other traditional characteristics of the country are not but that is another story .

		The clan feuds are important to-day chiefly as a picturesque memory , an echo from the past , that it is interesting to recall when you happen to shake hands with a
Callahan	PERSON	or talk with a
Howard	ORGANIZATION	, a
Turner	ORGANIZATION	, or a Tolliver .

		Their history illuminates the character of the present-day `` citizen '' ; it does not afford justifiable grounds for a polemic against his an - cestors who made their own law and abode by it .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 353 NOTES ON NEW FICTION Any story-writer who has the luck to be recom - mended by
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	will get attention , but he will have to stand a more searching scru - tiny than if he had offered himself unannounced .

		A certain standard is expected of him , and merely good work will hardly do .

		On the jacket of
Richard Curie	PERSON	's `` The Echo of Voices '' -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	commends the publisher for his enterprise : `` I think your taking him up is a good move .

		He has brains ; he has a writer 's temperament .

		There 's a lot in him . ''

		So there is .

		The temperament in particular is interesting and the eyes through which Mr.
Curie	PERSON	views our world are fresh and penetrating .

		There is per - haps more than a suggestion of Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's own method , and more than a trace of the influ - ence of the great Russians , especially Dostoevsky .

		But what then ?

		These are are no bad models for a young writer with a temperament , and Mr.
Curie	PERSON	has had the strength to put his individual stamp on all but one of these tales .

		Mr.
Curie	PERSON	is fond of rogues , the smooth , round , over-elegant , masterful men on the fringe of things who manipulate other people 's money , and he is fond of interesting failures , men with or without brains who , through some flaw in the stuff of which they are made , are doomed to go down .

		He is interested also in the lives of quite drab people , and knows how to write their shabby little tragedies in just the right key .

		It is interesting to see how much , for once , can be made of that motiveless malice which inspires quite half the unkindness in the world .

		Malice fascinates Mr.
Curie	PERSON	, and it gets to fascinate us , too , as we read ; it is not intruded but it is always there in the most casual relations , the sand on the axle of smooth intercourse .

		And it has abso - lutely no meaning , none whatever ; it does no one any good .

		Mr.
Curie	PERSON	has already the skill of the master in getting under way , snaring the in - terest ; he can sketch a character in a sentence or a phrase , and his control over natural human speech serves him almost everywhere .

		The traces of his novitiate are not , however , com - pletely obliterated as yet : he does not always sustain the interest to the end , and in some of the stories there is that progressive decline which indicates that the writer is losing confidence in himself and in his power to hold the reader .

		Neither can Mr.
Curie	PERSON	always quite rise at the climax to the high level of excellence which the tale as a whole maintains , and since he is a seri - ous workman , relying not at all upon tricks but holding you only by the veracity of what he has to show , the disappointment is proportion - ately keen .

		`` The Echo of Voices '' is an achieve - ment which will make those who read it wait eagerly for the next book by Mr.
Curie	PERSON	.

		Is it because of our idealization of worldly success that American novels are so richly en - dowed with money and motors and the spin - ning wheels of invisible , but highly profitable , commerce ?

		To indicate that `` Cousin Julia , '' by
Grace Hodgson Flandrau	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , is inconsiderable would be most unfair , and yet its lack of depth and subtlety , traceable , possibly , to American social experience , is re - deemed only by vivid coloring and skilful arrangement of detail .

		The characters are thin but unmistakably American , their chances for development too often avoided in favor of clever bits of local color .

		Yet the book is more than readable ; its charming pictures of the middle West and its sardonic understanding of the Cinderella background of les nouveaux help to point a shrewd moral .

		For suppose that the manager of all our destinies , the American mother , marries her favorite daughter to a French marquis , should the other daughter refuse to marry a millionaire who could finance them all ?

		Out of the heat of
Africa	LOCATION	, from camel-tracked Sidi-bel-Abbes , comes a story of the Foreign Legion of
France	LOCATION	that for sheer adventure and hardy romance could hardly be excelled .

		Scorched by the sun , the Legion scrubs its clothes in the paved reservoir , eats its monotonous din - ner in cell-like barracks , and spends its half - penny a day riotously in the cafes of Sidi-bel -

		Out of all civilizations and from all countries come the members of the Legion , and their diversity of character and purpose is astounding .

		Whether or not you notice an overdrawing of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can 's dialect , a self-consciousness in occasional epi - grammatic turns of phrase , or an excess of high lights , your admiration is held throughout .

		Six years ago Mrs.

		It is a chronicle of hate for Prussianism , well thought out and presented .

		An English girl , carried off her feet by the passion of a young German officer , marries him and the rest of his family in a moment of romance .

		Before the end of the wedding-trip his insolence and arro - gance have awakened her to his tyranny .

		This is a `` society '' story .

		Everyone is fabulously rich , or appears to be .

		Only one of the characters is supposed to have red blood , and he is trapped into matrimony by the heroine , who in order to avoid the scandal consequent upon an innocent indiscretion coolly announces that she has secretly married him .

		Those having a taste for the sort of stories usually told over the cigars , after the women have left the room , will enjoy this bit of journalese .

		Something of the same situation provides
Alice Duer Miller	PERSON	with mate - rial for `` Ladies Must Live '' -LRB- Century ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		But
Miss Miller	PERSON	is less highly seasoned with scandal and writes with frank humor of social pirates and their tricks .

		She seems to have drawn her characters from life rather than society jour - nals and exhibits genuine wit in their handling .


Louise Maunsell Field	PERSON	's new novel , `` The Little Gods Laugh '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , is about the people of whom one reads in the `` society '' columns .

		There is some clever charac - terization , but that is not a sufficient excuse for the addition of one more novel to the already overlong list of American mediocrities .

		The story of a salt-air castle or two down on
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, where you can buy oilskins and fish - hooks and kerosene and calico after supper if you want to , is the gist of
James A. Cooper	PERSON	's `` Cap'n Abe , Storekeeper '' -LRB-
Sully & Kleinteich	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The fog is real fog , and the breakers are really the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and it was really a case of love at first sight .

		If your last trip to the
Cape	LOCATION	has lost any of that delicious odor of clams and sea - weed that clung even to your shoelaces , you can get a new whiff of it here , with a great deal of pleasure .

		\ M VI .

		COMMTN I MRS.
KATHARINE FULLERTON GBROULD	ORGANIZATION	comes down very hard on the younger British novelists in the current `` Yale Review . ''

		The , write precisely alike ; it is n't possible to tell Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	from Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	or Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	from
Compton Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	.

		They take in one another 's washing , so to speak , and wear one an - other 's clothes .

		They all bear organized society a grudge ; they are bent on changing things with - out stopping to have definite ideas about what changes are likely to work .

		They are obsessed with sex and yet they create if you can call it creation odious women .

		Their heroines are huzzies or morons often enough they are both .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	himself is no better in that respect .

		Look at
Hilda Lessways	PERSON	!

		``
Hilda	PERSON	is never a nice girl ; she is a monster from the start and to the finish . ''

		As for Mr.
Wells	PERSON	he has bene - fitted by the steadying force of an interest in so - cial problems , and `` his reward for having been perpetually occupied with them is to have won through to ` The Research Magnificent ' and ` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	. ' '

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	gives you , so to speak , your cue and prepares you nicely for this judg - ment at the end `` it will take more than Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	to make Russians credible to me .

		He seems to me no more plausible than Dostoievsky , and far , far short of Turgenev . ''

		This is the kind of faint praise that will rejoice Mr.
Wal	PERSON	- pole and Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	.

		To fail with Dos - toevsky , and , inferentially , in the same manner , is the shining goal to which half the young Eng - lishmen now writing strain their eyes .

		BEFORE us ON THE TABLE lies the second edi - tion of the pamphlet of the
Committee on Labor of the Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defence	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was organized on
April 2	DATE	, with a membership of one hundred and fifty , and it has grown , at the present writing , to the plethoric number of five hundred , circa .

		Its pro- gramme is not pretentious , and the pamphlet speaks of sub-committees `` whose plans are fur - thest advanced , '' particularly those in relation to wages and hours and mediation and conciliation .

		The programme pledges the committee to the maintenance of industrial standards existing be - fore our country entered the war , changes to be permitted only when national safety , in the judg - ment of the
Council of Defence	ORGANIZATION	, demands them .

		The chairman of the committee is the well-known Mr.
Samuel Gompers	PERSON	.

		Now the interesting thing about the committee is this : since its for - mation , strikes have multiplied in important war industries .

		In some parts of the
West	LOCATION	there has existed a state of industrial warfare .

		And on the whole and everywhere labor conditions prom -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 355 ise to become worse rather than better .

		Yet the committee has not assembled since its organiza - tion .

		None of its sub-committees , not even those whose work is `` advanced , '' has had anything to offer by way of protest or programme .

		Whatever work has been done , has been done by depart - mental mediators , by special departmental com - mittees , or by the spoken word of President
Wil	PERSON	- son .

		It is , however , true that Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	has made many speeches in many places .

		Contem - plation of the committee 's pamphlet and of its record brings to mind the historic question of Lord Dundreary , when he was one day over - whelmed with a sense of the futility of earthly things : `` Why , '' he sighed , `` ah , why is a hen ? ''

		THE BLESSED WORD `` MESOPOTAMIA '' is the recorded ancestor of a line of such blessings , whose most recent and favored progeny is the blessed word `` Creative . ''

		Since
M. Bergson	PERSON	joined it to Evolution , it has had a distinguished , if rather confusing , series of mates .

		The prag - matists have set it before Intelligence , and dancers and other vaudevillains have joined it with their own pet substantives .

		In various in - stantaneous and futurist magazines Mr.
Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	descants on all sorts of crea - tive newness , and in the town of
Baraboo	LOCATION	,
Achille Lesceaux	PERSON	, tonsorial artist , announces Creative Haircutting .

		M. Lesceaux justifies his announcement with the philosophy of
Benedetto Croce	PERSON	and
Joel Elias Spingarn	PERSON	.

		The latter has written a book , `` Creative Criticism , '' in which , particularly ,
M. Lesceaux	PERSON	declares , he has found his vindication and exposition .

		For if , as the book so truly and eloquently declares , all art is expression , and nothing but expression , and if the difference between good art and bad art is the mere difference between successful and unsuc - cessful expression , there can , first of all , be no reason for the snobbish and mid - Victorian exclu - sion of the tonsorialist from the fellowship of the imagists , cubists , and creative critics .

		Haircut - ting ,
M. Lesceaux	PERSON	insists , is also expression .

		Fur - thermore , according to the creative critic , the ex - pression is indifferent to its material ; its success or failure must be measured by the intention of the Expressor ; and the less obstruction a material offers this intention , the more perfect the ex - pression .

		God , who meets no obstruction what - soever , creating , indeed , as in a vacuum , is most perfectly self-expressive , and the conditions un - der which the tonsorialist works , at least in
Baraboo	LOCATION	,
M. Lesceaux	PERSON	submits , are , of all that obstruct the artist , nearest to God 's own .

		M. Lesceaux is , however , reluctant to press too hard his claim to admission to the fellowship of crea - tive artists .

		He is restrained by the irrefutable demonstration of the creative critic that the artist expresses only himself , that as an artist he is self-sufficient , independent , whole , an Individ - ual !

		His public is as indifferent as his material .

		His expression is a soliloquy , not a communica - tion .

		With certain theatrical managers , he may declare , Prometheus-like , `` The public be damned ! ''

		But a tonsorialist , even a master of Creative Haircutting , may not altogether do this .

		One thing more troubles
M. Lesceaux	PERSON	.

		He ob - serves that the Individuals whose Art is Self - Expression seek lucre and praise and reputation for their soliloquies , and that `` Creative Criti - cism '' is among books on sale .

		THE MODERNS put their best foot forward in the `` Modern Library '' series now being issued at a modest price by Messrs.
Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	.

		The moderns are not alone , of course , for
Schopenhauer	PERSON	comes in and so does
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, but both have worn well and seem to exhale a distinctly modern note .

		Who - ever edited the series has a decided flair , for there is scarcely a title that fails to awaken interest or stir memories not too quiescent .

		In the list at hand , the dead who were chosen appear to have been largely those who still cast their spell most strongly over the young generation
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	,
Strindberg	LOCATION	,
Meredith	PERSON	, and , with diminishing force perhaps , Maupassant .

		Among the living we have
Anatole France	LOCATION	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Wells	ORGANIZATION	,
Chesterton	LOCATION	,
George Moore	PERSON	,
James Stephens	PERSON	, and Lord Dunsany a thoroughly representative list distinguished throughout by a discriminating choice of titles .

		The series is doubly welcome at a time when the pinch of high prices threatens to curtail the book-lover 's pleas - ures .

		THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED in the cause of literature and art in
America	LOCATION	will regret that `` The Seven Arts , '' which made so valiant a start under the direction of a group of vigorous young
New York	LOCATION	writers , has been obliged to suspend publication .

		Its loss is one of the upsets caused by the war .

		When the editors were faced with the alternative of modifying the policy of free discussion they had announced or of losing finan - cial support , they very properly declined to sub - mit to dictation , feeling that without complete independence they could do little to further either critical taste or sound sense .

		By arrange - ment with the editors ,
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	has under - taken to fill the unexpired subscriptions , and since readers of `` The Seven Arts '' will find some of their friends among the regular contribu - tors to THE DIAL , we hope that they will not feel they have been thrown among strangers .

Washington City	LOCATION	,
February 1803	DATE	.

		Sir In compliance with a request of the
House of Repre	ORGANIZATION	- sentatives of the
United States	LOCATION	, as well as with a sense of what is necessary , I take the liberty of urg - ing on you the importance and indispensible necessity of vigorous exertions , on the part of the
State	ORGANIZATION	govern - ments , to carry into effect the militia system adopted by the national legislature , agreeably to the powers reserved to the states respectively , by the constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	; and in a manner the best calcu - lated to ensure such a degree of military discipline , and knowledge of tactics , as will , under the auspices of a benign providence , render the militia a sure and permanent bulwark of national defense .

		None but an armed nation can dispense with a standing army , to keep ours armed and disciplined , is therefore at all times important ; but especially so at a moment when rights the most essential to our welfare have been violated , and an infraction of treaty committed without colour or pretext , and al - though we are willing to believe that this has been the act of a subordinate agent only , yet is it wise to prepare for the possibility that it may have been the leading measure of a system .

		While therefore we are endeavoring and with a considerable degree of con - fidence to obtain by friendly negotiation a peaceable redress of the inquiry , and effectual provision against its repitition , let us array the strength of the nation , and be ready to do with promptitude and effect what - ever a regard to justice and our future security may require .

		In order that I may have a full and correct view of the resources of our country in all its different parts , I must desire you , with as little delay as possi - ble , to have me furnished with a return of the militia , and of the arms and accoutrements of your state , and of the several counties , or other geographi - cal divisions of it .

		Accept assurances of my high consideration and respect .

Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` The book records in - cidents in my own life in the struggle for the waters of
Owens River	LOCATION	which the city of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	stole from us .

		That was a very wicked episode and I did not begin to do justice to the chicanery of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	.

		I am saving some of those things for the sequel to ` The
Ford	ORGANIZATION	' !

		It was I who discovered and made public the attempt of the city to secure the surplus rights of the River in just such fashion as I have described
Anne	PERSON	and
Kenneth Brent	PERSON	doing in the book . ''

		As the recognized authority on Gothic architecture , any book by Mr.
Cram	PERSON	, whose work in connection with the
West Point Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	and the superb
St. Thomas Church	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	has achieved world - wide admiration , commands attention .

		This volume , however , has a very special interest to-day as it dis - cusses in a most illuminating manner the civilization of the Middle Ages and incidentally of our own period .

		It will be read with much interest not only by students of Gothic architecture , but by all who are thinking deeply of the present world crisis and of what is to come after .

		Chinese Poet : Po-Chu-I By the kindness of Mr.
A. D. Waley	PERSON	of the Print Room , British Museum , I have been permitted to see the proofs of his translation of thirty-eight poems by Po - Chu-I -LRB- A. D. 772-846 -RRB- , the great Chinese poet of the T'ang dynasty , as well as the manuscript of a volume of translations of pre-T ` ang poems , whose publication has been delayed by the war .

		Some of my readers may know `` A His - tory of Chinese Literature '' and `` Chinese Poetry in English Verse , '' two volumes by Professor
H. A. Giles	PERSON	, the English scholar who has done so much to spread a knowledge of
China	LOCATION	and the Chinese in our incurious island .

		But valuable as are Professor
Giles	PERSON	's renderings , I think that Mr.
Waley	PERSON	's are superior by reason of their literal exactitude , through which we can apprehend intimately the spirit of the best Chinese poetry .

		Professor
Giles	PERSON	per - haps was inclined to treat his subject a little too much in the mood of an enthu - siastic collector of bric-a-brac , and one suspects he has also deferred to the taste of the Chinese compilers of standard an - thologies .

		Tastes in literature , of course , alter with each generation , and possibly Mr.
Waley	PERSON	's versions of Po-Chu-I 's po - ems will open a fresh , important avenue to our understanding of some neglected Chinese masters .

		A thing noticeable in Mr.
Waley	PERSON	's versions is that they seem to abolish the screen of difference between our English outlook and that of his Chi - nese originals .

		That in itself is a great achievement , and perhaps the secret of Mr.
Waley	PERSON	's success is partly explained by the remark in his foreword , `` I have not used rhyme because ... the restric - tions of rhyme necessarily injure either the vigour of one 's language , or the literal - ness of one 's version . ''

		That all the Chi - nese poems he selects seem extraordinarily human shows that his own taste is guided by a sure instinct which repels preciosity on the one hand and banality on the other .

		His view , if I do not misinterpret it , is that both the early pre-T ` ang poetry and Po - Chu-I have been neglected and pushed out of sight by Chinese scholasticism and formalism .

		Iri his own day Po-Chu-I 's poems had immense popularity in the
Ori	PERSON	- ent , and profoundly affected the later school of Japanese poetry , but shortly after his death that congealing , formaliz - ing influence in Chinese thought which Po - Chu-I combatted by his realistic example , closed in on literature ; and the ideal of successive generations of poets and schol - ars was to repeat , and to imitate , in ste - reotyped form classic motifs and models .

		It seems strange that poetry should , like the Chinese bandaged foot of later days , become cramped and conventionalized by fashion for long ages , but we have an analogy in the bardic literature of both
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	, where fresh treatment and fresh subjects were frowned upon by the professional literary caste for centu - ries .

		According to Mr.
Waley	PERSON	, Po-Chu-I derided the formal themes and treatment of his great predecessors and complained of the lack of freshness and lack of draw - ing from nature in his contemporaries .

		He seems himself to have been one of those strong , innovating forces that ap - pear here and there in letters and art , vig - orous , creative minds , like
Hogarth	PERSON	or Whitman , who go their own way regard - less of current taste or fashion .

		His fe - cundity must have been very great , since he left behind him
4000	DATE	poems , which have , fortunately , all come down to us .

		In his manner of work he was a true im - pressionist , seizing some aspect of life before his eyes and absorbing himself in recording some incident or reflection or feeling of the moment , though he had , according to Mr.
Waley	PERSON	, a didactic side and set great store by those of his poems which were written with a purpose .

		But 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	we get an excellent view of his sponta - neity as a poet , from his own confession : There is no one among men that has not a special failing And my failing consists in writing verses .

		I have broken away from the thousand ties of life , But this infirmity still remains behind .

		Each time that I look at a fine landscape , Each time that I meet a loved friend , I raise my voice and recite a stanza of poetry , And am glad as though a god had crossed my path .

		Unfortunately exigencies of space pre - vent me from quoting here any of the longer specimens which Mr.
Waley	PERSON	has selected of Po-Chu-I 's genius ; but a good example of his breadth of touch and deli - cacy of feeling is `` The Old Harp , '' which , simple and direct in style , has true artistic subtlety .

		THB OLD HARP Of cord and cassia-wood is the harp compounded : Within it lie ancient melodies , Ancient melodies weak and savourless , Not appealing to present men 's taste , Light and colour are faded from the jade stops : Dust has covered the rose-red strings .

		Decay and ruin came to it long ago , But the sound that is left is still cold and clear .

		I do not refuse to play it , if you want me to : But even if I play people will not listen .

		How did it come to be neglected so ?

		Because of the Ch ` iang flute and the Ch ` in flageolet .

		One perceives that the author of these verses was a connoisseur of life as well as of the arts , and a ripe product of gen - erations of spiritual and aesthetic culture .

		It is much to be hoped that Mr.
Waley	PERSON	may execute his project of writing Po - Chu-I 's life ; meanwhile he has so ar - ranged his `` Thirty-Eight Poems '' that we gain delightful glimpses of the poet 's so - cial atmosphere .

		A courtier and high offi - cial , Po-Chu-I writes as an experienced man of the world , but always with delight - ful freshness and vivacity .

		Thus , in a poem to the
Hermit Cheng	ORGANIZATION	, he feelingly chronicles his hardships in attending the Emperor 's levee on a bitter wintry morn - ing , when he had to ride for thirty miles in the teeth of the north wind , his horse slipping on the causeway , his lantern going out , his ears almost blown off , and his beard stiff with icicles !

		When he arrived , frozen and stiff , and had to wait for the imperial summons within the Triple
Hall	PERSON	, how he envied
Cheng	PERSON	, the retired scholar , `` who in warm bed-socks dozes beneath the rugs and need not get up till the sun has mounted the sky . ''

		For his extremely outspoken criticisms of the
Administra	LOCATION	- tion , it appears that Po-Chu-I fell into dis - grace and was exiled to remote provinces , where he bewails the fact that it is impos - sible for a man of his tastes to make any friends with the lusty , ape-like mountain - eers of Pa !

		His uncompromising direct - ness is well illustrated in his `` Satire against Clericalism '' -LRB- circa A. D. 809 -RRB- , a poem which recalls
Browning	PERSON	's `` Bishop Hatto '' : The Imperial Patent on the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	doors is writ - ten in letters of gold ; For nuns ' quarters and monks ' cells ample space is allowed , For green moss and bright moonlight plenty of room provided ; In a hovel opposite is a sick man who has hardly room to lie down !

		I remember once , when at P'ing - yang they were building a great man 's house , How it swallowed up the housing space of thou - sands of ordinary men .

		Like the Chinese in all ages , Po-Chu-I detested the warrior 's life , and his `` Satire on Militarism , '' unfortunately too long to quote , preserves an edge that cuts our Eu - ropean flesh to-day .

		He is more indirect , however , in his poem on the superstitious Emperor Hsien-Tsung -LRB- A. D. 806-20 -RRB- , who was `` devoted to magic , '' while he feelingly commiserates `` the man who dreamed of Fairies '' and who in conse - quence was ordered by the monarch to watch for the fairy host for thirty years in the empty mountains !

		`` Gods and fair - ies , '' comments Po-Chu-I , `` if indeed such things there be , their ways are beyond the striving of mortal men . ''

		This vigorous common sense and his breadth of vision and delicacy of feeling are the qualities that have preserved Po-Chu-I 's poetry , when classics less human have fallen into oblivion .

		A true realist , Po-Chu-I finds his inspiration in everyday life , in little scenes and impressions that other natures less gifted might deem prosaic .

		Thus he interests us by his half-rueful reflections on the fact that the birth of his infant daughter , Golden Bells , who `` is learning to sit and can not yet talk , '' has postponed for fifteen years , his plan `` of retiring and going back to the hills . ''

		But Golden Bells dies when she is three , and the poet tells us , in a later poem , how by thought and
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 383 reason he had driven his grief away , till , one day , meeting by chance her foster nurse in the road , his sorrow returned .

		Another poem records how when in his retirement the officials came by night , knocked at his door , and demanded thirty bushels of grain tribute , he reflected that he himself had occupied four official posts and `` for doing nothing '' had received ten years ' salary !

		I wish that I had space to quote the delightful poem `` After Getting Drunk , Becoming Sober in the
Night	TIME	, '' a perfect model of subtle impressionism , but in place of this I will cite a piece no less charming , `` On Going to the Mountains with a Little Dancing Girl Aged Fifteen '' : Two top-knots not yet plaited into one , Of thirty years just beyond half You who are really a lady of silks and satins Are now become my hill-and-stream companion !

		At the
spring	DATE	fountains together we splash and play !

		On the lovely trees together we climb and sport .

		Her cheeks grow rosy as she quickens her sleeve - dancing ; Her brow grows sad as she slows her song 's tune .

		Do n't go singing the song of the
Willow Branches	ORGANIZATION	, When there 's no one here with a heart for you to break .

		This poem was written when Po-Chu-I was sixty-five , a period of life which he celebrates in another , beginning I have put behind me Love and Greed ; I have done with Profit and Fame ; I am still short of illness and decay and far from decrepit age ; Strength of limb I still possess to seek the rivers and hills ; Still my heart has spirit enough to listen to flutes and strings , At leisure I open new wine and taste several cups , Drunken I recall old poems and sing a whole volume .

		But one must make an end of one 's quo - tations from a poet whose example -LRB- which has lost nothing of its force and freshness in
1100	DATE	years -RRB- leaves one wondering whether many of our contemporary poets are not aiming too high ?

		In comparison with Po-Chu-I 's simple , human , unaffected outlook will not many of the moderns who dazzle us in Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's `` Anthol - ogy of Magazine Verse , '' poets `` subtle in symbolization , '' poets of `` monumental moods , '' poets with `` lofty aspirations for humanity , '' appear to future generations like damaged locks whose keys have been mislaid ?

		Of course as a realist , Po-Chu-I does not compete with poetry less concrete and familiar , of a higher , more idealistic order .

		But may not our impressionists to - day learn from him the lesson that pose , self-consciousness , preciosity isolate the poet and prevent the development of that sense of unity between him and his subject which first-rate poetry , of whatever genre , communicates ?

GARNETT	PERSON	.

		The Structure of Lasting Peace INTRODUCTORY : PRECEDENT AND ADVENTURE IN THE ORGANIZATION OF PEACE Never in the history of human warfare , which is also the history of civilization , have the state and conduct of war met with so much organized opposition , and so ef - fective repudiation in principle .

		Wars have been fought before , and men have before yearned and labored for peace .

		But their hope of its coming and their labor have been grounded on their faith in supernatural intervention ; lasting peace could be God-made alone , and only the divine miracle could end any but a particu - lar war with any but a particular peace : the princes of earth are princes of war ; the heavenly prince is the prince of peace .

		If to-day 's war is unique in the strength of the forces engaged , the engines em - ployed , and the blood and the treasure poured out , it is also unique in the wide - spread feeling that it is a civil war , in the determination that it shall be the last war , in the fact that it has been met from the outset , in all the states engaged , with or - ganized and persistent opposition , which may be repressed or martyred , but which can not be destroyed .

		Call this opposition what you will quixotic , stupid , treacher - ous , foolish , what not -LRB- and at different times and in different places it ^ may merit all these eulogia -RRB- it remains in the bulk a unique record of the spirit in the history of the warfare of man upon earth .

		Pre - cedent for it is lacking ; it delineates a new feature in the aspect of humanity .

		It delineates a new feature because it is secu - lar , definitive , and dynamic , while the pacifism of tradition has been theological , quietistic , and expectant .

		Modern pacifism 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	rests its claim upon the ground from which militarism has immemorially worked the nature and hopes of mankind .

		It justifies its claim by the citation of history and the analysis or social structures .

		Peace foundations like that endowed by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, associations like the League to
Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	, differ however from the vaguer groups with more adventurous social imagination , whose sentimentality is not altogether checked by perception , in that they try to study procedures and seek precedents , and aim to attain no more than they can get .

		They are the realpoliti - ker among pacifists , recruited mainly from the office-holding , diplomatic , and academic classes the precedent-determined , back - ward-looking classes ex-presidents , ex - secretaries of state , ex-ambassadors , professors -LRB- ex , therefore , by vocation -RRB- mostly of international law .

		Their in - fluence is as obstructive to the building of lasting peace as that of the sentimental groups is irrelevant .

		For the end desired has no prototype in the international relations of the past , and the situation which teaches so drastic - ally how desirable is this end , no duplicate .

		It needs to be faced intelligently , on its merits , not habitually via a precedent , nor sentimentally through a rootless aspira - tion .

		What is needed to make a peace that shall endure is not a development of preexisting relationships and conditions ; these make as easily for war .

		What is needed is a revision of the principle on which they rest .

		The corpus of practices and treaties and precedents that goes by the euphemism `` international law '' rests in effect upon principles the exact opposite of those necessary to constitute a real inter - national comity .

		There is not one of them which does not incarnate a precarious equilibrium of opposed and inimical inter - ests , desires , and forces .

		War has been only the upsetting of such unsteady bal - ances , and peace their Sisyphean restora - tion .

		To establish lasting peace there is required , therefore , the apprehension and stressing of a constitutive principle as im - manent in human behavior as that which the international lawyer exploits , but mak - ing for an interlocking of powers instead of a balancing , for an international organi - zation whose existence will not repress but set free , not frustrate but reen force , the in - stinctive spontaneities and normal pur - poses of the so various groups of mankind .

		International law has no precedent for such a means to such an end , nor can it have .

		What international organization existed prior to the war or now exists among the embattled alliances , has no organs to exercise such a function , nor can it have .

		Unities conditioned upon the menace of a common enemy can have only an inimical relation to peace , and the alliances and combinations of powers have derived exclusively from such conditions .

		But there is a more basic reason for the futility of precedent .

		States , natural though they be , none the less consist of many elements of artifice .

		The parts of a state are very like the parts of a machine .

		Their outstanding trait is rigidity .

		Often they perform excellently what they have been ordained to perform , but never any - thing more .

		The maiming or destruction of one part cripples the whole ; no other part is able to take over its functions or to perform its services .

		There is no com - pensation , as there is in the organization of a living body .

		Unprecedented situations consequently tend to throw governments out or gear , to disintegrate them : their old organs can not get adjusted to the new conditions ; the governments either go to pieces , or their bureaus and departments go on doing what they have always done , and the governments are compelled to create new organs adequate to master and control the novel situation .

		As frequently as not the creation of new organs of government is tantamount to a revolution in the structure of the state .

		The Great War offers illustration of all these effects : of disintegration and revolution in the his - tory of government in
Russia	LOCATION	; of industrial and political reconstruction in the history of government in
England	LOCATION	; of the begin - ning of analogous and far-reaching radi - cal changes in the
United States	LOCATION	, or which the visible signs are the creation of the
Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defence	ORGANIZATION	, of the office of food administration , and of the other offices of control .


Germany	LOCATION	, it is true , has under - gone very little change , but precisely be -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 385 cause war has brought very little news to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		If these phenomena mean anything for the right definition of conditions of lasting peace , they mean that those are not condi - tions subject to the judgment of statesmen and diplomats , whose habits of mind and body make them inexorably deferent to precedent , tradition , and vested interests .

		These phenomena mean that the deciding judgment of conditions of lasting peace must be made by an enlightened public opinion , at the conclusion of the openest and freest possible discussion , in deference to the simple aspiration of the collectivi - ties of mankind for freedom and self - expression , and with regard to the actuali - ties that favor peace in the system of relationships into which regard for prece - dent has thrown the hapless rank and file of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		They pay the cost , theirs should be the choice .

		Considerations neither of precedent nor of vested interest , nor of prestige nor of honor can grasp the principle that must underly the constitution of lasting peace , and create the organs of an international polity such that the longer they function the surer peace will be .

		The alliance of democratic common - wealths lays claim to the discovery of this principle .

		With varying stress and much confusion of counsel its members are unanimous in declaring that they are fight - ing this civil war to vindicate it .

		They call it the `` Principle of Nationality . ''

		Although it is now only
September the autumn	DATE	publishing season has set in with great severity ; and one does not know whether the odd , dull noises one hears from time to time are German bombs or only new masterpieces falling heavily from the press .

		Booksellers and circulating libraries are getting ready for action , readers are looking through announcement lists with ex - clamations of pleasure , and reviewers are wondering whether the army can not be persuaded to take them after all .

		The new season promises to be thick with important books .

		Some per - sons profess themselves most impatient to see Lord
Morley	PERSON	's recollections and there is a great pother about them in the press .

		But this is an eagerness which , to be frank , I can not share .

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	wrote admirable books on Vol - taire ,
Rousseau	PERSON	, and
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is possible to read these works with a great deal of pleasure , though the author sometimes shows a painful lack of humor when deprecating the failings of his subjects .

		But when he approaches his own time , he develops a singular caution and rigidity .

		His life of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, though no doubt a faithful , and certainly a monumental , record , is rather a treatise on a public institution than the story of a man .

		It is a striking contrast to the life of Disraeli begun by Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	and now in course of completion by Mr.
Buckle	PERSON	; and though
Gladstone	PERSON	was perhaps not so picturesque as `` Dizzy , '' he was no less alive .

		It seems prob - able to me that Lord
Morley	PERSON	's reminiscences will be equally stilted and inhuman ; and the noise of their approach , therefore , leaves me with - out emotions .

		But there are other books on the point of appearing .

		A new volume of poems by Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	will give us a fresh opportunity of finding out what we really think about the greatest poet who ever used such ridiculous language .

		It is true , however , that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has shown un - mistakable signs of growing defter and defter in the writing of poetry and possibly his new col - lection will indicate what , in a younger man , we should call a promising development .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, also , will publish a volume of verse called `` Per Arnica Silentia Lunae , '' poems in his latest manner , the work , that is to say , of a middle - 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	aged leprechaun .

		His skill has grown ever more impressive as he has grown older , but his poetry has , if anything , increased in eeriness .

		There is something blood-curdling in the triviality of some of his pieces , when one considers the perfection and mysteriousness of their manner ; it is as though a banshee should lean across one 's shoulder and ask , in a conversational tone , for a light .

		You could not have a better contrast to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	than Mr.
Herbert Trench	PERSON	, who is getting into the habit of publishing his collected poems , being about to do it this
autumn	DATE	for the second time .

		He gives one the impression that he takes himself very earnestly in his writing ; there is something solid , dignified , even unwieldy about his verse .

		But it is often good and sometimes very good , if you can acquire the taste for it .

		And then there are
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	's letters but of these no more until they appear .

		It is by no means certain , of course , that all or any of the books I have mentioned will be out this
autumn	DATE	; for with printers in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	, binders in
Somer	PERSON	- set , publishers in
London	LOCATION	, and railways burdened with munitions of war , a great deal may happen between announcement and publication .

		Meanwhile one of the great events of the season has taken place .

		The two unfinished novels by
Henry James	PERSON	are out and have evoked a chorus of perplexed applause .

		No critic dares say that he dislikes them , but it is fairly clear that not all have understood them .

		All , or very nearly all , are agreed that there is nothing of more interest in the two volumes than the notes from which the author worked .

		Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare , the very man to write on
Henry James	PERSON	, is responsible for much the best appreciation of the last appearance of the great novelist .

		The trouble which
James	PERSON	took to make his meaning ultimately accessible , if not immediately apparent , the fine gesture with which he renounced false lucidity for obscure truth , have fascinated him .

		`` What he put into the composition of his novels , '' Mr. de la Mare exclaims , `` the ordinary scribbler must faint even to speculate upon . ''

		And again : `` There is no happier gift in these Notes , none more simple , curious and exhilarating , than the spectacle they convey of a man really and truly enraptured by the thought and by the effort of consummately purposing the thing he can do well . ''

		`` This engrossed self-oblivion , '' Mr. de la Mare proceeds , `` is the child 's , '' But it is not altogether self-oblivion , nor altogether surpris - ing that it should appear childlike .


Henry James	PERSON	simply sought to render as veraciously as possible the thing as it appeared to him .

		His manner reminds one sometimes of the careful , candid tortuousness of a child that is trying to explain its own motives and make them seem credible to an elder .

		He had a fine temperament , which was the essential that made him a good novelist .

		But , as Mr. de la Mare points out , it is his fine enthusiasm for his work which is particularly revealed in these volumes ; and his enthusiasm makes him an inspiring example for his fellow - craftsmen .

		When I come to think about it , there is a certain similarity between
James	PERSON	and Mr. de la Mare .

		Both of them go out to catch a rare sensation in a net of words ; and frequently the words seem to have no bearing on the desired goal until , surprisingly , the sensation is caught .

		They have enlarged the bounds of consciousness , perhaps , by expressing , however largely and vaguely , states of the soul which had previously escaped definition .

		It is , in both cases , patient and devoted cunning that does it .

		A minor sensation has been caused by a novel - ist of a very different sort .

		Mr.
Alec Waugh	PERSON	, son of Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	, publisher and critic , left his public school for the army at the age of seventeen and thereupon wrote a novel on public - school life before passing his eighteenth birthday .

		It is a very remarkable feat ; but I find it diffi - cult to consider it as anything more than that .

		It has received many eulogistic reviews , but I have not detected any note of real enthusiasm in the critics .

		They all seem unable to get past the fact that it is remarkable that a boy of seven - teen should have written a novel ; and it is re - markable .

		But given a boy of intelligence with a wide knowledge of recent literature and there are plenty of them and with sufficient persistence and concentration this is where the number is reduced I should have expected just such a novel .

		It is , in a moderate way , a diatribe against the code and the standard of values that obtain in our public schools ; Mr.
Arnold Lunn	PERSON	uttered that diatribe more convincingly several years ago in `` The Harrovians . ''

		Mr.
Waugh	PERSON	's novel has wit , humor , and faithful observation .

		But it has also passages of juvenile ineptitude .

		There is one in particular in which the hero breaks out of school at night , goes to a fair , and takes a girl
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 387 on the roundabouts .

		The episode is compounded of the worst elements in Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	and Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	, and leaves me with the im - pression that Mr.
Waugh	PERSON	still has his wild oats to sow .

		But , though one may refuse to regard the book as anything more than an unusual feat in the circumstances , it is evident that Mr.
Waugh	PERSON	has a grasp of the methods of novel-writing that may be very useful to him when his character ripens .

		I turn to a book that is good in itself .

		In my last letter , I wrote a paragraph or two about the poems of Mr.
Francis Brett Young	PERSON	, and I men - tioned that all these pieces arose out of his ex - periences in the East African campaign .

		He has now published a prose narrative of these exper - iences , which tells me for the first time that he is a doctor and wrestled mightily in the bush with wounds and fever .

		I need make no apology for returning so soon to this writer , for his `` March - ing on
Tanga	LOCATION	'' is a
Phoenix	LOCATION	of its kind and has provoked in me condemnatory reflections on other war books .

		These , as it appears to me , are good in so far as they are expressive of general emotions occa - sioned by the mere existence of war ; but those books which have described actual experience of warfare have run through all the gamut of jour - nalism from useless to useful , from inept to ac - complished , without achieving anything higher .

		The authors , for whom writing is a vocation and the exact rendering of sensations a true passion , have been strangely silent .

		Our war books seem to have been typed because they were commissioned , not written because experience demanded expres - sion .

		Only Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	has attempted a veracious impression with an admixture of imagination to make reality seem credible ; and his `` Dark Forest '' gives a clearer vision of modern warfare than any other novel I have yet seen .

		But Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	is not , to me at least , a very readable novelist .

		He gave to a description of the Russian front all his talent , untrammelled by the thought of a public eager to be told all about these things and to reward the teller .

		But his talent simply seems to me insufficient , and the `` Dark Forest '' left me disappointed at the end .

		But Mr.
Brett Young	PERSON	in the light of recent knowledge I ought to call him Captain
Brett Young	PERSON	has treated the East African campaign in precisely the same spirit as that in which he would have treated the material for a novel .

		He has used his sensitive observation and his gift of vivid description to make his experiences seem real to us and he has avoided calling our attention on every third page to the fact that they really hap - pened .

		To the man with the eye of a creative artist , a man , that is , who can see the significance of life , a battle in the bush is not really much more startling than a love affair or a quarrel with a friend .

		Mr.
Brett Young	PERSON	has preserved this attitude and has written a narrative which is at once convincing and moving .

		War has not paralyzed or distorted his literary gifts and these , which seemed promising in his two or three novels , appear altogether remarkable in the pres - ent volume .

		Let me quote a passage of de - scription , taken absolutely at random in these pages : For two more hours we marched , and then , with a sense of the most profound relief , we found that we were going downhill once more .

		Another hour and the bush became insensibly thinner .

		At the end of the next a cloudy moon had risen .

		We were passing through a narrow way between grasses as high as a man 's shoulder , and this change from the alien atmos - phere of the bush was subtly reassuring , as though we had really stumbled into some pathway cutting a moonlit cornfield at home .

		We halted many times , resting our bodies on the stubbly ground , and in one of these halts a strange sound came to us , very like the silky note of a cornfield waving in the wind ; but the grasses among which we lay were motionless , and no wind stirred .

		And then it came to me suddenly that the sound should have been more welcome , for it was that of the
Pangani	LOCATION	, half deadened by its forest curtain .

		That is not one of Mr.
Young	PERSON	's high lights ; it is part of the continuous web of his story and it will illustrate , perhaps , the point I wish to make .

		I do not seek to produce the impression that , for the seven-hundredth time , the war has engendered a New Great Writer .

		I merely point to the fact , which is odd , though it should not be , that a writer who was good before the war has gone on being good , and has become , possibly , even a little better , in the very middle of warfare .

		When the war is done , Mr.
Young	PERSON	will , I suppose , resume the writing of novels ; and there are other novelists , though he certainly stands high in the younger generation .

		But , for the moment , he stands alone among those who have written books about the war .

		388 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	The Belgian Renaissance SOME MODERN BELGIAN WRITERS .

		By
G. Turquet	PERSON	-
Milnes	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Robert M. McBride It Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		It was in the year
1880	DATE	that a group of young men , fresh from the universities of
Louvain	LOCATION	and
Ghent	LOCATION	, emulous to carry forward the banners of their prophets , Baudelaire and Maupassant , founded in
Brussels	LOCATION	the review `` La Jeune Bel - giquc . ''

		The influence of Baudelaire was the most potent exercised by any individual upon a mod - ern literature .

		These young Belgians had steeped themselves in the poisonous exhalations of the `` Fleurs du Mai . ''

		They had all experienced the lassitude , the nervous atmos - phere , the subtle and powerful decadent perfume of his genius .

		Reading their work , we become acutely aware of the danger of exploring the dark depths of pathology , abnormalism , and mania without the steadying aid of science .

		It is a welcome coincidence , therefore , that during the fiftieth anniversary of the death of
Baude	LOCATION	- laire , there appears as well-informed a treatise upon this literature as is contained in the present book .

		Its chief virtue lies not so much in the consideration bestowed upon individual talent as in the synthetic treatment of the movement as a whole .

		It is here that we can listen to the beat of the wings of liberty and feel something of the unconquerable strength and resiliency of I ` ame beige .

		We see these troubled souls vacil - lating between gloomy investigation of tenebrous wharves and city slums , and conjuring up quaint and curious tableaux of ancient imagery , using their pens as their ancestors used paint upon panel and canvas .

		In
1883	DATE	the movement took definite form .

		Quinquennially , the state awarded a prize of some thousands of francs for the best book of the half-decade .

		In that year the jury judged no book worthy of the prize .

		Max
Waller	PERSON	organized in the name of `` La Jeune Belgique , '' which felt itself officially insulted , a banquet of protest in honor of
Camille Lemmonier	PERSON	, who had been refused the prize .

		Following this , he pub - lished the `` Parnasse de la Jeune Belgique , '' in the compilation of which eighteen poets col - laborated , and the battle against the conserva - tives was on .


Waller	PERSON	, who founded `` La Jeune Belgique '' in
1880	DATE	and edited it until his pre - mature death in
1889	DATE	, was a young man of vigorous intellect whose style was more facile than his critical faculty was keen .

		He was a gifted ironist and a poet of lyrical fantasy .

		Of the earlier , that is to say , the older , \ \ Tilers of this group , the most distinguished was certainly
Camille Lemmonier	PERSON	.

		The critic 's de - fence of Lemmonier is scarcely necessary to-day .

		No
Bernard Lazare	PERSON	will dismiss his sixty volumes in five vitriolic pages .

		He was a painter who more than any other
Fleming	PERSON	has revealed to us in his books the fleshly lusts of his
Flanders	PERSON	, the gorgeous color of the kermesse , the flaming mouth of the furnace , the humble cottage of the rustic , its eaves adorned by cooing pigeons .

		Every book is an uninterruped chain of pictures .

		Turquet-Milnes is an enthusiast , and enthus - iasm frequently results in loss of perspective .

		But when he upholds Verhaeren against
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, that supreme windbag whose pomposity well-nigh ruined his own genius , I can scarcely repress a bravo !

		The essay on Verhaeren is , on the whole , the finest in the book .

		Displaying his early love of color , his depiction of the brutality of life , his profound symbolism , the author traces in the poetry of Verhaeren the unmistakable influence of Baudelaire , and , tak - ing him through the period when he wrote some of the most beautiful love poems in the French language , leaves him singing of science , society , and the agents of progress .

		More interesting than any other figures in the book are those of
Georges Eekhoud	PERSON	and
Georges Rodenbach	PERSON	.

		Eekhoud 's `` La Nouvelle Carthage , '' recently published in an English ver - sion , seems to me to be the product of a literary Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	.

		There are flashes of lust , there is hoarse and frenetic laughter ; now he is a delicate , timorous youngster , curiously in love with his haughty cousin , and in another chapter we find this child grown into a man who shivers sen - sually at the touch of a hooligan .

		The book is a conscious glorification of vice , brutality , and ignorance .

		`` Les Kermesses '' is a slaughter - house .

		And yet , the man is a poet , akin to Poe and not at all to
Zola	LOCATION	.

		Rodenbach 's master - piece is `` Bruges la Morte . ''

		In this novel he depicts
Bruges	PERSON	, the home of his childhood , as a city of stillness , of mystery ; a city where one hears black silence creeping all round .


Vance Thompson	PERSON	once wrote , apropos of Rodenbach , `` The real Bruges is in the lethargic waters of the canals , '' which is mere rhetoric .

		Turquet -
Milnes	PERSON	is nearer the truth when he writes , `` Close by ... is the market of brass glittering in the sunshine , and such lace !

		and such bargaining about lace ! ''

		Rodenbach 's poetry is morbid and mystic .

		In it , water is always stagnant , lights are dim , birds plane , footsteps
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 389 are noiseless .

		An interesting parallel between these two is that each has falsified a city ; each has portrayed the city in his heart , and where one has called his
Antwerp	LOCATION	, the other 's is named
Bruges	LOCATION	.

		In a variety of ways , the works of Maeter - linck , Van Lerberghe , and Elskamp are inter - related .

		Van Lerberghe conceived the idea of making death `` ever present , albeit invisible , the principle of a new tragedy , '' and his `` Les Flair - eurs , '' the precursor of the Maeterlinckian drama , is undeniably the source of the latter .

		Maeter - linck found in Van Lerberghe the trick of intro - ducing immaterial , puerile sentences to secure an atmosphere of total melancholy .

		The great element that
Maeterlinck	PERSON	brought to the stage is Silence .

		His one discovery was our inquisi - tiveness , the power of the thing unseen .

		With Van Lerberghe he commenced to develop the idea of presentiment , and to heighten his effect , to create the proper frame of mind in his audi - tor , he added symbolism to his box of tricks symbolism which veiled all in mystery and which aided him to acquire another element , suspense .

		Add to these his years of study and meditation of the mystics , of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Swedenborg	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Boehme	PERSON	, Novalis , and
Ruysbroeck	PERSON	, his love of nature , and a high stoic beauty , and you have the man and his formula .

		Elskamp seems to me to have received too much attention from the author , particularly since such a poet as
Eugene Demolder	PERSON	has none whatever .

		The former is a sweet singer who has learned much from the French symbolists and from
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and rewritten with a great deal of beauty many old Flemish folk songs .

		He employs allegory in the fashion of a Fleming , but he suffers somewhat in compari - son -LRB- the author makes it -RRB- with the poet of `` De 1 ` Angelus de 1 ` Aube a 1 ` Angelus du Soir , '' Fran - cis
Jammes	PERSON	.

		Mention of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's `` Douze Chansons '' reminds one that they are now
Quinze Chansons	PERSON	.

		In an essay entitled `` The
Destree Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' the author portrays clearly and logically the Catholicism of
Walloon Belgium	LOCATION	, and against the background of its pious spirit he sketches the aims and work of leading Gallic men of letters .

		For me , the name of
Georges Virres	PERSON	is even more interesting than that of
Jules Destree	PERSON	, the social - ist , or his brother , the Benedictine poet-monk .

		Virres is a novelist who covers the
Campine	ORGANIZATION	, Eek - houd 's `` Wessex , '' with a great deal more sanity , albeit with some sentimentality , than
Eekhoud	PERSON	, and he is the author of some delightful and refreshing novels .

		The concluding essay is on
Leopold Courouble	PERSON	, the accredited humorist of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		`` La Famille Kaekebroeck '' is his masterpiece .

		`` La Maison Espagnole '' is a faith - ful and sincere record of his own childhood .

		Taken all together , this book is one of the most conscientious and sympathetic critical sur - veys I have read on any literature .

		Furthermore , the author writes in a style that is virile and posi - tive , and has a command of his subject that is a joy in these days when every school-teacher sets up shop as critic .

		He sees his men in rela - tion to their environment , to the earth from which they sprang , and having both vision and scholarship , he is able to measure them with an eye that is unusually clear .

		If he lays unprece - dented emphasis upon the influence of Baudelaire in
Brussels	LOCATION	, it is because such influence becomes more patent with every fresh study of Belgian literature .

		Denatured Nietzsche THE WILL TO FREEDOM .

		By
John Neville Figgis	PERSON	.

$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Nietzsche 's thought needs interpreters to res - cue it from the ignominy which has come upon it because of the war .

		Nothing is more diffi - cult to interpret fairly and suggestively .

		It is always a little incongruous to see a great mind expounded by a lesser one , and nowhere is the incongruity more impressive than in the case of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	.

		He is too electric , too poetical , too subtle in his insight , too coruscating in his incon - sistencies , to be tied down and measured out in the common expository way .

		The only way to appreciate him is to read him , not read about him .

		And yet to read him is the last thing that the Nietzsche-fearer usually does , although there are at hand most admirable translations in the charm - ing Foulis edition , translations that are usually remarkable considering that they are out of a language so unconvertible as the German .

		Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	's mind is perhaps no more mediocre than that of the usual writer who would be tempted to interpret
Nietzsche	PERSON	, but it is more irritating in that it is the mind of a professional Christian .

		His book consists of lectures deliv - ered at Lake Forest College , in
Illinois	LOCATION	, and it has the air of an English churchman come across the sea to tell the students about
Nietzsche	PERSON	what was good for them to hear .

		Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	recog - nizes in Nietzsche the most dangerous modern foe of Christianity , but as an intellectual and an 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	amateur political philosopher himself , he treats him with a certain gingerly respect that at once assumes his own competence and slightly patron - izes his subject .

		The result is scarcely happy .

		The discussion is pitched in a key so much lower than
Nietzsche	PERSON	's own writing , and is conducted in such obvious and pedestrian terms that the many quotations blaze across the page with a heat that seems almost to shrivel the unfortunate com - mentator .

		The systematized
Nietzsche	PERSON	whom Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	so carefully expounds and judges is not the
Nietzsche	PERSON	who quickens the blood and makes the mind race with ideas , the
Nietzsche	PERSON	of the `` Joyful Wisdom '' or the `` Dawn of Day , '' but a
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	that has been put into a condi - tion where he can be taken into Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	's mind and , presumably , into the minds of the students of
Lake Forest College	ORGANIZATION	.

		And this con - dition is that of a crude philosopher who has accepted the Darwinian theory , who sees the world as a chaos of warring forces , who rejects all moral valuations , and preaches a gospel for the few .

		To Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is little more than a `` romantic expression of sheer natural - ism . ''

		`` His doctrine is what it professes to be , '' he says , `` a philosophy of force and nothing but force ; it is certain to stimulate that pride from which tyranny comes in its disciples , and it min - isters to the worst prejudices of cultivated men , that other people are of no account . ''

		What Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	has done here is to make the common mistake of confusing a diagnosis with an ethics .

		Nietzsche sees that the raw material of life is will-to-power .

		This is the beginning of his diagnosis of society , morality , culture .

		But his doctrine is that this crude striving may be transcended , sublimated into harmless and crea - tive forms of power .

		Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	omits reference to that most significant passage in which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	speaks of the artist , the philosopher , and the saint as the highest expressions of the will-to - power .

		The common mind seems unable to keep from confounding
Nietzsche	PERSON	's analysis of what is with his ideal of what ought to be .

		The Superman is a blazing goal , not a tribute to a
Borgia	LOCATION	or a
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , the will-to - power is merely an impersonal description of life , not a defence of tyranny .

		So , too , the idea that the mass exists for the benefit of superior per - sons , is not so much an ideal as a sober analysis of the inevitable in a society where all do not strive as
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	would have them toward harmless and creative expressions of power .

		The Eternal Recurrence has not the ethical signifi - cance Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	gives it , but is merely a pes - simistic intuition of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's as to the way the world process runs .

		Even his riddling of Christian morality is diagnostic rather than eth - ical .

		The truth is that
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	shows the world to be a place so much more alarming , exhilara - ting , subtle , dynamic than minds of Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	's calibre can conceive it that when they read the analyses of its subtleties and exhilarations they can only say , `` This is not the world we know ; therefore it is what you ideally want '' !

		Nietzsche must be taken loosely , imaginatively , not as a mathematical problem where his doctrines , his effects , his literary charm , and his danger to tim - orous Christians , must all be discovered .

		He must be taken as wine or mountain air .

		Fact and ideal must play freely back and forth , con - spiring always against the staleness , the mechan - icalness , of modern culture and morals and theories of knowledge .

		Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	is concerned about
Nietzsche	PERSON	's `` denial of rights to the mass of men . ''

		`` The
Putumayo	LOCATION	atrocities are in ac - cord with his teaching . ''

		Away with
Nietzsche	PERSON	, then , because `` an author must be judged by the kind of spirit which will naturally come of fol - lowing on his lines . ''

		This is good fun from a professional Christian who would scarcely like Christianity to be judged from products like St.
Simon Stylites	PERSON	and
Torquemada	PERSON	, who followed all too logically on traditional Christian lines .

		Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	defends Christianity as neither purely altruistic nor hostile to culture nor even ultra-democratic , and chooses as Christian mod - els warriors like General
Gordon	PERSON	whose force would seem to be exactly the incorrigible sur - vival of the primitive religion of valor .

		He forgets that Christianity was strongest in the eras when it appeared as puritanism or monas - ticism .

		Nietzsche 's attack is a fair one , because he goes straight at the ideals of these powerful eras .

		A Christianity that is not ascetic or other - worldly is not a force in the world .

		The pagan , liberating , audacious message of Nietzsche touches the old puritan ideals at the quick .

		Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	admits the charm of Nietzsche so freely `` the literary expression of a soul on fire , '' `` power to write with blood '' that one wonders at his inability to make this the significant em - phasis , as it should be in a judgment of any poet - philosopher .

		But it is to the `` dangers of Nietzsche '' that he is most alive .

		The cult of pride , the seductions of immoralism , the unbri - dled individualism , the regression to the doctrine
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 391 of the natural inequality of man , the recrudes - cence of pagan morality , all these are held up before the frightened reader as scarecrows to warn him off .

		That is why Dr.
Figgis	PERSON	's book is dangerous if it is taken seriously as an adequate discussion of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		It must be credited , however , with what is perhaps the best short sketch of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's life to be found in English .

		The last few years have witnessed a rapid dis - integration of the laissez-faire theory .

		Even be - fore the war a man who asserted the right to conduct his business without respect to public interest was generally regarded as a last remnant of a once dominant species .

		Laissez-faire in in - dustry has gone the way of the divine right of kings .

		But individualism has persisted in rela - tions between nations .

		The suffering and devas - tation of this war have tragically demonstrated that the conduct of the least among nations vi - tally concerns the health of the rudimentary social organization of which it is a member .

		A struggle in which all the resources of one group of nations are pitted against those of another has emphasized the vital necessity of conserving each citizen and each element of wealth .

		Govern - ments have cooperated with one another in so intimate a manner and have assumed so many functions formerly sacred to the individual that to-day the laissez-faire theory is recognized as impossible both within the state and as between states .

		This is particularly realized in
England	LOCATION	.

		There we find the factors which constitute the present strength of
England	LOCATION	pregnant with after - the-war difficulties .

		The unlocking of vast reser - voirs of hitherto untouched productive energy , the entrance of women into all phases of indus - try , the increased home production of food prod - ucts , the loyal support of the colonies all these demand a reshaping of the domestic organiza - tion and an alteration in the political structure of the empire itself .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	must build anew .

		But the future is pliable ; it invites for - mation .

		A realization that a first essential is the formulation of a constructive policy and a clear statement of the problems at issue is the motive prompting the publication of `` After-War Problems . ''

		This book , a compendium of essays by nine - teen contributors , is edited by
William Harbutt Dawson	PERSON	.

		It discusses the problems of empire and citizenship , national efficiency , social reform , and national finance and taxation .

		The articles written by
Viscount Haldane	PERSON	, Sir
Joseph Comp	PERSON	- ton-Rickett , Dr.
W. Garnett	PERSON	, Professor
S. J. Chapman	PERSON	,
G. H. Roberts	PERSON	, and Professor
Alfred Marshall	PERSON	, together with those dealing with social reform , present a clearly defined programme .

		Back of this are two dominant motives : -LRB- 1 -RRB-
England	LOCATION	must regain the markets which neutrals and the
United States	LOCATION	have appropriated or face decline ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the revelation during the war that in the past she utilized a mere fraction of her productive capacity suggests a possible acquisition of foreign markets much in excess of that of the period prior to the war .


Germany	LOCATION	, of course , is a present menace , and Sir Compton-Rickett frankly states that it is suicidal to end the war with
Germany	LOCATION	an efficient industrial and com - mercial rival .

		These writers believe the survival of
England	LOCATION	depends entirely upon the conserva - tion and development to the utmost of every resource at the command of the nation .

		This involves , first , an immediate rehabilitation of the educational system .


Viscount Haldane	PERSON	outlines a national programme of education .

		It will profit Americans as well as Englishmen to read this .

		He believes
Great Britain	LOCATION	must realize at once the value of an industrially trained citi - zenry .

		`` Perhaps , '' he says , `` this world crisis , with the practical and sharp lessons which it is teaching , may awaken us , and convince the country that it is on the quality of its workers , and on nothing short of that , that it must rely if it is to hold its own . ''

		This involves the insti - tution of continuation schools , trade schools , facilities for stimulating and encouraging the ad - vancement of capable pupils in the direction of their talents , the broadening of the secondary schools , and a liberalization of the university curricula with special reference to scientific and technical training .

		The state must provide a universal education which will begin with pre - natal attention to the physical well-being and health of the child and extend well into adult life .

		The educational system should serve as a dragnet for selecting material best fit in every department for the service of
England	LOCATION	.

		Education is merely a first step .

		Sir Comp - ton-Rickett and Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	suggest a policy of governmental activity which is an amplification of work already being performed .

		Localities must continue to acquire natural monopolies such as transportation , gas , water , light , and housing 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	facilities .

		It will surprise American readers to find the primary reason given is that of avoid - ing the lack of efficiency that prevails in non - competitive industry .

		Furthermore , government operation will furnish revenues to lighten the excessive burden of future taxation .

		Similarly the nation must own national monopolies .

		Gov - ernment supervision is to extend over other lines of business as a means of preventing disastrous competition , haphazard methods of price fluctu - ation , and so on .

		The policy of creating committees and bureaus of research and experi - mentation and closely affiliating government de - partments with the laboratories of universities and technical schools is also to be further devel - oped .

		These will conduct experiments and supply information and advice for the benefit of the gov - ernment and business firms .

		Both Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	and Professor
Marshall	PERSON	condemn the institution of a protective system either as a source of reve - nue or as a means of encouragement to infant industry .

		Infant industries , important to the state , should receive direct assistance in their youth .

		This is more useful than a protective tariff ; `` for though the tariff may secure the home market against the competition of foreign goods produced at lower cost , in order that for - eign markets may be open to British goods the actual cost of production must be brought down to foreign cost , and this reduction is not hastened by a protective tariff . ''

		Monopolies of mineral and other resources of the empire are to be granted only to British capital .

		Government as - sistance in the form of advice and supervision will extend to the problem of food-production .

		The war has revealed to
England	LOCATION	her vulner - ability and she means to lessen dependence u.pon imported food .


W. Joynson	PERSON	-
Hicks	PERSON	, a member of the Tory party , insists that land must be divided into small holdings and farmers assisted financially through the institution of land banks after a manner similar to that adopted for Ire - land ; while
Viscount Haldane	PERSON	emphasizes the necessity for agricultural education .

		The labor problem is also discussed in national terms .

		The war has demonstrated the effective - ness of scientific management .

		It has also shown that this need not conflict with the continued improvement of working conditions .

		Labor in - sists that social legislation initiated previous to the war continue in force and be further ex - tended .

		Employment bureaus will multiply .

		Insurance against accident , unemployment , sick - ness , and incapacity has come to stay .

		The guar - antee of the government that fair wages shall be paid in munition factories and in all industries working upon government contracts has `` laid the foundations of a system which , supplemental to the operations of trade-unionism , is capable and easy of development till an ample and regu - lar income is assured every working-class family in the land . ''


G. E. Roberts	PERSON	, who thus speaks for labor , suggests the extension of a plan which evolved out of the dock strike of
1912	DATE	.

		It is to legalize throughout a trade or district an agree - ment entered into between a substantial body of employers and working-people .

		In industries un - organized , as agriculture , direct legislation will be necessary to secure a living wage and an attractive environment .

		The articles dealing with social reform will interest American readers .

		Social reform is sup - plemental to labor legislation .

		Before the war Parliament was embarked upon a constructive programme .

		The war has not dimmed the im - portance of this .

		English social workers confi - dently expect the realization of plans far greater than those of three years ago .

		But how are these plans to be financed ?

		Will the enormous war debt permit it ?

		Professor
Marshall	PERSON	, the eminent English economist , con - tributes an admirable discussion on taxation .

		He believes it is possible to finance these policies by a system of taxation so regulated as not to dis - courage capital .

		Income taxes will supercede property taxes and the movement to decrease both direct and indirect taxes upon the poor will continue .

		His discussion of the relation of im - port duties to the raising of revenue , the development of foreign trade , and the stimula - tion of infant industries and food-production is well worth the study of those Americans who consider a high protective tariff a necessary con - sequence of the war .

		It is also interesting to read his condemnation of preferential tariff ar - rangements designed to benefit
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her allies at the expense of the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the constructive policy presented in the book .

		I might have included Mrs.
Fawcett	PERSON	's excellent article upon `` The Position of Women in Economic Life . ''

		Women have entered every line of industrial work but still are underpaid and little protected .

		Mrs.
Fawcett	PERSON	attributes this to political indifference and trade-union preju - dice .

		She pleads for justice .

		It is unfortunate that the other writers have too little recognized women in their vision of a greater
England	LOCATION	, and the indifference of the book to the question of suffrage after the war is significant .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 393 I have given prominence to the second and third portions of the book .

		The first part is dis - appointing .

		Lord Cromer , who writes upon imperial federation , speaks with the illiberal cau - tion of the colonial administrator .

		He grants , theoretically , the demand of the colonies to participate in the foreign policy of the empire -LRB- barring
Egypt	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	-RRB- , but he would step cautiously in disturbing the existing political structure , and he insists that whatever policy is adopted , the voice of
England	LOCATION	must be dominant .

		Bishop Welldon successfully evades discussing the profound questions one would expect to see treated in a chapter on `` The State and the
Citi	ORGANIZATION	- zen . ''

		In its stead German barbarism receives at his hands a severe drubbing , being painted as the logical outgrowth of the subordination of the individual to the state ; while he criticizes indi - vidualism in
England	LOCATION	upon the ground that through the establishment of free schools and other forms of social legislation the people have become so demoralized that when the war came selfish interests drowned the voice of patriotism !

		One infers from his article that opposition to the party in power in time of war -LRB- something perfectly justifiable and worthy in time of peace -RRB- and any difficulty one may experience in recon - ciling individual conscience with public control are a manifestation of selfish interests in
England	LOCATION	and of commendable individualism in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		One would expect such a book to discuss the re - lation of the British Empire to a future inter - national organization , but it carefully refrains .

		A special article , however , seems necessary on `` The Cultivation of Patriotism . ''

		The alien question is handled purely with reference to the admission of foreigners to English citizenship .

		Nothing is said regarding the serious problem of the movements of British subjects within the empire ; as , for example , that of the Hindu to
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Consequently , while the book presents a con - structive national policy for
England	LOCATION	, it seems addressed to Englishmen not vitally interested in securing a vision of the needs of the British Empire as a whole , or really concerned with in - ternational welfare .

		The spirit is , a world safe for
England	LOCATION	.

		But one raises the question , if each nation at the conclusion of war deliberately embarks upon a policy of national efficiency prompted solely by the desire to acquire foreign markets and to attain self-sufficiency at home , what will become of the fruits of the war to end wars , and will such a world be safe for anybody ?

JACINTO BENAVENTE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated by
John Garrett Underbill	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Had Mr.
Garrett Underbill	PERSON	presented us with only two of the four plays that are in this volume with `` The Bonds of Interest '' and `` La Malquerida '' we should have been in - clined to accept his high estimate of the dra - matic power of
Jacinto Benavente	ORGANIZATION	.

		He includes with these , however , two plays that are decidedly poor in idea and technique `` His Widow 's Husband '' and `` The Evil Doers of Good . ''

		These two belong to an inferior dramatic talent .

		Moreover , they have the effect of bringing the translator down to his least efficient level .

		`` His Widow 's Husband '' and `` The Evil Doers of Good '' are satirical comedies .

		They must have had lightness and brightness in their dialogue .

		Imagine , then , a passage like this on the first page of the play which happens to be first in the volume , `` His Widow 's Husband '' : Everybody accepts and respects your decisions .

		Not invariably , I am sorry to say especially now that I have taken up the suppression of the hips , which are fatal to the success of any toilette .

		Society was formerly very select in this
City	LOCATION	, but it is no longer the same , as you no doubt have occasion to know .

		Too many fortunes have been improvised , too many aristocratic families have descended in the scale .

		There has been a great change in society .

		The par - venus dominate and money is so insolent !

		People who have it imagine that other things can be impro - vised as education , for example , manners , good taste .

		Surely you must realize that such things can not be improvised .

		Distinction is a hot-house plant .

		We grow too few gardenias nowadays like you , my friend .

		On the other hand , we have abundance of sow-thistles .

		It would be hard to make dramatic dialogue more prosaic than this .

		But the plays that are intrinsically good have more liveliness in translation .

		It is these two `` La Malquerida '' and `` The Bonds of Inter - est '' that make us feel that
Jacinto Benavente	ORGANIZATION	has dramatic talent .

		He is not at all in the class with
Strindberg	LOCATION	or Tchekhov , for he has made no discovery either in psychology or tech - nique .

		But he is in the class with his compatriot
Jose Echegaray	PERSON	.

		He has dramatic invention , power of characterization , and he has , too , the ability to impress a certain atmosphere on read - ers and spectators .

		`` La Malquerida '' is melodrama , but melo - drama that has distinction by reason of a strange reserve that goes through it all .

		This reserve is such that although two people have been mur - dered when the play closes and two others are likely to have their lives ended , we have all the 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	time the impression of smothered fire .

		The plot might be that of one of the ungovernable plays that the Sicilian Players produce .

		A stepfather -LRB- Estaban -RRB- is passionately in love with a girl -LRB-
Acacia	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- who is his wife 's -LRB-
Raimunda	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- daugh - ter .

		She loves him , though to her the passion appears as hatred .

		Estaban has had one of the girl 's suitors frightened off and he has the other murdered .

		In a Sicilian version of such a plot fury would out-top fury .

		But in this play there is so much restraint in the writing , so much reserve in the characters , that we get the impres - sion of quietism rather than of fury .

		We are made to feel the gravity and the dignity of the Spanish character all through the play .

		`` La Malquerida '' is a play that might make a success on the American stage , if put on by one of our few adventurous producers .

		The parts for the women Raimunda and
Acacia	ORGANIZATION	have splendid scope .

		The exposition is needlessly long and is complicated by unnecessary characters , but it could be very easily shortened and simplified .

		`` The Bonds of Interest '' is a play in which the action is so generalized that the performers have the anonymity of puppets .

		We can imag - ine the players who take the parts of
Crispin	LOCATION	,
Leander	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbine	LOCATION	,
Polichinelle	LOCATION	,
Harlequin	LOCATION	,
Pantaloon	LOCATION	, and other characters as simplified , wearing masks .

		Crispin , Leander 's servant , starts things going by his rogueries .

		He creates for his master `` the bonds of interest . ''

		These , being created , make it inexpedient that Leander be discredited as an impostor .

		The innkeeper whom he owes for entertainment , the poet whom he has patronized , the duenna whose expectations have been encouraged , the mother whose daugh - ter has been compromised , all find it necessary to push him towards the marriage that makes his fortune .

		But `` The Bonds of Interest '' is not a comedy of rogueries : everything is made abstract so that we come to see a philosophic idea in the play the dependence of that which loves and idealizes upon that which contrives and gains .

		The translator by rigidly following a custom of the author puts , we think , a needless strain upon the readers of the English version .

		Bena - vente tells nothing about his characters on the front page or in the programme ; he merely enumerates them
Raimunda	PERSON	,
Acacia	ORGANIZATION	,
Juliana	LOCATION	,
Dona Isabel	PERSON	, and so on .

		He gives us no advance information as to their age or their relation to one another .

		In the English version this lack often makes us miss the significance of a page or so of dialogue .

		Reading `` La Malquerida , '' for instance , we easily place
Juliana	PERSON	as a servant .

		But we imagine that she is a maid .

		The fact that she is old or middle-aged and a family re - tainer gives a significance to her appearance that we miss on a first reading .

		Moreover , she is married to
Rubio	PERSON	, the man-servant , who is Esta - ban 's creature .

		Had we this information in ad - vance , her hints would have more suggestion for the reader .

		An Asiatic Frontier FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO ARARAT .

		By
G. E. Hubbard	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
E. P. Dutton Sc Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		There was a time before the war when we were extracting the last ounce of romance from the fact that our twentieth century had found no more frontiers to delimit , no more hinterlands to protect , no more savage races to whom the gramaphone and the sewing machine were sym - bols of western progress .

		Indeed , the barbed wire of the last outpost had been taken down and was rusting about the fields of black , brown , and yellow races on the jungle side of
Asia	LOCATION	and
Africa	LOCATION	.

		So outworn had the subject become in the hands of editorial writer and diplomatic vale - tudinarian that the stage was busy substituting for the thrills of high finance and big business the thrills of a plot based upon the haul politique of canals and frontiers .

		And now , once more the price of barbed wire is significant , and , whether or not the status quo is to be restored , this is not the last volume on delimitation we are to read , nor will our old age be unvexed by the intimate confidences of soldiers and diplomats .

		But , in pre-war literature , Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's book deals with the `` last frontier '' in
Asia	LOCATION	: indeed , it is the story of a frontier controversy that has lasted between the Turkish and Persian governments since
1842	DATE	.

		Fortunately it is not devoted to that tiresome record , nor even to the dreary business that is concerned with erecting posts and deciding upon natural or artificial bar - riers between the litigants .

		The author has inci - dentally furnished us with a careful description of those regions in
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	that have been fought over by the British , Russian , Turkish , and German armies .

		A good idea of the almost insuperable task faced by the British in their advance to
Bagdad	LOCATION	may be gleaned along with attractive glimpses of the country in its
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 395 rarer and kindlier moods and aspects .

		Fauna and flora , and the pastoral life of the fierce Kurds , together with the picturesque life and customs of the various nomad tribes the British commission encountered , form the material of Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's leisurely pen .

		Though he was captivated , as other writers have been , by the charm of the Kurd , it was nevertheless a Kurd - ish bullet which imposed the long convalescence that enabled him to collect his impressions .

		Not long after the British , Russian , Turkish , and Persian commissions had placed their final mark on the frontier line , these Kurds were loosed against the defenceless Christians -LRB- Nestorians -RRB- of the country , and began that systematic butch - ery which has extended through
Armenia	LOCATION	down to
Mount Lebanon	LOCATION	.

		Delimiters of Asiatic boundaries seem to agree with commercial travellers on the dislike , re - marked by Lord
Curzon	PERSON	in his essay on frontiers , shown by Orientals of the Near East for giving and observing a contract .

		This , however , is not to be marvelled at among races that have been , and still are , subject to the Turk .

		The only reason
Turkey	LOCATION	consented to a boundary com - mission was the fact that British and Russian influences were converging in
Persia	LOCATION	.

		The great trouble and expense of previous commissions that had come to naught might have been increased in the present case had not a copy of the carte identique , the map completed in
1869	DATE	and ap - proved as a basis for negotiation , come to light in a British consulate in
Persia	LOCATION	the Ottoman copy had been destroyed by the last sultan .

		Thus the joint commission experienced all the various types of frontier problems .

		They had recourse to geographical , racial , linguistic , religious , and purely artificial devices , and one regrets that the author retails none of the solutions finally ac - cepted .

		Apparently the Turks were in a hurry , and for once failed to create the classical diffi - culties they had offered to previous commissions .

		Among the nomad tribes , when graybeards were consulted as to local custom and date , they inva - riably replied that the land , so far as they remem - bered , had belonged to
Allah	LOCATION	.

		The charm of Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's book lies in his picture of the interesting variance in customs as the picturesque tribes and races were encountered along the great mountain range that determined the course of the frontier .

		In the south , Iranian is separated from Semitic stock , that is , Lur from Arab .

		In the north , the tribal Kurds are divided into the two great sects of Islam Sunni and
Shiah	PERSON	.

		Since
Persia	LOCATION	is the home of the latter sect , it was allotted to her care , while the Sunni Kurds went to
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		Throughout the jour - ney the musical Persian was found alongside the guttural Arabic .

		The humors of the expedition are not forgotten in the discomforts .

		Water was always an important question , and once the British camp was pitched beside a delectable stream , the campers finding , shortly after , that its chief property was a strong solution of epsom salts .

		Fleas were ubiquitous , and the author records that the Kurds are compelled to rid themselves periodically of this pest by abandoning their camps , bag and baggage , and taking refuge in the mountains ; frequently the British camp was pitched disastrously close to an old Kurdish site .

		The Kurd has a gift for phrase : a difficult moun - tain was known as the `` Tearer of Pants , '' and its neighboring height as the `` Breaker of Nails '' ; snipe is known as the `` Father of Noses , '' and a portly British official was addressed ceremo - niously as the `` Father of Bellies . ''

		A Kurd chief was asked his income by a British officer and promptly named the sum .

		He was then asked his perquisites .

		`` Oh , '' said the chief , `` I never steal . ''

		Whereupon the Briton countered : `` Well , then , you 're not much of a Kurd . ''

		But the laugh was not always on the native .

		Some nomad Lurs , whose staple food is wild honey , were told that in
England	LOCATION	the bees were domes - ticated and lived in hives .

		But they were too wise for such a traveller 's tale .

		`` Ho , ho , '' said one , `` and I suppose when you go up to your
summer	DATE	pastures you drive them in front of you like sheep ! ''

		The intimate glimpses of the country and its varied ethnology are certainly more interesting than the perpetual bickering over such matters as grazing-rights and water - privileges that must have been a diurnal pro- gramme .

		And if Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's book is more concerned with the human and natural scene than with the petty affairs of international jeal - ousies in this last frontier of our world before
Armageddon	LOCATION	, the fact remains that it is still politically intriguing , and must continue to be after the war .

		A rich region that has for so long lain desolate under the blighting power of the Turk may yet fulfil a greater political and eco - nomic destiny under a more benign suzerain , when East and West once more begin delimiting frontiers , invoking nature , science , and artifice for the possession of the many acres that the war will leave out there basking in the sun .

		396 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	A Parnassian ` Romance THE KING or ALSANDER .

		By
James Elroy Flecker	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Max Goschen , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- It is , as far as one hears , the only novel of
James Elroy Flecker	PERSON	, and you come upon it not by patient searching nor by impetuous calls on the publisher , but by happy accident a sale of `` seconds '' and rejected noveb at
Mudie	PERSON	's or the
Times Book Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the very existence of this happy book seems forgotten , even now when every last word of Flecker 's is so cherished .

		`` The King of Alsander '' is hardly a last word in
Flecker	LOCATION	's tragically brief life ; the preface is dated `` Bey - routh ,
Syria	LOCATION	,
1913	DATE	, '' but for those who have made not a fad but a companion of his `` Golden Jour - ney '' and have sworn with him `` that Beauty lives though lilies die '' it is sufficiently precious .

		`` Here is a tale all romance , '' he exclaims , '' a tale such as only a Poet can write for you , O appreciative and generous Public a tale of mad - men , kings , scholars , grocers , consuls , and Jews : a tale with two heroines , both of an extreme and indescribable beauty : a tale of the South and of sunshine , wherein will be found disguises , myster - ies , conspiracies , fights , at least one good whip - ping , and plenty of blood and love and absurdity : a very old sort of tale : a tale as joyously improb - able as life itself . ''

		If you will , it is a tale of the Prisoner of Zenda written by a poet who is an artist and has a sense of the ridiculous so keen and pervasive that it begins by spoiling a story and ends by - being a story in itself .

		Even in this inconsequent dream of an idle Syrian day Flecker was too good an artist to neglect his form , too seriously a Parnassian even in his frivolity to forget his technique .

		Indeed it is quite possible to consider this book a Parnassian protest against the extrava - gance and sentimentality of the modern romantic novel , just as the `` Parnasse '' itself was a pro- test against the same characteristics of French romantic poetry .

		Only that would be missing the fun .

		`` The King of Alsander '' begins in the little English village of
Blaindon	LOCATION	, `` in some romantic English spot , Where
summer	DATE	's not so very hot , And winter not too chill . ''

		Thither , directly to the bongmash -LRB- which is Blaindon for Bon Marche ! -RRB-

		, where
Norman Price	ORGANIZATION	keeps shop when he is not reading
Apuleius	PERSON	, comes an old man , a poet , instilling into young
Norman	PERSON	the desire for travel and giving him a word of advice , to go straight to Alsander .

		So
Norman	PERSON	goes there and is met , as all young , fair , tall Englishmen should be met , by
Peronella	LOCATION	, whose countenance `` was a sweet rose and jasmine garden but always , I would have you remember , a garden that blossoms by the sea , with vistas of the bay - down every alley of the roses , and gleams of blue water glinting behind the trellis of the jasmine , and the sea air slightly touching the colour of all the flowers . ''

		Before he can fall properly in love with Pero - nella ,
Norman	PERSON	is caught in what is technically known as `` a web of intrigue . ''

		Alsander has fallen on evil days and the last of the
Kradendas	PERSON	, the ruling family , is an idiot .

		The arrogant and bigoted Count Vorza rules in his stead , and only a few patriots remain , who dream of an Alsander as great as
Florence	LOCATION	in her elder day .

		The Asso - ciation for the Advancement of Alsander chooses
Norman	PERSON	to represent the king , for the king him - self has not been seen by mortal eyes these many years .

		Norman is promptly examined for the post , rebels at the physical examination , is whip - ped , goes to the British consul , and demands that the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	`` what are they wasting coal in the North sea for '' if they ca n't protect an English - man from being insulted ?

		come to his rescue .

		But
Arnolfo	PERSON	, the pale and mystic figure of the story , persuades him to accept the position of king and he is duly crowned .

		A counter rebellion breaks out , because the new king has foresworn his early love for Peronella when he discovers that his good angel Arnolfo is , in reality , the Princess lanthe , legitimate heir to the throne after the madman .

		And so after much bloodshed and a dashing fight , in which the idiot king is killed ,
Norman	PERSON	marries the princess and becomes the true ruler of Alsander .

		Whereon the ancient poet reappears at
Blain	PERSON	- don , calls down the fairies who knew
Norman	PERSON	's mother , and takes
Norman	PERSON	's friend to assist at his own disappearance in the tumultuous seas !

		I take it that this is a fair plot , to which the intelligent reader of the summary can add details : the scene in the old shop where
Norman	PERSON	is made captive ; the scene in the castle where the imbecile king knights
Norman	PERSON	as his deliverer ; the quiet moment at the height of the coronation revels when
Norman	PERSON	, torn by his passion for Peronella , \ irlds in his own despite to the low voice of Ar -
1917	DATE	397 nolfo and discovers the princess ; the ancestral glories of Alsander ; the Jewish doctor who is n't a bad fellow after all ; the riot and the rout .

		A well-printed and easily read book of some 300 pages demands no more .

		But what makes `` The King of Alsander '' a joyous book , and a perplexity to those who like their Anthony Hope straight , is the bubbling and irrepressible humor of the telling .

		The maddest of all modern romances , `` The Man Who Was
Thursday	DATE	, '' alone contains more wildness and more joy than this book .

		Thus the introduction to Alsander : Who is there -LRB- I should have written in
1820	DATE	-RRB- or what man of feeling and imagination can be found , who , on contemplating the ineffable grandeur and unspeakable majesty of Nature , does not ardently aspire to hold at the same moment communion with some divinely tender female heart , to read in those liquid eyes his own reflections purged of their dross and transmuted into gold , to press those sensitive fingers and thereby lose himself in rapture among the gorgeous scenes that astonish and confound his gaze , to seal those fluttering lips with the memory of an unforgettable moment ?

		To resume the use of the English language , Nor - man felt lonely .

		Or , Peronella : I will not give my heroine `` plain but interesting features '' or `` a noble rather than beautiful counte - nance with intellect shining in her eyes , '' or even in a candid moment declare her to possess `` a haunting plainness all her own . ''

		But apart from all this there is the truth to consider , and this young girl was assuredly one of the most perfect women God ever made by accident or Satan by design .

		The trick is by no means a new one , the play of ironic intelligence on a romantic subject is , we are asked to believe , the essence of modernism .

		But Mr.
Flecker	PERSON	's achievement is extraordinary in that it leaves and even enhances the romance ^ Because this is a good tale and a thriller .

		His embellishments : `` Grave matters of ethics are frequently discussed in the course of my story . ''

		One of them is the connection between whipping and philosophy ; another , quite a good one , is concerned with English hypocrisy and English cleanness in the matter of sex .

		`` For
Thackeray	PERSON	, the Irregular Unionist -LRB- if so we may style those easy livers -RRB- , is a scourge of high society ; for
Dickens	PERSON	, he is an ungodly scoundrel , a scourge of low society ; for
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, he is a noble fellow disregarding the shackles of convention ; while the late
George Meredith	PERSON	in - variably punishes the amorous by describing them as intellectual failures .

		Today Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	would consider
Lovelace	PERSON	disreputable owing to his lack of interest in social problems , while the pale Nietzscheans would worship him in ecstatic gasps as a monstrous fine blond beast . ''

		There is more of this and more of many things , sly jests and sharp remarks , pointed asides throughout the story , and ineffable good humor .

		It is wrong to write seriously about a book of this type ; the only excuse is that one can not write as
Flecker	PERSON	did , and to write seriously may persuade some people to read frivolously .

		Yet if we are thinking of romance and such things , and if we are wondering a little at these strange Eng - lish whose grocer boys become poets if not kings , who are endlessly provincial , and who colonize the world , we may reflect on Flecker and on this book of his .

		Because it is intensely English .

		It revels in the South and sunshine because it has its roots in
November	DATE	Evenings !

		Damp and still They used to cloak
Leckhampton Hill	LOCATION	, And lie down close on the grey plain And dim the dripping window pane .

		He married a Greek lady ; he lived for the Grecian islands and the Moslem East , but he never forgot the
England	LOCATION	which slopes down the green and lovely Cotswolds or runs to the sea in the bright sands of
Bournemouth	LOCATION	.

		The mys - teries of the East and the urgings of adventure have been expressed to us best by inland and pro- vincial folk , by a Conrad or a Louys or a Flecker .

		But when I walk in
Athens	LOCATION	town That swims in dust and sun Perverse , I think of
London	LOCATION	then Where God 's brave work is done , And with what sweep at Westminster The rayless waters run .

		It is this firm rooting in
London	LOCATION	and the Glou - cester lanes which makes his feeling for Iskander and
Samarkand	LOCATION	so authentic in his verse , and it is his feeling for God 's brave work which makes the flightiness and cheer of Alsander so delightful .

		`` Oh shall I never never be home again ! ''

		he cried .

		`` Meadows of
England	LOCATION	shining in the rain , Spread wide your daisied lawns . ''

		He would be the last to say that it was in this tale all of romance that he came home .

		It was a home of sobriety and decency , a home cultivated and blessed by the very passage of the tender years , and his romance and his poems are not of these things .

		But he would have known that only the things he longed for and desired made it possible for him to give such desirable things to the world .

		398 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS PLAYS BY
OSTROVSKY	PERSON	.

		Edited by
George Rapall Noyes	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It takes what amounts almost to genius to make a good translation .

		Perhaps that is why so few of the many books rendered into English are readable .

		There are , after all , not many men with scholarship enough to think in two languages and at the same time imagination enough to recognize the soul of a phrase and give it rebirth in a new tongue .

		Ostrovsky , the dramatist contemporary of Tolstoy and Dos - toevsky and
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	, presents a difficult prob - lem for the translator .

		Perhaps that is why the English versions of his plays have been so few .

		His characters , for the most part from the Rus - sian merchant class of fifty or sixty years ago , speak in a racy vernacular of their own .

		Trans - lation of the idiom is impossible .

		To paraphrase
Moscow	LOCATION	slang with
Chicagoesc	ORGANIZATION	is , of course , out of the question .

		The translator in the present instance has attempted the betwixt and between of colloquial English , and the result is cumber - some .

		Still there is enough of interest in the four plays to make up for the lumbering dialogue .

		The plays made their first appearance in the fifties and sixties , just a few decades before `` An Old Homestead '' initiated the first `` school '' of American drama , and yet they are surprisingly modern , not only in their merciless realism , but even to a certain extent in form .

		They are not patterned after that formula of `` big scenes '' and `` curtains '' against which we are only beginning to revolt .

		They meander as life meanders , full of irrelevant speeches , and at the end they are likely to offer no resolution , as in `` A Protegee of the Mistress , '' or to peter out in inconsequen - tial dialogue , as `` It 's a Family Affair We 'll Settle it Ourselves . ''

		Yet they have dra - matic quality .

		In spite of an Elizabethan ten - dency toward unnecessary soliloquies , allegorical names for very real characters , and speeches hurled robustly over the footlights at the audi - ence ,
Ostrovsky	PERSON	's plays are , in the main , the sort of plays one would like to see on the American stage .

		To expect such plays is not demanding too much of our playwrights , for
Ostrovsky	PERSON	is not a genius .

		He is simply the scribe of a chang - ing time , noting with some faithfulness its effect upon a portion of society .

		And yet , as histories of Russian manners during the years immediately preceding and following the emancipation of the serfs , and as masterpieces of characterization , these plays have much to give the American stu - dent of the drama , even through the medium of an inadequate translation .

		THE RAILROAD PROBLEM .

		By
Edward Hun	PERSON	- gerford .

		McClurg ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Like the poor , the railroad problem is always with us .

		In a volume of two hundred and fifty pages Mr.
Hungerford	PERSON	has told us something of the ills of `` the sick man of American business '' and has suggested a few palliatives some may think them curatives .

		The book is based on articles which appeared in such journals as `` Col - lier 's , '' `` Every Week , '' and the ``
Saturday	DATE	Even - ing Post . ''

		From this one would naturally expect it to be written in an easy and entertaining style , and in this he will not be disappointed .

		In fact , it is just such a volume as one would like to read on a railroad journey .

		Four chap - ters deal with labor , two with organized and two with unorganized , and they are full of inci - dents in the everyday life of engineers , conduc - tors , and telegraphers , that have a real bearing on the railroad problem .

		The same may be said of the chapters dealing with the railroads and their competitors , and the relation of the rail - roads to national defence is stated in a clear and concise way .

		The good red blood of human life runs all through the book .

		Even the serious stu - dent of the railroad problem may profit by its perusal , for it helps to humanize the whole situ - ation .

		BIRDS OF
BRITAIN	LOCATION	Their Distribution and Habits .

		By
A. H. Evans	PERSON	.

		Putnam 's ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The American nature-loving public is accus - tomed to two types of books about birds first , the guidebook which tells how to identify them , and second , the popular descriptive stories of bird-life .

		This British book falls in neither class .

		It is a hybrid .

		Written primarily for use in schools , it fails to meet the American concep - tion of natural-history education because it deals so plentifully in scientific phrase and classifica - tion .

		It is not helpful as a guidebook because it makes no pretense of trying to aid in identifying birds , except incidentally through the many photographs which accompany the text .

		All the birds which visit
Great Britain	LOCATION	are described un - der their respective families .

		It is the family , however , not the species , which is made the centre of descriptive interest .

		The popular study of birds in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is far behind nature study in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This book is just one evidence of the lack of adequate facilities for bringing bird-life close to the school and the home .

		There are excellent guidebooks to British and European birds , though there are still lack - ing those popular , intimate , highly illustrated nature-books which bring the boy and girl of the average suburban and country home in Amer - ica so close to wild life .

		This book , intended for children , does not meet such a need .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 399 A SCALE OF PERFORMANCE TESTS .

		By
Rudolf Pintner	PERSON	and
Donald G. Paterson	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Mental testing promises to become so tech - nical a pursuit that manuals of the art are in - dispensable .

		Mental tests aim to measure capacity by the double method of finding what a child -LRB- or , for that matter , an adult -RRB- knows and what he can do .

		Knowledge is more or less incidental , even accidental ; though the immunity from its acquisition in a constantly inviting and stimulating environment argues incapacity .

		But doing seems to stand nearer to ability .

		On the basis of this conception Professors Pintner and
Paterson	PERSON	have developed a graded series of tests based entirely on performance , though necessar - ily using the material of identification , recogni - tion , and perception of logical relations , which enters as readily into doing as into knowing .

		Such tests must be tried out and a standard of performance for each age determined .

		The standard then becomes an available yardstick to determine mental stature , particularly with ref - erence to notable defect or proficiency .

		The programme is admirably carried through , with abundance of well-arranged tables and sufficient interpretation to show the bearing of the results and warn against sources of error .

		There are so many types of children to be tested for whom the medium of language is not suitable the deaf , the speech-defective , the foreign , and even the nervous that performance-tests have a peculiar significance .

		In view of the fact that the pres - ent war is to see tried on an unprecedented scale the method of testing recruits to gauge their rank , in comparison with other forms of exam - ination and estimate , psychology is to find an unusual practical application , by which the value of the art is likely to be demonstrated .

		Equally has its application to the disqualified in mental and moral make-up , against whom society must protect itself , made the subject of great moment .

		STUDIES IN INSECT LIFE .

		By
Arthur Everett Shipley	PERSON	.

		T.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	; 10s .6 d. Professor
Shipley	PERSON	has collected in this volume a number of previously published articles and addresses .

		They are all so written as to be intelligible to the lay reader and they are of more than passing interest .

		In one of the studies , `` Insects in War , '' there is presented an aspect of the problem of army life that is not likely to have occurred to the average man .

		Three essays are given to bees and wasps and two to the development of oceanography .

		Among the lat - ter there is an interesting study of Sir
John Murray	PERSON	, the founder of that science , with some sidelights on university life in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in the late sixties .

		Modern chemists will be amused to read of how
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, not being very much interested in chemistry , would `` mani - fest the greatest adroitness in drawing
Robertson Smith	PERSON	, who was then teaching chemistry , from the arid deserts of physical science into the tangled thickets of theological discussion , and he always succeeded in keeping him there as long as he liked . ''

		The essay most likely to appeal to the lay reader is the one on `` Hate . ''

		Basing his conclusions on the work done by Cannon as to the function of the adrenal glands , Professor
Shipley	PERSON	thinks that the function of hate is , phy - siologically , simply that of placing men in a position to put forth their utmost physical ef - fort .

		There are two articles of interest to the literary historian : `` Zoology in the
Time of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	'' and `` The Revival of Science in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		ITALY AT WAR .

		By
Herbert Vivian	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		This is a different sort of book from Mr.
Alexander Powell	PERSON	's volume of the same name and approximately the same date of publication .

		Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	writes as an observant rambler who chanced to be footing it through
Italy	LOCATION	at the time Prince von Billow was given to understand that his presence in
Rome	LOCATION	was no longer desired .

		Thus the Italian people 's attitude to the great issue of the day is presented with the insight and the accuracy of one familiar with the ways of the common folk and speaking their language -LRB- as also several other European tongues -RRB- .

		Note - worthy is the author 's emphasis upon the too little suspected perpetration of Austrian atrocities .

		Frightfulness he shows to be not exclusively a Prussian product .

		Such books as Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	's and Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's are especially welcome , even especially needed , at this time to set forth the extraordinary skill and heroism with which
Italy	LOCATION	is quietly carrying through an ar - duously -LRB- and literally -RRB- up-hill task .

		Might not a little more power at her elbow , just now , enable her to end the war for us by pushing on to
Lai	PERSON	- bach and
Vienna	LOCATION	and thence into
Germany	LOCATION	, if not actually to
Berlin	LOCATION	?

		THE STREET OF INK .

		By
H. Simonis	PERSON	.


Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		Though not all that its subtitle claims for it , this anecdotal retrospect down the length of Fleet Street is a remarkably interesting and in - forming book , being from the pen of a shrewd observer with a retentive memory who for twen - ty-two years has been an active journalist in the famous `` street of ink '' that gives its name to the volume .

		Mr.
Simonis	PERSON	is at present director of the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily News '' and `` Star , '' and his fund of personal reminiscence goes far toward justifying the publishers ' assertion that he has met 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	practically everyone worth knowing in
London	LOCATION	journalism during the period covered by his ram - bling narrative .

		An intimate history of recent English journalism the book may well call itself , but outside of
England	LOCATION	we have only a single chapter on `` The American and French Press . ''

		The writer 's fondness for illustrative anecdote contributes no little to the entertaining quality of his pages , though occasionally the application of the story to the subject it is intended to illus - trate is not so obvious as it might be ; but a timely word pointing out this application now and then helps us out of the difficulty .

		OUTPOSTS OF THE FLEET .

		Stories of the
Merchant Service	ORGANIZATION	in War and Peace .

		By
Edward Noble	ORGANIZATION	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	; 60 cts .

		That heroes of the merchant marine should , as a rule , receive but scant recognition seems very unjust to Mr.
Edward Noble	PERSON	, and his present collection of stories will possibly do something toward causing the creation of an order or simi - lar honor to be bestowed on them .

		To the ordi - nary perils of the deep are now added the risks and the terrors of war , as is vividly brought out in such tales as `` Torpedoed '' and `` Homeward with Grain , '' which , with seven other short pieces , make up the contents of the book .

		Most , if not all , of these sea-yarns have already seen the light in various British journals , but are none the worse for that .

		At least they are new to American readers .

		They speak eloquently of the tragedy of the good ship done to death , with passengers and crew , by the furtive submarine .

		WAR .

		By
Pierre Loti	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		In the perusal of this new volume by
Loti	PERSON	, it is brought home to one again how inexplicably and beautifully his manner and matter are fused .

		He treats of the usual subjects two Belgian child refugees , the soldiers , the ruined cathedrals , the battle line but in the atmosphere of this book , one sees everything bathed and refreshed .

		The sketch of the refugees touched us more than anything we have read regarding the war , yet it is by no means harrowing , but is colored with a whimsical humor .

		He happily awakens in the reader his amused , hopeful pity for the children .

		In all the sketches of personages , he characteris - tically avoids the obvious and the crudely emo - tional .

		Even in the story of his visits to the
King	ORGANIZATION	and Queen of
Belgium	LOCATION	, where his self - consciousness is most apparent and where his d'Artagnan-like adoration might render him ridiculous , there is perfect artistic restraint .

		As for the horrors of war , they are shown without squeamishness but with no wallowing in awful - ness .

		Others have written of the ruins of
Ypres	LOCATION	and
Rheims	LOCATION	, but it remained for Loti to tell us of their melancholy beauty .

		He shows them as they look in the twilight ; he calls up the spirit that was intrinsically theirs , and finds the inner mean - ing of their desecration in the desire on the part of the Prussians to destroy the very heart of ancient
France	LOCATION	.

		He throws an exquisite glamour around
Ypres	LOCATION	, portraying the cathedral and the great belfry projecting their silhouettes against the sky , seemingly congealed , gesturing with broken arms ; and he conjures up the mournful surroundings in which
Ypres	LOCATION	is now lost .

		Then , Loti-like , he shows us three or four little girls escaped from the cellars which sheltered them and dancing around in the square beneath the phantom belfry .

		For the Loti-lover this book holds the pleas - ure of anticipation and of realization .

		THE MEXICAN PROBLEM .

		By
C. W. Bar	PERSON	- ron .


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Granting that all the facts are as stated by Mr.
Barren	PERSON	, that he is not far out of the way in his deductions , and that his little book is worthy of attention , he but touches the surface of the Mexican problem as it exists to-day ; and the problem to-day is very different from what it was only a year ago .

		In his foreword he leads us to understand that he will demonstrate that the development of the oil fields of our neigh - bor to the south will prove the true solution .

		In fact , the solution of the problem must come before the oil fields can be satisfactorily operated .

		As he truly says , economic progress is only po > - sible where government is firmly established , where disorder is suppressed , and where the courts mete out justice to all .

		He has given no hint as to how this is to be accomplished .

		RealK his title is misleading .

		His whole theme is found in the two affiliated oil companies the Pan - American in
California	LOCATION	and the Mexican Petro - leum .

		The author says that the
United States	LOCATION	can never take its proper attitude toward its sister republic until two popular , but false , impres - sions are removed .

		First , that the natural wealth of the country has furnished a base for contending business interests from the States to promote Mexican quarrels ; and second , that the land question is at the bottom of those troubles .

		It is true that the land question was only a tem - porary war-cry , for every attempt to give land to the natives has proved a failure .

		On the other hand , there is much to show that the Madero revolution was fomented by certain business interests in this country in order to get rid of
Diaz	ORGANIZATION	, and thus obtain greater power .

		Attention is called to the wavering policies of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 401 President
Wilson	PERSON	in dealing with the Mexican situation .

		Everyone familiar with the situation will agree that `` We have no right to strike down the governments of
Mexico	LOCATION	one after another and refuse to the government and people finan - cial , business , and political assistance . ''

		The real problem is that of `` one civilization and one order , one rule and procedure , in contact with another civilization , another order , pro- cedure and morality . ''

		This problem was what the
Diaz	PERSON	administration was scienti - fically studying and beginning to solve , as the publication of
Peust	ORGANIZATION	's monograph demonstrated .

		It is true that `` at the present time the larger part of the good people of
Mexico	LOCATION	are children who want to be in debt and at the same time care-free . ''

		The average peon suspects and avoids the owner of a hacienda who will not per - mit him to sell himself into peonage .

		Very few have sufficient persistent energy to make good industrial operatives .

		They do not want oppor - tunity to labor .

		We solved the Indian problem by driving the Indians from the soil and exter - minating them .


Mexico	LOCATION	has tried to solve it by protecting these child peoples and at the same time stimulating those found worthy of indus - trial activity .

		HENRY THOREAU AS REMEMBERED BY A YOUNG FRIEND .

		By
Edward Waldo Em	PERSON	- erson .


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Dr.
Emerson	PERSON	, who was about seventeen years old when
Thoreau	PERSON	died , has retained through the fifty-five years since that premature death some vivid memories of the strangely gifted man who was a frequent visitor at the
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	house and a favorite elder playmate and sagacious coun - sellor of the
Emerson	PERSON	children .

		The remem - brances now presented in book form were in part first given to interested hearers twenty-seven years ago in the form of a lecture designed to correct prevalent misapprehensions as to both
Thoreau	PERSON	's character and the events of his life .

		Amplified now with passages from the journals of both
Thoreau	PERSON	and the writer 's father , and enlivened with scraps of personal reminiscence from some of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries , these illuminating glimpses of a strongly marked and splendidly independent but too often misunder - stood personality are a welcome addition to the rather meagre literary product called forth by the
Thoreau	PERSON	centennial .

		In this little book Thoreau the idealist stands justified for his re - fusal to devote the best years of his life to pencil - making and money-getting .

		That he should have been thought by a competent authority to need any such justification at this late day is note - worthy .

		A GERMAN DESERTER 'S WAR EXPERI - ENCE Translated by
J. Koettgen	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Serial publication in German and the appear - ance of specimen chapters in English had already prepared a welcome for this anonymous narra - tive upon its publication in book form .

		The writer 's deep hatred of war and all its works , not only the actual bloodshed and cruelty , but also the unnatural and humiliating relations of men to officers in the German army itself , speaks in every page and explains this pacific soldier 's determined and at last successful attempt to get free of the whole loathsome business .

		A dash across the Dutch boundary and an
Atlantic	LOCATION	voy - age as stowaway accomplished the end in view , and we leave the author enlisted in the ranks of American socialism as a fighter against capital - ism , to the pernicious power of which he ascribes the war .

		The whole story is told with the vivid - ness that comes of recent deep and indelible im - pressions of soul-stirring experiences .

		GERMANISM FROM WITHIN .

		By
A. D. McLaren	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		It is easy to be wise after the event ; hence the multitude of what may be called ex post facto prophets of the war .

		Nevertheless Mr.
A. D. McLaren	PERSON	, in his presentation of the symptoms long since pointing to
Germany	LOCATION	's present violent malady , writes with a first-hand knowledge of his subject that commands the reader 's serious at - tention .

		For thirty years , he tells us ,
Germany	LOCATION	has been the core of his thought , and the last seven of these years he spent in close con - tact with Germans of all sections and classes .

		Finally , his residence in the country and his study of its institutions were rounded off by an eight months ' sojourn in the concentration camp at
Ruhleben	LOCATION	.

		Long before the war his purpose had been formed to produce an exhaustive analysis of German Kultur ; and though his present book falls short of being exhaustive , it gives far more than a superficial view of the various activities and characteristics and tendencies in which stu - dents of
Germany	LOCATION	have been and still are inter - ested .

		One leading purpose of the book is `` to bring to the surface some of the hidden forces and strivings long at work in
Germany	LOCATION	, to show the trend of contemporary feeling and policy as something more than an externality or an aber - ration , and allow Deutschtum to unfold itself , its attitude to a wonderful age , its ` mission ' to the English mind . ''

		Thus the book is no mere by-product of the war .

		It is the careful work of a patient observer who has for thirty years been studying the politics , industry , education , char - , acter , and ideals of the German people .

		402 THE DIAL -LSB-
October 25	DATE	NOTBS ON NBW FICTION In some books a great character is created ; for which all else is forgiven .

		But in `` The Soul of a Bishop '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	has produced only a soul , a busy , inquisi - tive , aspiring soul , a solitary and almost disem - bodied soul , in custody of a bishop not the bishop , because no such definite person comes into being .

		A bishop , who wears gaiters , accompanies the soul through the 300 pages of its purgatory , a bishop who suggests in his detachment from the suffering soul and in his own impersonality that he is only a counterfeit presentment of
H. G. Wells	PERSON	leading around the Wells soul for pur - poses of public exhibition .

		Those who are fond of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	must perforce feel affection for his very interesting soul and find pleasure and satisfaction in its development .

		Sympathetically , one wishes that the environ - ment provided had been more real and attrac - tive .

		The scenes and characters of the book have the artistic bareness of the stage-settings of ultra-modern drama .

		It is left to the imag - ination to complete the background .

		Neither the palace at Princhester in which we find the soul , with a bishop , nor the dark and crowded little
London	LOCATION	house in which we leave the soul with one
Edward Scrope	PERSON	, formerly a bishop , is a hab - itable residence .

		But their flatness serves as a consistent setting for the vague minor characters who move around up stage .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	almost apologizes for the few `` domestic details '' he gives , `` irrelevant as they may seem in a spirit - ual history , '' and it is plain that he regards the supporting cast of his star soul as equally irrele - vant .

		Lady
Ella	PERSON	, wife of a bishop , wanders on and off the stage and furnishes the righteous , colorless foil for an unrighteous , colorful adorer of the soul 's attendant .

		This indiscreet adorer ,
Lady Sunderbund	PERSON	, almost comes to life in her childish sorrow when an unfrocked bishop re - fuses her offer of a garish temple for the new religion the soul is creating .

		Then the soul , possibly fearing the competition of any other reality , promptly ends Lady Sunderbund 's hopes and with them her momentary existence .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has put all his great power of thought and expression into the monologue of the soul which is the purpose of his writing .

		The action is incidental .

		The soul moves about , ges - ticulates , postures , disrobes , flagellates itself , and , through a series of strenuous contorting exer - cises , transforms a sickly , feeble , and inert soul - existence into a ruddy , muscular , and energetic soul-force .

		In order to embody this spiritual history the author ostensibly transforms
Edward Scrope	PERSON	, bishop of the orthodox church , into Ed - ward
Scrope	PERSON	, a servant of God .

		But whereas
Edward Scrope	PERSON	is unconvincing , the soul is a real creation .

		It is worse than useless to attempt to condense into a few sentences Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's evolution of true religion out of false creeds .

		That to which so powerful a writer has devoted an entire book can not be thus compressed with fairness either to him or to the reader .

		It is better simply to record that the soul is hard-thinking , hopeful , and unafraid .

		Many , who are to-day making a long-neglected search into their own spiritual natures and finding plumbless depths , vast unex - plored spaces , and unconquerable heights , will find intense interest in the experiences of this soul of a bishop , and at the journey 's end come to a like understanding with Mr.
Wells	PERSON	: `` Faith is a sort of tour de force .

		A feat of the imag - ination ... One perceives it clearly only in rare moments . ''

		If the reader is incapable of one of those `` rare moments '' in which he can perceive the value of this soul 's confession , he should not ascribe his failure to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, who has not only delivered a message of high inspiration , but has striven painstakingly to make the value of that message clear to all minds not sealed in with stupidity or intellectual arrogance .

		Like a good many actors , Mr.
Will N. Har	PERSON	- ben , author of `` The Triumph '' -LRB- Harper ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , finds it harder to put himself into a straight part than a character part .

		The South of the negro , the carpet-bagger , and the eccen - tric and despised Yankee of Civil War times , is very real to him .

		It is when he tries to portray the South through the character of the old-time southern gentleman that he falls somewhat short of verisimilitude .

		His point of view is of one who sees situations and events in a broad way , and who interprets them through his knowledge of the average man with his oddities , his stupidi - ties , his pretensions .

		Mr.
Harben	PERSON	makes us feel the overpowering importance to the men and women of the sixties of the things that to-day seem unimportant .

		He really has a good point to make , and he makes it in spite of the common - place melodrama to which his plot lends itself .

		`` My Mother and I , '' by
E. G. Stern	PERSON	-LRB- Mac - millan :
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- , describes the loftier and rarer as - pect of immigration .

		It carries the conviction that behind the `` problem '' there are high ideals shaping the courses of our second-generation for - eigners , carrying individuals through education and change to an Americanism that reflects a truer conception of liberty than our proverbial native spread-eagleism .

		The immigrant with as - pirations meets the educational reformer in a singleness of purpose that creates the most legiti - mate hope for American democracy .

		It is such an immigrant that the present author describes , in a narrative of simplicity and charm .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 403 Patience Worth 's three-hundred-thousand - word novel , `` The Sorry Tale '' -LRB-
Henry Holt	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.90	MONEY	-RRB- , was dictated , we are told , letter by let - ter , by means of the ouija board to Mrs.
John H. Curran	PERSON	, of
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		Men and women of intelligence and discretion witnessed the phe - nomenon in part and were even sharers in it .

		They vouch for the authenticity of the spirit - author and her graciousness .

		When passages of particular difficulty appeared , she would stop her tale to comment upon them ; and when the book was completed , she even went so far as to desig - nate to Mrs.
Curran	PERSON	in the presence of her pub - lishers in
New York	LOCATION	her choice of binding and cover design .

		It appears , therefore , that `` The Sorry Tale '' is Patience Worth 's own , from title to finis .

		The story is laid in the time of Christ , and concerns itself principally with the son of a re - jected Roman courtesan and
Tiberius Caesar	PERSON	, Hatte by name , whose life is exactly synchronous with
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's , though appallingly antipodal .

		The contrast is made strikingly manifest in the scene on
Calvary	LOCATION	, when the incarnation of hate and the incarnation of love hang side by side on crosses in reality of their own rearing .

		The plot , stripped of verbiage , is consistent and straightforward ; many of the incidents are amaz - ingly dramatic or poetic ; and the presentation of the life then extant in
Palestine	LOCATION	is accurate and full .

		To find these things , however , the average reader will have to master a style that is neither fish nor fowl in part the language of the Stuarts , in part the language of metaphysics .

		Largely , however , the language is that of Pa - tience Worth , a strange and tedious mixture of beauty and prolixity .

		When
Caanthus	PERSON	says , `` Thou art long ,
Panda	LOCATION	, long ... Tarry not , '' we breathed an `` amen '' in the general direction of the unseen author .

		`` Everything here is melodious , old-world , and set to ^ measure : like a minuet of Bocherini . ''

		So says Sir
Harold Carne	PERSON	in a letter to his friend
Launcelot Moult	PERSON	,
Esquire	ORGANIZATION	, in `` Dandelions , '' a first novel by a new writer ,
Coulson T. Cade	PERSON	.

		If the story were the consummation of all its author evidently wished for it , this statement of Sir
Harold	PERSON	's would be its best possible descrip - tion .

		There is charm and to spare in the pic - tures of English country life that are presented in dissolving succession ; the felicitous chapter headings suggest something of the color and the old-fashioned fragrance of the descriptive pas - sages : `` Pear-Drops , '' `` Tulips , '' `` Larks and Buttercups , '' `` Spice , '' `` Roses , '' and so forth .

		But the machinery of Mr.
Cade	PERSON	's narrative rumbles and groans too audibly at too frequent intervals ; the plot is superficial , even flimsy , and the char - acterization shallow .

		The plot has one ques - tionable merit : the insouciance with which it deals with certain bodily functions that we are usually taught to regard as pornographic .

		That such a story offends so little is due largely to the charm of the author 's style .

		Betsy , a little girl who has been too vigorously understood by her

		The book is intended primarily for children , but Mrs.

		This is a relatively slight tale but one that will not lessen her reputation as a thoughtful and clever writer .

Christopher Morley	PERSON	's `` Parnassus on Wheels '' -LRB-

		This is the woman 's side of `` Adventures in Contentment , '' and its whimsical humor in showing the domestic tem - per of the literary vagabond will meet with wide appreciation .

		This is the story of a `` liter - ary '' farmer 's sister , who revolts and takes to the open road on her own account .

		Her misadven - tures and the philosophy of the `` Perfessor , '' whose book-van supplies her with the oppor - tunity to escape the career of domestic drudge , make unusually good reading .

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	com - bines genuine understanding of the `` bookish '' temperament with humor that is irresistible .

		Mr.
Wallace Irwin	PERSON	exhibits greater talent in the choice of a title for his new volume than in the stories themselves .

		The book is called `` Pilgrims into Folly '' -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- and at first sight one wonders whether Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	is not himself one of the Pilgrims , for it is a little difficult to imagine the creator of
Hashimura Togo	LOCATION	being highly successful in the field of serious fiction .

		But in the course of these `` ro - mantic excursions '' he shows that he is capable of entering imaginatively into the lives of ideal - ists who will sacrifice bodily comfort , public rec - ognition , or obvious happiness in behalf of a more uncertain , though greater , satisfaction .

		One story , `` He Shot the Bird of Paradise , '' stands out from the rest .

		It has subtlety and suspense , and is marred only by a touch of ama - teurishness a criticism that applies to the entire volume .

		Mr.
Irwin	PERSON	is still a little uncertain of his powers , but the present book has definite promise .

October 25	DATE	CASUAL .

		COMMENT IN RESIGNING FROM THE FACULTY OF
Colum	PERSON	-
bia University	ORGANIZATION	as a protest against the dismissal of Messrs.
Cattell	PERSON	and
Dana	PERSON	, Professor
Charles A. Beard	PERSON	has performed a public service of the first importance .

		The vigorous and candid let - ter in which he gives his reasons for an act in - volving great personal sacrifice squarely raises at last an issue that will have to be faced , not in
Columbia	LOCATION	alone , but in every other university in the country .

		Shall a group of trustees `` who are reactionary and visionless in politics , and narrow and mediaeval in religion , '' determine what our educators are to teach ?

		Is the truth to be what such men happen to believe or find it to their in - terest to impose upon others ?

		Is the status of the professor to remain precisely that of the day laborer ?

		Is he to be subject to dismissal at the will of trustees who are accustomed to deciding such questions according to their ideas of what is reputable and permissible ?

		Are his colleagues on the faculty to have nothing to say as to his fitness ?

		If so , then there can be no freedom .

		In making a stand for the democratization of uni - versity control , Professor Beard occupies the strongest possible position .

		He was one of the most brilliant members of the faculty .

		His views are not those of the men dismissed .

		He is not a pacifist .

		His attitude to the war has never been doubtful .

		He was , in fact , one of the first to urge that we take our place beside the Allies , and in his letter of resignation he reiterates his conviction that we `` should now press forward with all our might to a just conclusion . ''

		Himself in thor - ough sympathy with the ruling majority , he has had the courage and the fine idealism to protest in the most effective way against the growing tendency to terrorize and coerce minority opin - ion , to substitute `` curses and bludgeons '' for ar - gument ; thus the implications raised by his letter stretch far beyond the immediate struggle in the universities .

		His act is one of the truest patriot - ism , and it comes at a time when it is not too late to substitute vision for violence in our treatment of the disaffected minority .

		Bitterness and pas - sion are accumulating in direct proportion to the success with which the intolerant and reaction - ary elements in our population are assuming to represent our national attitude in the war and to suppress all discussion of aims and policies as seditious .

		There is in all this , as the revolt of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	students clearly shows , a tragic fail - ure on the part of the middle-aged directors of opinion , university trustees , and so on , to under - stand the psychology of youth , whether in or out of the trenches .

		The old shibboleths and catch - words no longer rouse the traditional response and the effort to make them the test of loyalty can have no other result than to alienate the sympathy of the very youth who are bearing the burden at the front .

		Professor Beard is one of the few who understand the new spirit , with its passion for genuinely constructive service , and one hopes that in leaving
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	he may find a broader field in which to serve the interests of the kind of democracy to which he is attached .

		IN A RECENT NUMBER OF THE `` Mcrcure de
France	LOCATION	, ''
M. Andre Maurel	PERSON	sweats and labors at a gigantic task of demolition .

		He is engaged in battering away , with the nib of a pen , at the foundations of `` Jean-Christophe , '' that huge structure of ten volumes reared to the glory of a `` humanitarian lie . ''

		You fancy that such a task , undertaken with such a weapon , is a little formidable ?

		By no means ; for the ruin is al - ready half accomplished .

		`` Dans ce marecage silesien s ` ecroule la statue de Monsieur
Jean	PERSON	-
Christophe Krafft	PERSON	, entrainant avec elle 1 ` oeuvre entiere de M. Remain
Rolland	PERSON	. ''

		The French have understood Jean-Christophe only since the war began .

		He seemed mild in spite of his art - ist 's violence ; he was clearly an idealist , a musi - cian steeped in dreams .

		He died innocently enough on the eve of the invasion , but
M. Mau	PERSON	- rel points out subtly that he died happy .

		Why happy ?

		Was it not precisely because he had served the fatherland loyally as a spy ?


M. Mau	PERSON	- rel proves to his own satisfaction that `` Jean - Christophe '' is essentially a German novel .

		Jean-Christophe is expansive ; he insists on the right of the individual to take what he can use and to take it wherever he can find it .

		Applied to nations this is the familiar philosophy of might .


M. Holland	PERSON	's philosophy is the philosophy of force !

		`` Jean-Christophe '' is German in form .

		Who ever heard of a Frenchman sprawling through ten volumes , treating a life , hour by hour , from the cradle to the grave , sweeping in the whole of civilization ?

		This lack of measure and sweet reasonableness how can one think of it as French ?

		No ; the war has quite undone
M. Rolland	PERSON	and all his works ; and with an amazing generosity
M. Maurel	PERSON	hands them over to the enemy .

		It is a mistaken generosity at a time when his country is sacrificing its most promising youth in the trenches ; for even in normal times what country is likely to offer us a `` Jean-Chris - tophe '' every decade ?

		A
CHICAGO	LOCATION	NOVELIST WAS COMPLAINING bit - terly the other day of the isolation in which he has to do his work .

		A man set down in the midst of commercialism has to be altogether self-fertil - izing .

		Ideas may come to him from the air and set his mind aglow , but there is none of that
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 405 swiftness and amplitude of suggestion which is possible where the cross-fertilization of other minds occupied with the same problems enriches and fortifies his own .

		He spoke with envy of the fortunate workmen who are able to utilize other men 's brains without fear of infringing a copyright .

		They pool their intellectual capital and each is able to draw from the common source much more than he had put in .

		They gather at a table ; someone produces a likely idea ; it is tossed here and there , mauled and dissected , turned inside out , reduced to essentials and forced to yield up its last bit of value .

		The result is bound to be illuminating and immensely helpful to the writer who wants to develop the idea in a work of art .

		There is indeed a great deal to be said for this sort of community think - ing , but it has one grave drawback .

		It offers to the vanity of the artist a response so immediate and uncritical as to be demoralizing .

		Why wait for the applause of a vague and probably indif - ferent public when you can saunter into a cafe ' and steep yourself in the warmth of more or less expert approval ?

		No doubt it is possible for the coterie to produce its great men , but they are a tough-fibred lot who know precisely how much to value group enthusiasm .

		LIBRARIES SERVING A SPECIAL CLASS OF READ - ERS have been obliged to meet the challenge of the war in various ways .

		The question presented itself whether it would be better in some cases to abandon that specialization of function which had distinguished them in peace times .

		Mr.
W. N. C. Carlton	PERSON	, the librarian in charge of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	, felt that , so far as his institution was concerned , it would be wiser to reach an accommodation with the ex - ceptional conditions than to depart from the li - brary 's special field , and the solution he worked out seems altogether admirable .

		He assembled all the books dealing with the culture , the his - tory , and the customs of the countries at war with
Germany	LOCATION	on shelves easy of access , and supplemented the collection with a gallery of photographs , color-prints , and etchings showing the architectural glories and the scenery of the allied countries .

		`` I wanted everyone who came into the room to realize the grandeur of the civ - ilization that had been attacked , '' said Mr.
Carl	PERSON	- ton , `` and in doing that I believe that I have most effectively fulfilled the purpose of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		IN DISCUSSING THE ENGLISH INTELLECTUALS IN WARTIME in the current `` Century , '' Mr.
S. K. Ratcliffe	PERSON	reminds us once more of the posi - tion occupied by the two old English universi - ties .

		Oxford , with its strong classical traditions , is the home of orthodoxy .

		Its leaders , from
Gil	PERSON	- bert
Murray	PERSON	to
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	, have revealed themselves as the defenders of the government , pamphleteers and propagandists at need .

		Cam - bridge , on the other hand , with its mathematical and scientific bent , is the home of
Bertrand Rus	ORGANIZATION	- sell ,
Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, `` the most philosophical and persuasive advocate of peace without vic - tory , '' and the conductors of the `` Cambridge Magazine , '' the `` most resolute band of academic internationalists . ''

		Mr.
Ratcliffe	PERSON	adds that the reasons for the contrast might not be hard to divine , but he contents himself with recalling that `` long ago
Kant	PERSON	remarked upon the tendency of scientific studies toward intellectual remote - ness from the passions of contemporary affairs . ''

		Now that the struggle is on between the classi - cists and the advocates of science , the attitude of the two great universities is not without its sig - nificance .

		Does the classical discipline naturally select minds that are relatively unadventurous , infertile , precedent-loving , respectful of author - ity , and impatient of change ?

		It we were to judge by some of the leading `` humanists '' of our own country , we could hardly be in doubt .

		WHAT WILL LITERATURE BE LIKE after the war ?

		One often hears that it will be `` nobler '' than before , and people who talk in that vein point out that the actual will be too harsh for war-frayed nerves .

		Men will take books as a narcotic .

		Perhaps .

		But if we look at some of the most vital books that have come to us from the trenches , we notice a different temper at work .

		There is often a relentless focusing of the horror , a will to realize it to the full , to speak for once of the unspeakable .

		Take
Henri Barbusse	PERSON	's `` Under Fire . ''

		You ca n't help feeling in that book an amazing lift and stir , a renewal .

		But what is the source of that feeling ?

		It is `` the vision of the thrill of reason , logic and sim - plicity '' that shook the men of his squad `` like a fit of madness . ''

		It is the confused effort to think things out .

		War must be banished .

		Yes , but to get rid of war , one must first get rid of privilege , of prejudice and injustice .

		` That would be fine ! '

		said one .

		` Too fine to be true ! '

		said another .

		But the third said , ` It 's because it 's true that it 's fine .

		It has no other beauty , mind !

		And it 's not because it 's fine that it will come ... It 's because it 's true that it has to be . ' ''

		There is plenty of idealism here , but it is an idealism eager to use the mind as an instru - ment to realize the dream .

		If such is the temper of many of the young generation in the trenches , there is little reason to fear a flood of `` noble '' books .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Some time ago a friend of mine issued a book , and of course one should think no less of him for that .

		To put forth a volume , indeed , might increase one 's personal affection for such a friend and even arouse a legitimate pride in him as one who has received royal recognition or been knighted for exceptional service .

		The authorship of a book , how - ever , receives from a great many minds the hom - age given to the bearer of evidences of immortality , a homage that serves the purposes of a halo , which , indeed , some authors accept , sometimes consciously and often unconsciously , at its face value .

		I recall a timid debutant in this line telling a friend , that he had asked a famous senator to write an intro - duction to his forthcoming volume .

		`` Hump ! ''

		said the friend , `` Why should you ?

		Your name will be known when his will only be in the buried statistics of mere officials . ''

		The prospective author had a sense of humor , but he no doubt accepted the halo subconsciously at least .

		Years passed and I was with that young writer when a publisher , a rival publisher , to be sure , picked up a copy of his volume and calmly assured him that it was printed on sulphite wood-pulp pa - per and would last only a few years ; `` not a rag in it , '' he added , as he tolled the knell of subcon - scious hopes .

		The victim confessed to me that he supposed he had written his book merely to con - tribute to the knowledge of his own generation , but that a slight wrenching of the machinery in the cardiac region revealed to himself a subconsciously held halo of immortality .

		The other friend , with whom I began this letter , was `` wiser in his generation , '' and with a sense of humor also .

		When asked by his publisher what kind of paper he preferred , he answered , without batting an eye : `` One that will last , say , about seven hundred years '' ; to which modest reply , the dispenser of immortality promptly showed him a sample sheet , adding : `` Here 's the stuff ; it is 33 per cent rags . ''

		To have a Sphinxian secret like that spoken aloud seemed incredible to my friend , and he passed it on to me as the sesame of immor - tality of a ll sizes ; for , if 33 per cent rags will produce 700 years of immortality , 1 per cent ought to give 25 years and mirabUe dictu 100 per cent would give 2500 years , which ought to satisfy the most fastidious in immortalities !

		I am told , too , that this secret is not copyrighted .

		Never before have I been worried about the per - manency of `` rag-time , '' but the very name now has a sinister suggestion .

		ENGLISH TANKA .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Every lover of poetry is more or less familiar with the famous Japanese verselets known as tanka and haikai .

		The word tanka means literally `` short poem . ''

		It is a verselet of thirty-one syllables , arranged in five lines of five , seven , five , seven , seven syllables respectively .

		The haikai , or hokku -LRB- literally `` first verses '' -RRB- , is a still shorter poem , of only seventeen syllables , arranged like the first three lines of the tanka .

		The charm of this Japanese `` epigram , '' as
Chamberlain	PERSON	translates tanka , is its suggestive or impressionistic feature , like the charm of many a Japanese painting or picture .

		It does not express all its meaning , but leaves one to read into it the full meaning .

		It is this which makes a Japanese tanka so difficult , sometimes absolutely impossible , of translation into expressive English .

		And it is especially difficult to translate it into English verse .

		However , it is not our purpose now to discuss the Japanese tanka at length , but to call attention to what may , perhaps , be termed English tanka .

		They have been written by Rev.
S. H. Wain	PERSON	- wright ,
D.D.	LOCATION	, secretary of the
Christian Literature Society of Japan	ORGANIZATION	, and are published by that society -LRB-
Tokyo	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The author has been an English teacher and missionary in
Japan	LOCATION	for about thirty years and is well versed in both the Japanese language and Japanese literature .

		But his tanka are not translations ; they are original .

		The first verselet , which adorns the title-page , under a picture of
Mount Fuji	ORGANIZATION	, is entitled `` Advent '' and reads as follows : In time 's long record naught To perfection has been brought .

		Whence Fuji 's sudden advent , Faultless and without precedent , Into the flight of years ?

		The following is a beautiful interpretation of the feeling of `` Crowds Viewing Cherry Blossoms '' in
Uyeno Park	LOCATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		Solomon was not robed like one of these Ten thousand spring-blown cherry trees .

		Nor gazed the Shebaean Queen with more surprise Than the Uyeno throng whose souls uprise To beauty as whitecaps to the breeze .

		And the following on `` Nirvana , '' written `` near a Buddhist monastery , '' is another good `` sample . ''

		Boom !

		wailed the temple bell .

		And the sound rose and fell , Like life and death .

		It moaned and sobbed , Like a lingering sorrow , And gently died away As day sinks into night With no to-morrow .

		The pessimism of that is balanced by this one on `` Optimism '' : If you say that seared sadness Lurks behind all laughing eyes , I reply that grace may cause this , By turning sorrow !

		into joys ; As from bed * of slime and vileness
Lotus	ORGANIZATION	flowers in beauty rise .

		Finally here is a real gem , written at Hono - lulu , in

		In a note concerning the source of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's `` gov - ernment of the people , by the people , for the peo - ple , '' an American illustrated weekly some time ago quoted two phrases of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	which , although distantly resembling
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's line , are by no means identical with it .

Parker	PERSON	delivered at the
New England Anti- Slavery Convention	ORGANIZATION	in
1850	DATE	he employed a phrase virtually identical in form with the one which Lin - coln 's address has made so familiar .

		It is contained in the following passage : There is what I call the American idea ... This idea demands ... a democracy , that is , a govern - ment of all the people , by all the people , for all the people .

		-LSB- Italics mine -RSB- ... That is one idea ; and the other is , that one man has a right to hold another man in thraldom , not for the slave 's good , but for the master 's convenience ... For shortness ' sake , I will call this the idea of Slavery .

		It demands ... an aristocracy , that is , a government of all the people , by a part of the people the masters ; for a part of the people the masters ; against a part of the people the slaves .

		Parker , as we see , is contrasting all the people with part of the people ; the antithesis is clear and deliberate ; moreover , it obviously accounts for his use of the qualifying `` all '' in the italicized passage .

		Aside from this single word , however , his phrasing and
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's are identical .


Parker	PERSON	's priority , it would seem , entitles his name to be remembered in connection with the terse formulation of the prin - ciple of ideal democracy which adorns the mem - orable
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address .

		LETTERS AND DIARY OF ALAN SEEGER -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read and reread the review by Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	of `` The Letters and Diary of
Alan Seeger	PERSON	'' in a recent issue of THE DIAL .

		The review is interest - ing , and in some respects I am in accord with the views expressed , but it seems to me the reviewer has failed utterly to catch the real value of the publication .

		For instance , there are the letters of the poet to his mother .

		Seeger seems from the first anxious to have her approval , and equally anxious that she should be brave and proud in the event of his death -LRB- see pages 3 , 8 , 70 , 119 , 175 -RRB- .

		But deeper than his attitude toward his mother is his attitude toward the war .

		He is no soldier of fortune .

		He is there from principle .

		The diary and letters are replete with evidences of his effort to key his courage up to the sticking-point and to meet the supreme test with a noble spirit when it should come .

		It is his motive in enlisting , touched on here and there throughout the book , and his cultivation of courage for the supreme test that make his letters to his mother so fine .

		I do not agree with the reviewer that Alan See - ger meant that we are all `` cowards , hypocrites and fools '' because we can not fight and must do our bit in `` second-best things . ''

		The quotation begin - ning `` But as in times of peace , '' is taken from the middle of a paragraph in which he says that it is `` disheartening '' that other nations should be brought into the war .

		He had hoped that it could be won without this necessity .

		But at the same time he felt `` There should be no neutrals but everyone should bear some part of the burden . ''

		No better evidence of
Seeger	PERSON	's breadth of mind and his sense of appreciation of vital support given the soldier , can be asked than his excoriation of a criticism pub - lished in
America	LOCATION	: I should not think that I would need to tell you that that article is simply the low joke of a mind that thinks it funny to tell lies .

		If his letters did nothing worse than belittle his comrades who are here for motives that he is unable to conceive , it would be only dishonourable .

		But when it comes to throwing discredit on the French government that in all its treatment of us has been generous beyond anything that anyone would think possible , it is too shameful for any words to characterize .

		-LRB- Letter to his mother ,
March 12 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- .

		And now that he has met the death of his dreams , now that he has disappeared at the pinnacle of his cherished career , we neither remember , nor can believe , the words of
Victor Chapman	PERSON	, quoted by Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	, that
Seeger	PERSON	was `` an appalling wreck '' before the war .

		Not only was he found physically fit to enlist , but the letters and diary show that he endured long marches and other hardships , and the moral tone of all the letters and diary is that of an unusual personality , a noble son , and an uncom - plaining , manly soldier .

		Unfortunately the author seems ob - sessed with the idea that to be interesting he must be slangy .

		The reader is continually addressed as `` Old Man '' and `` Old Scout , '' and a rod or reel never costs ten dollars , but `` sets you back '' or `` creases your bank roll '' to that amount .

		A stu - dent of

		Mr.
A. S. Neill	PERSON	, for all his re - jection at the hands of the rigid-minded parents of the quaint Scotch village , has not allowed his train of thought to be side-tracked , and the results of his roadside reflections are quite as entertaining as they ever were .

		`` My whole theory of educa - tion , '' he says , `` is built on my abject humility . ''

		He finds that discipline breeds lack of discrimina - tion and lack of good taste in the teacher as well as in the child ; he believes that education is noth - ing more nor less than individual thinking , in - dividual investigation , self-development .

		He sees no more reason for the teacher to impose rules and punishments , except as between man and man .

		than for the pupil to do the same .

		In other words , his credo is based upon a justifiable democracy one that we are apt to ignore the democracy of age and youth .

		That this is the only right spirit upon which to establish pedagogy -LRB- horrible word -RRB- we are absolutely assured .

		But does it work ?

		Let Mr.
Neill	PERSON	answer for that in his own manner .

		The mere fact that
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	was there fitted for college , as we know from his own pen , is enough to make the academy and its history objects of unfailing interest .

		Students of unfortunate
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's po - etry will find interest in an attractively bound little book , ``
Francis Thompson	PERSON	Essays , '' issued at Can - ton ,
Ohio	LOCATION	, by the
Franklin Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains two essays by
Benjamin Fisher	PERSON	, an
Ohio	LOCATION	manufacturer , who died in
1916	DATE	and who devoted much of his time , during his last years , to a study of
Thompson	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		With portraits and biog - raphies of both men , it serves the purpose of a double memorial volume .

		The author places the subject of his pages as follows : `` In imagination we dare not attempt such an impossible thing as a classification by comparison .

		The greatest fac - ulty of analysis , a function of the lower order of mind we denominate ` reason , ' utterly fails at its approach to this highest reach of mentality .

		The sacred writers of Biblical times called this power Vision , ' the modern author names it ` invention , ' the popular view accepts it as ` illusion , ' but its highest form is surely intuition and revelation .

		With this rare gift alone we reach beyond the con - fines of sensuous being ; and in such a state , whether acquirement or endowment ,
Thompson	PERSON	dwells in natural , voluntary activity . ''

		A list of
Thompson	PERSON	's published works , necessarily brief , concludes the volume .

		Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	touches a chord of response in his readers by his facility in rhythmic , picturesque utterance .

		This facility is often fatal to his ex - cellence as a poet , but it adapts itself readily to the description of German frightfulness on the high seas , which is the subject of a little book of sketches called `` Open Boats '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	; 50 cts . -RRB-

		.

		These scenes of murder and wilful abandonment were designed , it appears , as a moving plea for the active alliance with his own countrymen of the hitherto neutral Americans .

		That object no longer exists , but if any American is still in doubt about the rea - sons for our cooperation in the war , `` Open Boats '' is recommended as a good tonic and restorative .

		The book by Professors
Hollingworth	PERSON	and
Poffenberger	PERSON	gives in simple form the entire series of facts regarding the sense of taste , and points out the interesting aspects of its evolution , as well as its practical and aesthetic value .

		We are apt to underestimate the importance of the so-called lower senses and practically to forget that their significance still holds , despite our changed en - vironment .

		Apart from its ministry , along with the sense of smell , to food acceptances and re - jections , the sense of taste stands as the type of aesthetic preference .

		It represents the large in - dividual differences concerning which there may be little purpose in dispute , but very positive value in an understanding of their contributions to the men - tal life .

Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin	LOCATION	; 50 cts . -RRB-

		.

		Beneath the superstructure of official facts one glimpses heroism and sacrifice the details of which will never be known , but which distinguish the retreat above many engagements that history will note more carefully .

		In their baptism of fire on Belgian soil the little expedition - ary force set the future British army a memorable and difficult example .

		`` Such courage and patience , such humorous resignation and cheerfulness in ad - versity , are to be paralleled only in the finest armies of history . ''

		Their most fitting memorial is this brief , soldierly , vivid account of the retreat .

		The pres - ent reviewer wishes the editors of the series had given him
Meredith	PERSON	and a little freer hand about the necessity of much quotation and the inclusion of bibliographical detail .

		Then we might have had the delight , and it is a delight , of Professor
Neilson	PERSON	at his best .

		But the present volume is at least worth while , discriminating and well up to the stan - dard of the series .

		Of the making of textbooks there is no end , espe - cially of textbooks in English composition .

		But occasionally a volume appears which from its preface onward towers above the jumble of its competitors .

F. W. C. Hersey	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The ar - rangement of the contents is unexceptionable ; the five parts deal respectively with the gathering and weighing of material , the kinds of composition , structure , diction , and mechanics .

		Better even than the arrangement , however , is the excellence of the presentation .

		This is manifestly the result of years of dose study of the actual problems of composition , and is without a trace of that be - wilderment which quickly shatters our confidence in most volumes covering this field .

Augusta F. Bronner	PERSON	, -LRB- Little ,

$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- , may be unreservedly commended .

		It is not a study of special abilities and disabilities , except in the narrow field of the study of children likely to be brought up for psychopathic examina - tion .

		It is largely a record of cases , and in a measure is a pioneer contribution .

		The clinical material thus accumulated is admirably considered and presented in regard to the types of defect and superiority which unusual cases present .

		These are arranged first with regard to the educational aspect as presented by unusual capacity or incapa - city for number work , for the use of language , more specifically for spelling or reading or writing , and then in the special study of separate mental processes which present distinctly irregular per - formances .

		These include memory , association , imagination , and deficiencies in mental control .

		The next stage in advance would be the determination of the types of mental deficiency and superiority for which the tests serve as outward expressions .

		That these tendencies , when psychologically studied , will show interesting parallels with similar failures in the decay of mental powers , may be foreseen .

Masaharu Anesaki	PERSON	, professor of the science of religions at the Imper -
ial University of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	, and for two years profes - sor of Japanese literature and life at
Harvard	LOCATION	, has given a biography of a reformer of Japanese Buddhism .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	, as in
Western Europe	LOCATION	, the thirteenth century was a period of transition and of great intellectual activity .

		Buddhism , which had existed in the islands for several centuries , was divided into several sects , each with its faults
Nichiren	PERSON	set out to reform it .

		The essence of his work was the preaching of the prime importance of the `` Lotus of the Perfect Truth , '' a book occupying in the Buddhist scriptures a place analo - gous to that of the Johannine writings in the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Owing to the persecutions to which he was subjected to by his countrymen ,
Nichiren	PERSON	's life was a stormy one , and he narrowly escaped martyrdom .

		Disciples gathered about him , neverthe - less , and a sect bearing his name has existed in
Japan	LOCATION	down to the present day .

		In the past this sect has not been so important as certain others , but according to our author , it is receiving renewed attention in
Japan	LOCATION	to-day .

		It can not be said that
Andrew S. Ferenczi	PERSON	's `` Contributions to Psycho - Analysis '' -LRB- Badger ;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- is particularly important , or that it brings forward matter that has not already been sufficiently em - phasized .

		Indeed , its general trend goes back to the early statements of psychoanalysis , in which the formulation of principles was rather overdone in view of the evidence then obtainable .

		The ex - treme insistence upon the sexual interpretation of every trifling incident is itself so dominant that it leaves little room for other varieties of interpreta - tion .

		As a part of the general literature of the subject , the book has its use .

		It shows ability and a grasp of the mental mechanisms , but in no other wav can it be said to be notable .

		Four years later he went with Captain
Cooke	PERSON	and forty men to

$ 865	MONEY	.

		It is an extremely rare
Cambridge	LOCATION	imprint by
Samuel Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was reprinted in
England	LOCATION	in the same year without the printer 's name and with a different collation .

		It was credited by
Increase Mather	ORGANIZATION	to
Jonathan Mitchcl	PERSON	, pastor of the church at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		This was
Increase Mather	ORGANIZATION	's own copy , having his auto - graph at the upper corner , but it appears very faintly since the ink is faded .

		It also bears the autograph of
J. R. Lowell	PERSON	,
1844	DATE	.

		An interesting thing in the rare-book world was the recovery a few days ago by
Henry E. Hunting	PERSON	- ton of a valuable piece of Americana that had been stolen from his great library .

		The story is that , while Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	and his librarian
George Watson Cole	PERSON	were in
California	LOCATION	, someone who had access to his collection took from it some scarce works and offered them to dealers .

		One of the books , a rare American work , is said to have been sold to a dealer for
$ 1000	MONEY	.

		When Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	returned to
New York	LOCATION	, the dealer , who did not know that the book had been stolen , called on him and offered it for
$ 2000	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	identi - fied the book as his own property and regained it .

		A stolen rare book is a very difficult thing to sell .

		At a sale last year in this city by one of the auction houses , a copy of the first
Philadelphia	LOCATION	directory was bought by Dr.
A. S. W. Rosenbach	PERSON	, of that city , for
$ 1900	MONEY	.

		He put the book in his pocket , and went to lunch shortly after noon .

		By
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 413 five o'clock he had found out that it was the copy owned by the noted collector
Brinley	PERSON	.

		It had passed into the possession of Mr.
Goelet	PERSON	, from whom it had been stolen .

		Dr.
Rosenbach	PERSON	returned it to Mr.
Goelet	PERSON	.


James F. Drake	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, recently had two presentation copies stolen from an express company to which he had intrusted them .

		They passed through various hands and eventually were offered to him .

		He thus recovered them .

		Two books were stolen from
Anderson	PERSON	's dur - ing the
Learmont	PERSON	sale .

		Not long afterward they were offered to
George D. Smith	PERSON	, who told the man to return with them .

		Then Mr.
Smith	PERSON	called up the company and was asked to hold the man when he returned .

		Something frightened the salesman , however , who failed to appear .

		Mr.
Drake	PERSON	a short time ago purchased a library chiefly made up of ordinary books , but containing besides , a number of first editions of
John Dryden	PERSON	and a manuscript copy in
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	's autograph of his famous poem , `` Ballad of Reading Gaol . ''

		The manuscript has many corrections in
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's handwriting .

		Wilde manuscripts bring high prices .

		Full autograph letters signed by former Presi - dent
William H. Taft	PERSON	are rare .

		They command high prices at public auction .

		Most of his letters are typewritten , being simply signed by him .

		An ordinary one-page , autograph letter signed by him fetches at auction from
$ 25	MONEY	to
$ 35	MONEY	.

		A fine auto - graph letter of his has just been obtained by a col - lector .

		It is eight pages long , written entirely in Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's hand and addressed to former Justice
Charles E. Hughes	PERSON	.

		It relates to the present poli - tical campaign in
New York City	LOCATION	and mentions the name of
John Purroy Mitchel	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Taft	PERSON	wrote the letter because he was unable to attend a public dinner in
New York	LOCATION	.

		A duplicate of the letter was sent to Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	, the original passing into the possession of the autograph collector .

		The following unpublished letter by
Giuseppe Garibaldi	PERSON	, the Italian patriot , addressed to

Italy	LOCATION	, referring to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, has just come into the possession of
Gabriel Wells	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	: Caprera ,
March 27 , 1865	DATE	.

		Very dear Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	: The name of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, like that of Christ , marks the beginning of a glorious epoch in the history of humanity , and with pride I have per - petuated the name of the great Emancipator in my family .

		The press and the other enemies of his great Republic are like the asses of the fable who kicked the lion believing him dead , but today , when they see him arise in all his majesty , they change their language .

		The American question is a light of liberty for the world and will gladden the hearts of all hon - est men .

		I greet your wife with all affection and respect .

		Yours ,
G. Garibaldi	PERSON	.

		This letter was written less than three weeks before
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's assassination .

		In the
summer of 1861	DATE	Lincoln 's secretary of state ,
William H. Sew	PERSON	- ard , made an appeal to
Garibaldi	PERSON	to lend his sword to the

J. P. O. Eland	PERSON	's `` Li Hung Chang '' by
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their series of biographies , `` Makers of the

		Some years ago Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- neth Bell , a connection of the family interested in
G. Bell	ORGANIZATION	and Sons , of
London	LOCATION	, and a representative of
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	happened to be talking at dinner about some of the features of such note - worthy series as the `` American Statesmen '' and `` English Men of Letters , '' and the query arose as to whether the time was not ripe for another series of the same general standard to include a group of prominent figures in the nineteenth century who represented comparative vacancies in bibliographical lists .

		It was proposed that these makers of the nineteenth century should be treated as world fig - ures by having the life of each written by an enthusiastic student who was not a native of the country represented by the subject of the biography .

		Lord Charnwood 's `` Abraham Lincoln , '' recently published , shows the results of this reasoning .

		The volumes thus far arranged for are : ``
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, '' by
Basil Williams	PERSON	; `` Lord Shaftesbury , '' by

		The novel has been compared by leading literary critics with
George Eliot	PERSON	's `` Romola , '' with
Conrad	PERSON	's `` Nostromo , '' with
Winston Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, '' with Kipling s `` Kim , '' with
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's `` The White Company , '' with
Blackmore	PERSON	's ``
Lorna Doone	PERSON	. ''

		Here are in brief some of their judgments upon it : `` The Big Book of the Year . ''

		`` Pages of Enchantment . ''

		`` A Fine and Splendid Picture . ''

		Rare and fortunate is the novel that wins from critics such unanimous approval and such varied praise as the critical journals of
America	LOCATION	have given to `` El Supremo . ''

		`` It Comes Alive Under Our Eyes . ''

		`` It Enriches Our Literature . ''

		`` A Rare Kind of Novel . ''

		The Nation in a full page review said : '' 4 E1 Supremo ' is fiction upon the heroic scale and in something very like the grand manner ... The remarkable thing about this book is that with all its meticulousness of detail , with all its shifting kaleidoscope of scenes and incidents ... it does achieve the miracle ; it comes alive under our eyes , glows _ with life and color , shows the true depth and richness of heroic romance .

		... We are fain to submit the impressions of a powerful work of the imagination , a work of genius . ''

		The
New York Tribune	ORGANIZATION	declared that `` This is indeed _ a remarkable piece of work , picturesque as fiction and no less colorful as a page of prac - tically unknown American history , called the atmosphere `` enchanting , '' said that romance blooms everywhere under the eyes of parents and duennas , summed up the story as `` a vivid , com - prehensive picture of a period and a life gone beyond recall , '' and was sure that `` it will nold the attention of all who venture into the en - chantment of its opening pages . ''

		The
Chicago Daily News	ORGANIZATION	in the course of a third review recanted entirely a doubting opinion expressed in its first article : '' `
El Supremo	ORGANIZATION	is a royal character ; he needs room to rove in .

		If Mr.
White	PERSON	could not confine him to the one dimension of a short story , neither could we , nor do we wish it .

		And we prophesy soberly that our grandchildren will agree with us . ''

		The Dial , reviewing the novel at length and with hearty admiration , said that `` the author possesses a remarkable historical imagination and the book lives , and we live with it .

		The
New York Evening Poet	ORGANIZATION	in a long and appreciative review said : `` The book may fairly be described as extraordinary .

		For Mr.
Wnite	PERSON	has attempted the impossible and has almost achieved it .

		The amazing thing is that presenting this immense and bewildering kaleidoscope Mr.
White	PERSON	is able to give to his picture sweep and expanse , and at the same time to fill in the details so that it is aglow with life and color . ''

		But it is impossible to quote briefly from all the laudatory comment the book has received .

		The opinions above prove that the best literary judgment of this country agrees with the publishers of this novel , that it is without doubt the
Greatest American Historical Romance	ORGANIZATION	that has yet appeared .

		And certainly it would be difficult to find anywhere a more enchanting and exciting tale than this in which the reader lives , fascinated to the end , the life of gay and bright
Asuncion	LOCATION	under the rule of `` El Su - premo . ''

		432 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	A Suggestion to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	WE were sitting in the smoking compartment of a Pullman , hitched to a broken down , coughy engine that was jerking its way along the un - even tracks that parallelled the
St. Croiz River	LOCATION	.

		I had been up the
Grand Lake Streams	LOCATION	for a few weeks ' loaf , fishing , smoking , reading , thinking .

		As the engine labored along , the bleak , stubby remains of fine spruce forests on one side of it and the turgid , little river full of pulp wood on the other , I half closed my eyes and dreamily played a monstrous trout on a gossamer line .

		Just as I was about to land ray catch , the chap sitting opposite me remarked in the same matter of fact tone in which he might have said Good Evening !

		`` How can they do it for
sixty cents	MONEY	! ''

		He seemed perfectly sane , his gray eyes were steady and calm , so my first impulse to plead an engagement developed into the conventional `` I beg your pardon ? ''

		Preston continued , `` When I answered their first advertisement in The
New Republic	LOCATION	, I cheerfully anticipated getting
sixty cents	MONEY	' worth , if that some cheap , abridged , poorly edited book printed in eye-straining type on butcher 's manila .

		But when those two books came !

		Just think a 350 page copy of `` Thus Spake Zarathustra '' I had tried for months to get that last word of `` Kultur '' translated by
Thomas Common	PERSON	and with an intro - duction by
Frau Nietzsche	PERSON	, and a volume of the finest collection of 13 De Maupassant stories I 've ever seen , and I think I know my De Maupassant .

		I felt that I had cheated the publishers . ''

		Preston paused for breath I learned afterwards that he is an unusually taciturn man and before he could resume , I had opened my bag and fished out two charming limp croft leather volumes , `` The Way of All Flesh '' and `` The Mayor of Casterbridge '' with
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	's introduction .

		`` I thought you were a bit queer , at first , '' I said , `` but they say people are judged by the books they read , so we do n't need any other introduction . ''

		`` I should say not , ''
Preston	PERSON	exclaimed , `` collectors of the Modern Library do n't .

		Are n't they the most satis - fying companion volumes ever ? ''

		Just then the crazy engine grunted and pulled up at
Machias Junction	LOCATION	, where
Preston	PERSON	and I got out , stretched our legs and passed the time of night with a group of State of
Maine	LOCATION	lumber jacks .

		Preston told them the yarn about
Isaac Newton	PERSON	cutting a big hole and a small hole in the side of his barn so that both his big cat and her kittens could get out at night , and we could hear their appreciative guffaws as we settled down again to our pipes and our chat .

		I told
Preston	PERSON	a lot about the Modern Library that he did n't know .

		He had gotten only the first twelve titles .

		He let his pipe go out several times when I told him there were thirty volumes to be had for the same sixty cent price and that almost every one of the new titles had an introduction by such men as
Padraic Colum	PERSON	,
Alexander Harvey	PERSON	,
Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	, etc. , which some people thought alone worth the
sixty cents	MONEY	.

		I waxed eloquent and , before we thought of turning in for the
night	TIME	, had explained how The Modern Library had started with the idea of giving the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Public the very best in modern thought at as low a price as possible , and in a simple , attractive , con - venient form .

		It included books that had never been published in this country before , such as `` Married '' and `` A Miracle of St. Antony '' ; and out of print books ; that it bought from other publishers the right to reprint such worth-while books of contemporaneous interest `` Best sellers do n't mean entree to The Modern Library , '' I said , `` though ` The Best Russian Stories ' and ` The Way of All Flesh ' and ` Dorian Gray ' and several others have been reprinted several times in this edition '' `` Do you realize , '' said
Preston	PERSON	, `` that those fellows are doing something big ?

		Only one or two foreign publishers have attempted anything as fine as that Modern Library '' `` That 's just what
Gerould	PERSON	of The
Bellman	PERSON	,
William Marion Reedy	PERSON	and
Mencken	PERSON	and
Kerfoot	PERSON	and all the critics are saying , '' I answered .

		``
Clifford Smyth	PERSON	of the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, and he knows books , says : '' ` If real merit in typography , binding , convenience , and best of all subject matter , counts for anything , these books are certainly deserving of a fine measure of success .

		They fill a need that is not quite covered , so far as I have observed , by any other publication in the field just now . ' ''

		Preston exclaimed , `` Great heavens , man , I 'm a Modern Library fan myself , but you seem to remem - ber word for word what people say about it .

		They ought to have you on their pay roll . ''

		`` Well to tell you the truth , they have , '' I replied with somewhat of a sheepish grin , `` in fact I 'm one of the publishers of the
Modern Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		I would n't have started talking about it if you had n't wound me up , so you 'll have to excuse me , and '' `` Excuse you nothing , '' said
Preston	PERSON	, `` there ought to be an Act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	obliging everyone to read The Modern Library .

		I 'll call it square , though , if you give me one of your new lists , and have breakfast with me at the
Parker House	ORGANIZATION	in the morning . ''

		So we shook hands and a few minutes later , as I pulled the tan colored blanket over my legs , the poor old spavined engine gave an extra cough or two , and the last that I remember of that night is the vision of a gigantic trout , reading `` The Red Lily '' in a barn with two cats .

Btecussion	LOCATION	, anfc Htaformatum .

		The Case of the Professor and the
Public Interest Newspaper	ORGANIZATION	comment on late academic events at the
University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	and
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	reveals even more clearly than usual the split between the prevailing attitude inside and outside of university walls .

		To the general public practically every academic issue which gets upon the `` front page '' is one of freedom of teaching and speech .

		Reactions are condemnatory of administrative action if the editorial writer or the voluntary cor - respondent feels that there is danger of inquiry and discussion being stifled , espe - cially if a vivid imagination sees universi - ties being choked to death in the grip of capitalistic overlords .

		They are laudatory on equally general principles if the writer feels that teachers in universities are run - ning amuck with political and theological radicalism , or even are trying to enlighten their students as to the drift of modern radical thought instead of confining them - selves to inculcating well-established or - thodoxies of interpretation .

		Show me one who , as
Elihu Root	PERSON	said so naively about suffrage for women , `` looked into the mat - ter a great many years ago '' and came to a conclusion which he has never found reason for reopening , and I will show you one who deprecates the tendencies of pro- fessors to adopt half-baked opinions and who rejoices at every curb placed by the firm hand of authority upon irresponsible licentiousness of thought .

		See , passim , the editorial columns of the `` New York Times . ''

		Strangely enough , by contrast , one rarely finds the body of college teachers much excited about the free-speech issue .

		What it is concerned about is usually ques - tions of procedure , which ultimately turn upon the relative authority to be exercised by the trustees as legal employers and guardians and the faculty as representing immediate educational interests .

		The case of the faculty has never been better stated than by President
Schurman	PERSON	of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	apropos of the resignation of Professor Beard .

		Consequently I make no apology for quoting him at length , especially as his official position protects his account from the charge of being an expression of un - bridled professorial license .

		The American professor is apt to chafe at being under a board of trustees , which in his most critical moods he feels to be alien to the republic of science and letters .

		Even in his kindliest moods he can not think that board representative of the university .

		The university is an intellectual organization and the American professor wants the government of the university to conform to that essential fact .

		His indictment of the existing form of government is that it sets up and maintains an alien ideal , the ideal of a business corporation engaging professors as employees and controlling them by means of an absolute and irresponsible authority .

		The professor 's attitude is not so sen - sational as that of the public .

		It is less heroic than that of popular radicalism , which demands the thrill of combat , the plot of the oppressing villain and the mar - tyrdom of the oppressed victim .

		It turns largely on formal and technical questions , questions of procedure as may be seen in the report of
the Association of American Professors	ORGANIZATION	on the case of
Scott Nearing	PERSON	at
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a popular image of the association rush - ing to his rescue out of sympathy with radical views .

		As a matter of fact , the condemnation of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	author - ities was based essentially upon prosaic details of failure to define grounds , failure to allow a hearing , upon details of time and method of dismissal , with present - ment of collateral evidence that these ir - regularities of procedure were due to unacknowledged objections to the tenor of his economic doctrines .

		This case affords a reasonably fair symbol of the usual situ - ation .

		It is obvious that the professorial atti - tude is not one of itself to attain the dig - nity of the front page .

		It is too technical , not sufficiently dramatic and personal .

		It even readily lends itself to adverse and 436 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	unsympathetic statement .

		The professors are represented as animated by a narrow class spirit , bound together to protect one another at all hazards , and setting them - selves up as above the ordinary rules of responsibility to their superiors that is , their employers .

		Sympathies that might easily be gained by the war cry of infringe - ment of freedom of thought and teaching are dissipated or alienated when the case is rested so largely on formal grounds , when the struggle is revealed to be one for greater participation in university govern - ment .

		It may then be worth while to set forth the grounds on which teachers appeal for the sympathy and support of the public in what can readily be construed into a struggle for mere class privileges .

		President
Schurman	PERSON	stated the gist of the thing when he said that to the teacher the university is `` an intellectual organiza - tion , '' and that he wants the actual govern - ment of the university to conform to this fundamental fact .

		If anything lifts the effort of the teaching body from an attempt to advance personal and class pre - rogatives up to that of a public interest , it is , of course , just this fact .

		If security and responsibility of intellectual organi - zation are worth anything to the nation , then the professors ' efforts to get a respon - sible share in college control form a public service .

		If guarantees of the indepen - dence of the higher intellectual life of the nation from alien and sinister influences are worth anything to contemporary
America	LOCATION	, then professors are entitled to every meed of public support in their bat - tle against a situation which in the lan - guage of Professor Beard makes the status of the college teacher `` lower than that of the manual laborer who , through his union , has at least some voice in the terms and conditions of his employment . ''

		For until this voice can be obtained , the calling of promotion of intelligence in the nation remains unassured , precarious , imperfectly responsible .

		The case of the university teacher is simple .

		It is that the teaching body rep - resents and embodies that function of scholarship and research which is the essential life of the university , while law and precedent , surviving from a day when economic and intellectual conditions were radically different from those of the pres - ent , confer control upon a body of men `` alien to the republic of science and let - ters . ''

		He is only too well aware of the fact that legally the trustees -LRB- as in the words of the charter of
Columbia Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity -RRB- `` shall forever hereafter have full power and authority to direct the course of study and the discipline to be observed , '' and that he holds his position purely at `` the pleasure of the trustees . ''

		But he is also aware that these documents reflect the conditions of a century ago , when the modern university was as undreamed of on one side , as the modern big business corporation on the other .

		And when he is told that since he knew the conditions of his employment when he accepted his job , he is thereby estopped from complaint , his answer is not merely that trustees are far too wise to attempt to base their course consistently upon their legal authority , but also that his primary loyalty is to an idea , to a function and calling , to the advancement of learning and truth , and that it is his business as well as his right to struggle by every legiti - mate means to bring about a change in any situation which compromises the efficacy of his public calling .

		Nothing is more desirable than that the change should come about by a voluntary devolution of authority on the part of its legal possessors .

		But events demon - strate that the past policy of holding , for the most part , these powers in tacit abey - ance is rapidly becoming one of unstable equilibrium , and that the situation must be defined and clarified by an explicit con - ferring of authority upon the teaching body .

		If wisdom is lacking in high places to effect the change by voluntary abdica - tion , then the question which the teaching body will have to face is how far it is will - ing to become a body of place-holders and technical specialists immune from interfer - ence because it speaks in tongues not understood by the public .

		I have written of the question as it affects the college teacher because I am familiar with the question from that angle .

		But the issue affects the entire teaching body of all our schools .

		The spread of the movement to federate public-school teachers with trade -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 437 unions can not be understood except as a part of this larger issue .

		That portion of the public which deplores the fact that teachers resort to industrial unions for defence and support assumes , beyond all others , an obligation to recognize the concern of the public in the struggle of teachers to have a more responsible voice in the conduct of their work .

		In the end , it is the public , not the teachers nor their legal employers and regulators , whether in the university or in other schools , which will determine the settlement of the issue .

		It is not too much to say that the final issue is how much the American people cares about the integrity and responsibility of the intellectual life of the nation .

		JOHN DEWEY .

		An Apology for Crudity For a long time I have believed that crudity is an inevitable quality in the production of a really significant present - day American literature .

		How indeed is one to escape the obvious fact that there is as yet no native subtlety of thought or living among us ?

		And if we are a crude and childlike people how can our litera - ture hope to escape the influence of that fact ?

		Why indeed should we want it to escape ?

		If you are in doubt as to the crudity of thought in
America	LOCATION	, try an experiment .

		Come out of your offices , where you sit writing and thinking , and try living with us .

		Get on a train at
Pittsburg	LOCATION	and go west to the mountains of
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		Stop for a time in our towns and cities .

		Stay for a week in some
Iowa	LOCATION	corn-shipping town and for another week in one of the
Chicago	LOCATION	clubs .

		As you loiter about read our newspapers and listen to our conversa - tions , remembering , if you will , that as you see us in the towns and cities , so we are .

		We are not subtle enough to con - ceal ourselves and he who runs with open eyes through the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	may read the story of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		It is a marvelous story and we have not yet begun to tell the half of it .

		A little , I think I know why .

		It is because we who write have drawn ourselves away .

		We have not had faith in our people and in the story of our people .

		If we are crude and childlike , that is our story and our writing men must learn to dare to come among us until they know the story .

		The telling of the story depends , I be - lieve , upon their learning that lesson and accepting that burden .

		To my room , which is on a street near the loop in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	, come men who write .

		They talk and I talk .

		We are fools .

		We talk of writers of the old world and the beauty and subtlety of the work they do .

		Below us the roaring city lies like a great animal on the prairies , but we do not run out to the prairies .

		We stay in our rooms and talk .

		And so , having listened to talk and having myself talked overmuch , I grow weary of talk and walk in the streets .

		As I walk alone , an old truth comes home to me and I know that we shall never have an American literature until we return to faith in ourselves and to the facing of our own limitations .

		We must , in some way , become in ourselves more like our fellows , more simple and real .

		For surely it does not follow that be - cause we Americans are a people without subtlety , we are a dull or uninteresting people .

		Our literature is dull , but we are not .

		One remembers how Dostoevsky had faith in the simplicity of the Rus - sians and what he achieved .

		He lived and he expressed the life of his time and people .

		The thing that he did brings hope of achievement for our men .

		But let us first of all accept certain truths .

		Why should we Americans aspire to a subtlety that belongs not to us but to old lands and places ?

		Why talk of intellectuality and of intellectual life when we have not accepted the life that we have ?

		There is death on that road and following it has brought death into much of American writing .

		Can you doubt what I say ?

		Consider the smooth slickness of the average magazine story .

		438 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	There is often great subtlety of plot and phrase , but there is no reality .

		Can such work live ?

		The answer is that the most popular magazine story or novel does not live in our minds for a month .

		And what are we to do about it ?

		To me it seems that as writers we shall have to throw ourselves with greater daring into the life here .

		We shall have to begin to write out of the people and not for the people .

		We shall have to find within our - selves a little of that courage .

		To con - tinue along the road we are travelling is unthinkable .

		To draw ourselves apart , to live in little groups and console our - selves with the thought that we are achiev - ing intellectuality , is to get nowhere .

		By such a road we can hope only to go on producing a literature that has nothing to do with life as it is lived in these
United States	LOCATION	.

		To be sure , the doing of the thing I am talking about will not be easy .

		Amer - ica is a land of objective writing and thinking .

		New paths will have to be made .

		The subjective impulse is almost unknown to us .

		Because it is close to life , it works out into crude and broken forms .

		It leads along a road that such American masters of prose as
James	PERSON	and
Howells	PERSON	did not want to take , but if we are to get anywhere , we shall have to travel that road .

		The road is rough and the times are pitiless .

		Who , knowing our
America	LOCATION	and understanding the life in our towns and cities , can close his eyes to the fact that life here is for the most part an ugly affair ?

		As a people we have given our - selves to industrialism , and industrialism is not lovely .

		If anyone can find beauty in an American factory town , I wish he would show me the way .

		For myself , I can not find it .

		To me , and I am living in in - dustrial life , the whole thing is as ugly as modern war .

		I have to accept that fact and I believe a great step forward will have been taken when it is more gen - erally accepted .

		But why , I am asked , is crudity and ugliness necessary ?

		Why can not a man like Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	write in the spirit of the early Americans , why can not he see fun in life ?

		What we want is the note of health .

		In the work of
Mark Twain	PERSON	there was something wholesome and sweet .

		Why can not the modern man be also wholesome and sweet ?

		To this I make answer that to me a man , say like Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, is wholesome .

		He is true to something in the life about him , and truth is always wholesome .

		Twain and
Whitman	PERSON	wrote out of an - other age , out of an age and a land of forests and rivers .

		The dominant note of American life in their time was the noisy , swaggering raftsman and the hairy - breasted woodsman .

		To-day it is not so .

		The dominant note in American life to - day is the factory hand .

		When we have digested that fact , we can begin to ap - proach the task of the present-day novel - ist with a new point of view .

		It is , I believe , self-evident that the work of the novelist must always lie some - what outside the field of philosophic thought .

		Your true novelist is a man gone a little mad with the life of his times .

		As he goes through life he lives , not in him - self , but in many people .

		Through his brain march figures and groups of figures .

		Out of the many figures , one emerges .

		If he be at all sensitive to the life about him and that life be crude , the figure that emerges will be crude and will crudely express itself .

		I do not know how far a man may go on the road of subjective writing .

		The matter , I admit , puzzles me .

		There is something approaching insanity in the very idea of sinking yourself too deeply into modern American industrial life .

		But it is my contention that there is no other road .

		If one would avoid neat , slick writing , he must at least attempt to be brother to his brothers and live as the men of his time live .

		He must share with them the crude expression of their lives .

		To our grandchildren the privilege of at - tempting to produce o school of American writing that has delicacy and color may come as a matter of course .

		One hopes that will be true , but it is not true now .

		And that is why , with so many of the younger Americans , I put my faith in the modern literary adventurers .

		We shall , I am sure , have much crude , blundering American writing before the gift of beauty and subtlety in prose shall honestly belong to us .


SHERWOOD ANDERSON	PERSON	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 439 The Structure of Lasting ` Peace II THE `` PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITY '' : `` NATURAL RIGHTS '' AND THE EVOCATION OF NATIONALITY That nationality is a principle is a dis - covery comparatively recent .

		Its appro - priation by dynasts , by hereditary and military oligarchs , and by traders , priests , and politicians is little more recent .

		Nationality was a fact before it became a principle , and it was an unrecognized con - dition before it became a fact .

		Before nations were , there were dynasties or states , that is , associations of men and women working out their lives generation after generation in service and obedience to masters whose claim rested on force , tradition , and superstition .

		Who , particu - larly , these masters were , that exploited their persons and property , was a matter of indifference to the masses of
Christian Europe	LOCATION	throughout the greater part of
Europe	LOCATION	's history .

		And even more indif - ferent was it to the classes , whom they exploited .

		Lands and people changed owners as the toll of successful military piracy or as marriage portions , and the changes were regarded as part of the necessity that is resident in the nature of things .

		And necessity , as everybody nowa - days has been assured , knows no law .

		Nevertheless , this necessity began , on the whole and in the long run , to get abro - gated .

		Its power of constituting the nature of things began to fail .

		The nature of things was altering , and the force bring - ing about the miraculous alteration was the force of nationality .

		Nationality itself , however , is no miracle , no artefact .

		It also is an aspect and constituent of the nature of things , long merely implicit and asleep , awakened by democracy to power and to efficacy .

		The awakening was slow and indirect .

		Remote beginnings accrue to it from the religious reformation which removed the seat of religious authority from the head of a church to the heart of each member of the church ; a nearer cause was removal of the seat of sovereignty from the head of the state to the citizenry of the state , the Puritan Revolution accom - plishing this in fact by the trial and execu - tion of the Cavalier king , proving thereby that the divinity which hedges about a king makes him none the less amenable to the laws of men , when men choose to assert themselves .

		The act was defended by opposing to the doctrine of the `` divine right of kings '' the doctrine of the natural rights of man , and when the French Revo - lution , a century and more later , repeated the act , the doctrine had become common - place .

		Our Declaration of Independence pronounces its essence : God had created all men equal and had endowed them `` with certain inalienable rights . ''

		These , as against the dynastic privilege , had come to be taken as the necessity immanent in the nature of things .

		Necessarily , hence , the inequalities among men of class , of sta - tion , of privilege , of right , of property , of virtue were contrary to the nature of things , artifices , inventions of priests and kings to perpetuate their rule .

		According to natural law and natural right all men are alike and all men are good ; abolish class and privilege and you automatically abolish injustice and evil .

		So argued
Rousseau	PERSON	, so all the eighteenth-century prophets of natural right .

		`` You are as good as your betters , and your betters are no better than they should be .

		Sovereignty is everybody 's and everybody is equal . ''

		This teaching , though it may contradict the facts of life , is so near to the hopes of men , that men took it at once to heart .

		The Polish shlakta , whose indifference to the common good had made
Poland	LOCATION	the easy victim of the Prussian conspiracy against her , learned to think of the whole of
Poland	LOCATION	, peasantry , customs , and institu - tions , as the peer of her destroyers .

		The British colonies of
North America	LOCATION	effected their momentous revolution .

		The masses of
France	LOCATION	brought theirs to its epoch - making culmination .

		Under the inspira - tion of the democratic idea societies of men were acting collectively , autonomously , and with full consciousness of what they were doing , against dynasty , property , and authority , and all that these imply in ownership and command .

		The beneficiar - ies of these took natural alarm .


Prussia	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	also , combined against the people of
France	LOCATION	.

		But only to 440 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	find that their armies melted away , that their subjects everywhere celebrated the coming of the French soldier as the coming of the liberator .

		The republican form of government followed the French army in fact , as trade follows the flag in military - capitalistic fancy .

		Dynasts , anxious to maintain their prestige , found themselves compelled to defer to the free good-will of their subjects .

		Continental state-organiza - tion appeared to be getting turned down-side up .

		The people were in fact becoming the sovereign .

		That is , they were becoming conscious , in trying to respond to the call of the revo - lution , of what nature and habit and hope they and their neighbors were , and of how these were expressed in language and tradition , in memory and custom , in all that makes up a community 's cycle of life .

		The revolutionary call to Equality meant , for the daily life , the abolition of all the caste and property distinctions that the Russians have discarded to-day .

		The Revolution 's call to Fraternity meant , for the daily life , comradeship on an equal basis with anyone with whom communica - tion could be effectively held with the neighbor , that is , near at hand , who speaks the same language and has the same back - ground , who , by virtue of this sameness , understands .

		The Revolution 's call to Liberty meant , first and foremost , the overthrow of the traditional oppressor at home , and the achievement there of self - government , the replacing of dynasty by commonwealth .

		Had the new French nation continued to treat the peoples its armies set free as peers , as fellow-citizens , not as subjects ; had
Napoleon	PERSON	not once more restored piratical imperialism to the place from which the ideas of the Revolution had driven it , the ruling caste of
Europe	LOCATION	could never have succeeded in duping their sub - jects into believing in the identity of their interests and the community of their cause .

		Even so , their success depended on a con - cession to the principle that sovereignty rests in the people .

		For the call to resist
Napoleon	PERSON	had to be made through an appeal to self-appreciation , through a propaganda , sometimes inspired , some - times spontaneous , exhorting the various peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	to consider the excel - lence and dignity of their ancestries , their cults , their traditions , their histories , their ways of living , their arts , and particularly their languages .

		The most conspicuous continental instance of such a propaganda is the series of `` Addresses to the German People '' by the philosopher Fichte .

		The outcome of this movement of ideas and events was nationality .

		As the doctrine that the people is the sovereign spread , it made them conscious of the quality of their life , their memories , and their institutions wherein consists their unity as a people .

		The need of resistance to a common foe deepened the sense of this unity , and rendered the elements which are its form objects more precious to be preserved than life itself .

		Among these elements a sovereign government is not to be found : a nationality is not a state , and may exist without any political individuality what - ever , as do the Scotch and Welsh and Irish nationalities in
England	LOCATION	, or the Italian and French and German in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, or the Bohemian , Croat , Czech , and Serb - ian in
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, or the
Ukrain	LOCATION	- ian or Polish or Finnish in
Russia	LOCATION	, or the Jewish there and everywhere .

		A single nationality may be distributed among many states , as are the Jews and the Poles ; many nationalities may compose one state , as
Great Britain	LOCATION	is composed , or
Turkey	LOCATION	, or
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	.

		Nor , again , is a nationality a nation , for a nation is a nationality possessed of political sover - eignty and animated by political purposes with regard to other nations , which it is free to carry out .


Hungary	LOCATION	is a nation ;
Bohemia	LOCATION	is not ;
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	is not .

		England is a nation ;
Ireland	LOCATION	is not .

		Ger - many is a nation ;
Bavaria	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	are not .


France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	are nations ; Rus - sia is not .

		All are nationalities , plural or singular .

		States exist wherever govern - ment controls nationalities for its own pur - poses without regard to the will and preference of the nationalities .

		Nations ex - ist where the purposes of government are the expression and execution of the will of the people .

		Nationality is the basis and material of both states and nations .

		It exists potentially wherever human beings are associated in durable groups , through
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 441 instinctive media of association .

		It be - comes actual whenever the members of the group become aware of the history and form of this association , reverence its past , and hope for its future .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		Garden Dream They cried before my gate at morning-mirth , `` Come out and help us burn the weeds from earth ! ''

		But I was planting out my garden-close With wands of lily and with slips of rose , And their scented wavings made the air so sweet That I could not listen to their trampling feet ... -LRB- Yet there blew a perfume from the garden-bed That changed the evil weeds to white and red ! -RRB-

		They cried before my gate at noontide-breath , `` Come out help us hush the dance of death ! ''

		But I was dancing in a woodland ring With brown wood-women for my partnering , And fauns that fluted till the green glades rang , And all I heard was what the wood-birds sang ... -LRB- Yet there came a music from the wood-folk 's flute That made the drums of evil dancing mute ! -RRB-

		They cried before my gate at sweet of
night	TIME	, `` Come out and help us scourge the black world white ! ''

		But I was weaving me a golden gown All strung with silver ribbons up and down , With moon-white laces that should foam and

		\ And every poor man had a garden-close With wands of lilies and with slips of rose , And every poor child danced the woodlands through And sang and fluted merry songs he knew , And every woman had a golden gown Gay-strung with silver ribbons up and down , And we all went singing how the world is fair And warm the

		MARGARET WIDDEMER .

		Literary Affairs in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		One of the wittiest Parisian papers , `` GEuvre , '' said
this morning	TIME	that readers of newspapers who took the trouble to go right to the end of their papers yesterday would have found a British vic - tory on the last page .

		This exactly hits off the position to which the military operations are now relegated in public opinion and in the press .

		No - body thinks or talks of anything but the latest scandals ; the Bolo affair , the Turmel affair , the Almereyda-Duval affair fill most of the small space to which the newspapers are reduced by the paper famine .

		Of all the present `` affairs , '' that in which
M. Paul Bolo	PERSON	is concerned is by far the most im - portant , both as regards the sums of money in - volved and the position of the newspapers and the individuals more or less compromised .

		The `` Bonnet Rouge , '' which is involved in the Al - mereyda-Duval case , was -LRB- it is at present sus - pended -RRB- an evening paper with a very small circulation and no influence .

		Almereyda , its ed - itor , who died in prison soon after his arrest , in circumstances not yet cleared up and never likely to be , was an adventurer almost worthy of Bal - zac , who had few scruples but against whom there was not the smallest evidence of treason .

		The charge against him was the merely technical one only possible on account of the existence of martial law of `` detaining documents interest - ing the national defence , '' a charge which could be successfully brought against every newspaper - editor in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Duval , who was the manager of the paper , in which he had invested rather less than
$ 40,000	MONEY	, is accused of having had rela - tions with the enemy , but on account of the secrecy with which French judicial investigations are conducted , it is impossible as yet to say what evidence there is for the charge .

		The smallness of the sums with which he dealt is in itself a reason for doubting whether he was really an agent of
Germany	LOCATION	; it may turn out that it is merely a case of trading with the enemy .

		It is assumed that he gave money to the `` Bonnet Rouge '' to promote `` pacifist '' propaganda , but there was little evidence of such propaganda in the paper ; indeed , the existence of the censorship would make it impossible for any French paper to demand peace at any price .


Almereyda	PERSON	, in the course of his chequered career , had been a revolutionary anarchist , but from the beginning of the war his paper received a subsidy of
$ 1600	MONEY	442 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	a month from the government , a circumstance which led him greatly to modify his opinions .

		The chief interest of the Turmel affair is to be found in the fact that
M. Turmel	PERSON	is a dep - uty .

		At present all that is known is that the sum of
$ 5000	MONEY	in Swiss bank-notes was found in his cupboard at the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the possession of the bank-notes of a neutral country is not in itself a legal offence and , but for
M. Tunnel	ORGANIZATION	's own inconsistent explanations , it is probable that nothing would ever have been heard of the matter .

		Bolo Pasha -LRB- he was given that title by the ex-khedive
Abbas Hilmi	PERSON	-RRB- is in a very different case .

		It is officially announced that a large sum was paid to his account in certain American banks by the
Dresdener Bank	ORGANIZATION	.

		He supplied last year more than
$ 1,000,000	MONEY	to
M. Charles Hum	PERSON	- bert for the `` Journal , '' he holds half the shares in the company that owns the `` Rappel , '' and among other papers in which he has a financial interest are said to be the `` Paris-Midi , '' the `` Cri de
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB- a satirical weekly -RRB- , and `` La Revue , '' of which
M. Jean Finot	PERSON	is the editor .

		Bolo had a large circle of influential friends , including the President of the Republic and
M. Monier	PERSON	, first president of the
Court of Appeal	ORGANIZATION	and the second judicial functionary of
France	LOCATION	.

		The latter has been called upon by the government to account for his relations with Bolo before
the Court of Cassation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bolo 's friendship with
M. Poincare	PERSON	caused him to be entrusted with more than one official mission abroad and he travelled with a diplomatic passport .

		One of the most interesting circumstances in the case is that the papers financed by Bolo are all extremely jingo in politics .

		The `` Journal '' advocates war to the bitter end and has made a campaign for more `` cannons and munitions '' ; the `` Rappel '' is the special organ of the party that demands the annexation to
France	LOCATION	of all the German territory on the left bank of the
Rhine	LOCATION	.

		If , therefore ,
M. Bolo	PERSON	's money in fact came from the German government , it is evi - dent that the latter desires to encourage the ex - tremists in
France	LOCATION	that demand the continuation of the war until the Allies are in a position to impose humiliating conditions that will perma - nently cripple
Germany	LOCATION	.

		This would be an intelligent policy on the part of the German gov - ernment , for those extremists and their organs in the press enable the government to persuade the German people that they are defending their very existence , and that the extravagant demands of the Allies are responsible for the continuance of the war .

		Two years ago the German gov - ernment had a translation made of several of
M. Maurice Barres	ORGANIZATION	's articles in the `` Echo de
Paris	LOCATION	'' and circulated them throughout
Germany	LOCATION	;
M. Barres	PERSON	also demanded the annexation of all the left bank of the Rhine and the annihilation of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The new ministry the fifth since the war does not seem to be very popular either in Par - liament or in the country ; but ministries that have a cool reception sometimes last longer than those received with enthusiasm .

		The prime min - ister
M. Painleve	PERSON	is personally popular and has the advantage of being a new man , for he had never held office before
1915	DATE	, but the composi - tion of his cabinet is criticized and it is generally considered to be too large and unwieldy .

		He himself , it is believed , would have preferred to form a ministry of the Left , but
M. Poincare	PERSON	persuaded him to include such politicians as MM .

		Ribot ,
Barthou	LOCATION	, and
Doumer	PERSON	, who represent con - servative Republican opinion .

		For the first time since the war the government includes no Social - ist .

		The Socialist party is sharply divided on the question of ministerial participation ; what is known as the `` minoritaire '' section objects to it altogether and refused to take part in the nego - tiations with
M. Painleve	PERSON	.

		The `` majoritaire , '' or governmental , section would still agree to be represented in the government on certain condi - tions , but they objected on the one hand to the inclusion of MM .

		Ribot ,
Barthou	LOCATION	, and
Doumer	PERSON	and , on the other hand , they were not satisfied with the portfolios offered them by
M. Painleve	PERSON	.

		M.
Albert Thomas	PERSON	, in particular , would accept no office but the ministry of foreign affairs or that of war , whereas
M. Painleve	PERSON	asked him to remain at the ministry of armaments .

		The whole question of ministerial participa - tion , so far as the Socialist party is concerned , will be decided at the national congress of the party , which is to meet at
Bordeaux	LOCATION	on
October 6	DATE	.

		The question of peace negotiations will also be discussed at the congress ; the `` minoritaires '' have drawn up a resolution in favor of such negotiations at the earliest possible moment , in - deed the terms of the resolution suggest that , in their opinion , the moment has already arrived .

		Until May the two sections of the party were divided also on the question of resuming inter - national relations , but that difference no longer exists ; the party is now \ innnimous in desiring to take part in the proposed
Stockholm	LOCATION	confer -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 443 ence and both sections declare in their resolutions their intention to use every effort to obtain the passports for
Stockholm	LOCATION	which the late ministry refused to issue .

		Art has languished since the war ; the younger artists are at the front or are among the host of killed , there has been a terrible loss of prom - ising talent , and their elders for the most part , not having the heart to work in their studios , have found occupation in connection with the war .

		There are exceptions :
M. Maurice Favre	PERSON	, a sculptor of great attainments , has recently fin - ished a marble bust of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, remark - able alike for its qualities as a work of art and its success as a psychological study .

		He is now in
Italy	LOCATION	, where he is engaged on busts of
Gabriele d'Annunzio	PERSON	and
General Cadorna	ORGANIZATION	.

		The event of
last month	DATE	was the death of
Degas	LOCATION	.

		He had already passed out of active life , for on account of his failing eyesight , he had not touched a brush for thirteen or fourteen years ; when he could no longer paint , he amused himself by mak - ing figures in wax of dancers , which he intended for cires-perdues , but I do not think that any reached the stage of bronze .

		For the last few months he had been confined to his room , but he suffered from nothing except old age and he grad - ually went out like a burned-down candle .

		The end came one night quite naturally and pain - lessly ; as one of his relatives said to me , `` he never saw death , '' of which he had an almost morbid dread .

		It can hardly be disputed that one of the greatest artists of the nineteenth century has dis - appeared .

		Degas is often called an `` impression - ist , '' but the term as applied to him is inaccurate and he himself protested against the description .

		His technique was never that of the impression - ists properly so-called , although he took part in all their exhibitions from
1874	DATE	to
1886	DATE	.

		He himself asserted , perhaps not quite seriously , that he was the artistic descendant of Ingres ; his first master ,
Lamothe	PERSON	, for whom
Degas	PERSON	had all his life an immense admiration , had been a pupil of Ingres .

		But , although
Degas	PERSON	was , like In - gres , above all a master of line , and although his art was a natural development of the great French tradition , he broke loose at a very early age from the fetters of academic convention by which
Ingres	ORGANIZATION	was hampered , and , in my opinion , was a far greater artist than his adopted ances - tor and that is saying much .

		He was influ - enced both by the great Italians -LRB- during the two years that he spent at
Rome	LOCATION	in early youth study - ing without a master , he did little else than copy them -RRB- and by the impressionists , and was inter - ested above all in light and movement .

		Pastel was the medium that he preferred to all others and , in my opinion , he was the greatest pastel - list that the world has yet known ; I dare to put him even above
Perronneau	LOCATION	and Latour .

		The French government , which has bought so many bad pictures , never purchased a work of
Degas	LOCATION	, he felt the slight deeply , but the
Louvre	LOCATION	has now a representative selection of some of his best paintings and pastels , thanks to the posthumous generosity of
Count Isaac de Camondo	ORGANIZATION	.

		Degas has left no `` school '' ; his only real pupil was an American ,
Miss Cassatt	PERSON	, but Toulouse-Lautrec , of course , owed much to his influence .

		I have left myself no space to speak of litera - ture , but there is not much to be said on that subject at present .

		The majority of books pub - lished are concerned with the war and few have much value .

		The great success of the year a success entirely deserved has been `` Le Feu '' of
M. Henri Barbusse	PERSON	, a description of modern war as it really is by a man who has experienced it and , being an artist , is able to record his expe - riences in a work of great literary qualities .

		All the fighting men that I know agree that it is the only truthful book about the war .

		Its sale has been greater than that of the most successful works of Zola at the height of his fame in the same period ; it has been translated into English -LRB- `` Under Fire , ''
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- and also , without the permission of its author , into German .

		Another book of a very different kind relating rather to the future peace than to the war itself is `` Les Bases d'une Paix durable , '' by
M. August Schvan	PERSON	-LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	;
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , of which an American edition is , I understand , shortly to be published .

		It is an extraordinarily original and independent contribution to the study of future international relations ;
M. Schvan	PERSON	aims at getting rid of diplo - macy and foreign politics altogether and his solu - tion reduces enormously the functions of the state .

		It seems to me both promising and prac - ticable , given the will to put it into practice , but it is intensely revolutionary and makes hay of established conventions and traditions .

		The season has given us one really remarkable play , `` Les Noces d'Argent , '' by
M. Paul Ger	PERSON	- aldy , a young author who had the honor of getting this his first dramatic work produced at the
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	; but I must defer any comment on it .

		444 THE DIAL -LSB-
November	DATE	8 Tendencies in Modern American ` Poetry TENDENCIES IN MODERN AMERICAN POETRY .

		By
Amy Lowell	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	, who alternates actively between the creative and the excgctical , has paused in her poetry to write of a half-dozen of her American fellow-poets .

		Each of her studies carries with it not only a critical estimate of the subject 's work , but also a sufficing amount of fresh biographical matter and a portrait not yet familiar to the public eye .

		Though the `` new movement '' has come chiefly within the past five years or so ,
Miss Lowell	PERSON	finds among her six selected poets representatives of three phases or stages ; and this subdivision works advantageously to the architectonics of her volume .

		In her first stage
Edwin Arlington Robinson	PERSON	and
Robert Frost	ORGANIZATION	represent the earliest breaking down of tradition the slow fading of the fundamental beliefs upon which a particular civilization was reared , though the results of these beliefs still retain their hold upon the people brought up on them .

		The second stage is repre - sented by
Edgar Lee Masters	ORGANIZATION	and , in some measure , by
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	: beliefs are now so much a thing of the past that they have no power to mould character , and the result , for the moment , is a sort of mental chaos , tending to cynicism and even to despair .

		In the third stage the old beliefs have been left completely behind by new ones ; men are living upon other planes of thought and are able to turn their attention to other things to Beauty , for ex - ample .

		This last and crowning stage is repre - sented to
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	by her fellow imagists , `` H. D. '' and
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	.

		In the first stage , beauty is a thing remem - bered ; it has still a haunting power .

		In the second , it is crowded out by the stress of travail by the birth pangs of the new .

		In the third , it is rediscovered , regained ; and it is intoxicating : we are as like as not to find ourselves in the midst of `` sea gardens , '' and `` lacquered man - darin moments , '' and `` vermilion pavilions , '' and `` jade balustrades . ''

		It happens that three of these poets , one for each of
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	's stages , has written of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		She utilizes the three pro- ductions to drive her point home concretely .

		Thus ,
Robinson	PERSON	presents Lincoln as part man , part symbol , slightly conventionalized , and a little remote and cold : For he , to whom we had applied Our shopman 's test of age and worth , Was elemental when he died , As he was ancient at his birth : The saddest among kings of earth , Bowed with a galling crown , this man Met rancor with a cryptic mirth , Laconic and Olympian .

		Masters makes Lincoln a man first of all , but a man typifying a national aspiration ; yet , how - ever venerated and loved , always a man neither conventionalized by tradition nor lifted into the realm of legend .

		`` Out of me , '' says
Ann Rutledge	PERSON	The vibrations of deathless music ; '' With malice toward none , with charity for all . ''

		Out of me the forgiveness of millions toward millions , And the beneficent face of a nation Shining with justice and truth .

		Fletcher raises
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	to the rank of `` pure symbol , as elusive and pervading as a brooding god '' raises him , indeed , `` to the veiled awe of a national legend '' : There was a darkness in this man : an immense and hollow darkness , Of which we may not speak , nor share with him , nor enter .

		He whom we mocked and obeyed not , he whom we scorned and mistrusted , He has descended , like a god , to his rest .

		Strew over him flowers ... rayed , violet , dim , With the nails that pierced , the cross that he bore and the circlet ; And beside it there lay also one lonely snow - white magnolia , Bitter for remembrance of the healing which has passed .

		Fletcher , it should be understood , is the son of a Confederate veteran .

		Such things perhaps represent the `` new poetry '' at its highest , as regards theme and manner .

		Other phases , of course , produce other effects , shock , bewilderment , protest .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	now and then protests on her own ac - count .

		Though it is the property and the privilege of a new school to believe in itself even to the exclusion of countenance for all other schools , past and future still one may dis - criminate .

		If she praises with heartiness she chides with keenness .

		Her exceptions are taken with the disconcerting candor , the unsparing lucidity of criticism that so often are shown within a narrow domestic circle .

		She perceives the limitations of `` H. D. '' in her Greek modes .

		She scores the sex-obsession of `` Spoon River , '' and the undisciplined diffuseness of its successors .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 445 She protests the verbal virtuosities of an un - chastened Fletcher : though she seems to regard him as the crown of the movement , his over - exuberance is against him ; and , like Masters , he lacks the selective instinct .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	rises gallantly to
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	.

		The world knows her biography ; and through her it may now know his .

		Were two people ever more unlike in origin , tradition , and experience ?

		Yet a common danger and a common faith unite the little band ; all worldly differences disappear before the lions .

		She apprehends
Sandburg	PERSON	as the spokesman of the new `` multi-racial '' Amer - ica : `` It is he and his ilk who are moving us away from our Anglo-Saxon inheritance , '' and who `` bring us the points of view which are working so surely , if insidiously , upon the whole body of the people . ''

		Miss
Lowell	LOCATION	, herself some - thing of an adventurer and propagandist , seems willing enough to be moved on .

		Our population is `` a crazy-quilt , '' true ; `` but how strong is that Anglo-Saxon ground-work which holds them all firmly to its shape , if no longer to its color ! ''

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	finds her Anglo-Saxon account in
Robinson	PERSON	and in
Robert Frost	LOCATION	.

		The latter was born in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, but was claimed by
Massachusetts	LOCATION	at the age of ten , and has since been a dweller on that
New England	LOCATION	country - side which he celebrates so closely and narrowly .

		In fact ,
Frost	ORGANIZATION	has become as `` down East '' as pumpkin pie .

		Many of his pieces , in their tempo and their turn-out not always , by any means , in their subject !

		have some of the bland , self - containing rotundity of that sectional dish , and possibly something of its soggy undercrust ; often , too , an insufficient measure of ginger makes the savor tame .

		But his commentator feels that he wins by his gentle understanding and his strong and unsentimental power of emotion , though his imagination is bounded by his life , and though he is `` bent all one way , like the windblown trees of
New England	LOCATION	hillsides . ''

		Yet , after all , art is rooted in the soil ; many besides Miss
Lowell	PERSON	feel Frost 's effect of quiet solidity and reality ; so we must allow her to compare him with
Burns	PERSON	,
Synge	PERSON	, and Mistral and to rank him with them in the opinion of future generations .

		Yet , in the end ,
Amy Lowell	PERSON	's heart is with the imagists they are the end to which the whole new creation moves .

		She analyzes with fond minuteness the brief , staccato-cadenced pieces of `` H. D. , '' reproducing in this connection the `` brief list of tenets '' on which the imagist poets are mutually agreed , and summarizing it thus : Simplicity and directness of speech ; subtlety and beauty of rhythms ; individualistic freedom of idea ; clearness and vividness of pre - sentation ; concentration ; and for an after thought suggestion .

		But concentration most of all : `` that is of the very essence of poetry . ''

		New rules and principles here ?

		she asks .

		By no means , she answers .

		And who shall say her nay ?

		Well , in her `` Tendencies in Modern Ameri - can Poetry ''
Miss Lowell	PERSON	is emphatically `` there '' ; there in heart , mind , and spirit ; there with her faith and her reasons for it ; there with her polemical aptitudes and her full employment of them ; on the spot , up to date , with her eye on the poetical clock , to the last second of the latest minute .

		But a clock has been known to strike thirteen and she has left out Vachel Lindsay .

		Who is more of our own land and of our own day ?

		Think of the whirr , the clang , the whole resonant jubilee !

		Has too strong a regard for architectonic symmetry excluded the tall , loud clock from the furnishings of the
House of Present-Day Poetry	ORGANIZATION	?

		Is so joyous and hearty a fellow really to be ranked as a `` popu - larizer '' of the movement led by
Sandburg	PERSON	and Masters ?

		Twin Prophets of Platitude and Paradox HEART TO HEART APPEALS .

William Jennings Bryan	PERSON	.

$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Is CIVILIZATION A DISEASE ?

		By
Stanton Coit	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		`` A speech , '' says Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	, `` may be dis - puted , even a sermon may not convince . ''

		I do not doubt that he speaks out of a wide and varied experience , and I hope that he will not be too much disappointed if opinion finds these heart - to-heart appeals of his a scrapbook of unconvinc - ing sermons and disputable speeches .

		Even so , they offer an answer , striking in its unanimity with Mr.
Stanton Coit	PERSON	's own , to the remarkable question : Is Civilization a Disease ?

		The question is not original with Mr.
Coit	PERSON	.

		He once `` deigned , '' he tells us , to read a book by that genius and sage ,
Edward Carpenter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Carpenter calls this book `` Civilization , its Cause and Cure , '' and the reading led Mr.
Coit	PERSON	at once to take sides against civilization .

		What he means by civilization , however , is not what is usually meant by the term .

		Usually we mean 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	by civilization the positive contributions of hu - man effort through human institutions to the enrichment and liberation of the powers of man .

		Civilization is a word of eulogy .

		But the clever Mr.
Coit	PERSON	uses it as a word of condemnation .

		Quite in the inverted way of Mr.
Gilbert Ches	PERSON	- terton , Mr.
Coit	PERSON	makes the word civilization mean the defects and evil generated by human institutions .

		Civilization begins , he says , `` with the crack of the whip '' ; it rests upon slaves and women ; and history is the record of a conflict between man and it .

		On the side of man are Christ ,
St. Francis	LOCATION	,
Savonarola	LOCATION	,
Wycliffe	LOCATION	, Lu - ther ,
John Wesley	PERSON	,
Rousseau	PERSON	and company ,
Karl Marx	PERSON	,
Peter Kropotkin	PERSON	, and Mr.
Coit	PERSON	.

		The Reverend
William Sunday	PERSON	, Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	are not mentioned .

		The omission of the two former is intelligible , for if civilization is , as Mr.
Coit	PERSON	declares , `` the incarnation of self-interest , '' their indifference to civilization is not beyond dispute .

		But to leave Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	out unless it be that Mr.
Coit	PERSON	has read `` Heart to Heart Appeals '' !

		If he has , he must have been thrown into a state of perplexity , for these appeals are made now in behalf of man , and again in behalf of civilization .

		Thus : `` The Darwinian theory rep - resents man as reaching his present perfection -LSB- i. e. , what Mr.
Coit	PERSON	means by civilization -RSB- by the operation of the law of hate the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak ... If man links himself in generations with the monkey , it then becomes an important question whether he is going toward him or com - ing from him and I have seen them going in both directions .

		I do not know of any argument that can be used to prove that man is an im - proved monkey that may not be used just as well to prove that the monkey is a degenerate man , and the latter theory is more plausible than the former . ''

		`` Miracle of miracles is man . ''

		Again , speaking of the present unpleasantness in
Europe	LOCATION	, Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	says : `` There must be a cause and it must be a human cause , for no one who loves God would ever blame Him for this inhuman war . ''

		Man , evidently , is in Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	's opinion no better than he should be , but his civilization is a perfection particularly the civilization of
America	LOCATION	.

		Thus : Standing upon the vantage-ground already gained the American people can aspire to a grander destiny than has opened before any other race .

		Anglo-Saxon civilization has taught the individual to protect his own rights .

		American civilization will teach him to respect the rights of others .

		Anglo-Saxon civilization has taught the individual to take care of himself .

		American civilization , proclaiming the equality of all before the Jaw , will teach him that his own highest good requires the observance of the commandment : `` Thou ` halt love thy neighbor as thyself . ''


Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	civilization has , by force of arms , applied the art of government to other races for the benefit of Anglo-Saxons ; American civilization will , by the in - fluence of example , excite in other races a desire for self-government and a determination to secure it .

		Anglo-Saxon civilization has carried its flag to every clime and defended it with forts and garrisons .

		American civilization will imprint its flag upon the hearts of all who long for freedom .

		To American civilization , all hail I
Time	ORGANIZATION	's noblest offspring is the last .

		Mr.
Coit	PERSON	might well get irritated as well as perplexed by these utterances of Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	's .

		If , however , he should try to pass beyond the words to their meaning , he would be relieved .

		He would find Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	's answer to his smart question a distinct affirmative .

		Indeed , rarely have illiterate sincerity and literate sophistication written so unanimously and from such different points of approach .

		It is not apparent from Mr.
Coit	PERSON	's book how long he has entertained its dog - mas , but Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	is an unparalleled example of doctrinal constancy .

		His book is composed of excerpts from speeches delivered , he tells us , during a quarter of a century , and there is not an idea in the last that does not appear in the first .

		Both he and Mr.
Coit	PERSON	see certain evils in the life of man and propose certain remedies .

		The details of the proposals differ as the histo - ries and character of the men differ ; their prin - ciples are the same .

		The flavor comes , of course , from the details .

		`` I was , '' Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	tells us , `` eating a piece of watermelon some months ago , and was struck with its beauty . ''

		`` Did you ever , '' he asks , `` raise a radish ? ''

		and watermelon , and radish , and corn that he bought in
Cairo	LOCATION	, all lead to rhetoric about the Lord , concerning whose wishes and opinion Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	seems as authoritative as another and less popular
William	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Coit	PERSON	does not have the Lord on his mind and certainly would not reach him through watermelons , rad - ishes , and corn from
Cairo	LOCATION	.

		His approach would be urbaceous rather than bucolic .

		But both he and Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	are Christians .

		That is , they retain the naive attitude toward the Christ of Christianism , and they derive from Him author - ity for such opinions as they approve of , attrib - uting to `` civilization , '' or to something else , the things and doctrines they dislike .

		Both exhibit the characteristic parochialism of the churchly Christian , to whom nothing can be good or re - ligious that has not that label .

		Both oppose the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 447 exploitation of the masses by the classes , invisible government , war , and the other bugaboos of social reformers .

		Both see corrective ideals as `` the meaning of
America	LOCATION	, '' which is to them
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		Both are blind , one through ignorance , the other not otherwise than wilfully , to the fact that the recognition of some of the advantages of unselfishness over selfishness is a common hu - man emotional event , which anticipated
Chris	PERSON	- tianity many times and will succeed it many times .

		Prophets are these men , of better times com - ing : the one , in platitudes of age-old error , inno - cent through ignorance ; the other , in paradoxes of modern lies , sophisticated through vanity .

		But their message is the same , and it is sounding enough .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		Criticism with an Unhappy Ending THE STUDY AND CRITICISM OF ITALIAN ART -LRB- Third Series -RRB- .

		By
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
G.Bell & Sons	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		As in another volume , which has appeared since , all but the first of the seven essays in this book are readjustments of certain prominent problems in the history of Venetian painting during the fifteenth century .

		The first , which alone concerns us here , is called a revaluation of
Leonardo	LOCATION	, and is an eloquent impeachment of his art .

		It is an elaborate and somewhat alarm - ing `` showing-up '' of a stately immortal whose memory has come down the centuries in invio - late purple .

		For Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	would persuade us that
Leonardo	PERSON	's renown as a universal genius and as a remarkable individual has exaggerated our rating of his achievement as an artist .

		And it is in the artist that Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	is here narrowly interested .

		In disputing such a venerable reputation at all , our critic startles us with a contention that seems , at first , audacious in order to be novel and picturesque .

		For like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, like
Dante	PERSON	,
Leonardo	PERSON	has gone as an acknowledged element of traditional culture , and his genius wins fresh converts every day among the small number of freer , autonomously aesthetic spirits , thus furnishing a special sanction , and evidence of its immediate and intrinsic virtue .

		An accu - mulation of respectable , scholarly authority , moreover , increased by the many ponderous vol - umes newly written about him , has put his fame beyond question , and widespread acqui - escence has raised it to a sort of divine immu - tability .

		As his priest and expositor , Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	himself , some years ago , rationalized and ritu - alized the public worship of this deity , and may be said to be responsible for the flutter many of his devotees still dutifully undergo in the presence of his work .

		He put a reason into our minds for our fancied appreciations and told us what forms our appreciations ought to take .

		If one is therefore amazed at his apostasy , it is at least disquieting to find that his arraignment is radical , and may even seem unanswerable .

		He begins with an autobiographic account not without its dramatic interest of an artistic conscience corrupted by the attempt to reconcile the questionable effect upon him of
Leonardo	LOCATION	's work with academic formulas and literary word - charms .

		With continued exposure to the works themselves Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's elementary dilemma settles into the conviction that artistically they are far below their supposed level of excellence , and that popular and literary opinion , particu - larly
Pater	PERSON	's notoriously beautiful passage , are mischievous misreadings .

		Considered historically , these pious falsifica - tions are ultimately due to a twofold tradition : one academic , the other personal .

		The former of these secured
Leonardo	PERSON	's reputation as a great craftsman , the latter served to leaven the pre - vailing turn for myth-making , which threw a glamour over his artistic achievement .

		The aca - demic tradition proceeds from
Leonardo	LOCATION	's estab - lishment of two formulas , -LRB- 1 -RRB- contrapposto , or counterpoise , the twisting of the body on its own axis , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- chiaroscuro , a refinement upon the illusion of its vanishing planes .

		His counterpoise was an epitomized statement of the functional laws of the human structure .

		It struck its mean , and betrayed its scope .

		It brought out its motor possibilities , while it held it in unchanging equilibrium .

		His chiaroscuro provided the painter with a device for producing increased optical effects .

		It transferred the ex - istence of the objects in a picture from the realm of the determinate to the realm of extended sug - gestion .

		One was plastic in effect , the other pictorial , one `` formal , '' the other technical in nature ; between them they covered the whole field of artistic performance , and the academies made dogmas of them , and of Leonardo a sort of patron saint .

		But the perpetuation and growth of his repu - tation were assured by the survival of a tradi - 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	tion concerning his own person , the fabulous variety and distinction of his gifts , his calculated demeanor , his detachment , and his high , priv - ileged association .

		He was , moreover , the per - fect type of the myriad-minded era in which he lived , and he became a cult even in his own day .

		Not long after his death
Vasari	PERSON	becomes his first hierographer .

		Vasari considers him divinely en - dowed by immediate and miraculous act of grace ; and though Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	lays the final act of apotheosis to the Romantic idealism of the
last century	DATE	,
Vasari	PERSON	's statements made three hundred years before are less likely to be figures of speech .

		Leonardo 's innovations , however , were vicious in effect , and inartistic .

		They made the practice of art easier , and lowered its level of activity .

		They impoverished it , and doomed it to swift ending .

		But if they were the blight of Florentine art after him , they marred the finer qualities in his own .

		For
Leonardo	PERSON	was less concerned with making his work yield aesthetic ecstasy -LRB- which is the measure of art -RRB- , than with pro- ducing demonstrations of some principle of ar - rangement , of pose , of expression , or of execution , and consequently where aesthetic qualities are present in his works they are overlaid with for - mula and technical elaboration .

		`` The aesthetic moment of the `
Mona Lisa	PERSON	' has been sacrificed to effects of chiaroscuro more subtly worked out , more insistently logical than any perhaps that had yet been achieved . ''

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's chief quarrel with
Leonardo	PERSON	, however , is on the score of `` illustration , '' as in the case of the `` St.
John	PERSON	, '' in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, where `` the meaning suggested to us by a representation before us contradicts or opposes the spirit of the ostensible subject as conceived by ourselves . ''

		`` For educated people , '' we are told , `` visualize no matter how gropingly and vaguely the heroes and actions of story , and cherish a definite , if crude expectation of how they are to be repre - sented . ''

		But instead of a passionate ascetic , which is what we look for , we are shown a `` well-fleshed epicene creature with an equivocal leer , pointing upward with an operatic twist as if to invite us to look up , not to Christ first appearing upon the world , but to Bacchus clat - tering along with all his rout . ''

		The dogma of illustration has been ignored and a spiritual con - vention outraged .

		`` St.
John	PERSON	'' is a piece of un - expected , impudent blasphemy , full of unsavory suggestions .

		Even the `` Last Supper '' fails as `` illustration , '' and its decoration is not distinguished enough to carry off its deficiencies ; `` the sinister and even criminal faces '' of some of the figures and the purposeless grandiloquence of others are un - seemly , and Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	sets one kind of vehe - mence against another in his denunciation of this `` pack of vehement , gesticulating , noisy for - eigners . ''

		But if Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	has disparaged some of the world 's masterpieces , he has levelled strenu - ous argument and a savage loathing against the most honored , the ``
Mona Lisa	PERSON	. ''

		He has been lifting the gilt and patina that man and time have put there , layer by layer from the idol 's face , and now he is gouging out its eyes .

		He owns the mastery , the `` conscious art of the painter , '' the magnificence of the design ; but
Mona Lisa	PERSON	is doomed , against his deeper insight , to remain what she is , `` a foreigner with a look I could not fathom , watchful , sly , secure , with a smile of anticipated satisfaction and a pervad - ing air of hostile superiority . ''

		She baffles the spectator and even leads him to doubt his intelli - gence .

		She eludes all explicitness and attenuates all emphasis .

		She blooms with dim intimations , with `` over-meanings , '' which swell into a mon - ster that torments us with its hundred-headed ambiguities .

		This view has a lordly lineage , and a knightly champion in our eminent authority .

		And yet , I must confess that , strange as
Mona Lisa	PERSON	's smile has been declared , the commentary the centuries have written round it seems to me stranger still .

		To discern enigmas was a high recommendation in the mystery-mongering nine - teenth century of
Ruskin	PERSON	and Pater , and since their day who has not rediscovered the unfath - omable in our fashionable Florentine ?

		Criticism of a severer and narrower intention even , has been , thoughtfully and thoughtlessly , rehearsing well-worn judgments about her in precious para - phrase ; and the result of thus pouring old wine into new bottles was to do no good to the wine : something of the savor of the real truth was each time lost .

		For
Vasari	PERSON	the smile was a sort of trans - figuration of the features , and no more .

		But the critical practitioners of our own day with their more intimate insight and infinitely nicer methods have tried to account for it artistically .

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	anticipated in substance by Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	thinks
Leonardo	PERSON	had discovered that
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 449 the expression of smiling is almost entirely a mat - ter of modelling -LRB- which is partly true -RRB- , and that it interested him to produce a smile by delicate changes of surface alone -LRB- which is not wholly false -RRB- .

		The undeniable truth , however , is that the smile is there , not only as a `` result of tech - nical preoccupation '' -LRB- which Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	sug - gests as a possibility -RRB- , but as an unmistakable sign of an irradiation of the human conscious - ness ; and its evocations are , I humbly insist , due as much to its own presence as to the insinuating effect of the chiaroscuro .

		The smile is in the fugitive light a light coming from within which pauses for an instant and then passes .

		The smile and the modelling are really two aspects of the same thing , and the alleged enigma may lie in the abidance of the evanescent , in the paradoxical lingering of the transitory .

		It is equally hard to accept our critic 's final appraisal of
Leonardo	LOCATION	, whom he would put down to
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's level .

		And still harder is it to share his implicit tenet that the art of the Far East gives us a norm by which
Leonardo	PERSON	's painting , and presumably all other painting , is to be measured .

		When he says that `` there is nothing in
Mona Lisa	LOCATION	's expression that is not more satisfactorily ren - dered in Buddhist art '' and that `` There is noth - ing in the landscape that is not even more evoca - tive , and magical '' in Chinese and Japanese painting , he chooses to ignore that
Leonardo	PERSON	's picture is of a different aesthetic order , and be - longs to other modes of aesthetic experience .

		For who can deny that there are certain internal laws abiding in both arts which alienate them eternally , and that it is to some extent with sets of faculties accordingly different that we respond to either of them ?

		Commensurate , therefore , though they be , they are not commensurate on the ground of their essential natures .

		We feel that this cardinal view gets its mo - mentum from the lofty , freely indulged bias of an exquisitely fastidious amateur ; but , whether in the last analysis -LRB- which I neither pretend nor hope to reach -RRB- proved decisive or not , Mr.
Ber	PERSON	- enson 's parti pris ought to be amiable and in - spiring , just because his standards are exalted and strenuously exclusive .

		To entertain his res - olute prejudices against the realism of the `` Last Supper , '' or his disapproval of the `` uncomfort - able suggestions '' of `` The
Leda	PERSON	, '' of the `` St.
John	PERSON	, '' and of
Leonardo	LOCATION	's tainted taste , is to bring deeper insight to , and win greater admira - tion for , the less obvious beauties of archaic Greek sculpture and the exalted arts of the
East	LOCATION	.

		Even if
Leonardo	PERSON	does not seem wholly to come to his rights in this remarkable essay , the incidental criticism and the fresh point of view are boldly significant .

		The original inquiry , moreover , moves through a rich field of general ideas toward many interesting ultimate issues .

		Indeed it is far-reaching and fundamental .

		It carries in it a revision of view concerning a number of Leonardo 's great contemporaries , whose glory has similarly flowered , and flour - ished .

		It implicitly urges upon the historical theorist a reinterpretation of the whole Renais - sance , and upon the political historian a revalua - tion of its conspicuous figures and events .

		To the philosopher of taste it suggests a reformation of ultimate standards of aesthetic judgment .

		Get-Rich-Quick Philosophy PHILOSOPHY AND THE SOCIAL PROBLEM .

		By
Will Durant	PERSON	.

		Perhaps it was still possible a generation ago for a single mind to master the accumulated knowledge of the world .

		If so , the twentieth century has added so enormously to the flood of detailed information that the thing is no longer possible .

		What then is to be the fate of the philosopher , `` the spectator of all time and all existence '' ?

		Is he to become a cultural vermi - form appendix ?

		Or will he change his function and adapt himself to meet the new needs of the organism ?

		One by one the sciences have left their common mother , Philosophy ; have set up independent households , and have become respon - sible for numerous progeny .

		Psychology , long a darling child , has lately begun pulling most scan - dalously at the apron strings , while even Ethics is showing a lack of interest in things about the house and is looking more and more pensively out of the windows .

		There really appears to be danger that in our time all the children may get started in life for themselves .

		Is Philosophy to be a good old lady with nothing to do but sit quietly in the corner , fold her impotent hands , and wait for the quiet end ?

		By no means , answers the author of `` Philos - ophy and the Social Problem . ''

		Let Mother Philosophy change her diet and take pragmatic treatments !

		The result will be miraculous .

		With color returned to her cheeks , a recovered 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	appetite , the stiffness gone from her joints , and a new light in her eye , Philosophy will once more be hailed as queen of the sciences , and men will again turn to her for inspiration and for guidance .

		If it be suspected that this light-hearted resto - ration of youth and vigor to philosophy is a caricature , I can only suggest -LRB- and I urge it on other grounds -RRB- that the reader consult Mr.
Du	PERSON	- rant 's book .

		`` Philosophy , '' says the author , `` was once mistress of all the disciplines of thought and search ; now none so poor to do her reverence . ''

		And this lapse from her former significance and vitality is due -LRB- as
John Dewey	PERSON	recently put it -RRB- to `` chewing a historic cud long since reduced to woody fibre . ''

		Unless philosophy is revitalized by turning from `` a study of the details of super - seded systems '' to `` the study of the miraculous living moment in which the past melts into the present and the future finds creation , '' philosophy will sink still lower in the `` calm death of social ineffectiveness . ''

		Now , really , what evidence have we that phi - losophy is in such a bad way ?

		We have an - nouncements , like this of Mr.
Durant	PERSON	's , made from the house tops .

		But have we anything more ?

		Is it not true that university courses in philosophy have grown in recent years both in numbers and in vital interest ?

		Is there not more rather than less of a demand for philosophical literature ?

		In matters of this sort one is gener - ally dependent upon impressions , but a wide - spread impression is not always a bad guide , and there is certainly a wide-spread impression in academic circles that philosophy has experienced a revival rather than a decline in the
last decade	DATE	or two .

		Neither is the interest confined to what Mr.
Durant	PERSON	, with amusing arbitrariness , calls the vital philosophers ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, and
Nietzsche	PERSON	, nor to the `` few '' professors of philosophy `` who insist on focussing thought on life . ''

		Not only are classic speculators like Des - cartes ,
Locke	PERSON	,
Berkeley	LOCATION	, and
Hume	PERSON	seriously studied in large elective classes conducted by men not as yet won to the `` revitalized '' philoso - phy , but even Kant -LRB- whom the good pragmatist can not name without crossing himself -RRB- comes in for a good share of attention .

		This may be deplorable , but it shows that many people are interested in problems which Mr.
Durant	PERSON	would have them find dull and dry .

		The explanation is , of course , that it is not the matter but the manner that counts .

		Enough wholesale denun - ciation may yet succeed in convincing people of the futility and ineffectiveness of philosophical speculation .

		But in that case there is reason to fear that no exception will be made in favor of Mr.
Durant	PERSON	's form of pragmatism .

		No one , it seems , is so unconscious of danger as the man who is sawing off the limb upon which he sits .

		In the case of Mr.
Durant	PERSON	the limb is sawed almost through , and I appear to see the wide jaws of sociology spread to receive him .

		Now , disaster to philosophy is just what the author labors to ward off , provided it be true philosophy , `` the intellectual reconstruction of life '' rather than the `` intellectual categorizing of experience . ''

		When he thinks of the philoso - phers transformed into social engineers , platting out the map of life and harnessing the genius of the race for the renewing of creation , his optimism knows no bounds .

		It is only because present - day philosophers are not hot with what he be - lieves to be passion for social perfection that he will none of them .

		If this is good pragmatism , it is somewhat sur - prising .

		One would expect a philosophy which has given a new significance to the principle of relativity to be less dogmatic ; to allow at least for a programme which is concerned not with immediate but with distant ends , and which aims to affect the social structure indirectly and com - prehensively through the enlargement of men 's mental outlook and the broadening of human sym - pathies , rather than directly through the solution of concrete , everyday problems .

		Alas , not even Kant could be more inflexible .

		Here is a nasty slum .

		Take hold ; see that it is cleaned up ; or admit you are a mossback and not a philosopher .

		Or if you are a philosopher , then it is high time we had a new type .

		This is Mr.
Durant	PERSON	's prag - matic challenge .

		Well , it is interesting that the contemporary philosopher whom he admits into the front rank is
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, widely known for his long and brilliant occupation with `` intel - lectual dead-issues . ''

		I quote a paragraph and a footnote : Philosophy was vital in
Plato	LOCATION	's day ; so vital that some philosophers were exiled and others were put to death .

		No one would think of putting a philosopher to death today .

		Not because men are more delicate about killing ; but because there is no need to kill that which is already dead .

		It would be invidious to name the exceptions which one is glad to remember here ; but it is in place to say that the practical arrest of
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	is a sign of resuscitation on the part of philosophy , a sign for which all lovers of philosophy should be grateful .

		When philosophers are once more feared , philosophy will once more be respected .

		Mr.
Durant	PERSON	's admiration of
Bertrand Rus	ORGANIZATION	- sell does him credit , but it shows the futility of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 451 insisting that a philosopher who wishes to count socially must go at it in a particular way .

		Or will Mr.
Durant	PERSON	maintain that
Bertrand Rus	PERSON	- sell is solely significant as the author of such books as `` Justice in War Time '' and `` Why Men Fight '' ?

		See , then , how the real philosopher gets into the game .

		Feminism , socialism , eugenics , an - archism , all the isms , says Mr.
Durant	PERSON	, have nothing to offer toward the solution of social problems .

		They are like the unintelligent , ran - dom movements of a monkey trying to solve a puzzle .

		This he makes clear by means of a dialogue in the course of which the various isms prove one another futile .

		After this reductio ad absurdum , he turns to the sciences .

		Alas , there is a great defect in the sciences also : they are `` shredded , '' `` fragmentated , '' piecemeal .

		Science becomes more and more a fragmentated thing , with ever less coordination , ever less sense of the whole .

		Our industrial system has forced division of labor here , as in the manual trades , almost to the point of idiocy : let a man seek to know everything about some - thing , and he will soon know nothing about anything else ; efficiency will swallow up the man .

		It is `` this shredded science '' which calls loudly for coordination .

		And here is philosophy 's chance .

		Science furnishes the shredded wheat ; philosophy must bake the biscuit .

		How ?

		By taking the `` essentials from the sciences , '' coor - dinating these into a `` sense of the whole , '' and guiding scientific research by the aid of this vision .

		The scientist is a wizard in the labora - tory , but for that very reason is near-sighted .

		He has a poor sense of direction regarding the utility of his experiments .

		It is the philosopher 's function `` to point the nose of science to a goal . ''

		He will `` do the listening to today 's science , and then do the thinking for tomorrow 's statesman - ship . ''

		Of course one might object that something more than a well-arranged dialogue is required to prove that the isms are not , as many people think , effective engines of concrete social reform ; and the scientists might object to being led by the nose , even if we were agreed on its desira - bility .

		One wonders , moreover , whether the proposed `` coordination of the essentials of sci - ence '' is not simply an invitation to the professor of philosophy to deceive himself into believing that he is still master of the world 's knowledge .

		But I have not the heart to attempt to trip such romping enthusiasm by littering the ground with difficulties .

		For the same reason the reader is left to acquaint himself with the `` Society for Social Research '' and the author 's unrestrained adoration of the college professor .

		After all , the central issue raised by the book grows out of Mr.
Durant	PERSON	's contention that unless philosophy is ready to adopt a get-rich-quick programme , it has no further excuse for being .

		Notwithstanding the shrill insistence upon a particular type of philosopher , which gives to the book a tone of dogmatism probably not war - ranted by the spirit of the author , and in spite of a certain innocence respecting the stubborn - ness of human nature and the inertia of social institutions , which gives the discussion a flavor of immaturity , the book is an interesting plea for a philosophy that can pay its way in immedi - ate practical results .

		The author says things that need repeating , and he says them eloquently and earnestly .

		Especially is this true of the thesis of the volume : the need of organizing intelli - gence in behalf of a better human society , nation - ally and internationally .

		I fear , however , that his plan of campaign , if followed , would only get philosophy the reputation of being a gadding busy - body , meddling in everybody 's business , having none of her own .

		Goethe GOETHE .

		By
Calvin Thomas	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Goethe holds a higher position in German literature than any other man has ever held in any other literature .

		No adjectives can appraise Shakespeare ; but if we had to choose between having
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and having all English lit - erature outside of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, we should let the swan of Avon follow the swan of Lohengrin into any sea-change he cared to assume .

		It is quite otherwise with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Goethe alone is richer than all the rest of German literature put together .

		This is not merely because of his amazing versatility ; it is because of his still more amazing excellence , for in every kind of book he wrote , except in science and mathematics , he went to the top .

		He is
Germany	LOCATION	's greatest poet , dramatist , novelist , and critic .

		Tennyson 's fine compliment to him in `` In Memoriam '' certainly does not overstate the truth he sang `` to one clear harp in divers tones . ''

		It is indeed a remarkable fact that one individual 's literary pro- duction should exceed in value the combined con - tribution of his predecessors , contemporaries , and followers .

		I can think of no parallel to this .

		452 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	To lovers of literature , not
Berlin	LOCATION	, but
Weimar	LOCATION	, is the capital of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In his interesting preface , Professor
Thomas	PERSON	says , `` Every scholar has his own
Dante	PERSON	, his own Shakespeare , his own Goethe .

		This book pre - sents my Goethe as I see him after nearly forty years of university teaching during which he has never been long out of my thoughts .

		I came to him as an undergraduate by way of Carlylc . ''

		Well , although I do not know one-hundredth as much about him as Professor
Thomas	PERSON	knows , for I have never been a professional student or teacher of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, I came to him even earlier , by the same route .

		I fell under his spell at the age of fifteen , and have never been out of it since .

		Nearly every book that charmed me ,
Froude	PERSON	's brilliant sketch of Caesar among others , men - tioned a person by the name of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, a name I could not pronounce .

		But he was always men - tioned with immense respect , for the time had long gone by when De Quincey had found it safe to sneer at him as a `` German litterateur , '' and to make this prophecy : `` the honours of
Coler	PERSON	- idge are perennial and will annually grow more verdant ; whilst from those of Goethe every gen - eration will see something fall away , until pos - terity will wonder at the subverted idol , whose basis being hollow and unsound , will leave the worship of their fathers an enigma to their descendants . ''

		Carlyle settled the business for me .

		I read his translation of ``
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	, '' and became so enchanted by the characters in that wonderful story , that years later , when I heard the opera `` Mignon '' for the first time , I felt an indescrib - able thrill as each one of my favorite persons took the stage .

		It was as though a group of intensely loved friends had all risen from the dead and come back to cheer me with their bodily pres - ence .

		There are greater operas than `` Mignon '' ; but no other opera can affect me in precisely that way .

		It is almost impossible to open any book writ - ten by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and not immediately find some - thing stimulating .

		To test this now at my desk , I opened one , and the first thing I saw was , `` The theatre has often been at variance with the pul - pit ; they ought not , I think , to quarrel .

		How much it is to be wished , that in both , the cele - bration of Nature and of God were intrusted to none but men of noble minds ! ''

		No matter if a new biography of Goethe were published each month , there would still be a place for a book by Professor
Thomas	PERSON	.

		With his sound scholarship , cool judgment , clear common sense , keen humor , and long experience , he could hardly fail to write something valuable and important .

		But as a matter of fact , there was an urgent need for this particular work ; for unless I am mistaken , there has been no impor - tant Life of Goethe written in English since the
year 1855	DATE	, when the notable biography by
G. H. Lewes	PERSON	appeared .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's book is divided into two parts the impersonal and the personal .

		The first part , covering 167 pages , is a simple , straight - forward account of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		This treat - ment reveals a rather remarkable skill in the great art of omission ; for everything essential is there , and receives due attention and emphasis .

		No German could possibly have written these chapters .

		Unimportant details and personal prej - udices are absent .

		Much has been sacrificed to secure clearness and concision , but it is literally true that every page is interesting , for the style has movement .

		Then , forsaking the realm of unadorned fact , Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	enters the world of ideas .

		The remaining 185 pages are divided into the follow - ing chapters : `` The Philosopher , '' `` The Evolu - tionist , '' `` The Believer , '' `` The Poet , '' `` The Dramatist , '' `` The Novelist , '' `` The Critic , '' `` Faust . ''

		Here the treatment is individual .

		It is the author 's Goethe , and nobody else 's , who is revealed to us , and this is what we want the real justification for the appearance of the book .

		It is seldom that anyone can find fault with a work for being too short ; but I think this should have been longer .

		And I do not mean it as a compliment .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's admirable `` Life and Works of Schiller '' is more than a hundred pages longer than the `` Goethe , '' and surely there is not more worth saying about
Schil	PERSON	- ler than about his greater contemporary .

		In the endeavor , commendable in itself , to avoid pro- lixity , there is a feeling in these later chapters of abruptness , scantiness , insufficiency .

		There is never any sense of inadequacy on the part of the author , which makes undue brevity all the more unfortunate .

		Another thing .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	has of course read all the important books on Goethe written by Germans .

		He must have become thoroughly aweary of rhapsodical adulation .

		For the attitude of most German biographers and critics to the great sage has been characterized , not by intelligent and discriminating criticism , but by idolatry .

		Now , idolatry may possibly be
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 453 of some assistance to the worshipper but , as a rule , it helps neither the idol nor the spectators .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	not only refuses to kneel ; he bends over backward .

		One gets the impression that at the outset of his task he took a solemn vow not to slop over .

		This would be well enough if his admiration for Goethe were only moderate .

		But in the preface , although admit - ting that the halo has `` grown a little dimmer in the lapse of years , '' he says , `` I am conscious of owing more to him than to any other writer of books . ''

		One would not suspect this in reading the chapters on `` The Poet , '' on `` The Dram - atist , '' on `` The Critic . ''

		Indeed , one who had never read
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	would not believe him to be either a first-class poet or a first-class critic .

		The chapter on `` The Critic '' is positively cold .

		The temperature rises notably in the chapter on `` Faust , '' which is quite properly reserved to make the final impression .

		My suspicion that Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	is writing with German rhapsodies in mind is heightened by reading the chapter on `` The Believer , '' where a strong case is almost ardently supported .

		The chapter contains this excellent saying : `` Looked at in a large histor - ical survey religion may be conceived as a four - sided pyramid one side of which is cult , a second theology , a third ethics , and the fourth mystic emotion . ''

		The fourth side is what interested
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and in that sense he was surely not only a deeply religious man , but an inspiring religious teacher , as even I , a convinced Christian , have always found him .

		Still , he was not nearly so great a religious teacher as he was a poet and artist .

		This book is written for English readers .

		One does not need to know a word of German to enjoy and to profit by it .

		It is interesting to observe with what scrupulous care Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has avoided using German words .

		Ordinarily a book on this subject would have been thickly bespattered with them .

		They occur so seldom never except when necessary that they produce a shock .

		And one might almost say that no word of any kind is used except when necessary .

		I feel sure that I have never read a combination of biography and criticism of this size , where such extraordinary pains to avoid superfluities in speech have been taken .

		Even some English words have been `` simplified '' in order to pack everything into as small a space as is possible .

		The author has a tight rein on himself .

		The chapter on `` Faust , '' as it ought to be , is the best in the book .

		I have never seen anywhere so fine a discussion of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's optimism .

		He sees `` Faust , '' not as the English or the French see it , but as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	must have seen it himself .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	abundantly confirms the view revealed to me thirty years ago , when I saw
Henry Irving	PERSON	produce the play in the afternoon , and
Ernst Possart	ORGANIZATION	produce it in the evening of the same day .

		And
Irving	PERSON	's manager was there in a box ready to present Possart with a wreath from the famous English actor .

		But when the curtain rose and the `` Prolog im Himmel '' began , the manager went out and informed Irving that
Possart	PERSON	was not acting `` Faust '' that night , but some other piece .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	has written a sound and ` good book , a credit to American scholarship and criticism .

		He has shown commendable amenity in two ways by avoiding footnotes and by being steadily and delightfully interesting .

		And even those who still under the dominion of German pedantry believe that a sprightly , luminous style is incompatible with true scholarship , can not fail to recognize the learning so unpretentiously and modestly displayed .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	has long been a recognized authority , and if he were not , this book would make him one .

		It will be many years before students and lovers of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	will find it possible to neglect this crown of a life 's work .

		THE SHADOWED HOUR .

		By
John Erskine	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
The Lyric Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	; 75 cts . -RRB-

		Mr.
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson	PERSON	seems a young man to be giving us his collected poems ; it is , in fact , a little startling to find that even if most of his early work is omitted , as in this collection , he has published so much .

		In addition to the more realistic studies , by which Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has chiefly earned his reputation , `` Daily Bread , '' `` Womenkind , '' `` Fires , '' `` Borderlands and Thoroughfares , '' `` Livelihood , '' and `` Battle , '' this rather unwieldy volume contains also one poem in an earlier vein , `` Akra the Slave , '' a use - ful reminder that , like his fellow-poet Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has evolved in manner from romanticism to realism .

		When one con - siders in this connection some of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	very latest work , particularly in the lyric and in the sonnet form , where he seems tentatively to be teasing once more at colors more frankly brilliant , it is possible to suspect that , again like Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, he has fed himself to satiety on the drab and realistic and may yet revert to the romantic , an evolution altogether natural .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's development has , however , been more obvious and orderly than Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's .

		It was not , in his case , a sudden surrender to an overpowering and perhaps previously unconscious impulse , but rather a gradual modification .

		Even in `` Akra the Slave , '' for example , there are hints of the close psychological texture which was later to reach its maximum of efficiency as a poetic style in `` Fires '' and `` Livelihood . ''

		In `` Daily Bread '' and `` Womenkind , '' pitched in a collo - quial dramatic form -LRB- or dialogue , rather , closely akin to Mr.
Abercrombie	PERSON	's use of the same form in parts of `` Emblems of Love '' -RRB- , there was necessarily a good deal of waste .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's genius is not dramatic , and he found himself pre - cluded from the sort of step-by-step , objective analysis which is his keenest pleasure .

		Conse - quently , this is the weakest part of his work .

		In `` Fires , '' on the other hand , lies the happiest synthesis of all Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's talents .

		In these brief , rhymed narratives , dealing for the most part with the lives of working-people , but not too in - sistently in a drab tone , Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	found him - self free to exploit side by side his love of color and his love of sharp analysis .

		The result is a sort of iterative half-lyric analysis , frequently powerful .

		In `` Borderlands , '' `` Livelihood , '' and `` Battle , '' however , the lyric and colorful aspect has gone dwindling in proportion as the psy - chological preoccupation has increased .

		Un - fortunately , the gain in truthfulness has not entirely compensated for the loss in beauty .

		In some of the poems which compose the volume called `` Battle , '' for example , it may be ques - tioned whether actual bathos was not reached : to truthfulness Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	seems here to have sacri - ficed everything , even dignity .

		One admits his truthfulness , but one does not feel it .

		It is , of course , too early to attempt a placing of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	.

		For the present it is enough to say that he has developed a style peculiarly effec - tive , and valuable too for its influence on con - temporary poetry .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has clearly proved that poetry can deal with the common - places of daily life , with the bitter and trivial and powerful and universal commonplaces of human consciousness , and do it with force and beauty .

		None of his contemporaries on either side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	has equalled him in power to drag forth , link by link , the image-chain of a human mood .

		We can not yet begin complaining that these moods have a hypnotic sameness throughout his work ; nor that he varies the monotony of these analytical studies with too little of that romantic flush which , one can not help thinking , no less than an excessive love of matter - of-fact , is a part of consciousness .

		Mr.
Gib	PERSON	- son lacks the lyric elan for this , just as he also lacks flexibility of technique .

		But these are questions which perhaps will be settled anew with every epoch according to the prevailing taste ; one can not be dogmatic about them .

		To-day we like Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	for his dogged truthfulness , and we shy at his occasional pedestrian sentimentality .

		A later judge may conceivably reverse the verdict .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	is obviously a congener of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	.

		The poems in his `` Old Christmas '' are , for the most part , narrative and in much the same form that Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	is most fond of using : the octosyllabic couplet .

		It can not be pretended that this is poetry of a high order ; but Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	, in adapting to his use the life of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountain-folk , has hit upon extremely interest - ing material ; he has given us some excellent stories , told in the folk-language , with many quaintnesses of idiom , and , on the whole , with the simplicity and economy that makes for effect .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's technique is useful rather than brilliant he seldom rises above the level of the story - teller .

		In `` Saul of the Mountains , '' `` Old Christmas , '' or the `` Prince of Peace , '' the story obviously is the thing , and the story does the trick .

		When , as occasionally happens , Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	shows genuine imaginative power -LRB- as in the `` Strange Woman '' and its sequel -RRB- it is hard to say how much that power is fortuitous .

		Mr.
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	, whose book `` Prufrock and Other Observations '' is really hardly more than a pamphlet , is also a realist , but of a different sort .

		Like Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	is a psycholo - gist ; but his intuitions are keener ; his technique subtler .

		For the two semi-narrative psychologi - cal portraits which form the greater and better part of his book , `` The Love Song of
J. Alfred Prufrock	PERSON	'' and `` The Portrait of a Lady , '' one can have little but praise .

		This is psychological realism , but in a highly subjective or introspective vein ; whereas Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, for example , gives us , in the third person , the reactions of an individual to a situation which is largely exter - nal -LRB- an accident , let us say -RRB- , Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	gives us ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 455 in the first person , the reactions of an individual to a situation for which to a large extent his own character is responsible .

		Such work is more purely autobiographic than the other the field is narrowed , and the terms are idiosyncratic -LRB- some - times almost blindly so -RRB- .

		The dangers of such work are obvious : one must be certain that one 's mental character and idiom are sufficiently close to the norm to be comprehensible or significant .

		In this respect , Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	is near the border - line .

		His temperament is peculiar , it is some - times , as remarked heretofore , almost bafflingly peculiar , but on the whole it is the average hyper - aesthetic one with a good deal of introspective curiosity ; it will puzzle many , it will delight a few .

		Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	writes pungently and sharply , with an eye for unexpected and vivid details , and , particularly in the two longer poems and in `` The Rhapsody of a Windy Night , '' he shows himself to be an exceptionally acute technician .

		Such free rhyme as this , with irregular line lengths , is difficult to write well , and Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	does it well enough to make one wonder whether such a form is not what the adorers of free verse will eventually have to come to .

		In the rest of Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	's volume one finds the piquant and the trivial in about equal proportions .

		Mr.
Erskine	PERSON	has at best a dubious claim to a share in the title of this review .

		Most critics would call him a classicist : he writes , in a fairly orotund blank verse , of
Satan	LOCATION	, the death of reli - gion , the `` Sons of Metaneira . ''

		Unfortunately Mr.
Erskine	PERSON	dons a little too self-consciously the robes of the grand manner .

		One must forge through many sonorous and archaic Miltonic echoes , many valueless inversions , to come upon the occasional imaginative power or delicacy .

		In the `` Sons of Metaneira '' he is at his best : the story is told without strain , with effective touches of dignity and simplicity , and occasionally with sharp realization of scene .

		CQNRAD The Truth About War UNDER FIRE .

Henri Barbusse	PERSON	.

E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-


Henri Barbusse	PERSON	's poilus have a `` sacramental saying '' that economizes profanity : victory is certain `` if the civilians hold out . ''

		It is a bit of irony that has not been lost on
M. Barbusse	PERSON	.

		He at least can be accused of no tenderness for civilian sensibilities .

		He is magnificently indif - ferent to the curious editorial taboo which re - sults in the frigid brevity of the war dispatch and the inhuman abstractions of Mr.
Frank H. Simonds	PERSON	.

		To a man tremendously in earnest who wanted to make those at home see and feel the war yes , and smell it , too any squeamish - ness would naturally be a simple irrelevance .

		It would not be thought of , and
M. Barbusse	PERSON	has n't thought of it .

		The result is a book of terrific impact , a horrible and fascinating document that brings one nearer to the desolation and despair of No Man 's Land than anything else I have read .

		If `` Under Fire '' convinces you that you are at last hearing something like the truth , it is because it is so obviously an honest book .

		It is as innocent of false emphasis as it is of ordinary reserves .

		If
M. Barbusse	PERSON	makes out an over - whelming case against war , it is not by falsify - ing the evidence , by careful selection and suppression .

		His book is impressive by reason , largely , of its inclusiveness .

		So fine an intelli - gence as his is not tempted to be unscrupulous , because it sees that the case presents itself and can only be ruined by embellishment or distor - tion in the interest of an argument .

		It can be ruined by fanaticism , too , as the pacifist usually ruins it .

		It can be ruined , finally , by any suspicion of hypersensitiveness or any morbid obsession with the horrible .

		To write a really effective indictment of war , a man has first to persuade us of his sheer normality and the strength of his nerves .

		He has to convince us that he is not overcivilized and that he can be more or less at home with the primordial .

		He may loathe it , as
M. Barbusse	PERSON	loathes war , but the mere sight of its excesses wo n't topple him over .

		He is prepared for anything .

		All of which is only a clumsy way of saying that `` Under Fire '' is not a piece of propaganda , a work of pure horror designed to keep the reader at one emotional pitch and that the least en - durable through three hundred and fifty odd pages .

		No ; for even in war actual fighting remains a little exceptional ; the casual and the trivial bulk quite as large as they do in the lives of men at home .

		Only , the discomfort is on a gigantic scale and the dislocations of habit are without parallel .

		In the work of rebarbarization they count quite as heavily as the insane fury of the assault .

		M. Barbusse shows very subtly how all these influences play on the men and mould them ; how they are transforming the massed humanity at the front .

		His book is filled with a kind of primordial humor , with pene - trating criticism , with a truly Gothic grotesquery , 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	with a great and moving tenderness for the patched and wretched cave-men armored in mud , crawled over by lice , sleeping in dung , and sent at intervals across the hell of No Man 's Land to slay or be slain as chance serves .

		When we meet the men of the squad peasants and artisans of the lowest class , the true heroes of the war they are awash on `` an endless grey sheet that floats on the sea and has here and there gone under . ''

		M. Barbusse does not dabble in childish symbolism , but there is a complete appropriateness in his initial picture of a water-logged world in which `` even the wan light seems to flow . ''

		Water is , in fact , a sort of motif to which he returns again and again , until he sums up his final impression for us `` on the wrecked and dissolving plain , flecked with bodies between its worm-shaped chasms of water , among the islands of motionless men stuck together like reptiles in this flattening and sinking chaos '' `` I used to think that the worst hell in war was the flame of shells ; and then for long I thought it was the suffocation of the caverns which eternally confine us .

		But it is neither of these things .

		Hell is water . ''

		Like the author himself , the men of his squad are tortured by the need of finding words into which they can pack all their misery , so that what remains incredible even to them may be made credible to those who have stayed at home .

		What is war ?

		One of the men looks out on the `` calamitous plain , '' with bodies strewn `` here and there in the vastness like foul rubbish '' he looks and says , `` That 's war ... It 's not anything else . ''

		And the author interprets his thought : `` He means and I am with him in his meaning more than attacks that are like cere - monial reviews , more than visible battles unfurled like banners , more even than hand-to-hand encounters of shouting strife , War is frightful and unnatural weariness , water up to the belly , mud and dung and infamous filth .

		It is befouled faces and tattered flesh , it is corpses that are no longer like corpses even , floating on the ravenous earth . ''

		Such ,
M. Barbusse	PERSON	shows us , in a succession of episodes that are , I suppose , broadly typical such is war to the common soldier .

		The im - pression that he wishes to drive home , and that he does drive home with cumulative force , is one of infinite boredom and inhuman discomfort , of the pervasively disintegrating action of war upon a group of men who have outgrown the mood of war and whom circumstances can not quite thrust back into that mood .

		The lust for blood may , in fact , be stimulated , along with other lusts , but what
M. Barbusse	PERSON	insists upon is that it is no longer stimulated enough .

		The men themselves feel this as they watch the black troops getting ready to go into action .

		The Africans are real soldiers , made for the business of slaughter .

		But in themselves the peasant and the artisan are only overlaid , not obliterated ; and that makes a tragic difference .

		And what is their reaction to the war ?

		Is it simply a hopeless and confused acquiescence ?

		By no means .

		They are fighting the war in a spirit of fine generosity , with complete dedication of themselves ; they are trying to save what no longer exists for them the comfortable civiliza - tion of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		And they are trying to under - stand , to emerge `` from the delusion and ignorance which soil them as the mud soils them . ''

		What is it that causes war , they ask .

		It is the spirit of militarism , one answers . ''

		`
Germany	LOCATION	and militarism they 're the same thing . ' ''

		No ; that is too simple . ''

		` To-day militarism is called
Germany	LOCATION	. '

		.

		.

		` Yes , but what will it be called to-morrow ? '

		` After all , what is it that makes the mass and horror of war ? '

		` It 's the mass of the people . '

		` But the people that 's us . '

		` Yes , that 's true .

		It 's the people who are war ; without them , there would be nothing , nothing but some wrangling , a long way off .

		But it is n't they who decide on it ; it 's the masters who steer them ' ` The people are struggling to-day to have no more masters who steer them .

		This war , it 's like the French Revolution continuing . ' ''

		And then : `` The people of the world ought to come to an under - standing , through the hides and on the bodies of those who exploit them one way and another .

		All the masses ought to agree together . ''

		I am aware that the passages I have quoted , and especially the last , do a disservice to the author .

		Nothing in the book has the neatness and salience that such sentences have in a review .

		`` Under Fire '' is like a panorama which mu ^ t be taken in at a sweep ; its impressive bigness depends upon the cumulative effect of n host of small impressions which can not be subtracted from the whole .

		To review such a book is obviously impossible ; one can only recommend it .

		It is the sort of book which everyone who wants to know what war is actually like will have to read for himself .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 457 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS MR.
GEORGE JEAN NATHAN	PERSON	PRESENTS .


Alfred A. Knopf	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		What `` Mr.
George Jean Nathan	PERSON	Presents '' is largely himself ; we get him somewhat in the guise of a naughty altar-boy .

		He kneels before the shrine , he swings the censer , he goes through certain genuflexions ; yet he contrives to grimace at the reverent throng and to tip the wink that the worshipful Mystery is too much of a humbug to merit much regard .

		A man can not live live exclusively and consciously in a realm of unworthy make-believe without suffering for it ; and Mr.
George Jean Nathan	PERSON	, in some of his phases , is calculated to cause regrets .

		He is mighty knowing and capable in his field , but he is brash .

		He opens up some wonderful , sudden vistas for the playgoer , and shoots a number of penetrating epigrams ; but his taste and dis - cretion are not equal to his brilliancy .

		Though from
Fort Wayne	LOCATION	, as his biography on the jacket informs us , he has come to be more metropolitan than most of the metropolitans themselves self-possessed to the uttermost verge of the unabashed and as cynical as you please .

		One wonders how he would act if he met Truth and Right Feeling face to face : according to his own confession of experiences , he seems unlikely to meet them in the modern theatre , his sole milieu .

		He is a sort of latter - day Israfel , playing `` wildly , '' however `` well , '' on the keyboard of Good Taste ; he jabs , prods , counters , scrambles a loud , bizarre , but com - pelling performance .

		Yet the impression per - sists that he really knows the theatre as few others know it , and that he would write more worthily about it if it were more worthy itself .

		When the better day finally comes for the stage , let us hope not to find that the rather regrettable habits which Mr.
George Jean Nathan	PERSON	has formed during times of decadence are operating to prevent him from writing about finer things in a finer way .

		For despite numerous incisive and clear-visioned pages , large tracts of his work are better suited to the passing feuilleton than to the permanent book .

		THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN CAPITAL - ISM .

		By
John A. Hobson	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		The new edition of
John A. Hobson	PERSON	's `` The Evolution of Modern Capitalism '' differs from its predecessor by the addition of a new supple - mentary chapter dealing with the effect of the war on the industrial organization of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		`` The year
1914	DATE	, '' Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	writes in his preface , `` will mark a definite break in economic as in other history ... Never has any previous war exercised such a disturbing influence ... '' The disturbance has shown itself in
England	LOCATION	as a swift qualitative and quantitative readjustment of industry to new demands , an increase of pro- duction in spite of the withdrawal of millions of laborers from work , the `` dilution '' of labor , that is , an increase in the number of people exe - cuting a single process , and the employment of women at jobs hitherto taboo to them .

		Money wages have gone up , real wages are down , and the maintenance of the real wage level will de - mand , and in the end compel , cooperation be - tween labor and capital , such that workers may become in some sense owners .

		Against such a unification of the operators in an industry , how - ever , the consuming public will need protection , so that government regulation and control of prices and production may be necessarily con - tinued even when the war is over .

		This will be even more essential unless a durable and organic peace gets established .

		For nations will then want to go completely `` heeled , '' to be self-sus - taining in every respect , the governments hold - ing a firm hand upon the manufacture of munitions and the production of food particu - larly .

		The war has shown , furthermore , the increased power of the public credit , which kept the banks from going smash during the first period .

		This may be now invoked to finance a `` return to the land '' and other enterprises having a bearing on national defence .

		Without inter - national organization , moreover , economic inter - nationalism is certain to be disorganized .

		Industry will be subjected to the control of military and political considerations .

		This will arrest economic progress , and make secure the grip of the financial oligarchy upon mankind .

		LOVE SONGS .

		By
Sara Teasdale	PERSON	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		A bookful of loveliness is this new volume of
Sara Teasdale	PERSON	's verse : new not in the sense that all the poems it contains are recent ones , but that it represents a lately gathered treasury of lyrics .

		They are characterized , as her work has always been , by a musical facility , strong imagery , and that note of mingled joy and pain which haunts the moments of love , whether in its inception , its fulfillment , or its loss .

		Indeed the poet stresses so frequently the sweet ironies of what
Henry James	PERSON	called `` the great constringent relation between men and women , '' that as one reads many of them the successive poems lose some of their original keenness .

		Mrs.
Filsinger	PERSON	is betrayed , too , by her gift for smooth and charm - ing lines ; she occasionally wastes fascinating tech - nique on a triviality which ends in vapor .

		Her lapses from technical excellence , as for example the rhyming of `` love '' and `` enough , '' are in fact less frequent than her failures to give point to 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	otherwise lovely lyrics .

		Of them all , the `` Songs Out of Sorrow '' are her least achievement ; they descend most abruptly to the commonplace , both in theme and method .

		Of the others , one beau - tiful and typical is `` Lights '' : When we come home at
night	TIME	and close the door , Standing together in the shadowy room , Safe in our own love and the gentle gloom , Glad of familiar wall and chair and floor , Glad to leave far below the clanging city ; Looking far downward to the glaring street Gaudy with light , yet tired with many feet , In both of us wells up a wordless pity ; Men have tried hard to put away the dark ; A million lighted windows brilliantly Inlay with squares of gold the
winter	DATE
night	TIME	, But to us standing here there comes the stark Sense of the lives behind each yellow light , And not one wholly joyous , proud , or free .

		AN OLD FRONTIER OF
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		By
Frank H. Severance	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Severance	PERSON	is a specialist in his chosen field , the
Niagara	LOCATION	region during French discovery and dominion .

		He is painstaking and accurate , with an apparently vastly absorbent , orderly intellect , and if only he might have quickened his subject with a more human touch , the re - viewer could accord him unstinted praise .

		The story of civilized man 's struggle with the wilder - ness , with savages , and finally with other civilized men is one of ever-renewed interest , reflecting as it does the evolution of nationality .

		Champlain ,
La Salle	LOCATION	, and
Tonti	PERSON	, `` the man with the iron hand , '' in their laborious but relent - less progress westward , were not , perhaps , in - spired by the highest motives , but they were of the stuff that we can admire .

		Later , exploration was frequently but an excuse for profit in trade , just as trade was still later to become a mask for depredation , and national defence the byword for cruelties hardly exceeded by those of the shifty allies of the French in
America	LOCATION	.

		Dongan wrote , in the
last years of the seventeenth century	DATE	, '' 'T is a very hard thing that all the Countryes a French - man walks over in
America	LOCATION	must belong to
Canada	LOCATION	, '' and therewith demanded the `` break - ing down '' of the chief French stronghold at
Niagara	LOCATION	.

		The attitude that he criticizes was hardly confined to
France	LOCATION	.

		It might be applied with scant injustice to every man of whatever nationality who traversed the disputed country of western
New York	LOCATION	, the Lakes , and the terri - tory of `` La Belle Riviere . ''

		Through the maze of bickerings and badly directed affairs , a few men of unusual power stand out .

		There was Joncaire the Elder , inter - preter by profession , clandestine fur-trader , and subtle diplomatist for the French in their deal - ings with the Iroquois .

		There were his sons ,
Philippe	PERSON	, of whom the Senecas wrote to the Governor that `` they saw clearly their Father was angry with them , since he did not send back their son Joncaire , as that alone could tran - quilize them , '' and
Chabert de Joncaire	PERSON	, that in - genious rascal who possessed a like power over the loyalty of his Indians , and who followed his term on the Niagara portage as `` the greatest transportation monopolist in
America	LOCATION	, '' with a few years of not too solemn reflection in the
Bastille	LOCATION	.

		We read of such able opposition leaders as Colonel
John Bradstreet	PERSON	and Sir
Wil	PERSON	-
liam Johnson	PERSON	, the conqueror of
Niagara	LOCATION	.

		The author quotes liberally from the caustic , often humorous old journals and reports .

		In his chap - ter on `` Niagara News in
1757	DATE	'' he reflects most graphically the rough-and-ready existence on the frontier , when prisoners and scalps were brought in with daily regularity , when starving incomers were replenished from .

		the king 's stores with little regard to the legitimacy of their disposal , when `` ladies , women and children '' lent an air of domesticity and gaiety by their unpermitted pres - ence .

		It was a good time to be alive .

		SOCIAL DIAGNOSIS .

		By
Mary E. Rich	PERSON	- mond .

		Russell Sage Foundation ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		To make the study of human relationships as much a science as is the study of physical phe - nomena has been one of the dreams of the social philosophers since the days of the French en - lightenment .

		But the dream has never come true .

		While
Miss Richmond	LOCATION	in her careful work , to the preparation of which she gave the free time of fourteen years , has probably not had such an ambitious aim , she has produced a book remarkable for the accuracy of the methods outlined for the social worker and for the detail and thoroughness with which she has gone into the subject of measurements in one phase of life , the pathology of social adjustment .

		This volume is essentially a study in the methods and efficiency of case work .

		Cases are necessarily in large part individual matters and do not there - fore lend themselves easily to statistical study .

		Not the counting of instances , therefore , but the careful and painstaking analysis of human char - acter in relation to individual and social failure in all its angles and from all available sources in hundreds and thousands of instances difficult to classify has been
Miss Richmond	LOCATION	's task .

		It was a stupendous undertaking , but it had back of it the enthusiasm of one of the best-known and most able social workers of the country .

		And it needed badly to be done .

		How to get
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dence , how to test it , how to use it are the problems she set herself to solve , and she has handled them in a way which has measurably advanced one aspect at least of social science toward the goal which the social philosophers have set for it .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 459 IRISH IDYLLS .


Jane Barlow	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		When
Miss Barlow	PERSON	's `` Irish Idylls '' was first published , twenty years ago , a critic said of it : `` The philanthropist or the political student in - terested in the eternal Irish Problem will learn more from
Miss Barlow	LOCATION	's volumes than from a dozen
Royal Commissions	ORGANIZATION	and a hundred Blue Books . ''

		To say more is futile .

		Miss
Barlow	PERSON	, the daughter of the dean of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, spent her life in a small village just outside of
Dublin	LOCATION	; and narrow `` Lisconnell , '' hung with peat smoke and mist , is not drawn from imagi - nation , there is room for a stranger at every hearth , where kindness , sometimes a bit hedged by sharp words , is commoner than potatoes .

		`` A real poet 1 can never be , ''
Miss Barlow	PERSON	once wrote to a friend , and went on writing singing prose .

		At the end of a wet day `` the cloud canopy ... was flying eastward , scudding in festoons and trails and shreds , or furled into rumpled bundles in the grip of the careering blasts ... Each arrival , mostly in the moth-colored dusk , at the black mouth of
Dan O'Beirne	PERSON	's scarlet-hearted forge was a trium - phant moment to be anticipated from afar . ''

		And so on .

		But even if it were not shot with such lovely bits of description , every chapter in the book that one called `` One Too Many '' most of all is a gift to the student of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		THE BUDGET .

		By
Rene Stourm	PERSON	.

		Trans - lated by
Thaddeus Plazinski	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 3.75	MONEY	.

		There are many reasons for regarding the management of revenues and expenditures as the most crucial part of government .

		The age-long struggle for democracy has hinged on the power of the purse ; and , broadly speaking , political sys - tems succeed or fail according as they make pro- vision for honest and economical handling of the public funds .

		The
United States	LOCATION	has had her share of irresponsible and corrupt use of the people 's money , but the chief difficulty has been rather the almost unvarying shortsightedness and wastefulness of well-meaning , but inexperienced or inefficient , legislators and administrators .

		A year or more ago certain students of govern - mental problems set up in
Washington	LOCATION	an Insti - tute for
Government Research	ORGANIZATION	, with a view not only to scientific investigation , but to the develop - ment of constructive plans for administrative im - provement in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Quite properly , the attention of this promising agency was turned first of all to the subject of finance .

		An admira - ble volume dealing with financial administration in
Great Britain	LOCATION	was published , and the excel - lences of the British budget system were duly emphasized .

		A second publication is no less important , al - though only a translation .

		The book chosen is Professor
Stourm	PERSON	's `` Le Budget , '' which for many years has been the standard treatise on the preparation of estimates , the voting of appropri - ations , and the collection of taxes .

		In
France	LOCATION	it has reached a seventh edition ; and it is safe to say that no book has been more influential in bringing to their present high efficiency the finan - cial systems of the western European nations .

		The volume has been little used in
America	LOCATION	, except by scholars .

		It should now come into the hands of numerous members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, state legisla - tures , municipal councils , and other spending bodies ; and while , perhaps unfortunately , large sections deal on technical lines with problems and methods which are peculiar to
France	LOCATION	, the Amer - ican official who can not find here a fund of in - dispensable information ought not to be in public office .

		Fundamentally , the fault in our fiscal administration lies with the people , who cling to the notion that the treasury exists for the satis - faction of local needs .

		It is too much to expect of the people generally that they read
Stourm	PERSON	's lengthy and rather dry book .

		Yet through in - creased use by publicists , office-holders , teachers , and students it will undoubtedly become a force in the gradual reshaping of public opinion on more wholesome lines , thereby justifying the con - fidence of those who are responsible for its ap - pearance in its present form .

		A
NATURALIST OF SOULS	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Gamaliel Bradford	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's title sounds a bit pompous , but he has an authority for it no less
august	DATE	than Sainte-Beuve : `` je suis un naturaliste des esprits . ''

		This phrase Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	condenses into the word `` psychographer , '' which , together with `` psychograph , '' he has `` not yet found courage to talk about , and even if I had , publishers and editors have not . ''

		Psychography is , however , explained .

		It differs from biography in that the latter `` is bound to present an elaborate sequence of dates , events and circumstances , of which some are merely required to make the narrative complete , '' while `` psychography selects only that which is indispensable for its particular purpose , i. e. , the attempt to portray character . ''

		This difference hardly seems important since good biography has often succeeded in portraying char - acter with no neglect of the events of the indi - vidual 's life .

		The word , together with the process it is supposed to designate , might be ignored were it not for Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's seriousness about it , and his feeling that it `` seemed to sum up processes that have been rather vaguely employed before and to give them a name which might be useful in attracting the attention of the jaded , 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	overloaded American reader . ''

		The possibility of using the word `` psychography '' for that purpose is amusingly pathetic .

		There follow , then , ten essays nine on men and one on `` The Novel Two Thousand Years Ago . ''

		Of the nine only three are psychographs in the finished state : those on the younger
Pliny	LOCATION	,
Ovid	LOCATION	, and Saint
Francis	PERSON	de Sales .

		The other six , on
Donne	PERSON	,
Leopardi	LOCATION	,
Anthony Trol	PERSON	- lope ,
Burton	PERSON	and his `` Anatomy of Melancholy , ''
Alexandra Dumas	PERSON	, and Clarendon , are attempts made before psychography was `` consciously working . ''

		The reader is grateful that it worked before it was conscious , for it is difficult to tell wherein the real psychographs may crow over their less dignified brethren .

		Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	writes the sort of essay that is born of enthusi - asm and affection , the sort that keeps one from sleep and the dining-table .

		If you know the man of whom he writes , you are delighted ; if you do not , you wish you did .

		He is a humble and not unsuccessful follower of the great , unconscious psychographers ,
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, Saint
Simon	PERSON	,
Sainte	PERSON	- Beuve , and , though he is not mentioned as such , R. L. S .

		THE EXPANSION OF
EUROPE	LOCATION	; THE CUL - MINATION OF MODERN HISTORY .

		By
Ram	ORGANIZATION	- say
Muir	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Professor
Muir	PERSON	's `` Expansion of
Europe	LOCATION	'' is a companion essay to his recently published `` Na - tionalism and Internationalism . ''

		It undertakes to describe , within the space of 230 pages , `` the sources and character of the great process by which , during the last four centuries , the whole world has been subjugated by the civilization of
Europe	LOCATION	, and its bearing upon the problems of the Great War . ''

		Naturally , there is no attempt at formal narrative ; and while the recent stages of colonial development are dealt with most fully , even the transformation of the British Empire between
1815	DATE	and
1878	DATE	is disposed of in less than two-score pages .

		Emphasis is laid on the motives , principles , and methods of colonial enter - prise , and on the influence of colonial undertak - ing upon the national and international politics of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The best portion of the book is that containing an analysis of colonial rivalries from
1878	DATE	to the outbreak of the present war , although even here there is no claim to the pre - sentation of either new facts or unfamiliar inter - pretations .

		The world ambitions of
Germany	LOCATION	are very fairly stated , and one will perhaps find nowhere a better brief exposition of the
Mittel	LOCATION	- Europa scheme and its international significance .

		Elsewhere the author gives expression to his somewhat contemptuous opinion of American foreign policy .

		Perhaps he is right in saying that it is only the British fleet that has prevented the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	from being seriously chal - lenged ; but his cavalier characterization of that doctrine , in its present form , as `` a haughty declaration that
Europe	LOCATION	has no concern with American affairs '' is not warranted by the facts .

		The book may be read profitably by persons who desire a rapid resume of the colonial and commer - cial rivalries of the great powers ; more serious students will find it of little value .

		MY FOUR YEARS IN
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		By
James W. Gerard	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 2	MONEY	.


Germany	LOCATION	's recent remarkable response to the call for a seventh war loan , a loan of no less than
twelve billion marks	MONEY	, gives timely emphasis to ex-Ambassador
Gerard	PERSON	's assertion that the power of the empire is still unbroken , that `` we stand in great peril , and only the exercise of ruthless realism can win this war for us . ''

		Real - ism in plenty will be found in his detailed ac - count of his four years in the country now so relentlessly at war with us , as with most of the rest of the civilized world .

		From the day of his appointment as our representative at
Berlin	LOCATION	to that of his departure from the German capi - tal with `` a clear conscience , '' as he says , `` and the knowledge that I had done everything pos - sible to keep the peace , '' he tells us the story of his diplomatic and social experiences ; and trying in the extreme some of them must have been , though no suspicion of a whine jars with the sprightliness of these chapters of seriously mo - mentous personal and official history .

		Varying here and there the autobiographic style are sun - dry informing reports on such topics as Ger - man militarism , the Zabern episode , the causes of the war , the treatment of prisoners , commer - cial and economic conditions , war charities , and German hate .

		Personal observation rather than abstract theory underlies all these chapters and makes them well worth reading .

		THE BATTLE WITH TUBERCULOSIS AND How TO WIN IT .

		By
D. Macdougall King	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Dr.
D. Macdougall King	PERSON	, having returned after being `` over the top '' in the war against consumption , was impressed with the fact that those who fall do so because they do not under - stand why certain things are necessary .

		He had a score of years ' experience in treating the other fellow , and then he had the years when he was the patient .

		He has written an unusually clear and helpful manual-at-arms for popular guid - ance .

		It is made clearer by the frequent use of simile , chiefly drawn from army life .

		He tells how the white cells of the body march to and fro in the trenches , and fall upon and destroy the germs of disease ; but if the white cells are im -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 461 poverished or overworked , they are unable to win a victory .

		`` You are the general and their des - tiny lies in your keeping . ''

		The tubercle bacilli are weak , and easily overcome if rightly attacked .

		If they have become established , it is because the patient is ignorant , and he had better go to a sanitarium for instruction .

		The second portion of the book is devoted to home treatment .

		Since nine out of ten have the disease at some time , and since failure to recover may be charged in many cases to the ignorant kindness of friends , it behooves all to study the principles involved in the battle , and not to wait until they are attacked .

		Only one criticism is to be made on the material .

		Milk pasteurized at 150 degrees is deprived of some of its nutritive value .

		The approved temperature is from 140 to 145 degrees .

		MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF BRITISH NORTH
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		Selected and edited by
Katherine Berry Judson	PERSON	.

		McClurg ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Since eyes were made for seeing , and read - ing , .

		.

		such a book as this has not much excuse for being .

		In the preface the author says , `` As in other volumes of this series , only the quaint , the pure , and the beautiful , has been taken from the tales of the Indians .

		Any one wishing pure ethnology , good and bad together , would do better to go to ethnological reports . ''

		The author then makes no pretensions to scien - tific appeal , and her readers will hardly find any literary interest in the hundred or so short , mis - cellaneous , and inchoate myths related from the legends of Canadian aborigines .

		Whether they are reductions , redactions , or translations does not appear .

		Neither is there any specific assign - ment of sources .

		The purpose of the book seems to be the entertainment of young people , but even for this modest design the sketchiness of the material and lack of developed unity leaves it inadequate .

		The photograph on the cover and several interior views carry the strong suggestion that here is a new variety and a rather clever one of railway advertising .

		THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF LEISURE .

		By
James Peyton Sizer	PERSON	.


Richard G. Bad	PERSON	- ger ; 75 cts .

		This little essay with an attractive title calls attention to a serious problem in modern life , serious despite its leisurely aspect .

		It brings forth the important consideration that amuse - ment and recreation are among the prominent and essential affairs of men .

		Amusement has become a huge business .

		Leisure is in itself a value approaching the highest good .

		A success - ful democracy must make leisure possible for the largest numbers .

		It must provide ways of using leisure which will advance as well as content human beings .

		The statement made by Mr.
Sizer	PERSON	shows how far from such a condition the actual relation stands .

		It shows , on every side , an exploitation of the need for recreation , and its vulgarization in cheap drama , dancing , mov - ing pictures , and `` amusement '' parks .

		The organization of leisure and recreation by the community is ably pointed out as one of the essen - tial duties of the true democratic state .

		A Study of His Life and Works and of His Place in Contempo - rary Culture .

		By
Oral Sumner Coad	PERSON	.

		Pub - lished by the
Dunlap Society	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		After a long period of inactivity the
Dunlap Society	ORGANIZATION	has brought out a new book .

		This is evi - dently another of the dissertations on American writers into which the department of English at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has of late been directing candidates for the doctorate , and it is one of the best of its class .

		Unfortunately , it falls occasionally into a cheaply journalistic style , which might well have been censored by the distinguished gentlemen to whom the author gives thanks for aid with the proof sheets .

		Like other young investigators , the author includes material acquired in the course of his study which , while new and inter - esting to him , is readily available elsewhere , and is not closely germane to his subject .

		Notwith - standing these faults he has done an exceedingly thorough and complete piece of research , and has prepared a sane and , on the whole , well-balanced book .

		The order and system of his presentation will be especially appreciated by those who know how completely
Dunlap	PERSON	's own non-dramatic writings lack these qualities .

		He has steered well between the danger of overpraising the subject of one 's thesis as a hero and that of shattering a traditional reputation by supercilious criticism .

		There is no gainsaying his judgment that
Dunlap	PERSON	was an imitator rather than a creator , and that he had no high literary gift , but was , as pioneer and innovator , a force of the first im - portance .

		If Dr.
Coad	PERSON	has not succeeded in making as vivid as might be wished the person - ality of a charming comrade and a likable ac - quaintance , this may be due in part to the paucity of materials at his disposal .

		The appendix con - tains a bibliography of
Dunlap	ORGANIZATION	's writings , and a partial list of his extant paintings .

		THE OPPRESSED ENGLISH .

		By
Ian Hay	PERSON	.

		Doubleday , Page ; 50 cts .

		A book the Englishman could never under - stand .

		How anyone could find material for a satire in his dislike of `` talking shop '' and `` put - ting on side '' would be beyond his comprehension .

		But Ian Hay does and , moreover , he makes very good use of that material .

		He points out with 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	evident glee that in the present war , the English soldier , as differentiated from the Scottish or Irish or Canadian one , never gets the credit for any daring deed or victory at the front , but let something go wrong at once it is the muddle - headed Englishman who is blamed .

		Mr.
Hay	PERSON	tells why he thinks this is so .

		In another chapter he gives the Englishman 's `` Secular Decalog '' and a typical American 's comment on it .

		He then proceeds to explain why it is the English can not settle the Irish question .

		As is apt to be the case with a book of this kind , Mr.
Hay	PERSON	's desire to make his humorous periods leads him sometimes to sacrifice the exact truth .

		He exaggerates the idiosyncrasies of the Englishman to make his satire carry over .

		Once you have forgiven that , however , you find the little book pleasant reading .

		ACROSS
FRANCE	LOCATION	IN WAR-TIMB .

		By
W. Fitzwater Wray	PERSON	.

		Dutton ; 50 cts .

		Across
France	LOCATION	in wartime is exactly where and when many of the adventurous or the curi - ous among us would like to travel .

		Mr.
Wray	PERSON	-LRB- Kuklos -RRB- , out of a newspaper job because of the war and unfit to serve as a soldier , finds both employment of time and sufficient excitement in a bicycle trip across
France	LOCATION	from St.
Malo	PERSON	east to Vitry-le Francois , the line of travel all lying south of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The author is wise enough to realize the advantages of travel on foot or cycle advantages like those of closer acquaintance with the country traversed and of passage over roads inaccessible to an automobile .

		He gives , in a rambling way , the story of suspicious peasants , deeming anyone a Prussian who is not French , of broken homes , of the difficulty of obtaining food in short all the usual joys and pains of such a trip .

		If you are the sort of person who wants to know what is just around that bend in the road , you will enjoy Mr.
Wray	PERSON	's story .

		LIFE AND TIMES OF
DAVID HUMPHREYS	PERSON	.

		By
Frank Landon Humphreys	PERSON	.

		Putnam 's ;
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		These two large and handsome volumes are an excellent example of what may be called monu - mental biography .

		They have been prepared with great pains to commemorate the life and virtues of a relative of the biographer ; and printer , illustrator , and binder have combined to give them a form that is dignified on the library shelves .

		A casual reader with endless time will find in them much of miscellaneous interest , and the scholar may make use of them by means of the excellent index .

		A hurried student forced to read them through will do so with many groan - ings .

		The author shows his thoroughness by including every bit of information that comes in his way .

		For example , he thinks it probable , though he has no certain proof , that
David Humphreys	PERSON	lived in
Connecticut Hall	LOCATION	, at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, in
1771	DATE	.

		This justifies a two-page history of that building , with a quotation from a contem - porary mention of the laying of the corner-stone in
1750	DATE	, and the added remark , `` It is not stated whether the ceremony was a purely academic and social one , or whether the ` Worshipful Master ' and his assistants were called upon to lay prop - erly the foundation stone . ''

		On this plan of telling all that is known , all that is conjectured , and all that is not known about the most irrele - vant things , the biography meanders along .

		The familiar story of
Arnold	LOCATION	's treason and the cap - ture and execution of Major Andre is told at length , to conclude with the statement : `` The part borne in these transactions by Col.
Humph	PERSON	- reys does not appear from any available docu - ments .

		But as one of the
General	ORGANIZATION	's aides and a personal friend of Col.
Wadsworth	PERSON	he un - doubtedly went to
Hartford	LOCATION	, where his knowl - edge of French was probably of service . ''

		Indeed , without the words `` undoubtedly '' and `` prob - ably '' the author could hardly have got through the first volume .

		In the latter part of the work more corre - spondence is available , and the facts can be stated more definitely ; though of the letters given here two-thirds add nothing to our knowledge of
Humphreys	PERSON	, and most of them have been printed elsewhere .

		All known facts regarding
David Humphreys	PERSON	's life could very likely have been told in fifty pages , and all really significant parts of his letters and of letters to him given in one hun - dred pages more .

		Since the author has done a monumental biography so well it may be unfair to complain that he did not choose to do another kind ; but such a choice would have been a clear saving of 850 pages to the reader .

		Except for one or two slips that may be chargeable to the printer the work seems accurate and scholarly .

		It dwells especially on the relations between
Humphreys	PERSON	and
Washington	LOCATION	, not only while Col.
Humphreys	PERSON	was aide-de-camp to the Com - mander-in-Chief during the Revolution , but un - til
Washington	LOCATION	's death .

		It also gives full details of
Humphreys	ORGANIZATION	's career as minister to
Portugal	LOCATION	and to
Spain	LOCATION	, and his efforts to clear up the Al - gerian complications .

		His later public-spirited devotion to the improvement of sheep-breeding and of the manufacture of woolen cloth are pre - sented fully , though less emphatically .

		Those who remember
David Humphreys	PERSON	chiefly as one of the `` Hartford Wits '' may be surprised at the relatively small amount of space devoted to his literary work , though after the chapter of ``
Humphreys	PERSON	's Writings '' little remains to be said .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 463 NOTES ON NEW FICTION Any reader who has hoped that sometime he might have the opportunity to make the amende honorable to
Edna Ferber	PERSON	has it now .

		If you have found yourself led along protestingly , how - ever divertingly , through Miss
Ferber	PERSON	's previous writings ; if you have had an uncomfortable feel - ing that perhaps your author did not quite respect her reader , her art , or herself , here comes the chance to change your mind , to alter your atti - tude toward one of the most up-and-coming of our present-day fictionists .

		`` Fanny Herself '' -LRB-
Stokes	LOCATION	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- is the most serious , extended , and dignified of Miss
Ferber	PERSON	's books .

		Its first half , in particular , is quite the best work that the creator of
Emma McChesney	PERSON	has done .

		The earlier stages of the career of
Fanny Brandeis	ORGANIZATION	her advance from the small bazaar in ``
Winne	PERSON	- bago , ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, to an important position in a big mail-order house in
Chicago	LOCATION	is full of unc - tion , verve and passion .


Molly Brandeis	PERSON	,
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's mother , who dominates this portion of the book , is even better than her daughter .

		Later on the author succumbs to that necessary but trouble - some thing , a plot .

		The head of the mail-order house shows himself objectionable , if not danger - ous ; and a clever young newspaper man of
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's own race and own home town leads her to peace and safety .

		He rescues her from a career of business and business only , and aids her to realize herself as a woman and not as the mere head of a department an ending which the trend and tone of the story had seemed to threaten .

		`` Fanny Herself '' is a vivid , vital , full-blooded book ; dealing with `` big business '' and the ascent of a forceful and persistent race , it is more suc - cessful than some of its kind in avoiding essential offences to ideality and taste .

		In `` The High Heart , '' by Basil King -LRB- Harper ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , the heroine decides to live according to the principle that right will always conquer , and she is ever irritatingly sure of the righteousness of her cause , particularly when she engages herself to the son of a rich family who abhor the match .

		The head of this family , the `` Great Dispenser , '' as the author wittily calls him , looks upon himself as the divinely authorized arbiter of all his children 's lives .

		His self-conceit is sadly damaged when he discovers that his second wife , whom he loves with all the fervor of his sixty years , is faithless .

		She exchanges a promise of good behavior for his consent to the engagement of his son to the poor heroine , and then the latter immediately discovers that her affections are really placed elsewhere , so that the sacrifice is wasted .

		This book , by virtue of the author 's perhaps unconscious talent for writing , just escapes being platitudinous .

		It is a pity that
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	should waste her efforts on intellectual cream-puffs .

		A great deal of the psychology in `` The Second Fiddle '' -LRB- Century ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- is accurate ; but where could such happy endings possibly evolve ?

		And how could one lovely , normal girl be all but sur - rounded by a set of caricatures ?

		Any romantic young lady could tell you at the end of the first thirty pages who is going to get the charming Sir
Julian	PERSON	in the end .

		The effect is not lessened by a change of nomenclature a proof-reader 's oversight from `` Sir Richard '' to `` Sir
Julian	PERSON	. ''

		It is not fair for
Miss Bottome	LOCATION	to subsidize her gifts to the Ladies ' Market .

		`` We Ca n't Have Everything , '' by
Rupert Hughes	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Harper ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is a misnomer , for the various personages get what they wish , and that is `` everything . ''

		The book is a plea for quick and easy divorce .

		A lovely girl is married to a mere man .

		She is loved by an athlete .

		The hus - band , for his part , ties himself tightly to the bows and bells of a dancer .

		The wife , in defiance of her pastor 's wishes , finally obtains her release , just as the athlete finds himself obliged to marry an actress of the movies already twice married .

		In the end the reader is n't sure just who is married .

		The whole , in its sly sex-suggestiveness and apparent frankness about ostensibly vital problems , is quite characteristic of
Rupert Hughes	ORGANIZATION	.

		The war has put an end to the existence of many fads , but
Mary Fisher	PERSON	deems some of them still strong enough and harmful enough to write a story about .

		In `` The Treloars '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , we meet the editor of a frankly anar - chistic literary journal , the newspaper worker with ideals -LRB- soon snuffed out -RRB- , the woman who believes that home is woman 's only proper sphere , the spoiled actress who likes being loved and does not mind making a slave of some sus - ceptible man , the angelic maiden who finally wins the only man after the actress dies , and two controversial old men .

		All the personages are suitably downhearted , but almost every one finds salvation in the war .

		What a godsend the war has been to lazy or unimaginative novelists !

		With it they can cut every Gordian knot .

		But even so , sending the offending personages off to war is certainly less cruel than killing them .


Ethel M. Kelley	PERSON	's first novel , `` Turn About Eleanor '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , will attract the favorable attention of those who want an old - fashioned story about new-fashioned people .

		It is old-fashioned in this day of typewriter-made fiction because it is full of common sense and good workmanship .

		There is more than an amusing plot , there are real ideas in it , as well as flesh and blood and brain characters .

		The story concerns a group of young New Yorkers who , fired by the zeal of a young collegian , de - 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 8	DATE	termine to find a `` worthy purpose '' in life .

		That purpose is discovered in the adoption of ten-year - old
Eleanor	PERSON	.

		Anyone who ever had a child or wanted one will follow the ensuing experiences with the keenest enjoyment .

		Eleanor spends a month with each of her foster parents in turn .

		Each of them tries to mould her character in accordance with his pet preconceptions and gets moulded himself !

		Miss
Kelley	PERSON	knows how to tell a story and she has a sparkling wit .

		The book is the sort that one passes on to a friend .

		The scene of `` Temperamental Henry , '' by
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	-LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is very plainly
Evanston	LOCATION	twenty or twenty-five years ago .

		Henry is a boy of eighteen who falls in love with every girl he meets .

		For one tragic climax he starts out to
New York City	LOCATION	with the intention of seeing his present lady-love off to
Europe	LOCATION	, but meets a siren on the train who soon incites him to get rid of his last penny , with most humiliating consequences .

		The boy 's violent introspections and his barometric self-conceit are both funny and pathetic .

		Twenty-five years ago , if a stranger travelled through the
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountains , he was as likely as not to be taken for a revenue officer , and be summarily escorted from the country or disposed of in some less gentle way .

		To-day the mountain children no longer hide behind the house at the sight of a `` furriner , '' and coal , the railroads , and settlement schools have among them almost transformed the mountains to the guise of civilization .

		But there is still a place the other side of the divide from any railroad , where men who live a mile or two from their neighbors will say , `` Law , hit 's noisy enough fer me right hyer ! ''

		It is from these places that
John Fox , Jr.	PERSON	, draws the material for his new collection of stories , `` In Happy Valley '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Happy Valley harbors a mission school where St.
Hilda	PERSON	, its founder , has created a social nucleus for the mountain people , where they may send their `` young uns '' to get learning , and where they may go themselves for help .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	takes the keenest literary enjoyment in telling his tales of shootings , weddings , preach - ings , and other mountain ceremonies among the people whose ways and speech he knows so well .

		The inspiration that he seemed to draw from those earlier days at the Gap , when the moun - tains were really what one imagines the moun - tains to be , is somewhat dimmed , just as the mountain character has acquired a veneer of outer-worldliness .

		But the point is that he sees below the surface into the real lives of his people , and that he enriches mere incident with the warmth that comes from an appreciation of the values from which it springs .

		CASUAL , OOMMI N i WHO , BEFORE THE OUTBREAK OF THE GREAT WAR , was the leading advocate of international conciliation and pacificism in the
United States	LOCATION	?

		Who constantly and with curious insistence repre - sented to his countrymen the
German Kaiser	PERSON	as the true friend of peace , the ideal statesman , the genial family man and devoted scholar ?

		Who never tired of praising the German system of government and spread far and wide the gospel of its perfection ?

		Who wore upon his breast the
Kaiser	PERSON	's decoration and boasted of the imper - ial favors bestowed upon him ?

		Who spent
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	's enormous peace funds right and left hiring speakers , organizing pacifist soci - eties in our colleges , and paying teachers to go to summer schools all over the country prop - agating the doctrines of international concilia - tion ?

		Who demanded government ownership of munition works in order to remove the most insidious militarist influence from American poli - tics ?

		Who first fell upon the German professors after the outbreak of war and denounced them for their intolerance , their blind patriotism , and their undiscriminating allegiance to the Kaiser ?

		Who permitted the militaristic trustees of his institution of `` learning '' to subject to a humiliat - ing inquisition in
1916	DATE	two professors accused of pacific leanings ?

		Who permitted his trustees to pass and make public resolutions calling for a degrading inquiry into the views of the teaching force and then went South to play golf ?

		Who drove out of his institution a young instructor who was one of his own paid peace propagan - dists ?

		Who defamed and misrepresented two professors of pacifist leanings and called upon the mob to crucify them ?

		Who has now flung aside his `` convictions '' on international concilia - tion and become the chief witch-burner and heresy-hunter in
America	LOCATION	?

		Answer : The man who occupies the exalted office of president of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` YESTERDAY , '' WRITES A FRIEND OF THE DIAL , in
Paris	LOCATION	, `` I revisited the city .

		It is changed beyond recognition .

		The houses and shops are of course the same , and
Lahaye	PERSON	, mine host of the Cafe de
Paris	LOCATION	, as formerly , never fails to stir the ice at the bottom of his glass as he remarks , ` Here 's another the Prussians wo n't get . '

		But Dessertenne and Develoy and all the ox and cow dealers of the countryside are down and out .

		.

		The Americans , now two months gone , hold the country .

		They came up , they looked it over , they settled down .

		They own the railway station , in spite of the station-master , whom they sent out to pasture politely .

		They own the streets , peopling them with camions and
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 465 automobiles and side-cars .

		They own the cafes , eating and drinking in them a la quick-lunch , without allowing anybody to waste their time .

		They own the fields ; brick and iron barracks come up and cover the banks of the river .

		The drill-ground is theirs ; batallions drill from morn - ing to evening and entrain with an air that tells onlooking poilus ` Now , then , look sharp .

		They 're at it . '

		And the women are theirs ; I hear that the ladies look at them , lips puckered , and that all the young girls are dreaming of mar - rying Americans .

		But do n't imagine the natives are angry at being jostled and shaken up and shoved out by this invasion .

		Oh , no !

		The abo - rigines hold a corner on it , if I may say so , quite closed up .

		` Ai n't they the rascals ! '

		they keep saying .

		And when a Morvandiau deigns to call somebody a rascal , he 's using , I assure you , his superlative of enthusiasm . ''

		HOW IS CRITICISM TO REMAIN INFALLIBLE in spite of the fallibility of the critic ?

		The ques - tion is posed by a literary editor .

		In fiction , we are reminded , the critic 's `` great personal enjoy - ment '' may be `` excited to the highest degree by a
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	story , while `
Anna Karenina	PERSON	, ' we will say , might leave him quite calm .

		And yet he would be perfectly honest as a literary critic in recommending the `
Anna Karenina	PERSON	' novel much more highly than the detective story and this in spite of the fact that he enjoyed reading the detective story much more than he did `
Anna Karenina	PERSON	' . ''

		The study of literature has furnished the critic with `` perfectly definite laws '' by which to distribute praise and blame .

		What a nightmarish possibility !

		The `` laws '' apparently enable the critic to regenerate his readers while leaving his own nature unregen - erate .

		Could there be a more irritating paradox ?

		THE LITERARY EVENT OF THE PAST FORT - NIGHT was , of course , the appearance of the two unfinished novels by
Henry James	PERSON	.

		To the intrinsic interest of the volumes there is added the further interest of the workman 's notes , swift jottings that trace the evolution of the theme and the successive modifications it took on under the eager play of his mind .

		To those who love letters , such intimate revelations are al - ways precious .

		Whatever one may think of the durability of the vast fictional structure James reared , a question we shall certainly hear tossed about in the next few months , there can be no doubt of his impressiveness as an artist .

		He was unique and he was inspiring .

		Glance at these hasty , and yet always fastidious , notes `` the overflow into talk of an artist 's amorous plan '' and you are forced to realize anew how entirely
James	PERSON	had brought all his powers to a focus in the task of creation .

		Every impulse was subordinated , every activity tribu - tary , to the main stream of his interest .

		The problems he set himself were never easy , and they were never slighted .

		He seems even to have delighted in accumulating difficulties as he went along , in an effort to reveal more and ever more aspects of the repercussion of moods and the clash of temperaments .

		He recorded copiously and with the merciless minuteness of a man who has all the time there is , and yet one sees that what he wanted always to give was the utmost truth possible never mere subtlety .

		The prize he set himself was , to use his own words , `` to achieve the lucidity with the complexity . ''

		He did n't always succeed ; some of the complexities he saw or imagined could never have been made lucid ; but there is no doubt that he did his best .

		And he achieved in doing it a complete individu - ality as a writer .

		Such absorption as he revealed may seem a little idolatrous , inhuman in the wide area of experience it excluded , but it gives you the figure of the artist who is content to be that and nothing else .

		And such a figure can not but be imposing .

		THERE is A CERTAIN RESPLENDENT
MAGA	PERSON	- ZINE , published in the only `` cosmopolitan centre '' in these states , which has for its special care the fashioning of our nascent aristocracy .

		It is almost invariably patient and helpful , having regard to the rawness and stubbornness of the material with which it is condemned to work , and it can be informative on a vast range of topics touching the orthodoxies of the decorous life , such as hats , walking sticks , tea-table embel - lishments -LRB- including conversation -RRB- , and so on .

		Literature and the arts are by no means over - looked .

		For example , `` There are only two requirements for greatness in a work of art : it must set forth material that is momentous , in accordance with a method that is masterly .

		In the first place , the artist must have something to say ; and , in the second place , he must know how to say it . ''

		Or again : `` In any really great work material and method are so completely married that it is impossible for analytic critics to divorce them .

		The thing said and the way of saying it are one and inseparable .

		The genius of such supreme artists as Phidias ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Velas	PERSON	- quez ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	is identical with their talent . ''

		There are those who main - tain that a passion for the cliche is inborn , while others hold that it can be readily acquired along with the traditional culture .

		As long as the latter theory is not absolutely discredited , and tolerance of platitude remains the true mark of caste , our neighbor does right to persevere .

		BRIEFER MENTION To compare such opposite studies of feminine philosophy as
Anna Walther	PERSON	's `` Around the World with a Milliner 's Needle '' -LRB-
Stokes	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , and
Margaret Sherwood	PERSON	's `` Familiar Ways '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , seems impossible ; yet they have a predominate element in common , selfishness .

		Miss
Walther	PERSON	, after achieving success in everything in her career except a marriage with her super - cilious adorer , turns petulantly from her selfish agnosticism to an equally selfish faith in
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss Sherwood dilates peacefully on the joys of detached bachelor existence where the question of bird species is second only to that of bulbs .

		Yet the first of these volumes is brilliant in color and vivid in movement ; and the second is notable for grace of expression .

		It is refreshing in these will-o ' - the-wisp days of spiritualistic gleams over quagmires of doubt , to come across a series of short , sincere essays in Christianity , which really indicate a thoughtful and wholesome outlook on present-day affairs .

		`` The Other Side of the Hill , '' by

		The first element in physical slovenliness , ac - cording to

		Setting-up exercises are greatly aided by first training the muscles of the feet and chest .

		All the exercises advised by Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	may be taken at home , and without special apparatus .

		His directions are made clearer by the use of half-tone reproductions from weird composite photographs , reminding one of pictures of Vishnu .

		The plain , common-sense general advice and com - ment is of great value to any man or woman , and would add to efficiency .

		It is doubtless because
Thoreau	PERSON	devoted him - self to nature throughout the year , while most of us are campers and trampers only in the fair - weather months , that his editors like to group his writings according to the seasons .

		We have long had volumes of extracts from his journals bear - ing the titles `` Spring , '' `` Summer , '' `` Autumn , '' `` Winter . ''

		`` Through the Year with
Thoreau	PERSON	, '' by
Herbert W. Gleason	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- , a new and attractive gift-book commemorative of the centenary year , gives briefer selections on the same plan , illustrated with half-tones from photographs which Mr.
Gleason	PERSON	has secured by retracing for years the rambles of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	in
Concord	LOCATION	and vicinity .

		Except for a pleasantly - written and sanely appreciative introduction and a very few footnotes ,
Thoreau	PERSON	and these pictures speak for themselves .

		The illustrations are worthy of the poet-naturalist in that they include not merely the conventional landscapes and `` pretty '' flowers , but less usual and less promising subjects , such as the skunk-cabbage , fungi , icicles under a bank , and the `` sand-foliage '' produced by liquid mud on the snow in the railroad cut .

		It is inter - esting to note how an art wholly unknown when the author lived that of photo-engraving aids in the interpretation and appreciation of what he
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 467 wrote .

		It may well be that he would have dis - approved of a process with so large an element in it of the mechanical .

		But Mr.
Gleason	PERSON	has put into his photographs as much of an artist 's indi - viduality as the wielder of a camera can well do , and it is evident that in making and selecting these pictures he has been engaged in a patient labor of love .

		For those who are desirous of a handbook which summarizes in clear , if dull , English the traditional ideas entertained by liberals , `` Religious Thought of the Greeks from Homer to the Triumph of Christianity , '' Mr.
Clifford Herschel Moore	PERSON	's Low - ell lectures on the subject , will give satisfaction .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is professor of Latin in
Harvard Uni	LOCATION	- versity , and his lectures are printed under the ru - bric above set forth , by the
Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		They deal in succession with Homer and Hesiod ,
Orphism	PERSON	, Pythagoreanism and the Mys - teries , religion in the poets of the fifth and sixth centuries , the same in
Athens	LOCATION	of the fifth century , in
Plato	LOCATION	and in
Aristotle	LOCATION	, and the religious philoso - phies of their successors .

		In addition there are a clarifying exposition of the cultural relations be - tween
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, a discussion of oriental re - ligions in the western half of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	, an orthodoxly liberal survey of Christianity , and a dis - cussion of the influence of paganism on Christianity .

		The learning exhibited in the book is solid and un - imaginative , the style too much that of the class - room , dull but informing .

		They do these themes better in

W. S. Williams	PERSON	, in a little book entitled `` The Problem of the Unemployed '' -LRB- Badger ;

		The author himself does not separate them carefully .

		He places special emphasis on the effect of industrial conditions .

		The brief statement of methods of solving the problem in
Europe	LOCATION	is supplemented with suggestions for
America	LOCATION	.

		Here again one is struck with the failure to utilize standard discussions of this subject , for example , the programme of pre - vention presented by the
American Association for Labor Legislation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though not so announced on the title-page , `` The American Public Library , '' by
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- , is a new edition , revised and brought up to date , of the original work published
seven years ago	DATE	.

		But the printing on the wrapper and a supplementary paragraph in the preface , pro- claim this fact .

		As a matter of mechanical neces - sity , no doubt , the revisions and additions have limited themselves to such changes as could be made , here and there , without requiring any con - siderable resetting or recasting of the pages , so that the former pagination is retained , except that two pages have been added to the index .

		The table of contents of the first edition has also been reprinted without change , though a few of its details do not apply to the new edition , and a few details in the new edition find no place in the re - printed table of contents .

		Among alterations made necessary by recent developments , several of im - portance arrest attention in the chapter on `` The Library and the State . ''

		A useful list of American library periodicals takes the place of the old list of library dubs , and the statistical table of
A. L. A.	PERSON	meetings is lengthened by eight entries .

Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The author has brought together many of the important conclu - sions which Shakespearean scholars have arrived at during the past ten years .

		Thus , although often fresh and scarcely ever superficial , the volume appeals more to the general reader than to trained students of

		Professor
Warren K. Moorehead	PERSON	is known to archaeologists through his former work on `` The Stone Age in

		In his new volume `` Stone Ornaments of the American Indian '' -LRB- An - dover Press -RRB- , he attempts to draw conclusions from the distribution of ornamental stones as to the di - rection of migration of the Indians .

		After investi - gating nearly 12,000 specimens of problematical forms in ornamental stones Professor
Moorehead	PERSON	concludes that the centre of their distribution is the region
Illinois-New York	LOCATION	.

		If the Indian had come from the
East	LOCATION	, one would expect to find problem - atical ornamental stones in western
United States	LOCATION	.

		Since we do not , it is more conceivable that the migration was from west to east , and that the tribes which settled in the East developed these problematical ornamental forms as a separate cul - tural affair .

		The volume is beautifully illustrated and makes interesting reading .

		The woodcuts are of remarkable importance and completeness , commenc - ing with the earliest xylographs that is , the `` Apoc - alypsis , '' `` Ars Memorandi , '' `` Ars Moriendi , '' `` Biblia Pauperum , '' and `` Speculum Humanae Sal - vationis . ''

James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, the Hoosier poet , written to Miss Bottsford , an
Indiana	LOCATION	school teacher , now dead , mention of whose sale to
Gabriel Wells	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, appeared in a recent issue of THE DIAL , and which were resold to a well-known private collector , have been sought by relatives of Mr.
Riley	PERSON	.

		They got into communication with the present owner of the letters , and tried to purchase them from him .

		His answer was that he intended to keep the letters , but that he was willing to have relatives of the poet look over the correspondence and reach an agreement whereby some of the letters , containing things which ought not to be preserved , should be destroyed .

		Mr.
Riley	PERSON	's relatives claim that no one except the publisher of
Riley	PERSON	's writings has the right to print publicly or on a private press any of these unpublished letters .

		Three holograph letters of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	have recently come into the possession of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

Clarkson Stanfteld	PERSON	, marine and landscape painter and a friend of
Dick	PERSON	- ens. One , dated
April 30 , 1844	DATE	, concerns a dinner on behalf of a sanitarium for students and artists in which
Dickens	PERSON	was interested .

		Dickens says : The dinner is to comprise the new feature of ladies dining at the tables with the gentlemen not looking down upon them from the gallery .

		It will be very brilliant and cheerful .

		A second letter , dated
May 25 , 1849	DATE	, is signed `` The Misconceived One . ''

		In part it reads : No-no-no , Murder , murder !

		Madness and miscon - ception .

		Any one of those subjects not the whole .

		Oh , blessed star of
early morning	TIME	, what do you think that I am made of that I should on the part of any man prefer such a pig-headed , calf-eyed , donkey - eared master 's request .

		Says my friend to me , `` Will you ask your friend , Mr.
Stanfield	PERSON	, what the damage of a little picture of that one would be , that I may treat myself with the same if I can afford it ? ''

		Says I : `` I will . ''

		Says he , `` Will you suggest that I should like it to be one of those subjects ? ''

		Says I , `` I will . ''

		I am beating my head against the door with grief and frenzy and shall continue to do so until I receive your answer .

		The third letter is dated
January 9 , 1844	DATE	, and is signed `` Philo Forecastle . ''

		It reads in part : I was coming up to you today , but was detained abroad until dinner time , swearing affidavits against a gang of robbers , who have been pirating the ``
Carol	PERSON	, '' and against whom the most energetic venge - ance of the inimitable B. is solemnly -LRB- and lawfully -RRB- directed .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 471 LE GALLIENNE RARITIES -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
MacKay	PERSON	's inquiry about rarities by Rich - ard Le Gallienne , on page 360 of your issue of
October 11	DATE	, was of special interest to me in view of the fact that during the
summer	DATE	I was forced to be concerned with the work of Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	in connection with the forthcoming little book on his poetry in the `` Contemporary American Poet Series . ''

		The six items remarked are undoubtedly rarities .

		It would be presumptuous for me to think of add - ing to them as I am in no sense a specialist in bibliography .

		The reader not quite so expert , how - ever , might be willing to bear with some mention of publications almost if not quite so rare as those that Mr.
MacKay	PERSON	remarks .

		I should by all means remark `` My Ladies ' Son - nets '' -LRB- privately printed ,

1887	DATE	-RRB- .

		`` Vol - umes in Folio '' -LRB-
C. E. Mathews	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	,
1888	DATE	-RRB- is not at all a common acquaintance .

		`` The Book - Bills of Narcissus '' first appeared in
1891	DATE	and sub - sequently in editions in various other years .

		A copy of any early edition should be a prized possession .

		`` Fifty Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam '' -LRB- The Philos - opher Press ,

1901	DATE	-RRB- and `` The Beau - tiful Lie of
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB-

		Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	has been such a prolific writer and has contributed to so many different periodicals that someone else will doubtless be able to go much farther than I in answer to Mr.
MacKay	PERSON	's question .

		Very truly yours , BENJAMIN BRAWLEY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Under date of
October 18	DATE	I wrote with refer - ence to Mr.
MacKay	PERSON	's inquiry in THE DIAL about works by
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	.

		It happens that I have just received from Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	a let - ter bearing on some of the items in question .

		`` My Ladies ' Sonnets , '' and other `` vain amato - rious verses , with some of graver mood , '' termed by the author `` a very boyish production , '' was pri - vately printed in
Liverpool	LOCATION	in
1887	DATE	.

		The booklet should now be very valuable .

		Peter
Nansen	PERSON	's `` Love 's Trilogy , '' noted in some catalogues , was not translated by Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	himself , but by his second wife ,
Julie Le Gallienne	PERSON	; hence it does not properly come into a consideration of the poet 's work at all .

		`` The Beautiful Lie of
Rome	LOCATION	'' was originally published in
England	LOCATION	.


W. F. Mansfield	PERSON	published a small edition in

		In the spirit of see - ing the world `` before being anchored by matri - mony '' and with little but confidence in the supply of jobs to sustain them , they made the grand tour , and the account is none the less interesting because of a youthful egoism and naive sense of humor .

		The author , Dr.
J. E. Wallace Wallin	PERSON	, is director of the psycho-educational clinic of the board of education of

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Lind	PERSON	- say writes : `` I attended a negro church when I was last in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and some of the spirit of the sermons we heard went into
Samson	PERSON	; and the process of conversion and repentance is , I hope , an honest and reverent record of what hap - pened before us .

		`` After coming home I heard a negro sermon on
Jerusalem	LOCATION	whose refrain every few minutes was , ` Let Jerusalem be coming into your mind . '

		An - other day I heard , amid a general exhortation , this outburst : ` There was a Russian revolution yesterday , and my Lord is riding high . '

		`` I have used these phrases , I hope , in the same spirit that they were originally uttered .

		The fundamental difficulty of negro sermon poems of this type is that there is a profound seriousness of passion in the midst of things at which the out - sider is fairly entitled to smile ; and when a white man tries to render this seriousness and this humor at the same time , he is apt to be considered more of a humorist than a sermonizer .

		The negroes are perfectly willing to laugh a little on the way up to glory , and , unlike the white man , they do not have to stop going up while they laugh . ''

		Mr.
Hartley Withers	PERSON	, director of financial in - quiries in the
British Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, has written a little book , `` Our Money and the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has gone into its sixth edition in
England	LOCATION	, and is now brought out here by
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the preface he says : `` The present war , by making us spend with such Titanic recklessness , has supplied us with a huge magnifying glass by which cause and effect are more clearly seen than in times of peace .

		The results of borrowing , in - flation of currency , and inequalities of taxation are seen at work now on such a scale that if we use the experiences of the war aright they may help us to better financial methods when the war is over . ''

		Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	gives an account of how `` On the Right of the British Line '' came to be written and published : `` Four of us were dining at the
Athenaeum Club	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	in
February 1917	DATE	.

		One of the party was a young British captain who had been absolutely blinded and after - wards taken prisoner by the Germans in the righting on the Somme front .

		He was the most cheerful one of the party , and his narrative of his experiences was full of intense interest .

		When we went into the smoking room he said very quietly : ` Look here , you fellows .

		I can hear from your voices that you are pitying me because I am blind .

		Do n't pity me .

		Congratulate me because I am alive . '

		I urged him to write down some of the wonderful things he had been telling us ... He wrote the story and I brought the manuscript to
America	LOCATION	and took it to the publisher .

		This is how Captain
Nobb	PERSON	's book `` On the Right of the British Line ' came to be brought out here by the

		A Dividend in War Time for DIAL Subscribers When I purchased THE DIAL eighteen months ago , I believed there was in
America	LOCATION	a public which would support a progressive , independent journal of criticism .

		That assumption has been justified not only by the response of subscribers , but also by the splendid cooperation of the lead - ing thinkers and writers .

		The following letter from Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	is but one of many inspired by the new editorial policy of THE DIAL : `` Not only the
Middle West	LOCATION	but the country is to be congratulated on the development which is going on in THE DIAL .

		It is rapidly becoming a national influence , a journal to be reckoned with by those who think , especially because of its combination of honest informed book reviews with humane and pro- gressive social policies , and , not least , good writing , hard hitting , tolerant , straightforward writing proceeding from an imaginative vision . ''

		Now that THE DIAL is established editorially , the next step in its career is the securing of a wider reading public .

		It would be comparatively easy to secure increased circulation by means of advertising , but I prefer to spend that money in further improving THE DIAL .

		Consequently I am ask - ing the cooperation of our readers in doubling our circulation before
January 1st	DATE	.

		Attached to this letter is a scheme whereby each DIAL sub - scriber may benefit not only THE DIAL but him - self in this cooperation .

		THE 3 jf ortmgftflp journal of 3Uterarp Criticism , Discussion , anb information .

		Realism in
Prose Fiction Prose	ORGANIZATION	fiction is the vehicle par excellence for a realistic ideal .

		But I wish to call special attention to a somewhat embar - rassing feature of the realistic technique of nearly all prose fiction , further to sug - gest a method not a wholly new one for the development of a fictional technique that differs materially from the normal , excelling it , in my opinion , in its purely psychological possibilities .

		If one rum - mages in his memory of short stories and novels , such of them as can be fairly conceded to strive for realism , he will , I believe , be prepared to admit the justice of a somewhat unexpected thesis , that those succeed best in giving a sense of the flow and depth of life , in attaining both outer and inner realism , that do with the smallest number of essential characters , or , to put it rather differently , that do not attempt to individualize all the characters with equal care .

		The thesis will not hold rig - orously , to be sure , but in a large way it undoubtedly possesses much truth .

		In the measure that it is sound , it is merely the symptom of a wider principle , which we shall define in a moment .

		What gives a play its power of realistic illusion ?

		Evidently the simple fact that the action and dialogue are directly re - vealed to us , not left to the imagination .

		This means that we can readily identify ourselves with the various characters as they follow one another .

		Being passive spectators , our minds work kaleidoscopi - cally without serious effort , without too great an exercise of creative imagination .

		The drama is predigested food .

		For the lyric poem a greater degree of creative imagination is required of the reader .

		He must identify the mood of the poem with a potential mood of his own .

		As a rule , he is aided in this task by the singleness of the mood represented .

		Economy of attention makes for strength and vividness of mood-realization .

		Thus , the essential technique of both the drama and the lyric makes it a simple matter for us to live through the experiences that the artist aims to have us feel and sense with him .

		What are the tacit assumptions in fic - tion ?

		Generally speaking , the writer does not identify himself , and through himself the reader , with a central character alone but claims an unconditional omniscience .

		He enters with equal freedom into the psy - chic privacy of all his characters .

		His outlook upon the events and motives that comprise the narrative seems to be directed now by one of his characters , now by another .

		This conventional omniscience of the author 's goes by the name of objec - tivity .

		It is a power that the reader is supposed to share with him ; indeed , it is considered so much of a sine qua non in the art of story-telling that it can hardly be said to be generally recognized as a tacit assumption at all .

		The reader , at the mercy of his omniscient guide , turns one imaginative somersault after another .

		Hardly has he ensconced himself with some degree of comfort in the head and heart of one individual , hardly has he begun to feel the warmth of vicarious self-consciousness , when he is mercilessly bundled out of his retreat and required to take up new quarters .

		Incidentally he is asked to cut his former self dead , at any rate to exhibit no more than a purely external acquaintance with him .

		Needless to say , he may be called upon at any moment to race back into his old skin , or even to adopt a third alias , a fourth in - deed , there is no limit to the demands made upon his reincarnative capacity but the charity of the writer .

		All this makes good gymnastics for the reader , and he develops a flexible , bouncing multi-person - ality that keeps him ever alert .

		There is not one of us who has not rejoiced in the exhilaration of the exercise .

		But let us not forget that the test of a truly realistic technique is the relative ease with which the reader or hearer or spec - tator can be made to live ^ through the experiences , thoughts , feelings of the 504 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	characters .

		He must himself be these personalities and develop as them .

		In the drama , as we have seen , this self-identifica - tion with a number of personalities is rendered a comparatively easy matter by the very nature of dramatic technique .

		In fiction , however , it requires a more distinct effort of the imagination to project oneself into a character 's soul life .

		To do this for several characters and to shift rapidly about from one psyche to another may be fatiguing .

		More than that , it is , psy - chologically considered , a not altogether convincing procedure .

		Once we have iden - tified ourselves with a definite personality , our imaginative pride demands , provided always that the artist can hold our interest , that we be left to the isolation imposed by our new shell , that we watch the progress of events from our own point of vantage and follow the psychic lives of the other characters , not as revealed by themselves , but as affecting or as reflected in the soul that we have made our own .

		If the artist chooses to impose this limitation on the narrative form , two things inevitably re - sult .

		The arena crowded with significant characters , one of the features of the older , romantic and semi-realistic , types of fiction , becomes an impossibility .

		It is significant of a striving for a subtler understanding of reality that modern fiction has , on the whole , progressively moved away from this crowding of the arena .

		Further , the degree of individualization of the charac - ters needs to be carefully shaded .

		It will not do to bring them all into the foreground , for that would belie our naive outlook on our environment .

		The self stands strong - est in the light .

		Further removed are a small number of individualities whose lives are closely interwoven with that of the self but whose inner experiences can only be inferred , sometimes truly -LRB- that is , in a manner roughly coinciding with the view - points of their own selves -RRB- , more often mistakenly .

		Still further removed are a larger number of personalities whose inner life is of little or no consequence to the central self , whose only function is to lend dash and color to the stream of daily experience that makes up the outer life of this self .

		And in the dim background bob up and down the merest ghosts of psychic entities , pale gleams , fragments of a sug - gested multitudinous world beyond .

		So we are fated by self-consciousness and the limitations of attention to live our life .

		So we may be made to live an imagined world at the artist 's bidding .

		This psychic perspective is of greater importance than the unity of plot and the rest of the aca - demic requirements of literary art .

		For want of it many a well-conceived narrative , excellently motivated , proves `` jumbly . ''

		In a picture everything is illumined by a single light that has direc - tion .

		We would not think much of an exterior in which the central figure is lit up by daylight that runs counter to several subordinate daylights showing up the rest of the group .

		Vet we do not seem to have developed a very keen sense of the value of the strict analogue in literary art of consistent lighting a self-consciousness that sets all the elements of inner and outer life in comprehensible , livable rela - tions .

		Singleness of outlook by no means limits the writer to the short story or to labors of unambitious scope .

		Indeed , one of the works which seem best to answer to our ideal , though it has not by any means altogether eliminated cross-lights , is a prose epic in ten volumes `` Jean-Chris - tophe . ''

		At this point the reader may object that while this method pretends to be sweep - ingly realistic , to aim to grasp a bit of life and imprison it in narrative form , it yet is the merest subjectivism , an egoist 's dream in which everything is hopelessly out of plumb , in which the valid relations of the objective world are badly muddled .

		Nor would he be altogether wrong .

		And yet , what is life , as we really and individ - ually know it , but precisely `` an egoist 's dream in which the valid relations of the objective world are badly muddled '' ?

		Objectivity , one might say , is romance .

		But he would need to add that we crave and demand this romantic objectivity , this mad seeing of things `` as they really are , '' and that the literary artist has therefore a perfect right to choose between rigorous realism , the method that is frankly sub - jective , and objective realism , the romance of reality .

		There is , indeed , always room for the narrative embodying more than one psychological viewpoint , For the `` cross - light '' technique .

		Some of us , however ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 505 will continue to look upon the subjective , or better `` single-light , '' technique as the more subtle and aesthetically satisfying .

		Yet it is at least possible to combine the peculiar advantages of these two con - trasting techniques by the use of a third method of realistic representation .

		Look at the three human beings seated around a dinner table , nibbling at jejune bits of conversation .

		If you and I , like the psy - chologist of the behaviorist persuasion , merely described what we saw and heard , the reader of our story would not thank us .

		Insipid twaddle he would call it , for all our pains .

		If we identify ourselves with the host and take the reader into our confidence , revealing to him the stormy soul life hurtling along under the placid surface of conventional table talk , he would begin to feel interested .

		Yet he might tire of so purely one-sided , so merely subjective an interpretation of what was happening at the dinner table .

		On the other hand , if we identify ourselves now with the host , now with the hostess , now with the guest , pretending omnis - cience , some of us get restive , say `` jumbly , '' and talk of cross-lights .

		What if we tell it all three times as seen , heard , and felt by the host , by the hostess , and by the guest ?

		Should we not succeed in being subjective in three different ways , in other words , in being objective ?

		For may not objectivity be defined as the composite picture gained by laying a number of sub - jectivities on top of one another , the most romantic of all wish-fulfilments , the suc - cessive jumping out of our skin in as many distinct manners as we fancy ?

		Thus we reclaim the gift of omniscience that we had modestly discarded for the `` one-light '' technique , but with a difference .

		Before , we let our nine lives out of the bag all at once , now we live them in succession .

		The reader will not fail to have ob - served that we are not dealing with an altogether novel literary device .

		It is as old as `` The Ring and the Book '' and has latterly been the subject of experiment at the hands of
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	and
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	.

		Yet I doubt if the tremendous possibilities of `` The Ring and the Book '' method for the conveyance of a certain attitude toward realism have been clearly recognized .

		The method is of far greater significance than as a more or less interest - ing technical device ; it is one of the major approaches to a profound and all-embrac - ing realistic art .

		It sacrifices neither the depth , the inner truth , of subjective real - ism , nor the external completeness of motivation of objective realism .

		It unites the two in a new synthesis of boundless resources .

		As a method for the artistic presentation of ideas and the analysis of life , it is bound to come into its own and reap a large harvest .

		That it can never become the method of narrative fiction is obvious , if only because it violates what we may call , with apologies to the jargon of the economists , the law of diminishing returns in narrative interest .

		Let us ac - quaint ourselves with some of its implica - tions .

		One thing is obvious enough .

		This method of varied repetition makes some - what serious demands on the technical ability of the writer .

		Mere repetition of incident and dialogue with appropriate variations in motivation is out of the ques - tion .

		No mere human beings would long tolerate the resulting dulness , were they animated by the best of wills .

		One of the great tasks of the literary craftsman work - ing with the normal narrative technique is to make a satisfactory synthesis of the dis - parate elements of character , incident , and motive - that go to make up his story .

		He is always fearful lest he fail , explicitly or implicitly , to arrange his materials so as to bring out his point with maximum effect .

		The weaving of threads becomes an obsession with him .

		In our suggested method of repetition , however , the threads need rather to be unraveled .

		The total material to be put before the reader must be distributed , with naturalness and nicety , among the successive versions .

		In this way each version brings something new with it , while the actual repetitions must be charged with ever-changing significance .

		Needless to say , the arrangement of ver - sions would normally be such as to pro- duce the effect of cumulative energy , of a steadily growing comprehension of the meaning of the whole .

		Like all induc - tive processes , the method requires a high degree of mental alertness in the reader , an alertness that finds its reward in the fulness of realization finally attained .

		506 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	Attention may be called to a further techni - cal feature of interest .

		In the usual narrative it is always difficult , sometimes impossible , to avoid explicit analysis of character and motive .

		Even when we cordially like such analysis , we can not altogether ward off a sneaking irritation at the disturbing influence it exercises on the flow of the narrative .

		Our method reduces the necessity of explicit analysis to a minimum .

		The tacit comparison of even two skilfully constructed versions gives opportunity for a wealth of implica - tions , many of which would need express mention in a single version .

		We gain a perspective of motive as we pass from one subjective viewpoint to another , just as we gain our knowledge of space relations by shifting the angle from which we look at a number of objects .

		There are many other interesting corol - laries of the method .

		There is one in particular that should appeal mightily as opening up exquisite possibilities of a purely aesthetic order .

		We have all of us often observed the peculiar individuality that a specific light lends an object .

		A house is not the same thing in the chilly gray of dawn , in the blazing light of a clear noon , in the soft glow of sunset ; it is not the same thing under a hard winter sky as in the hazy warmth of
summer	DATE	.

		Each version of a repeated story is doubly subjective .

		The focal character brings with him not merely a psychic perspective , a centre of motivation , he brings with him also a temperament and a mood .

		His version receives an emotional atmosphere all its own .

		As we pass from one version to another , we not only shift our stand - point , we also attend in a different mood .

		This feature of change of emotional approach can be utilized to give the most profound , the most poignant interpreta - tions of life .

		One and the same series of events may be apperceived in varying , even contradictory , manner as a merry jest , a tragedy , a clever play of circumstance , an irritating bungle .

		Need one say that in the promised land is displayed a signboard bearing the fol - lowing inscription , in letters writ large : `` Tinkers beware .

		Only artists allowed '' ?

SAPIR	PERSON	.

		The Structure of Lasting Peace II THB `` PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITY '' : NATIONAL - ITY AND SOVEREIGNTY By and large , nationality is the integra - tion of the successive and permanent ele - ments of group life , as personality is the integration of the successive and perma - nent elements of individual life .

		It is as useless to seek any irreducible differentia of the one as of the other .

		Controversy about the nature and constituents of na - tionality goes on , as controversy goes on about the nature and constituents of per - sonality .

		Both dissolve under analysis ; both are the most potent of dynamics in the making of history , which is their rec - ord .

		And it is upon the observation of the conditions and workings of this fact , and this alone , that a programme of last - ing peace can successfully base itself .

		Na - tionality , then , is to the group what personality is to the individual : tradition is its memory , custom its habits , history its biography , language , literature , the arts , religion , its mind .

		Together these form its culture , and culture in the nation - ality is character in the individual .

		Dur - ing the nineteenth century one European people after another achieved nationality simply by becoming conscious for the first time , or by recalling afresh and cherishing , these items of its being , the Greeks , the Italians , the Germans , the various Balkan peoples subject to
Turkey	LOCATION	, the Hungarians and the Slavic races subject to
Austria	LOCATION	, the Norwegians , the Walloons and
Flem	PERSON	- ings of
Belgium	LOCATION	, and the Finns and
Ukrai	PERSON	- nians in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The Jews have been its great exemplification from the days of Titus , the Irish since
Cromwell	PERSON	's time , the Poles from the date of the final partition of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		To-day there is hardly a single society of men in
Europe	LOCATION	, who share in the same memories and customs and speech , that has not established its nationality , and de - manded for it freedom and opportunity .

		Where democracy prevailed the establish - ment took place spontaneously , as the ef - fect of freedom ; in lands with tyrannical governments it eventuated as resistance to oppression under democratic inspiration .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 507 So deep-lying is it in the funded mentality of the human families of
Europe	LOCATION	, that it has become the governing concept in a theory of civilization and a programme of life .

		The democratic prophet of this the - ory is the great
Mazzini	PERSON	; its dynastic promulgators are
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	,
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	, von Biilow .

		The latter formu - late it in a mythology of race , and provide metaphysical and moral sanctions for Ger - man imperialism ; their work , indeed , is an admirable instance of how a fact , con - verted into a `` principle '' and applied con - sistently and regardlessly , may become its own bitterest enemy .

		Against this German misapplication of the `` principle of nationality '' the demo - cratic powers oppose their own sounder formulation .

		How it applies to the pres - ent situation , its needs and demands , they have not said .

		What does it offer the so diverse nationalities that are the popula - tion of
Europe	LOCATION	?

		Which of the various components of nationality does it acknowl - edge as definitive ?

		What must it safe - guard and reenforce ?

		What repress or extirpate ?

		The Allies ' declarations yield no answer to these questions .

		They only deny the claims of imperialism , and those , only when they are German .

		But what is the relation of the `` principle of nation - ality '' to the imperialisms , if there be such , of
England	LOCATION	, or
France	LOCATION	, or
Italy	LOCATION	, or
Russia	LOCATION	, or the
United States	LOCATION	?

		To ask such a question , any realpoliti - ker will say , is folly .

		The `` principle of nationality '' will mean at any peace con - ference only what the victors will let it mean , nothing more .

		But there are these other determinants of its meaning , never - theless the wishes and demands of the various nationalities ; the implications and requirements of the fact of nationality as that appears as a force and a hope in the natural history of mankind .

		A lasting peace can rest only upon the harmony of all else with the latter .

		Now the least that can be said about the latter is that the association invoked in nationality is so peculiarly intimate as to command and demand the highest degree of loyalty and self-sacrifice from the associates .

		So in - timate is the association that , in spite of both criticism and evidence , the idea that the basis of nationality is race , community of blood and ancestry , is shared by both democrats and dynasts .

		It has its propa - ganda even in
America	LOCATION	, in the archaeolog - ical romancing of Mr.
Madison Grant	PERSON	and the fictional eugenics of Mr.
Seth Humphrey	PERSON	.

		Scientific anthropology discounts the whole conception , but there is envisaged in it at least this fact that the claim of any large association of men to consanguinity is an indubitable sign of a wakeful sense of nationality .

		Common ancestry is in - dicated in the word itself , wa/io-nality , but purity of stock can obviously not be the basis of it .

		How diverse stocks , associat - ing together , fuse through marriage , and become of `` one '' blood , can not be said .

		Nationality falls between race and other more external forms of associative unity .

		That racial quality underlies it and is near to it , must be granted , but it is false that racial quality is identical with it .

		Asso - ciation may
spring	DATE	from the original and inward nature of men , from the instinct of the herd , from a hereditary or constitu - tional like-mindedness ; it may derive from the need of defence and offence in an un - favorable environment ; it may rest upon both .

		Association of the first order is natural , internal ; of the second order , ex - ternal , artificial .

		The difference is as the difference between time and space .

		Thus , a man may change his surroundings ; he can not change his past .

		That is inalter - able , and he is what he is because that is what that is .

		To abolish that , he would have to abolish himself .

		He may , for ex - ample , be at the same time an Irishman , a son , a father , an uncle , a cousin , a citi - zen , a church-member , a lawyer , a Repub - lican , and a capitalist .

		Each of these words signifies a group to which he belongs .

		Most of them he may enter or leave with - out otherwise altering his nature and con - ditions .

		Others he enters without choice and can not leave without taking leave of his life .

		The citizen of
America	LOCATION	may be - come one of
England	LOCATION	, the Baptist a Meth - odist , the lawyer a banker , the Elk a
Mason	ORGANIZATION	, the Republican a Socialist , the cap - italist a proletarian .

		But the son , father , uncle , cousin can not cease to be these ; he can not reject the relationships these words 508 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	express , nor alter them .

		If they obtain once , they obtain forever .

		So an Irish - man is always an Irishman , a Jew always a Jew .

		Irishman or Jew is born ; citizen , lawyer , or church-member is made .

		Irish - man and Jew are facts in nature ; citizen and church-member are artefacts in civil - ization .

		Natural groups , like the Irish , the Jews , or any nationality , can not be destroyed without destroying their mem - bers .

		Artificial groups , like states , churches , professions , castes , can .

		These are social organizations ; natural groups are social organisms , organisms conscious of their nature , their powers , their inter - ests and desires , conscious , in a word , of their social personality , and acting in such a way as to preserve , enhance , and per - fect it .

		Empirically , then , what is affirmed in
1914	DATE	concerning nationality is the natural right which was declared in
1776	DATE	inalien - able to personality .

		The `` principle of nationality '' may be stated in paraphrase of the Declaration of Independence : All nationalities are created equal and are en - dowed by their creator with certain in - alienable rights , among them being life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ... To secure these rights governments are instituted among nationalities , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .

		That is , the principle of nationality is an extension of the scope of democracy from single to group personalities .

		Its application to artificial persons of that order corporations and the like within the state , is traditional ; the struggle for its application to the nationality is only just culminating .

		As the declaration sup - plied the governing concept for the con - stitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, so the `` principle of nationality '' supplies it for the constitution of mankind .

		International or - ganization , it implies , depends upon recip - rocal national responsibility , and indicates , hence , a nationhood suffrage parallel to manhood suffrage : one nation , one vote .

		Could this doctrine ever have been ade - quately applied ,
Europe	LOCATION	would have had a happier history .

		Differences between nationalities and their corresponding states in numbers , size , wealth , quality , and power , however , weighted the influence of nations variously and unduly ; encouraged in international affairs fear , jealousy , and suspicion to such a degree that the modi - cum of justice and fair dealing which the
United States	LOCATION	uniquely offered
Nicaragua	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	was looked at askance ; kept international behavior set upon a policy of laissez-faire , which only the growing eco - nomic interdependence of the world has succeeded in modifying .

		The internal affairs of states , no matter how rotten , are holy , taboo to all interference .

		An out - raged German government whines over the presumption in President
Wilson	PERSON	's re - ply to the Pope 's peace proposals and can - not interfere with
Turkey	LOCATION	's treatment of
Armenia	LOCATION	; the governments of our allies tread softly with regard to one another 's sacred inwards .

		No interference in a state 's internal affairs ; no responsibility in foreign policy ; no accountability , except to force , in anything .

		Each nation , each gov - ernment is sovereign ; each nationality wants sovereignty ; and sovereignty is irresponsibility , is international anarchy .

		Under the prevailing system the de - mands of the nationalities are just .

		With - out sovereignty , the policy of international laissez-faire , tempered by piratical im - perialism , leaves a nationality at the mercy of any exploiter who is stronger .

		With - out sovereignty it fears the security of its life , its liberty , its free way to happiness .

		Without sovereignty it is hampered in per - forming what
Mazzini	PERSON	has called `` its spe - cial function in the European work of civilization . ''

		But this sovereignty is also its enemy .

		It is the ground of interna - tional rivalry , the source of the afflatus called national honor , of militarism , and of dynastic domination .

		The `` prin - ciple of nationality '' solves nothing if it commits the post-bellum settlement to an increased number of sovereignties .

		It fails of its purpose if it fails to secure an open way for the spontaneous powers and happiness of nationalities .

		Without this security there can be no lasting peace ; and sovereignty both is and is not this security .

		The problem of the reorganization of
Europe	LOCATION	can find its solution only in con - ditions that will unequivocally secure this end -

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 509 The Idea of a
University Every American	ORGANIZATION	college and university is affected by the issue raised in Professor Beard 's dramatic resignation from
Colum	PERSON	- bia as a protest against trustee autocracy .

		For the conditions which he found intol - erable
spring	DATE	from a ruling conception held by university trustees and a portion of con - servative public opinion as to the nature of the modern university .

		The methods taken at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	to secure the expulsion of Professors
Cattell	PERSON	and
Dana	PERSON	are very revealing as to the status of professors and the nature of university prestige .

		The excuses , causes , and reasons given by the university authorities and the current com - ment of the newspapers show how frankly the American university has become a financial corporation , strictly analogous , in its motives and responses , to the corpora - tion which is concerned in the production of industrial commodities .

		Trustees who are business men , who hold positions as directors or executives in large financial or industrial corporations , carry over into the management of the university the attitudes and sensitivities learned in the corporate world .

		The university produces learning instead of steel or rubber , but the nature of the academic commodity has become less and less potent in ensuring for the academic workman a status materially dif - ferent from that of any other kind of employee .

		As directors in this corporation of learn - ing , trustees seem to regard themselves pri - marily as guardians of invested capital .

		They manage as a sacred trust the various bequests , gifts , endowments which have been made to the university by men and women of the same orthodoxies as them - selves .

		Their obligation is to see that the quality of the commodity which the uni - versity produces is such as to seem repu - table to the class which they represent .

		And in order to maintain the flow of capi - tal and the general credit of the institution they must keep the stock above par .

		In the minds apparently of the trustees , and of the executives and professors who work with them , the reputation of a university is comparable to the standing of a corpora - tion 's securities on the street , the news - papers taking the place of the stock exchange .

		The real offence of Professors
Cattell	PERSON	and
Dana	PERSON	seems to have been not so much that they were unpatriotic as that they had lowered the prestige of the uni - versity in the public mind .

		Neither the president nor the trustees nor the faculty committees brought forward any evidence besides epithet that either professor had , in the language of President
Butler	PERSON	's warn - ing , actually `` opposed or counselled oppo - sition to the laws of the
United States	LOCATION	, or had acted , spoken , or written treason . ''

		What these professors had done was to associate themselves with organizations which were enjoying infamy in the irres - ponsible press .

		No attempt was made to discover whether the newspaper accounts were true .

		Chatter and rumor were suf - ficient to convict them .

		Why ?

		Because on the stock exchange it is by rumor and prejudice that the value of securities is hit , not by evidence .

		When your stock is depressed by an alarming rumor , it is irre - levant whether the rumor is true or not .

		The mischief lies in what people think , not in the actual facts .

		And for this pur - pose newspaper chatter is authoritative .

		Your object then becomes not to discover the truth but to combat the rumor .

		If the fall in your stock is due to a suspicion of the value of your commodity , you renew your efforts to convince the public of its soundness .

		If it is due to an offending employee , you dismiss the employee .

		Hav - ing removed the cause of the prejudice , you may then expect your securities to resume their former level .

		Only on such an interpretation can we explain the tendency of university authori - ties to rely on newspaper opinion and upon the complaints of persons whom they would not take seriously on any other question whatever .

		One is often amazed at the callousness of university trustees towards the indignation that follows these arbitrary dismissals of professors .

		But this corporate attitude naturally discounts the opinions of the non-investing public .

		It is not the discontent of idealists that 510 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	matters , but the vague complaints from parents that their sons are being taught irreligion and sedition within the univer - sity , complaints from business men that a professor is tainted with economic heresy , indignation of prominent alumni at the connection of the university 's name with unpopular movements .

		These are the attitudes that depress the credit of the university in the investing world , and these are the attitudes that carry weight , there - fore , with the university president and the trustees .

		Vested interests presumably re - ceive dividends in the form of orthodox graduates .

		Whatever interferes with the supply of such a revenue is therefore a serious assault on the stability of the cor - poration .

		In any such system of ideas , the profes - sor becomes inevitably a mere employee of a company which has a standing to maintain in the corporate world .

		His intellectual freedom is extremely preca - rious , because a chance remark , or any public activity , may bring him that news - paper censure which causes the grave damage the university is likely to incur in the minds of the significant classes .

		An `` institution of learning , '' administered even on autocratic principles , might be expected to move always with the most scrupulous regard for the dignity of the teacher and for the principles of legal evi - dence in any cases of dismissal or censure .

		The professor might be expected to have a status more secure and more respected than that of the employee , holding his position from day to day , and might be expected to be dismissed only after formal charges , and after conviction on evidence which would satisfy an impersonal and judicial mind .

		None of the circumstances connected with the latest expulsions at Co - lumbia shows that any such standards prevail in our largest and wealthiest uni - versity .

		They show , on the contrary , that under trustee control the American uni - versity has been degraded from its old , noble ideal of a community of scholarship to a private commercial corporation .

		And the situation at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	is merely a sharpened form of what has gone on in other colleges and universities throughout the country .

		Professor Beard 's stirring gesture has raised the issue whether this reigning cor - porate idea of a university shall any longer prevail .

		If that reigning idea is making it impossible for a man of
Charles Beard	ORGANIZATION	's intellectual distinction , courage , and demo - cratic idealism to serve our largest univer - sity , we have come to the time when Americans will have to choose between the current philosophy of university govern - ment and the presence in the university of independent and vigorous minds .

		If a man like Professor Beard is to be forced to cut short his academic career because the status of the college teacher is becom - ing intolerable , a revolution in the idea of a university can not come too quickly .

		The present agitation for at least a constitu - tional form of government by which con - trol over all academic matters is turned over to the faculties is an advance .

		But to ensure the instructor 's freedom , both uni - versity authorities and the newspaper pub - lic must learn to distinguish between his academic functions and his private opin - ions and activities .

		He will scarcely be free as long as he is vulnerable for activities which in no way concern his academic work , or as long as he is considered to implicate the university in everything he says or does .

		The partisan of `` academic freedom '' will also want to see worked out an entirely new status for both the instructor , who is now an em - ployee , and for the student , who is now partly ward and partly consumer .

		State control is no solution , so long as director - ship is given to men with the current corporate attitudes .

		State ownership of universities , with control vested in the `` guild '' of professors , is probably the ideal solution .

		Meanwhile what is most needed is a clear realization of the hostility be - tween the present system of ideas which governs university control , and the func - tional and cooperative ideals which should govern a community devoted to learning .

		That hostility is almost complete , and Pro- fessor
Beard	ORGANIZATION	has done a great service by making a dramatic issue of it at the present timc '

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 511 Literary Affairs in
London	LOCATION	-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Two books have just been published , each deal - ing in its own way with the past of
England	LOCATION	.

		To-day we are thinking intensely and almost hectically of the present , a little but not enough of the future , and hardly at all of the past .

		Yet knowledge of , and meditation on , the past is an essential thing if our concern with the present is to be healthy or useful .

		We look back at most for parallels to our position , but we do not trouble about the long sequence of cause and effect that has been bringing us for thousands of years exactly to the point where we now stand .

		We think in months and days , not in epochs ; our strained attention is concen - trated on to-day and on the next three or six or twelve months , according to the view taken by the military expert , who has developed in every one of us , of the probable duration of the rest of the war .

		It is not a bad thing , then , that two authors in whom the thoughtful public has confidence should have plunged into past centuries .

		Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, who calls his book with proud simplicity , `` A Short History of
England	LOCATION	, '' races through the ages at an exhilarating speed .

		Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	, who pitches the action of his novel , `` Priest of the Ideal , '' in the present day , gets back to the early English church by taking his protagonists on a tour round the sacred places of the faith ; and in each place , lona ,
Lindisfarne	LOCATION	,
Durham	LOCATION	, or York , it seems as though he stepped off some sort of moving staircase of modernity into a cool and motionless dimension quite outside the hurry of time .

		The contrast between these two writers in their treatment of the past is immense .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	conceives the ages as galloping by , while to Mr.
Graham	PERSON	they have an enormous , vegetable motion that is almost imperceptible .

		Yet the two have a very similar effect ; and they arouse , the one by quiet intensity , the other by restless vigor , as it were a revival of sensation in those obscure and hid - den nerves which connect us with our past .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's career through English his - tory is not only rapid , but a little surprising .

		He has , of course , a political theory to support ; and it is not my business to say here whether I think his theory tenable or his historical founda - tion of it correct .

		He believes that
England	LOCATION	is ruled by the rich , that the bulk of the pop - ulation is without an effective word in the gov - ernment of the country , and that the rich are every day increasing their power and applying it to what he and his friend , Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, call `` the regimentation of the poor . ''

		He now traces the ascendancy of the wealthy classes to the end of the Middle Ages when the barons overcame the monarchy and , gradually resolving themselves into a new nobility , part legal , part commercial , part land-owning , but predominantly plutocratic , used
Henry VIII	PERSON	as a catspaw for the spoliation of the monasteries and so absorbed the major part of the wealth of the country .

		He sees an - other `` revolt of the rich '' in the Puritan Revo - lution and the execution of Charles I ; and the enthronement of George I is to him a proof that the rich had become so powerful that they were able to put a mere dummy into the seat of Edward I. Whatever you may think of these opinions , it is certainly true that Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton 's statements of fact are almost always im - peccable ; it is only in his interpretation of the facts that he departs from orthodoxy .

		It is beyond doubt that
Hampden	LOCATION	, the Ship Money hero , was , as he says , a very wealthy squire ; and you may make what you like of his epi - gram that `` there was no village Hampden in
Hampden	LOCATION	village . ''

		It is also true that Crom - well was a member of an immensely wealthy family ; and , though Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	does not mention it , it is one of the odd dark corners of English history that his real name , the name he used when his signature was required in con - nection with money , was not
Cromwell	PERSON	but Wil - liams .

		But whether these things cast any doubt on the complete disinterestedness of the great Puritans is a question that each man can decide for himself without browbeating from authority as Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has decided .

		But perhaps this reversal of common opinion is not the most important part of Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton 's book .

		What does matter in it is his intense and passionate love of the English people .

		He sees our faults and our blindnesses , but he sees also , in just relation to them , our virtues and our misfortunes .

		It may seem rather a ridicu - lous attitude to exhibit tenderness toward a great nation ; yet this is what Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	does without becoming ridiculous .

		He has never be - longed to that odious historical school which trumpets the greatness of
England	LOCATION	as though she were the one righteous person in a world of beings at once ruffianly and inefficient .

		These writers are the bagmen of the realm of ideas ; and the higher their level of expression the more 512 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	disgusting their attitude seems .

		Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton in times of peace was a little too much in - clined to harry us for our vices .

		But , early on in the war , he wrote a poem in which he said : Of old with a divided heart I taw my people 's pride expand Since a man 's soul is torn apart By mother earth and fatherland .

		and told how he knew A blacker thing than blood 's own dye Weighed down great
Hawkins	PERSON	on the sea ; And
Nelson	PERSON	turned his blindest eye On
Naples	LOCATION	and on liberty .

		But he went on to say that he now gave thanks to the `` thousandfold and frozen folk '' : Who have no faith a man could mourn , Nor freedom any man desires ; But in a new clean light of scorn Close up my quarrel with my sires .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is one of not many writers who have risen to the occasion of the war , and his history of
England	LOCATION	is , in a sense , a second and richer expression of that closing up of a quarrel .

		It is a poem of which the English people are the hero ; and when I say the English people , I do not mean only the people who live in
England	LOCATION	.

		To illustrate this point and Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's style at the same time , I may quote a few sen - tences on the American Declaration of Inde - pendence : We talk , with a humiliation too rare with us , about our dubious part in the secession of
America	LOCATION	.

		Whether it increase or decrease the humiliation I do not know ; but I strongly suspect that we had very little to do with it .

		I believe we counted for uncommonly little in the case .

		They were led on by a light that went before .

		That is a compliment to the American people ; and compliments between us , I believe , are now not wasted .

		They are the right and proper ex - pression of a right and proper spirit .

		But I do not think that Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is here at all concerned with compliments .

		He is merely re - joicing in a manifestation in English blood of a temper that he admires .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	equally pierces through a surface of things he disapproves to a heart which he maintains to be fundamentally sound .

		His two chief characters are Hampden , an English lay preacher who is stirred to spiritual blossoming by the stress of the war , and
Washington	LOCATION	King , a rather farcical American who comes to Eng - land for the purpose of buying relics , from a derelict gargoyle to the tower on
Glastonbury Tor	ORGANIZATION	, by means of which he intends to endow his own country with the past she lacks .

		Hampden agrees he is justified in purchasing whatever
England	LOCATION	will sell , because the sale will mean that the object sold has outlived its significance ; and he conducts King on a tour around the holy places where Christianity first rooted , in the hope of learning that
England	LOCATION	still treasures her sacred things .

		The scheme of the book is de - cidedly odd .

		It is now written in a tone of profound and brooding meditation , as in the passages descriptive of lona and
Lindisfarne	LOCATION	, now in a tone of satire as when
King	ORGANIZATION	invokes the aid of a newspaper magnate , who first booms him .

		then turns and rends him .

		It is interspersed with
Hampden	PERSON	's sermons , very beautiful passages of religious feeling , and ends with his death at the front .

		The most impressive note is sounded in those pages in which
Hampden	LOCATION	, as it seems , by mere intensity of will gets into touch in the sacred places with those who made them sacred and forces on the reader a realization of the fact that the past lives , that we can not move a step or live a minute as though those first mis - sionaries had never been .

		But the book is odd and partly incomprehensible .

		The mystical and the ordinary blend in it queerly .

		It is like look - ing at a stick thrust half-way into water half of it is plain and then quite suddenly half of it is refracted and unreal .

		And sometimes it is irritating because the whole book is not writ - ten in the same key .

		King , for example , is at one moment as absurd as a character in `` Candide , '' at another as delicately real as a person observed by
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	.

		It provokes on the whole the re - flection that Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's book on
Russia	LOCATION	may have been misjudged , that he was not reflecting with extreme subtlety the obscure soul of an alien people , but reflecting , as easily in that mir - ror as in any other , the peculiarities of his own mind .

		I have no space to do more than note the fact that a posthumous book by
Edward Thomas	PERSON	, who was killed in the attack on
Vimy Ridge	LOCATION	, has just appeared and that his `` Tenth Muse '' has been issued with a short memoir by Mr.
John Freeman	PERSON	.

		Thomas was a good writer who somehow never came into his inheritance .

		He was a fine critic and he had that eye for country which our modern writers are beginning spe - cially to develop .

		But he mixed up criticism with the country , so that nobody ever knew what to make of him , and he spent nine-tenths of his life in writing potboilers the kind of pot - boiler that does not sell profusely .

		He is re - ported to have said once that he had reviewed every book of verse which had appeared during
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 513 the last twenty years .

		The remark might be his epitaph .

		Criticism in this country is a thank - less , unhonored , hard-driven , and ill-paid busi - ness ; and it was certainly a stony stepmother to
Thomas	PERSON	's rare and rather delicate talent .

		He felt this ; and the feeling is probably responsible for a certain reluctance and coldness even in his most companionable books .

		I hope to return to him when the extraordinarily beautiful poems , which he began shyly to produce in the last years of his life , are collected and published .

		A Fig Tree I Murmurous , at evening , over the yellow-hilled Lone land they came , Crowding about his heels like timid sheep , Whispering his name , Peering at one another , pondering what they heard Resolute , each , to keep His every utterance as the chosen word .

		It would be doing no very frightful violence to the truth to say that one could divide most con - temporary American verse into two great types the types indicated by the title of this review .

		If one leaves out of account the matter of poetic form , rudely ignoring for the moment the bitter quarrel between vers-librists and metrists , one could justifiably conclude that all our contempo - rary poets are purveyors either of confectionery or caviar .

		Two or three exceptions we must make , of course :
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, clearly , serves a melange of both ; and
Messrs. Frost	PERSON	,
Robinson	PERSON	, and
Fletcher	PERSON	, and perhaps Mr.
Masters	PERSON	, will escape our classification altogether which is to their credit .

		But in the main , it can be plausibly argued that the classification holds .

		The confectioners , of course , are in the major - ity .

		These are the prettifiers , the brighteners of life , the lilting ones .

		They fill our standard magazines ; they are annually herded by Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	into his anthology ; and now , taking advantage of the poetic decuman wave and the delusions of publishers , they are swamping the land with their sweet wares .

		The conservative press flings garlands at them , the `` Literary Digest '' quotes them , the
Poetry Society of America	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- alas ! -RRB-

		fetes them .

		Hourly they grow more numerous , more powerful .

		The coura - geous and creative ones , and those who look to poetry for truthfulness and for a consciousness of life always subtler and more individually worked will soon have to fight for their lives .

		And how , indeed , shall they be able to fight ?

		There are no giants to be slain rather , a host of pigmies , and all alike .

		A poem by one might bear the signature of any .

		They sing in chorus rather than singly .

		The present group of volumes if we except `` Al Que Quiere , '' by Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, which we reserve for our course in caviar is an excellent illustration of this .

		How many critics , not per - sonally acquainted with these four authors , would know the difference if the names had been shuffled ?

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	, perhaps , would protrude 514 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	one would be a trifle alarmed at so much howling Weltschmerz , so many Sphinxes and wicked heathen kisses , so much passionate frustra - tion , in Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	, for example ; and one might , the case being reversed , start at Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's so speedy conversion to ululating Catholicism .

		But even here the difference is in the symbols rather than in the literary quality .

		They are both , they are all , blood brothers sentimentalists , dabblers in the pretty and sweet , rhetoricians of the `` thou and thee '' school , pale-mouthed clingers to the artificial and archaic .

		Here are platitudes neatly dressed , invocatory sonnets , the use of italics for emphasis -LRB- that last infirmity ! -RRB-

		, and all the stale literary tricks so relished , especially by the female , the `` calls o ' love , '' the `` cries i ' the wind , '' homing birds , in fact , the whole stock-in-trade of the magazine poet .

		Of Mr.
Reed	PERSON	these remarks are partially unjust .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	is too well bred to go so far .

		He restrains his platitudes from any attempt at lilting ; his gait , indeed , is pedes - trian .

		But of Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	and Mr.
Powys	PERSON	and Mrs.
Garrison	PERSON	particularly Mrs.
Garrison	PERSON	they are all too true .

		Here is nothing new , noth - ing distinctive , the trotting out of the same old passions , the same old heartbreaks and love songs , ghostly distillations of fragrances all too familiar .

		Is it possible for individuals to be so little indi - vidual ?

		Have they never experienced anything for themselves ?

		The publisher tells us that Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	has had , for a man still young , an aston - ishingly varied career .

		Nevertheless , one could not guess it from Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	's book .

		Ideas , emotions , language , rhythms , all are oddly sec - ond-hand , as if they had been offered to him and blandly accepted .

		So too with Mrs.
Garrison	PERSON	, with the addition of a touch more femininely sensuous , a sentimentalism a trifle more unctuous .

		So too with Mr.
Powys	PERSON	, though his range is wider , his intellect , in a stereotyped way , freer .

		The trouble with these poets , at bottom , is simply that they are imitative , and imitative with a sentimental bias .

		A few years ago an objective psychologist , a behaviorist ,
M. Nicolas Kostyleff	PERSON	, made a tentative study of the mechan - ism of poetic inspiration .

		The conclusions he reached , whatever else their value , were highly suggestive .

		An important part in poetic creation , he maintains , is an automatic verbal discharge , along chains of association , set in motion by a chance occurrence .

		The difference between a poet who merely echoes the ideas and rhythms of the past , and the poet who creates something new , is simply that in the former instance this verbo-motor mechanism is not deeply related to the poet 's specific sensibility ; in the latter , it is .

		This distinction fits the present case admirably .

		These poets , in other words , have not experienced sharply for themselves .

		They have drawn their stores of verbo-motor reactions from the books of others , without checking up from personal observation .

		They color their lives to a certain extent in accordance with their too early adoption of a speech which is not their own , instead of coloring their speech in the light of their own experience .

		They give us , therefore , neither clearness nor truth , nor any beauty of a personal kind .

		They give us instead a tame uniformity , floods of tepid rhetoric , vague regurgitations of the words of others , varied now and then for good measure with the grotesquely inept and the foolishly naive .

		And over and under it all runs our undying American adoration of the pretty - pretty , the pious , the sacred virtues .

		Life is made out to be simply one sweet thing after another .

		These are , in fact , confectioners , and not inspired ones , either .

		With the question whether there might not arise a great confectioner one who would bring genius and originality to his task of enlighten - ment and cheer or , if not that , at any rate another Longfellow we need not concern our - selves as yet , merely replying that there will be time for discussion when he arises .

		Meanwhile it is more interesting to turn to a consideration of the type of poetry we have called caviar , and to Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, who brings us samples .

		If the purveyors of confectionery are almost totally lacking in individuality , the purveyors of caviar fly to the other extreme : they carry individuality to excess .

		These are our modern individualists .

		What do they care how peculiar or esoteric their idiom is ?

		Self-expression is the thing .

		If the crowd can not understand them , or ignores them , so much the worse for the crowd .

		This is a senti - mental attitude , there is a good deal of pose in it , and a consequent defeat is easily regarded by the poet as the martyrdom of the truly great .

		Never - theless , it is oddly significant that these caviarists , these purveyors of bitter realism , collectors of the bizarrely unpleasant and the irrelevantly true , have a style entirely their own .

		M. Kostyleff would admit that their mechanisms of verbo - motor reaction are closely related to their spe - cific sensibilities : they are as clearly original as our other poets are imitative .

		It seems to be true , in this connection , that the realists have a much less stereotyped style than the lilters .

		They
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 515 appear to remember that , after all , literature should be drawn from life , not from literature .

		They experience first -LRB- and whole-heartedly , not with a fountain-pen behind the ear -RRB- and write afterward .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	is a case in point .

		His book throughout has the savory quality of originality .

		Is it poetry ?

		That is the question .

		Self - por - traiture it is vivid , acridly sensuous , gnarled , by turns delicate and coarse .

		There is humor in it , too , which is rare enough in contemporary verse .

		But on the whole it is more amiable than beautiful , more entertaining than success - ful .

		The reasons for this are several .

		To begin with , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	too seldom goes below the surface .

		He restricts his observations almost entirely to the sensory plane .

		His moods , so to speak , are nearly always the moods of the eye , the ear , and the nostril .

		We get the impression from these poems that his world is a world of plane surfaces , bizarrely colored , and cunningly arranged so as to give an effect of depth and solidity ; but we do not get depth itself .

		When occasionally this is not true , when Mr.
Williams	PERSON	takes the plunge into the profounder stream of consciousness , he appears always to pick out the shallows , and to plunge gingerly .

		The sensory element is kept in the foreground , the tone remains whimsically colloquial , and as a result the total effect even when the material is inher - ently emotional is still quaintly cerebral .

		Is it at bottom a sort of puritanism that keeps Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- liams from letting go ?

		There is abundant evi - dence here that his personality is a rich one ; but his inhibitions keep him forever dodging his own spotlight .

		He is ashamed to be caught crying , or exulting , or adoring .

		On the technical side this puritanism manifests itself in a resolute sup - pression of beauty .

		Beauty of sound he denies himself , beauty of prosodic arrangement too ; the cadences are prose cadences , the line-lengths are more or less arbitrary , and only seldom , in a short-winded manner , are they effective .

		In brief , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	is a realistic imagist : he has the air of floating through experience as a sen - sorium and nothing more .

		He denies us his emotional reactions to the things he sees , even to the extent of excluding intensity of personal tone from his etchings ; and his readers , there - fore , have no emotional reactions , either .

		They see , but do not feel .

		Is Mr.
Williams	PERSON	never any - thing but amused or brightly interested ?

		The attitude has its limits , no matter how fertile its basis of observation .

		Of course , one prefers , in the last analysis , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	and his caviar to any amount of thin saccharine .

		It is at least real .

		But one concludes that the richer and more vital realm lies midway between the extremes : in the truth - tellings of those who not only see sharply and know themselves intimately , but also feel pro- foundly , relate themselves to their world , and tell us what they know in the comprehensive bal - anced harmony which we call art .

		Making Germany Democratic THE COMING DEMOCRACY .

		By
Hermann Fernau	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Bishop
Berkeley	LOCATION	proposed to cure all physical ailments with the general application of tar water .

		He was unique in the selection of a rem - edy but not in his dependence upon one cure for various ills .

		The history of human thought con - sists largely in the appearance of great thinkers who interpret the universe in terms of one sub - stance and who would mitigate the maladapta - tions of man and his environment with a single prescription .

		To-day the evil is German autoc - racy and the one remedy the overthrow of the Hohenzollerns .

		`` The Coming Democracy , '' by
Hermann Fernau	PERSON	, presents a diagnosis and pro- pounds the antidote .

		From an enforced retreat at
Berne	LOCATION	,
Switzer	PERSON	- land ,
Fernau	PERSON	charges German autocracy with re - sponsibility for the Great War and calls upon his countrymen to repudiate their leaders .

		No American has more severely indicted the
Hohen	PERSON	- zollerns .

		He believes the historical development and the present constitution of the German Empire make for war , not peace .

		The govern - ment is the kaiser , possessed of God-given mo - narchial rights , received and to be interpreted by the kaiser alone .

		An examination of the Ger - man constitution shows that the states of the empire are but appendages of
Prussia	LOCATION	, for this state dominates the Bundesrat , or Federal Coun - cil .

		The states have surrendered to the emperor , king of
Prussia	LOCATION	, exclusive power to declare war , conclude peace , make alliances and treaties , and to appoint and accredit envoys .

		The imperial dip - lomatic , civil , and administrative officials are responsible personally to the emperor and to him alone .

		He may , when he considers it necessary , declare any portion of the federal territory in a 516 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	state of war and thus extinguish `` civil authori - ties , the liberty of the press , speech , meetings , union and even travel . ''

		The Reichstag is a fictitious democratic trimming .

		Its representa - tives , selected according to an electoral law of
1871	DATE	, do not represent the German nation of to-day .

		`` If , at any time , the government loses its majority in the
Reichstag	LOCATION	, it dissolves the lat - ter -LRB- the Emperor only requires for this purpose the assent of the Bundesrat , of which he is assured beforehand -RRB- , or simply ignores it . ''

		Its financial control is easily evaded and its law-making func - tions are confined to initiating laws and petitions for the consideration of the Bundesrat .

		The chancellor represents the emperor and is in no way responsible to the
Reichstag	LOCATION	, while `` only the nobility , endowed with divine insight , is entitled in Prusso-Germany to fill the most important offices and to solve the most difficult political problems .

		Consequently all leading govern - mental , administrative , and military posts are filled by members of the nobility . ''

		The continuance of this structure rests with the army .

		The German army represents a fusion of feudal absolute military control with the mod - ern system of universal military service .

		The army is national , but its allegiance is personal .

		`` You have sworn me the oath of allegiance , '' said
William II	PERSON	to the newly sworn recruits of
1891	DATE	.

		`` More than ever before unbelief and dis - satisfaction lift their heads in the Fatherland , and the occasion may arise when you will have to shoot down or bayonet your own brothers and relations .

		Then seal your allegiance with the sacrifice of your heart 's blood . ''

		Equally potent for dynastic security has been the propaganda of ideas .

		A comparison of intel - lectual
Germany	LOCATION	of to-day with the
Germany	LOCATION	of fifty years ago reveals no similarity .

		The ideals of
Kant	PERSON	,
Fichte	LOCATION	,
Feuerbach	PERSON	,
Schleiermacher	PERSON	, and
Schiller	PERSON	are aliens in the intellectual community of to-day .

		`` Learning without character , knowl - edge without conscience , organization without humanity , discipline without liberty , ideal with - out dignity ; such is the result of a mental devel - opment that , commencing with the disappearance of the
Weimar Germanism	PERSON	, and politically trained by
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	,
Bismarck	PERSON	, and
William II	PERSON	, and intellectually by
Hegel	PERSON	,
Treitschke	PERSON	, and their disciples , could only play its part as a pro- tecting power of the dynasty . ''

		This is the out - come on the one hand of a suppression of opinion hostile to the dynasty and on the other of a gov - ernmental encouragement and subsidy of think - ers who have persistently taught that the state is a divine entity in which the individual is insig - nificant ; that the essence of a state is power unlimited by moral responsibility ; that the ends of a state are best attained through war ; that war is `` divine , holy , normal and the moral law governing the development of the human race '' ; that racial science indicates that the
Teuton	PERSON	is the highest type of man , and , consequently , the divinely appointed vehicle of European civiliza - tion .

		Governed by a dynasty thus entrenched , which recognizes no law but that of might ,
Germany	LOCATION	can be nothing other than a menace to interna - tional peace .

		It was not surprising to see Ger - man representatives at the Hague in
1899	DATE	and again in
1907	DATE	oppose arbitration of disputes between nations .

		And when other countries sug - gested arbitration tribunals , reduction of arma - ments , and so on , as means of insuring peace , it was to be expected that the Kaiser would reject a limitation upon his free action with this enun - ciation of a strong-arm policy : `` Believe me , peace will never be better safeguarded than by a perfectly organized and prepared German army . ''

		Fernau seeks to prove from German official documents and admissions of Prussian statesmen that the Hohenzollerns deliberately struck at the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	in
1914	DATE	and by means of false - hood and misrepresentation enlisted the loyal sup - port of the German people in a `` defensive '' war .

		Thus proceeds the arraignment .

		Perhaps this is no time to pass upon its accuracy .

		It will be accepted by many who in a calmer period would insist that it is an oversimplified exposition of complicated and interrelated tendencies .

		The outcome may well be an unscrupulous autocracy hostile to the peace of the world , but it does not follow , as
Fernau	PERSON	implies , that contributing agents were motivated by sycophantic intentions .

		I am willing to let the indictment stand , how - ever , if emphasis will shift to the proposed reme - dies .


Fernau	PERSON	's are simple , too simple .

		He would make
Germany	LOCATION	a republic and institute some form of international organization which will `` frustrate by force of arms any attempt to restore personal despotism . ''

		He sincerely believes , in common with many Americans , that wars will cease with the disappearance of dynasties .

		If his book will enforce this illusion , its present value is questionable .

		It is not sufficient to paint Ger - man autocracy with lurid colors .

		If we are truly anxious to preserve democracy , we must ask the question , Why have the German people sub -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 517 mitted to the Hohenzollerns ?

		Why have they manifested no more discontent under a dynastic absolutism than have many Americans with a representative system ?

		The explanation is not found exclusively in the standing army and a rule of fear , but in the careful attention given to the economic and social welfare of the German citi - zen .

		The happiness of a civilized people is most intimately related to its industrial organization , and although we may condemn the German feu - dal political structure , we should not hesitate to imitate its concern for the well-being of the indi - vidual .

		Unless democracies supply an equality of economic as well as political opportunity , they are democracies in name alone , and the funda - mental duty of Americans while waging this war is not to rage blindly at the Kaiser but to actual - ize the principles in which we profess belief .

		Once we attempt this , we shall see the futility of a universal nostrum for the world disease .

		What does it mean to say a nation is an inter - national menace ?

		Ultimately , does it not imply that the individuals which constitute nations are imperiled in their development ?

		This suggests that the time has come when we should cease thinking exclusively either in nationalistic or international terms ; rather we should use the distributive welfare of mankind as a standard with which to test the effectiveness of both national and international organizations .

		The Coming Democracy will be , then , such an organi - zation both within and between states as will give to the individual a freedom for the develop - ment of his powers , and will substitute the principle of cooperation for that of force and coer - cion .

		If this be true , the overthrow of the Hohenzollerns is not a complete assurance of the future .

		It is
Fernau	ORGANIZATION	's naive assumption that wars are caused solely by dynastic ambition which makes his book inadequate in the present exig - ency .

		Should the conclusion of the war substi - tute a rivalry of capitalistic interests for dynastic ambitions , we shall have made the familiar leap from the frying pan into the fire .

		Wars will persist until there is removed the present tempta - tion for political domination and trade expansion to go hand in hand .

		A monopoly of international opportunities is no different in principle from special business privileges within states .

		Regu - lated behavior and equality of opportunity must supersede international cut-throat competition before nations `` shall beat their swords into ploughshares , and their spears into pruning - hooks ' ''

		Gothic Architecture THE SUBSTANCE OF GOTHIC .

		By
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Marshall Jones Company	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		These six lectures , given during the
winter of 1916-7	DATE	in the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	course , in
Boston	LOCATION	, present Mr.
Cram	PERSON	at his boldest and best .

		Astride his favorite charger , Mediasvalism , incased in the shining armor of his enthusiasms and his abhor - rences , wielding the Excalibur of his wisdom and his wit , he pursues the dragon of Modernism over
Europe	LOCATION	and adown the centuries by way of the abbeys , churches , and cathedrals he knows and loves so well .

		A great many people , because they do not agree with him , refuse to take Mr.
Cram	PERSON	seriously ; but he is a potent force , a very palpable fact .

		The war is an eloquent commentary on his main contention , that materialism is devolu - tion ; that its high gods are tottering to their fall ; that we stand on the threshold of an age of faith , which will express itself in beauty .

		One naturally distrusts the special pleader , particularly if he be eloquent , as is Mr.
Cram	PERSON	; but in his exaltation of the culture of the Middle Ages , cooler heads than his concur that the weight of evidence is all on his side .

		According to his view , Gothic architecture is the all-sufficient answer to all our claims to a superiority of culture .

		`` Efficiency '' is only a sign of civilization , a thing with which culture has nothing whatever to do .

		Although in this book Mr.
Cram	PERSON	uses Gothic architecture so largely as a stick to beat a dog with , he has nevertheless produced the best and most interesting short , non-technical history of the style that it has been the reviewer 's pleasure to encounter .

		And he has been able to do this so easily and so well , first , because he speaks of what he knows and loves , and second , because he has not been guilty of the error of isolating his his - tory of the building impulse from that of the life impulse , but has kept constantly before him the fact that the one is only the manifestation of the other .

		Mr.
Cram	PERSON	writes not alone from the point of view of an ardent Gothicist , but from that of an ardent churchman as well , and this contributes both to the strength and to the weakness of his book to its strength because he has so keen and constant a realization of the nobility and vitality of the essential spirit of Catholicism ; to its weak - ness because all those who fail or have failed of that realization are to him either heretics , heathen , or pagans , bent on establishing the king - dom of Satan upon earth .

		Paradoxically , iron - 518 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	ically , intolerance was and is the indelible stain upon the white robe of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The hunt - ing down of heresies and the persecution of heretics has ever been a part of its activities .

		If it is maintained that this is necessary to the existence of any religion , one has only to look for refutation to Buddhism , with its wise and gentle tolerance for alien faiths .

		Ask the av - erage Catholic priest about Buddha and he will tell you that
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	was a false god of the heathens ; ask a Buddhist priest about Christ and he will place him among the great hierarchy of spiritual teachers of mankind .

		If Catholicism , as Mr.
Cram	PERSON	hopes , and half believes , is to effect the spiritual regeneration of civilized society after the war , it must become catholic in fact as well as in name .

		To the reviewer it seems quite as probable that a war - weary world will turn for healing to the secret and sacred wisdom of the immemorial East , treasured for centuries in the brooding bosom of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Then indeed we shall find that West is East , and
East is West	LOCATION	, after centuries of mutual misunderstanding .

		In either case the world will not be the loser , for if its soul awakes , stirred and summoned by whatever `` righteous and eternal forces , '' the flower of great art will blossom again , to be the vehicle of these forces .

		Science , now organ - ized so largely in the service of death , will become the handmaiden of beauty , inaugurating another of those wondrous epochs of free-flowing life of which ruined
Rheims	LOCATION	has come to be the sad and eloquent symbol .

		The German cannon which aimed to obliterate that solid and serene rebuke to all their frightfulness have acted instead as so many pointed forefingers to make men see and remember the real and eternal issues raised by the war .

		This is Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's valedictory on that phase of art of which
Rheims	LOCATION	is a supreme example : Gothic art had done its work ; it had given immortal form to Christian civilization , and it passed with the splendid thing it had so faithfully served .

		It can never come back , at least with the life and power which were its own ... Whether its spirit comes back to express , in some new series of forms , the righteous and eternal forces that made the Mediaeval man and the
Mediaeval State	ORGANIZATION	, depends on the answer the world gives to the great question propounded by the War .

		The interest of Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's book lies , not in the picture he draws of the splendor of mediaeval - ism as expressed in its architecture , masterly as that picture is , but in its foreshadowing of a pic - ture still to be painted on the blank canvas of the future years .

		About two years ago Mr.
Frank Woore	PERSON	, an antiquarian bookseller of
St. Peter	ORGANIZATION	's Street , Der - by , bought `` at a country sale , among a num - ber of old ledgers and account books ... two quarto manuscript volumes containing the rem - iniscences of
Charles MacFarlane	PERSON	. ''

		A small part of the manuscript was in
MacFarlane	ORGANIZATION	's own writing ; for the rest a number of amanu - enses had been employed .

		Mr.
John F. Tatter	PERSON	- sail was given a sight of these volumes , and has now edited them for the public .

		His work as editor , he informs us , has consisted in the omis - sion of a few entries of minor interest or of a nature to give pain to living representatives of the persons referred to , in the arrangement of the material , and in the correction of errors made by the amanuenses without the author 's having had an opportunity to revise .

		MacFarlane has been all but forgotten , even by the students of the literature of the period .

		Yet in his day he was a man of considerable prominence .

		He was born in
1799	DATE	, spent the happiest years of his life -LRB- 1816-1827 -RRB- at Na - ples , visited
Greece	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	, returned to Lon - don in
1829	DATE	, associated personally with nearly all the conspicuous people of the time , married , begot children , fell on evil days , was admitted as a `` Poor Brother '' to the Charterhouse in
1857	DATE	, and died the following year .

		His literary works , of which a list , compiled by himself , is given in an appendix , were of a miscellaneous character , but for the most part comprise travel sketches , historical writings , and three `` historical tales , '' one of which , Mr.
Tattersall	PERSON	conjectures , may have given
Kingsley	PERSON	the idea for `` Here - ward the Wake . ''

		The present volume , published sixty years after the demise of the author , was not meant by
MacFarlane	ORGANIZATION	to be put into print immedi - ately .

		He composed it partly to cheer his soli - tude , partly with the thought that it might some day be published , and partly that it might be prized as an heirloom by his eldest son , an officer in the British army .

		It was begun in
1855	DATE	.

		The author 's purpose may be given in his own words : It has been my fortune , both at home and abroad , to be thrown among very many remarkable persons , of some of whom the world still talks and writes , and will continue to talk and write .

		I will say my
1917	DATE	-RCB- THE DIAL 519 say of these , and give some of their sayings and doings .

		I have never Boswellized ; I have never thought it fair to go from a man 's table straight to one 's diary , and before his dinner be digested or the flavour of his claret passed away , to sit down and enregister all that he has been saying in the confi - dence or carelessness of conviviality .

		But though I took no `` notes , '' I pondered over and treasured what I heard as also what I saw and as my memory has been very retentive , I think that I may report with tolerable accuracy .

		I can not promise to myself that in these souvenirs I shall be always and in - variably eulogistic ... De mortuis nil nisi bonum is a benevolent-looking maxim , but it will not do in practice ; it would be the death of history , of bio - graphy , of anecdote .

		Of anecdote of pleasantly told gossip there is no dearth in the volume .

		A rapid reading of the 300 pages is not only a recreation in itself , but a reminder of the personal characteristics of the men of that time and of the tangled inter - relations of these men with one another .

		Our memories grow hazy on such points as the jeal - ousy of
Rogers	PERSON	-LRB- `` Old Sam '' -RRB- toward
Sydney Smith	PERSON	, the wearisome and boastful loquacity of the other
Sidney Smith	PERSON	-LRB- the savior of Acre -RRB- , the rudeness of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	to Lamartine in calling Be - ranger `` the greatest poet of modern
France	LOCATION	, '' the feud between
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	and
Tom Moore	PERSON	, the perennial borrowing by Mrs.
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	of five pounds from
Carlyle	LOCATION	; but
MacFarlane	PERSON	reac - quaints us , or newly acquaints us , with these mat - ters .

		Of his lighter gossip an example is this incident `` after a very jovial dinner at Old
John Murray	PERSON	's '' King
John	PERSON	's : Theodore Hook was called upon to sing one of his improvised songs .

		He was in `` keff '' and in vein ; he sang three songs in succession , and really excelled himself .

		-LSB- The conceited
Thomas -RSB- Campbell	PERSON	, con - siderably more than three-fourths `` fou , '' went off into an ecstasy , and taking his wig off his head , he threw it across the table at
Theodore	LOCATION	, shouting , `` There , you dog !

		Take my laurels !

		They are yours ! ''

		The laugh - ter was uproarious ...
Washington	LOCATION	Irving laughed until his sides ached , and then with a sly , demure face told
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	that he had never before fancied those poetical locks were not of his own growth .

		But light , frothy comment is not all .

		Mac -
Farlane	PERSON	was a man of cultivated mind , was a fit associate of the varied personalities with whom he had contact .

		The chief value of his book lies in his reaction to those personalities .

		And along with his easy-going chatter about them goes an instinct for discerning the things which are char - acteristic , revealing .

		He perceives that the graceful turn which Sir
Thomas Lawrence	PERSON	would give a letter to a tailor a turn as elegant as if he meant the letter for a duchess is a symbol of the painter 's pride in doing everything thoroughly .

		In Shelley he sees personal pecu - liarities , yet asserts that the poet `` never could have been taken for anything but a true thor - oughbred English gentleman , '' and adds : `` He was all over feeling , and all his feelings were of the acutest sort .

		Had he not been drowned as he was , he never could have lasted ; the bright , sharp sword had already outworn the scabbard .

		.

		.

		His was never atheism , but a sort of inde - scribable pantheism ... Perishing as he did , he was getting his philosophy and his religion all right . ''

		Keats , he declares , `` could hardly see a
London	LOCATION	street row without the impulsive wish to be in the midst of it ... He was one of the most cheery and plucky little fellows I ever knew ... I rather think that what I most ad - mired in
Keats	PERSON	were his pluck and thorough abhorrence of what after my friend
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	we now call ` shams . ' ''

		He assures us that
Moore	PERSON	`` was thoroughly a manly fellow , and except on certain rare occasions , utterly de - void of pretension and affectation '' an assur - ance the latter part of which the reader of the melodist 's journal will perhaps modify a little .

		The senescent
Godwin	PERSON	he pictures as more human than we might have surmised , and he throws in the touching sentence : `` I rather fancied that he liked me because I had known poor
Shelley	PERSON	and his wife . ''

		He finds sterling qualities in
Beau Brummell	LOCATION	.

		He shows anew how genuinely the great-hearted
Scott	PERSON	was affected by his environ - ment .

		He deplores the impression that Words - worth , in his later years , `` was a circumspect , cold-hearted man . ''

		Most delightful of all his portraits is that of
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	, of which no adequate idea may be had unless the reader consults it for himself .

		MacFarlane cherishes few grudges .

		He read - ily forgives
Charles Knight	PERSON	, who brought him to financial ruin .

		Yet he sometimes interprets harshly .

		He is severe toward
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, unspar - ing of De Quincey , vindictive toward
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Of the ill-favoured , dogmatizing , masculine spinster '' he quotes ap - provingly the dictum of
John Wilson Croker	PERSON	in the `` Quarterly '' : `` The false , foul , and unfem - inine pen of Miss Martineau . ''

		His acquaint - ance with
Impey	PERSON	, whom
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	pillories in the essay on
Warren Hastings	PERSON	, and with many of the documents in the case , may account in part for his virulence toward the `` right hon. lampooner ... whom people persist in calling the Historian , although with him History is little more than a romance and a political satire . ''

		But the surer clue lies elsewhere .

		MacFarlane , 520 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	travelled and experienced as he was , was pro- nouncedly conservative .

		He hated any signs of departure from Anglicanism , he loathed the Whigs , he looked upon the passage of the Re - form Bill as an event which would send the country and the future to the dogs .

		It seems hard for him , with all his personal charity , to do justice to a man of liberal temper .

		Not that he was as reactionary as many other men of the age .

		Yet he was reactionary enough for us to have doubts about his fairness to Pole-loving
Campbell	PERSON	-LRB- `` Freedom shrieked when Kosciuszko fell '' -RRB- , to De Quincey with his `` solemn cant , '' to religion - baiting , political - economy - lauding
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	, to Macaulay the Whig , and the rest .

		And we should give greater weight to his approval of
Shelley	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and God - win if he did not himself assure us that
Shelley	PERSON	was becoming orthodox ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	was no longer given to indiscretions , and
Godwin	PERSON	had lost his religious and political radicalism .

		Hon - est and candid as
MacFarlane	ORGANIZATION	is , we must reckon with this bias in his nature in deciding whether his interpretation of a given personality is just and sound .

		GARLAND GREEVER .

		A Nucleus of ff ^ orld Organization THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES .

		Their Future Relations and
Joint International Obligations	ORGANIZATION	.

George Louis Beer	PERSON	.

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Now and again the full-flowing stream of war literature bears to the reviewer 's desk a volume of substantial and lasting worth .

		Such a book is Mr.
Beer	PERSON	's `` English-Speaking Peoples , '' con - taining the most penetrating analysis of past and present Anglo-American relations that has yet been made , and discussing with peculiar sanity the future duties and dealings of the several great branches of the English-speaking family .

		Upwards of twenty-five years ago the question of a formal political connection between the Brit - ish Empire and the
United States	LOCATION	was debated with much seriousness in certain circles on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The final word was ut - tered by Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	in a thoughtful essay wherein he laid all due stress on the nu - merous and important bonds of sympathy and interest between the English and the American peoples , but declared that the ground was not yet prepared `` in the hearts and understandings '' of Americans , and probably not in those of Brit - ish citizens .

		As Mr.
Beer	PERSON	rightly says , strong unifying forces have been at work during
this quarter-century	DATE	, and particularly since
1914	DATE	, and the question of the future relations of the two peoples has taken on an entirely different aspect .

		It is not assumed that a political reunion is any more feasible to-day than it was in
1894	DATE	, and Mr.
Beer	PERSON	does not undertake to discuss that ques - tion .

		But he does seek to explain -LRB- to use his own words -RRB- `` the advisability and necessity of a cooperative democratic alliance of all the Eng - lish-speaking peoples , from which may possibly in time be developed such a new type of perma - nent political association . ''

		The discussion begins with a trenchant analy - sis of the shortcomings of the modern system of sovereign states a system which the writer frankly characterizes as `` international anarchy . ''

		Not only is the present cataclysm the outcome of a system which sets off nations one against another and enshrouds interstate intercourse with a `` murky atmosphere of fear and suspi - cion , '' but so long as the community of states remains unorganized , the `` will to war '' of one of its members will always be able to thwart the pacific purposes of the majority .

		Interna - tional law , arbitral machinery , `` ententes , '' and understandings all must fail to save the world from being a great armed camp , so long as the nations refuse to yield their jealous separatism and to give up the notion that they , as sovereign states , must demand from their citizens supreme and undivided dedication .

		It is plausibly argued that no nation , particularly under present-day conditions , can really be fully self-controlling -LRB- that is , fully sovereign -RRB- , and that a more gen - eral recognition of this fact would have the wholesome effect of causing states to relax their rigid attitudes toward their neighbors .

		Mr.
Beer	PERSON	's main point is that this sort of re - laxation is to be expected first from nations that have longest been on good terms , and that have most in common .

		The English-speaking nations best meet this condition ; hence the plea is for the initiation of the new type of internationalism by and among these nations .

		Gradually , it is hoped , the idea will commend itself elsewhere ; and finally the whole civilized world may attain such a measure of organization as to make great catas - trophes like the present war forever impossible .

		The major portion of the book is taken up with a description of our foreign policy before and during the war , and with an inquiry into the ex - tent and character of the unity of the English - speaking peoples , with a view to ascertaining
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 521 how far these peoples now are from the mu - tually trustful attitude required for the inter - national reorganization that is advocated .

		The judgment passed on the American policy of sep - aratism is severe .

		`` Almost , if not equally , as dis - astrous to the civilization of the world as are the aims and acts of
Germany	LOCATION	, was the tradi - tional attitude of the
United States	LOCATION	which , im - mersed in concern for its own peace and liberty , had until
1917	DATE	adhered to a policy of ` no for - eign entanglements ' outside the western hemi - sphere that is tantamount to a repudiation of all responsibility for maintaining justice and right in interstate relations other than such as directly affected the American continents . ''

		The
United States	LOCATION	is , accordingly , held to a degree of negative responsibility for the present war , and it is declared that the contest has given the death blow to the country 's cherished policy of isolation by demonstrating what ought to have been plain before that the traditional course of non - intervention is impossible in a highly interdepen - dent world .

		In the author 's opinion , the time has come for a permanent English-speaking alliance an alli - ance not of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	alone , but of all the English-speaking peoples of the world , so that the great self-governing do - minions of
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
South Africa	LOCATION	will have their clearly defined and proper places in it .

		In a final chapter the reasons for such an alliance are succinctly set forth .

		They run sub - stantially as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the English-speaking peoples have a deep and lasting inheritance of common speech , ideas , institutions , purposes , and methods ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- upon them will fall , in a peculiar degree , the task of economic rehabilitation after the war , requiring the closest cooperation ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- their security is dependent on a preponderance of sea power , which they can more economically maintain in collaboration than separately ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the two fundamentals of American foreign pol - icy which are likely to survive the present con - flict that is , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and Chinese integrity have heretofore been powerfully sup - ported by British good-will , and can best be maintained in the future with the aid of that valuable force ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the alliance would mean an accumulation of strength such as would avert the danger of preparedness in any of the coun - tries growing into militarism ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- the English - speaking peoples must form the central element in a League to , Enforce Peace , or any similar international organization having as its object the discouragement of war .

		Mr.
Beer	PERSON	's argument is logical and forceful .

		He has scrupulous regard for the facts of history and economics ; his views are the outcome of a lifetime of study of British imperial and colonial affairs and of international politics .

		Many , per - haps most , of his readers will shrink from ' his conclusions .

		Even to-day the proposal that the
United States	ORGANIZATION	adopt a settled policy of foreign alliances is somewhat startling .

		But no one will be justified in withholding from this book the tribute of candid and thoughtful consideration .

		To a world in chaos such a piece of constructive reasoning and planning should be welcome .

		The Story of a Failure THE RISE OF
DAVID LEVINSKY	PERSON	.

		By
Abraham Cahan	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Fifteen or twenty years ago there appeared in the magazines some remarkable stories of the
East Side of New York	LOCATION	by
Abraham Cahan	PERSON	.

		They were not of the crudely comic type of
Potash	ORGANIZATION	and
Perlmutter	PERSON	, nor were they in the somewhat finer mood of sentimental humor which made the late
Myra Kelly	PERSON	deservedly popular .

		They were humorous and pathetic in a quiet , compelling way , with a gentle austerity of tone even less familiar to American readers then than it is in the days of the Russian invasion .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	praised these stories and he and others in editorial authority encouraged the author to write more .

		A career in the pleasant art of fiction was open to Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	.

		But he with - drew from it and , so far as I know , he has written no more stories for at least ten years .

		He has devoted his energy to building up the great Jewish daily `` Forward , '' which is not only the voice of the
East Side	LOCATION	, but a powerful vehicle of social and political ideals that have not yet penetrated the capitalistic sanctums of
Times Square	ORGANIZATION	and
Nassau Street	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now , as he approaches sixty , Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	gives us this solid , mature novel , into which are com - pacted the reflections of a lifetime .

		The notice on the wrapper calls it `` a story of success in the turmoil of American life . ''

		Probably the writer of those words intended to help the book by the appeal which `` success '' makes to the American mind , for no reader , not even a pub - lisher 's clerk , could miss the immense irony of 522 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	the story .

		It is indeed the story of a failure .

		The vanity of great riches was never set forth with more searching sincerity .

		The helplessness of the individual , even the strong and prosperous , in the economic whirlpool , the loneliness and disillusionment only partly assuaged by pride in commercial achievement , the sacrifice of the intel - lectual life to the practical , these are the funda - mental themes of the book .

		Levinsky , with the instincts of a scholar and a desire for the finest things in life , is swept into business by circum - stances which he hardly understands himself and against which he is powerless ; once in the game he makes the most of his abilities , but he never ceases to regard his visible good fortune as poor compensation for the invisible things he has missed .

		His wealth forces him to associate with all that is vulgar and acquisitive in
Jewry	LOCATION	and isolates him from all that is idealistic .

		He finds that he can not even speak the language of the woman he most admires .

		Worse still , he is out of sympathy with the aspirations of millions of poor Jews from whose ranks he has sprung .

		He has no sympathy with those who would break the game up or make new rules , yet he sees that the game is hardly worth playing , even for the winner .

		`` Success !

		Success !

		Success !

		It was the almighty goddess of the hour .

		Thousands of new fortunes were advertising her gaudy splen - dors .

		Newspapers , magazines , and public speeches were full of her glory , and he who found favor in her eyes found favor in the eyes of man . ''

		The portrait of
David Levinsky	PERSON	is a portrait of society , not simply of the Jewish section of it , or of
New York	LOCATION	, but of American business .

		And business is business whether done by Jew or
Gentile	PERSON	.

		If
Levinsky	PERSON	is a triumphant failure , he is so because American business , which shaped him to its ends , is , viewed from any decent regard for humanity , a miserable monster of suc - cess .

		Not that
Levinsky	PERSON	is an abstraction , or that the novelist is forcing a thesis .

		Far from it .

		The personality of Mr.
Levinsky	PERSON	is as sharply individualized as the hero of
Meredith	PERSON	's `` One of Our Conquerors , '' though with a different kind of subtlety , the subtlety not of detached analysis , but of naively simple self-revelation , which of course is not so simple as it sounds .

		Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	is an artist ; he knows how to think through his characters , by letting them do the thinking , as if it were their affair and not his .

		At the same time he does not perform -LRB- nor does any other artist -RRB- that foolish and meaning - less operation , as expressed by a great poet through a young critic , of holding `` the mirror up to nature . ''

		Nature in a mirror is just nature , not nature thought out , excogitated , turned to human uses , interpreted in human words .

		And this is the place to say that Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	knows how to use words .

		There are no great phrases in this book .

		A simple and -LRB- intellectually -RRB- honest busi - ness man writing his autobiography would not use a great phrase ; such a phrase might issue from some enviable person in that intellectual life from which
Levinsky	PERSON	was excluded .

		But there is no banal or inept phrase .

		Such a man as Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	intends
Levinsky	PERSON	to be , a man trained in the
Talmud	LOCATION	, which means verbal sense , and hammered by the facts of life , which means a sense of reality , and a wistful failure , which means imaginative retrospection , says things in a direct , firm , accurate style .

		There is no lack of emotion ; strong feeling , expressed or implied , runs through the book from beginning to end .

		But there is a complete absence of elo - quence , a deliberate refraining from emphasis , an even manner of setting forth ideas and events impartially for the value inherent in them , an admirable method , the method of a philosophic artist .

		Here is life ; some of it is good , some of it is bad ; it is all somewhat pitiable , to be laughed at rather than cried over ; nobody is deserving of indignant blame or abuse .

		It is our business to understand it as well as we can ; and though we never can see it in its entirety or with complete clearness , if we make an honest effort to record events and delineate personalities , the events will arrange themselves in a more or less intelligible sequence , and the personalities will be their own commentary upon themselves .

		An obvious method , but you will read many a book to find one skilful application of it .

		It seems to me the method most often employed and carried to the highest degree of perfection by the great Russians .

		I am driven to the timid - ity of `` seems '' by my friend
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	, who reminds us in his bluff-calling manner that we do much talking about Russian novels with - out having read many of them or understanding what we have read .

		But better-informed critics than I have noted that one characteristic of the Russian novel is a benevolent impartiality in its treatment of all kinds of people and a calm con - templation of events horrible , gay , sad , comic .

		A revolutionist can portray , in fiction , a commis - sioner of police , whom in real life he would be
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 523 willing to kill , with a fairness that is more than fair , with a combination of Olympian serenity and human sympathy .

		He can be a virulent propagandist when he is writing pamphlets , and when he writes fiction he can forget his propa - ganda or subdue it to art , that is , to a balanced sense of life .

		A remarkable case is
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's `` Resurrection . ''

		Tolstoy had given up art as a bad job and had been for years a zealous prop - agandist , benevolent and philosophic , to be sure , but exaggerated and distorted .

		He had fallen under the influence of
Henry George	PERSON	and the single-tax idea -LRB- because he , like
George	PERSON	, lived in a country where the chief economic problem was agrarian -RRB- .

		When he came to write `` Resurrec - tion , '' he made his hero a protagonist of the single-tax theory .

		A propagandist who was not an artist would have made that theory succeed in the book .

		Success in fiction is cheap and easy .

		But
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, an artist that is , a man with a feeling for the facts of life made the idea fail before the conservatism of the peasants whom the idea was intended to benefit .

		That is honesty in art .

		When I say that Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	's novel sounds like a good translation of a Russian novel , and that he is a disciple of the Russian novelists , I accuse him of the crime of being an artist and a seer .

		As a matter of biography , he is a child of Russian literature .

		And that is why his novel , written in faultless English , is a singular and soli - tary performance in American fiction .

		If that strange demand for `` the '' or `` a great American novel , '' a demand which is at once foolish and the expression of a justifiably proud feeling that a big country ought to have big books , is to be satisfied , perhaps we shall have to ask an
East Side Jew	LOCATION	to write it for us .

		That would be an interesting phenomenon for some future Profes - sor
Wendell	PERSON	to deal with in a
History of Ameri	ORGANIZATION	- can Literature .

		And by the way , Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	is a competent critic .

		I hope he will give us not only more novels , but a study of Russian literature for the enlightenment of the American mind .

		I remember with gratitude an article of his which I read when I was even more ignorant than I am now , on the modern successors to the group of Titans ,
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Dostoev	PERSON	- sky .

		He put Maxim Gorky in his place and told us -LRB- this was before the Russian invasion -RRB- about Andreyev and
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	.

		If Mr.
Cahan	PERSON	will write a book on Russian literature , I will do my best to establish him in his merited place
Jacob Tons	PERSON	on in American literature .

		BOOKS AND PERSONS .

		By
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Here you are face to face with a professional `` a tremendous and omniscient expert , '' to bor - row one of
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's own thumping phrases .

		In our American world of salesmen and brokers , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	would indubitably have been known as a `` live wire . ''

		Easy to imagine other brokers hanging on his lips , waiting for the golden word that might turn out to be an invaluable tip and the first stage on the road to fortune .

		I do not mean to be disrespectful ; I mean to be complimentary .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has taken the trouble to know his business from the ground up rather than from the clouds down , and that in itself is quite sufficient to give any real artist distinction in the world of letters .

		He knows the technical side and the publishing side , and he has taken the trouble to formulate a pretty definite notion of the public for which he writes .

		He is sufficiently alive to be keenly and not superciliously interested in all the gossip going , and he does not pretend to disdain trivial - ities .

		He did not begin to be an artist by the aristocratic process of exclusion or elimination , and even if we are obliged to regard his peculiar case as one of the happy cases of dual personality and to think of him as , so to speak , a two-fisted writer , that does n't in the least invalidate the message he has to give to the novice .

		That most novices will be inclined to mistake his sanity for cynicism and resent the cool grays in his picture of the literary life , makes no difference what - ever .

		The base on which Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's talent rests is common sense .

		Some people complain that that is precisely what is the matter with him , by which they mean to indicate , I suppose , that his work is not sufficiently irradiated with imag - ination .

		They feel cheated , let down , forced to live too much on one plane and in the mood of
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	.

		Well , I confess that one does feel that sometimes in the novels , especially in the famous trilogy ; there are vast , arid stretches in `` Hilda Lessways '' and I think there are some even in `` The Old Wives ' Tale . ''

		There is often something mechanical and galvanic about the simulation of romantic ecstasy especially when it is a question of the illusions of youth .

		The exclamation point bends under the burden it has to support .

		But as critic , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	almost always recognizes a work of authentic imagina - tion when he sees it ; nor is his enthusiasm 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	rendered less happily infectious by the fact that he tolerates no nonsense and begins by as - suming that the production of masterpieces is something more than `` inspirational hypersthe - nia . ''

		The present volume is made up of selections from the cauteries he contributed to `` The New Age '' during the years 1908-11 , under the name of ``
Jacob Tonson	PERSON	. ''

		The range is considerable , giving Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's reactions to publishers , the public , the literary agent , the prevalence of cant , and so on ; but I think the book is chiefly inter - esting as a record of the casual judgments casual in form only of a tremendous expert on his fellow-craftsmen .

		Such judgments are always immensely stimulating even if they are n't -LRB- as Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is fond of pretending -RRB- the only judgments worth listening to .

		They are usually more provocative and enlivening than elaborate criticism , for they may be as these are quite innocent of rhetoric , and rhetoric can be an ap - palling spoil-sport .

		It suggests embalming fluid .

		The liveliest idea , treated with rhetoric , often takes on the vacuous placidity of a corpse .

		Here , on the other hand , we get the writer 's enthu - siasms and exasperations , his forethoughts and afterthoughts , and even his profanity .

		All of which is precisely as it should be in a causerie that is often no more than an expanded para - graph .

		So far as Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's enthusiasms are con - cerned , most of them were quite easy for a man of taste writing in
1908	DATE
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	,
Conrad	PERSON	-LRB- whom he only , to be sure , defends against the ineptitude of the `` Athenaeum '' -RRB- ,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		What he says about Mr.
Ches	PERSON	- terton seems to me altogether just and not too severe ; Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's dogmatic orthodoxy , coming at this time of day , stamps his mind , for all its brilliancy , as second-rate .

		-LRB- Since the beginning of the war it has been absolutely third - rate , when it has n't been in abeyance . -RRB-

		Nor are his remarks on the later Rudyard Kipling too drastic .

		Some would object to them as socio - logical .

		The crux of the matter is Kipling 's at - titude to the English land system .

		`` To read this story one could never guess that the English land system is not absolutely ideal , that tenants and hereditary owners do not live always in a delightful patriarchal relation , content .

		There are no shadows whatever . ''

		But what Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- nett is objecting to is not Kipling 's tory com - placency ; it is his blindness a very serious disability in an artist .

		We are working now into the region of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's aversions .

		I have kept no count , but my impression is that the aversions are more numerous than the enthusiasms in this collection , and there can be no doubt at all that they are more vivacious .

		His judgments of doom are `` short and shattering . ''

		Take the case of Ar - thur
Christopher Benson	PERSON	a shining mark who has come off unscathed under a shower of arrows .

		`` Much if not most of the Thread of Gold ' is merely absurd .

		Some of it is pretentious , some of it is inept .

		All of it is utterly banal .

		All of it has the astounding calm assurance of medi - ocrity .

		It is a solemn thought that tens of thou - sands of well-dressed mortals alive and idle to-day consider themselves to have been uplifted by the perusal of this work . ''

		With Mr.
Benson	PERSON	one may loosely lump such other aversions as Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	,
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, and
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	all incomparable idols of the book-reading mob , the mob , in this sense , being composed of the `` superior stolid comfortable , '' the middle - class props of the status quo and the invincible enemies of progress and art .

		How they dote on elegance !

		The elegant emotions of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's heroines , and the elegant upholstery and language of
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	's .

		As for Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, she knows her business ; her novels are possibly `` the best stuff now being swallowed by the uneducated public ; and they deal with the governing classes ; and when you have said that you have said all .

		Nothing truly serious can happen in them .

		It is all make-believe .

		No real danger of the truth about life ... I should think not indeed ! ''

		The chief remaining aversion of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is the mandarin , and the most mandarinic of the mandarins is for him the professor .

		Here Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	assumes the posture of the professional heaping scorn on the amateur .


Churton Collins	PERSON	is his particular bete noire .

		`` He had acquired much learning .

		Indeed , I should suppose that on the subject of literature he was the most learned man in
Britain	LOCATION	.

		Unfortunately , he was quite bereft of original taste ... The frown - ing structure of his vast knowledge overawed many people , but it never overawed an artist unless the artist was excessively young and naive . ''

		And Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	goes on `` de-classing the whole professorial squad
Bradley	PERSON	,
Herford	ORGANIZATION	,
Dowden	PERSON	,
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	,
Elton	LOCATION	,
Saintsbury	LOCATION	.

		The first business of any writer , and especially of any crit - ical writer , is not to be mandarinic and tedious , and these lecturers have not yet learnt that first business . ''

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 525 Indeed , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's attitude to all criticism , whether mandarinic or not , is frankly aristocratic .

		The critic wants the special insight and sympa - thy that belongs to the `` creative artist , '' and without that he is simply bound to flounder ; above all , he is bound to arrive late at the feast .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's ostentatious and persistent appro - priation of the title `` creative artist '' is not un - suggestive of swank , a form of self-indulgence with which he is on intimate terms , as he has shown conclusively in more than one novel .

		That is not , however , the whole story .

		No !

		If he is hard on the professor here and harsh elsewhere with the dilettante , the man who knows more and talks better than any creative artist , it is not altogether because he objects to the genteel tradition in criticism .

		Impossible to acquit him of a touch of envy .

		Not envy of the professor 's gentility or of his eminence , but envy solely of the blissful amplitude of his leisure .

		What a chance to read books , all the books there are !

		Some , perhaps most , creative artists are quite innocent of any such envy ;
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, however , is really a bookman and there is not a little evidence that he has had to remind himself now and then that the main business of the writer is to write and not to read .

		Such things are naturally irritating .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS Night on the Beach A bare spit of sand Stretches out to the dark ; At the border of it , houses : Sparse-scattered blocks of obscurity .

		At the edge of it , night , And a surging , a moaning , Something clutching hard at the edge of the sand , Something sliding in terror away .

		Two people drift past , Talking in low voices ; They are lost , blurred shadows In the grey flatness .

		The heavy clouds hang in the sky As if they dared not go further ; A wind scurries hastily over the sand and then stops .

		PORTRAITS AND PROTESTS .

		By
Sarah N. Cleghorn	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		As a poet Miss
Cleghorn	PERSON	's gift is a slender one , and lies rather in intention than in accomplish - ment .

		Her subject-matter is usually fit for lyrical treatment , whether it is the picture of a girl or a landscape or even a little social irony .

		But her manner of handling these themes is too completely conventional to be poetic .

		While the verses have all a distinct personal accent , they fail adequately to convey emotion .

		This is partly due to the fact that the author clings to lilting measures , intelligible for `` Margerita Singing Ballads , '' but not for ``
Jane Addams	PERSON	, '' that she uses inversion frequently , permits her metrical feet to stumble , and has a rather tiresome fond - ness for flounces and roundabouts .

		The lack of intensity is perhaps also due to Miss
Cleghorn	PERSON	's austere passion for
New England	LOCATION	.

		The portion of the book called `` Protests '' has more of prop - aganda value than of warm human anger in it , and the occasional humor is as dry as the air of
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		An instance of lyrism exceptional for the volume is this : Fields of fireflies Wheel all night like stars above the wheat .

		But this note on
George Herbert	PERSON	is more characteristic : He led the wanton English Muse to church : The lovely pagan
Muse	PERSON	, `` well drest and clad . ''

		Several of the poems show a kinship with the shrewd talent of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, but not her genius .

		The difference is significant : where the latter was , even on her intellectual altitudes , com - municative ,
Miss Cleghorn	PERSON	remains merely expressive .

		NEW ZEALAND IN EVOLUTION .

		By
G. H. Scholefield	PERSON	.

		New Edition .

		Scribner ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		`` You ca n't tell , '' as the admirable
Crichton	PERSON	of Mr.
Barry	PERSON	remarked , `` what will happen on an island . ''


New Zealand	LOCATION	is the most insular of civilized countries .

		It is 4000 miles from
South America	LOCATION	, the nearest continental land area , and it is divided from
Australia	LOCATION	by `` an uninterrupted moat twelve hundred miles in width at its narrowest part . ''

		And a great many things have been happening in
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		During the last seventy-five years the islands have been a sort of political experiment station for the rest of the world .

		In
1840	DATE	European civilization was represented by a handful of pioneers and perhaps 60,000 savages , among whom cannibalism was not yet extinct .

		To-day
New Zealand	LOCATION	is a commonwealth of a million middle-class souls living under the most ad - vanced democracy in the world .

		Within this brief period this little island nation has faced 526 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	and , humanly speaking , has solved most of the problems that older peoples are reluctantly be - ginning to consider .

		It had a race problem , which it `` solved '' by guaranteeing to the natives their rights in the soil and making of them , like the Indians in
Oklahoma	LOCATION	, a landlord class .

		It had a land problem , which it solved by a policy which has tended to make great estates unprofit - able and to discourage absentee ownership .

		It had a labor problem , which it met by the estab - lishment of a national labor bureau , a state farm for the unemployed , and a system of com - pulsory arbitration .

		It has had other problems , which it has met by taking its coal mines under state control , by the organization of a state life-insurance com - pany , the establishment of a state sawmill , and by taking over the control of the national oyster beds .

		Mr.
Scholefield	PERSON	's book , which was written in
1909	DATE	, is now published in a cheaper edition .

		At the time it was first published it was said , in spite of all that had been written on
New Zealand	LOCATION	, that nothing had been written which gave at once a comprehensive and consistent ac - count of the whole political and economic evo - lution of the island .

		This need the book met and nothing has since been published to take its place .

		There is a certain propriety , also , in the republication of the volume at this time , when the changes now going on in the political and economic organization of the world make the description of
New Zealand	LOCATION	's bold experi - ments in democracy , interesting reading .

		MILITARISM AT WORK .

		IN
BELGIUM	LOCATION	AND
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		By
K. G. Ossiannilsson	PERSON	.

		Un - win ; 2s .

		6d .

		In his Flag Day address President
Wilson	PERSON	made passing reference to the singular zest with which the German people seem to submit to their present oppressive form of government .

		Possibly the zest is only apparent , and not real .

		Mr.
Ossiannilsson	PERSON	depicts a highly organized system of ruthless repression against which pro- test has small chance of rising above a whisper .

		`` Why has German Liberalism proved such an utter failure ? ''

		he asks .

		`` Why is a double quar - tet allowed to sing the part which ought to resound with the full force of a massed choir ?

		Is everything hypnotized by militarism ?

		Is
Germany	LOCATION	so united in wrong-doing as we are made to fear and believe ? ''

		His reply is that the massed choir is only waiting for the leader 's baton , but that every potential leader is made to disappear , in the trenches or prisons or else - where , as soon as the attempt to raise the baton is ventured .

		That nefarious device of Prussian statecraft known as Preventive Arrest throws suspected persons into jail under the pretense of benevolently protecting them from their own latent tendencies to evil , and in jail they remain until their errant impulses are overcome .

		The insufferable governmental conditions now existing in
Belgium	LOCATION	and , in a somewhat less degree , in
Germany	LOCATION	itself , are plainly , with much docu - mentary evidence , exposed to view ; and finally
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Egmont is aptly quoted in behalf of his compatriots , the sturdy Belgians , in his elo - quent protest against the tyrannical rule of
Alba	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
H. G. Wright	PERSON	translates this little volume from the Swedish .


RUSSIA	LOCATION	AS I KNOW IT .

		By
Harry de Windt	ORGANIZATION	,
F.R.G.S. Lippincott	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		After all the conflicting reports and interpre - tations of
Russia	LOCATION	, it is significant that so experi - enced a traveller as Mr.
de Windt	PERSON	, having already written `` Siberia as It Is , '' should discreetly call this work ``
Russia	LOCATION	as I Know It . ''

		To have paralleled the former title would have been a hardy matter .

		In allowing the book to be pub - lished in its present form , however , the author risks the charge of taking undue advantage of the contemporary interest in things Russian .

		For , interesting as it is , the material shows every evidence of having been collated with less thought of homogeneity than of producing a book that would sell .

		The arrangement of subjects is curious .

		The reader is taken from
Petrograd	LOCATION	to
Moscow	LOCATION	, then to
Finland	LOCATION	and over to
Siberia	LOCATION	, back to
Kiev	LOCATION	, down to the
Crimea	LOCATION	, and finally to the
Caucasus	LOCATION	.

		Interspersed along the way are chapters on the moujik , the
Cossack	ORGANIZATION	, diversions , food , and creeds .

		The author is at his best when he writes of the Russian .

		He pictures and characterizes , leaving the reader to interpret .

		His friend the moujik is the subject of a particularly illuminating chapter .

		One learns from it that the Russian language is spoken all over the em - pire -LRB- for such he still calls it -RRB- with the same purity of accent by plebeian and patrician alike , and that you can tell an aristocrat from a moujik more by his manners than by his speech .

		The moujik has other excellent qualities .

		He is hos - pitable , industrious , skilful , brave .

		Extenuation is found for his laxity of morals in his cramped and insanitary housing conditions , and if his clothing is unclean and vermin-infested , he at least wars upon the parasites by subjecting them to a high temperature in the kitchen-stove oven .

		According to his education and training he is quite an exemplary citizen , a contrast in a variety of ways to the rich Siberian of whom the author was once a guest .

		The Siberian owned priceless pictures and other artistic treasures , horses and
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL carriages , and conservatories of rare orchids .

		His bedroom was furnished in
Louis	LOCATION	XV style by a famous Parisian decorator , yet he slept every night , fully dressed , on three chairs .

		Evidently Mr.
de Windt	PERSON	has not been in
Russia	LOCATION	very recently , for usually he tempers any positive statement regarding a condition that may have been changed by the revolution with a footnote or parenthesis such as `` or was -LRB- or did -RRB- under the Empire . ''

		It is difficult to believe , however , that this care was exercised in the assertions that there are fifty breweries in operation throughout
Finland	LOCATION	, that the Russian ballet is the finest in
Europe	LOCATION	, or that the revolutionary youth of both sexes are easily recognized , as they affect an eccen - tric style of dress .

		Enough of ante-bellum
Russia	LOCATION	must of necessity remain , however , to give the book some lasting value in spite of its blemishes , for it is mostly about people , and human nature does not change with politics .

		THE LADIES OF DANTE 'S LYRICS .

		By
Charles Hall Grandgent	PERSON	.

		Harvard Uni - versity Press ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		The most obvious parallels which come to one 's mind in reading these studies are two works of Dante himself , the `` New Life '' and the `` Banquet , '' where the poet frames a certain number of his lyrics in a prose commentary .

		Professor
Grandgent	PERSON	has translated the major - ity of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's short poems , grouped them to show their probable relation to one another , and surrounded them with all the exegesis that keen critical insight can offer .

		At first the reader is captivated by the charm of the style and the translations of the lyrics ; it is only on reflec - tion that he becomes aware of the masterly in - terpretation , based on long study of all
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		In the first chapter , entitled `` Violetta '' after one of the more shadowy of the ladies , there is a discussion of Italian poetry contem - porary with
Dante	PERSON	and of the evolution in his own manner , through rather conventional ama - tory verse , to the dolce stil nuovo , with its mys - tic idealism .

		The remaining studies deal with
Matelda	PERSON	, the lovely symbol of youth in the earthly paradise , with
Pietra	PERSON	, who inspired some of the most wildly beautiful of the lyrics , with
Beatrice	PERSON	, and with
Lisetta	PERSON	, possibly the lady of the window , who occupied some place in the poet 's mind , as he says , after the death of Beatrice .

		None of the figures can be positively identified , though Professor
Grandgent	PERSON	believes that each one is the idealized image of some woman known to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		In general the poems point to a tendency which seems to have been characteristic of the author .

		``
First Dante	ORGANIZATION	's fancy is stirred by a real person ; then , having come to regard this person as a symbol of some - thing abstract , he little by little loses conscious - ness of the reality and consecrates himself to the cult of the symbol .

		Having reached this last stage , he believes , or tries to persuade himself , that the whole experience has been an allegory . ''

		How TO STUDY ARCHITECTURE .

		By
Charles Henry Caffin	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	's object is to treat architecture as a live art one which grows out of both the needs and the ideals of life .

		He gives much more heed than is common in books of this type to the considerations religious , philosdphical , social , political , and economical that have in - fluenced architecture among various peoples in various ages ; and he is constantly , consistently concerned with architectural works as organic growths .

		His book , like most of its kind , labors through the ages to bring things down to us and to our day ; what is aside from the main line of advance to that goal is omitted .

		Thus the archi - tecture of the
Orient China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	is passed by : the gate recently opened to eastern painting and other arts is not yet wide enough to admit eastern building .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	has a sufficing chapter on Minoan architecture , based upon the excavations of
Evans	PERSON	and others in
Crete	LOCATION	; and thus he closes up the hiatus long felt between the architecture of
Egypt	LOCATION	and that of
Greece	LOCATION	, besides accounting more clearly for remains like those at
Mycenae	LOCATION	and Tiryns .

		He endeavors to appraise the value of individual buildings , as well as of national schools of building , and he stands throughout on the basis of organic structure and develop - ment .

		As but few peoples have been able to compass in their architecture a happy balance of logical and emotional elements , Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	now and then is naturally `` put to his stumps . ''

		Thus , Roman architecture , in its aesthetic aspects , was largely an overlaying of native construction with Greek decoration , quite illogically applied : if the Romans are to be praised , it must be mostly as organizers on a grand scale and as engineers of great energy and audacity .

		Again , if we are to enjoy the architecture of the Renaissance , at which time the master-builder was succeeded by the architect -LRB- in the modern sense -RRB- , we must regard its examples as works of pictorial design rather than as creations based on organic functioning .

		And what of the characteristic American architecture of the present day the steel-cage construction clothed in stone , brick , or terra cotta draperies lifted at random from all historical periods ?

		Well , we must be indul - gent here , too .

		We turn with a little sigh of relief to the Greeks , the Byzantines , and the mediaeval cathedral-builders , peoples of three 528 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	periods who were able to bring about a complete fusion of fine feeling and clear thinking .

		Mr.
Caffin	PERSON	makes concessions but does not yield ground .

		For the rest , his book offers throughout a sufficiency of practical detail for the student and the amateur ; and the illustrations , many of which are unhackneyed , invariably illustrate the points he is intent upon making .

		OLD ROADS OUT OF
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	.

		By
John T. Paris	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		Ten famous highways and their rich historical and legendary associations form the subject of Mr.
Faris	PERSON	's agreeably discursive volume .

		These roads , favorites with automobilists and , formerly at least , with equestrians and pedestrians , are the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Highway to
Wilmington	LOCATION	, the
Baltimore	LOCATION	, the West Chester , and the
Lancaster Turnpikes	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Gulph	PERSON	, the Ridge , the
Germantown	LOCATION	, the
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, the York , and the
Bristol Roads	LOCATION	, stretching out , collectively , somewhat like the radiating sticks of an open fan , with the Dela - ware River serving as the outside sticks and the city hall as the central pivot on which the sticks turn .

		No other city presents such a number of radiating highways passing through scenes of such varied beauty and historical interest .

		It was a happy thought to make them the subject of a book , and with much curious lore has the subject been enriched , showing diligence and no little original research in the treatment .

		Historical , genealogical , and literary items of note sprinkle the pages .

		WEIGHTS AND MEASURES .

		By
Franklin P. Adams	PERSON	.

		Doubleday ,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION
$ 1	MONEY	.

		The worth of a jest is said to lie in the ears of him that hears it .


Franklin P. Adams	PERSON	is enough of a psychologist to know this axiom , and he plays on the joy of recognition to gain much of his deserved applause .

		He chooses his audience , and gives its members things to gloat over which will waken familiar echoes in their brains , as well as delight them with his own happy wit .

		This audience is , however , catholic .

		It should know its classics ,
Horace	PERSON	,
Catullus	LOCATION	,
Propertius	LOCATION	, as it knows its Irving Ber - lin and its
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		It should rejoice in things carnal , prefer tennis to toil , and have human sympathies withal , appreciating the righteous resentment of the ditch-digger against the plutocrat in a motor .

		This latest volume is rich in parodies , most of them so nice as to be exquisitely funny .

		Es - pecially good are those which at once parody and reply to such poets as
Amy Lowell	PERSON	,
Sara Teas	PERSON	- dale , and
Owen Seaman	PERSON	.

		But there are other bits which do not depend on any reference for their humor .

		Such are the `` Strange Cases '' of people whose fate is surprisingly what one would expect it to be , if one had not been led by pop - ular fiction ists to expect the unexpected ; the sweet , sardonic thumb-nail sketches of such no - tables as Mrs.
Vernon Castle	PERSON	and
Gaby Deslys	PERSON	; and verses like the pathetic plea to
W. Hohen	PERSON	- zollern , which concludes : Sue then for peace !

		And let the skies be fair again !

		The
Polo Grounds	ORGANIZATION	' most ardent eager tenant Was I. .

		.

		And ,
William	PERSON	, how I yearn to care again About such things as who will win the penant ! ''

		Besides his funniness , which depends as much on his assumptions of intimacy as on a gentle irony , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is felicitous in his use of exacting metres and involved rhyme-schemes .

		He takes a certain joy in overcoming technical difficulties , though he does not scruple to split a word for the rhyme 's sake , and then he seems to take you into his confidence regarding the poet 's problem .

		Most choice is his use of slang in paraphrasing Latin .

		Even his titles are mirth-provoking : `` Vides , ut alta stet nive candidum ... '' is entitled `` The Cold Wave of 32 B.C. '' ; `` Vixi puellis nuper idoneus ... '' is immortalized as `` When Q. H. F. Sang ` Good - bye Girls . ' ''

		The quality of these translations may be seen in this version of `` Vitas hinuleo me similis , Chloe '' :
Chloe	PERSON	, regard my song sententious And trust me as your soul 's director : No longer be a conscientious Objector .

		No lion , I , to feast upon You ,
Chloe	PERSON	.

		Do not be so distant .

		Forget your mother .

		Be a non - Resistarft .

		THE ORDER OF NATURE .

		By
Lawrence J. Henderson	PERSON	.


Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the recent thoughtful and stimulating work of this author on `` The Fitness of the Environ - ment '' emphasis was laid upon the fitness of the inorganic world for life .

		This is shown in cer - tain fundamental stabilities of the chemical and physical environment , in the equable temperature of the earth , in the constancy of alkalinity in the ocean , and in the regularity of currents in the atmosphere and the ocean .

		Again the mobilization of the chemical resources of the earth and their marvelous freedom of movement depend upon the unique properties of water .

		Thus the primary constituents of the environment , water and car - bonic acid , serve with maximum efficiency to make stable , durable , and complex both the liv - ing thing itself and the world around it .

		No other chemical substances could possibly replace them .

		The actual environment is thus the fittest possible abode of life , as we know it , in all its physical and chemical characteristics .

		Fitness of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 529 the environment is as constant a component of any particular case of adaptation as is the fit - ness of the organism itself .

		The very nature of matter and energy , of space and time , imposes certain general characteristics upon the organism which result in that mutual fitness which we call adaptation .

		The author maintains that a hith - erto unrecognized order exists among the proper - ties of matter , and one which makes things what they are .

		These peculiarities are not evenly dis - tributed among all the compounds of the chem - ical elements , nor are they apportioned according to the laws of chance , nor again by any conform - ity to the periodic system of the elements .

		The unique properties of hydrogen , oxygen , and car - bon bring about stability of physical and chem - ical conditions , diversity of phenomena , and the possibility of complexity , durability , and activity of physico-chemical systems on the planet .

		Static analysis masks this order , which becomes evident only when time is taken into account .

		It is the author 's effort in the present work to establish the importance of these three chemical elements for the process of cosmic evolution including that of organisms , resting his conclusions on what he calls the secure foundations of abstract physical science with the elimination of all mere biological theories .

		But Hamlet is gone from the play .

		Does abstract physical science include within its sure grasp all those properties of the organism with its ceaseless flux of matter and flow of energy and its cyclic persistence through the lapse of time ?

		The author then ventures to `` sketch the development of thought upon the problem of teleology , and at length to confront the scien - tific conclusions with the results of philosophical thought , in order finally to attempt a reconcilia - tion . ''

		Appendices to the discussion include
James Clerk Maxwell	PERSON	's classic essay on `` Deter - minism and Free-Will '' and
Fechner	PERSON	's on `` The Tendency to Stability . ''

		CAMP-FIRE VERSE .

		Chosen by
Williams Haynes	PERSON	and
Joseph LeRoy Harrison	PERSON	, with an introduction by
Stewart Edward White	ORGANIZATION	.

		Duffield ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This collection is unique and interesting , and is one which any lover of camp life may be glad to have on his shelves .

		At the same time , it offers great temptation to the usual criticism of a book of selections that the editors have neither put in nor left out the right things .

		The pref - ace says : `` We have tried to exclude all poems not conceived in the true spirit of the sportsman and to include no poems devoid of literary merit .

		Accordingly , some beautiful poems , sure of their place in literature , have been omitted as poetry rather of the library lamp by the study fireplace than of the crackling campfire beneath the stars ; and some verse , very true in its sporting spirit , has been discarded as doggerel . ''

		But , though
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Thoreau	PERSON	were in a sense `` literary fellers , '' some of their verse surely has the genu - ine breath of out-of-doors ; neither is represented , nor is
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	, nor Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	, nor
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Kipling and more strangely in view of the tone of the book
Robert W. Service	ORGANIZATION	have but one poem each .

		Most of the pieces are by authors who are , to the present reviewer at least , unknown , and many of them are of the undistinguished sort that serve as space-fillers in the better sporting magazines .

		Some of the dog - gerel , if it is clever doggerel , which the compil - ers so conscientiously excluded might have added a pleasing variety .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's introduction is of the sort that is written by request , and his one original generalization , that `` With Kipling 's ` Feet of the
Young Men	ORGANIZATION	' as a sort of dividing line , later -LSB- out-of-door -RSB- verse takes an entirely new attitude and you don your khaki , '' might be questioned .

		PLAYS FOR A NEGRO THEATRE .

		Granny
Maumee	LOCATION	; The Rider of Dreams ; Simon the Cyrenian .

		By
Ridgely Torrence	PERSON	.

		Mac - millan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Most of the people who interest themselves in the cause of the black man spend their time try - ing to prove him less black than he is painted .

		The metaphysics of
William Blake	PERSON	's little black boy , `` But , Oh !

		my soul is white , '' is accepted -LRB- though no one really believes in it -RRB- as an apology for all negrodom , when the sensible , and one would think the obvious , way of securing justice for the dark-skinned races would be to prove that black souls have a value , intrinsic and discrete , that makes them worth considering on their own merits .

		By establishing in
New York	LOCATION	a theatre in which plays of negro life are presented by negroes ,
Ridgely Torrence	PERSON	may be earning for himself the laurels of a second emancipator ; for it is quite conceivable that such a theatre may do as much toward making
America	LOCATION	understand the negro soul as the Irish Literary Movement especially the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	has done toward acquainting a portion at least of the English - speaking world with the soul of
Cathleen ni Houlihan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , the three plays that Mr.
Tor	PERSON	- rence has just published are strangely reminis - cent of the Irish plays .

		They have all the faults of the latter , they are perhaps even a shade more loose and amateurish , but they have about them the gracious honesty of a primitive people , a refreshing contrast to sophistication 's steelier , more intellectual truth .

		The negro theatre is a folk theatre and its plays are folk plays .

		They are chronicles of a 530 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	simple , childlike people , full of naive , super - stitious religion and rude poetry and still within sound of the savage tom-tom .

		The least effec - tive of the three plays in Mr.
Torrence	PERSON	's volume is `` Simon the Cyrenian , '' a symbolic play of the time of Christ , built upon the legend that the bearer of the cross was a negro .

		The most effec - tive is `` The Rider of Dreams , '' the story of a charming , `` no ` count nigger . ''

		Miscegenation , lynching , the exploitation of the negro by the white all these appear in the plays , not as prop - aganda , but rather as facts of life , unalterable and merciless as birth and death .

		Mr.
Torrence	PERSON	does not plead for the black man and he does not apologize for him .

		He simply presents him , one feels truly , as he is .

		`` All I wants is room to dream my good dreams an ' make my own music . ''

		So says Mr.
Torrence	PERSON	's playboy , the incorrigible rider of dreams .

		That is , of course , what most of us want and few of us get .

		The world crowds in , even upon the white but it tramples the negro , whose dreams it does not even vaguely understand .

		Is it too soon to hope that the negro theatre may act as an interpreter ?


ILLINOIS	LOCATION	.

		By
Allan Nevins	PERSON	.

		Oxford Uni - versity Press ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The series to which this book belongs shows it to be , not a history of the
Prairie State	ORGANIZATION	, but a record of the rise and progress of the youngest of the state universities of the old
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is appropriate that this first his - tory of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	should make its appearance in the semi-centennial year of that institution , though the fact that the book thus cel - ebrates the completion of a memorable half-cen - tury in
Illinois	LOCATION	educational progress is , strangely enough , not even referred to in the preface , nor does it appear to receive any emphasis elsewhere in the volume .

		This omission , however , may be due to the author 's modesty , and certainly is not to be included among those `` shortcomings '' for which he asks indulgence , briefly indicating the difficulties of his task a task executed nearly a thousand miles from the scene with which it is concerned and generously acknowledging the assistance received from many sources far less remote , geographically .

		A rough division of the university 's history might have been made , into two equal periods of a quarter-century each , the first marked by slow and painful progress , the latter with a splendid record of increasingly rapid advance .

		But the book does present very forcibly the contrast between earlier unsuccess and later achievement at least in a material sense .

		Perhaps a little more credit might justly have been accorded to those who won the less spec - tacular victories of the difficult first years , those who fought for ideals more than for legislative appropriations and new buildings .

		Dr.
Peabody	PERSON	, the university 's second head -LRB- Regent he was then called -RRB- thus deserves high praise , and in part receives it ; but there seems to be a contradiction in terms in the statement that `` he cared little for expansion but much for perfection , little for numbers but much for size and efficiency . ''

		In describing
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	's successor , President
Draper	PERSON	, the author says that on assuming office he won the students ' regard by expressing the hope `` to become personally acquainted with them all a promise he made good . ''

		But the university had more than eight hundred students in
Draper	PERSON	's first year , and not even the most zealous seeker of popularity could have accomplished the task indicated , in addition to engrossing administra - tive duties .

		Indeed , a faculty member of that time distinctly recalls Dr.
Draper	PERSON	's expression of regret at his inability to acquaint himself with all the members of the corps of instruction about one-tenth the size of the student body .

		The book , pleasingly written , has also the more substantial merits of careful historical detail and a comprehensive grasp of its subject .

		It is a needed and useful contribution to our educational history .

		A more liberal inclusion of portraits among its well-chosen illustrations would have been welcome ; such men as
Peabody	LOCATION	,
Burrell	PERSON	,
Forbes	LOCATION	,
Ricker	PERSON	,
Shattuck	PERSON	,
Snyder	PERSON	, and at least half a dozen more , it would have been pleasant to find looking out at us from the pages of this chronicle .

		WOMAN AS DECORATION .

		By
Emily Bur	PERSON	- bank .

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The tendency of the feminist movement has been , intentionally or unintentionally , to nullify woman 's objective value , which , after all , in a world of dun-colored males , is not to be despised .

		It is very easy to understand why those with the cause of woman at heart should deprecate the commercialization of her beauty , but not so easy to comprehend why they should fail to see the advantage of utilizing that beauty to emphasize her individuality , should fail to realize that the objective value of a human being is an asset which , understood and rightly used , may become a spiritual force all the more potent for being purely objective .

		One can well conceive such books as `` Woman as Decoration '' being used as propaganda .

		It is frankly nothing more than an outline of the principles underlying the ef - fective costuming of woman , with illustrations drawn from the `` modes '' of all countries and all times .

		It expounds no philosophy of clothes it is technical rather than philosophic and it has no claim to being regarded as `` literature '' ; and yet one feels that it should be recommended .

		It teaches the art of using an old weapon in a new cause .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 531 NOTES osr NEW FICTIOX `` The Human Tragedy '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- , a trans - lation of one of the less-known works of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, will probably be welcomed chiefly for the excellent English into which it has been ren - dered by
Alfred Allinson	PERSON	and for the interesting full-color illustrations by the Russian artist
Michel Sevier	PERSON	, whose style suggests
Bakst	PERSON	and the
Moscow	LOCATION	Art Theatre .

		But lovers of
Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	will find in this comparatively neglected story , taken from `` Le Puits de Sainte -
Claire	PERSON	, '' an authentic utterance of the subtle Frenchman .

		Fra
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	, a naive follower of St.
Francis	PERSON	, has embraced poverty and humility and despised his soul .

		But through the visits of the Prince of Men the curse of thought comes upon him and thereafter life gradually assumes a different aspect .

		He learns desire and specu - lation , the splendor and the cruelty of things created ; he suffers but he also loves the adver - sary through whom suffering has come .

		Thus the undoing of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	becomes a parable of the universal human tragedy of thought .

		In reading this tale one inevitably recalls the author 's saying that Pity and Irony should be given to life for its witnesses and judges .

		`` The Innocents , '' by
Sinclair Lewis	PERSON	-LRB- Harper ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , is nothing to lose one 's critical temper over .

		It will be hailed in hundreds of American homes as a `` sweet little story '' ; and perhaps it should be dismissed as such with a brief and friendly notice .

		But , somehow , all of it , even Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	's disarming preface , which points out that the tale is one `` for people who still read
Dickens	PERSON	and clip out
spring	DATE	poetry and love old people and children , '' thus absolving the author of all pretensions to writing for a critical audience , is irritating .

		One does n't want Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	to write sweet little stories for sentimental ladies to laugh and weep over .

		One remembers `` The Trail of the Hawk '' and `` The Job '' neither of them a really big book , but both of them warmed by a rich , passionate interest in life and made digni - fied by a sincere searching after truth .

		They held out a promise .

		Some day , one felt , Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	would outgrow his crudities and produce for us an American novel to which we might point with pride .

		Now comes `` The Innocents '' to break the promise .

		`` The Innocents '' carries with it the fear that Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	has `` arrived , '' but by that easiest way which entices so many of our young Ameri - can writers .

		A painted style , as our magazines bear witness , is popular with the crowd .

		Senti - mentality is easier than truth and pays better .

		It takes a chaste soul the soul of an artist to recognize and reject what cheapens and degrades ; and Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	, one fears , does not even realize where the primrose path is leading him .

		If he did , he might not have had the courage to dedicate `` The Innocents '' to that `` splendid assembly of young British writers '' which includes
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	,
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	,
Oliver Onions	PERSON	,
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	,
J. D. Beres	PERSON	- ford ,
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	,
Patrick MacGill	PERSON	, and , looming above them all ,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		Any one of them has intellectual sophistication enough to reject the facile smartness of phrase , the essen - tial flimsiness , of Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	's latest book , which presents a spectacle made all the sadder by the traces of a better self revealed in it .

		Among the well-remembered dislikes of one 's childhood is the story of the little boy whose mother gave him loaf sugar with a few drops of rum on it to cure a cough .

		The little wretch soon learned to cough for the sugar , and , after that first step downward , descended to the gut - ter , where he died a drunkard 's death amid his mother 's vain self-accusations .

		One was familiar with tales of the same type invented , on emer - gency , by one 's elders to illustrate what hap - pened to children who did n't `` mind '' ; so that one could not be intrigued into accepting the loaf-sugar tragedy just because it was in a book with pictures .

		It is no longer considered good pedagogy to feed children on tracts , but tracts for adults , disguised under the more sophisticated title `` fact stories , '' have been popularized long since by the ``
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post . ''

		They produce the same irritation that the story of the little boy and the rum produced .

		One believes in neither the story nor the moral .

		Zona Gale 's latest novel , `` A Daughter of the Morning , '' presents the whole woman question under a thin sugar-coating of plot .

		The barren - ness of the country woman 's life ; the wrongs inflicted upon woman in industry and the neces - sity for organization as a means of righting them ; the relation of woman 's work and marriage all these problems and more are faced and solved by a heroine with the suggestive name of
Cosma	LOCATION	, whose story , for fortuitousness , sentimentality , and slimness of characterization would put Hora - tio Alger to blush .

		As propaganda , the book is unconvincing ; and it is impossible to avoid the issue , as the publisher does on the cover - jacket , by laying the emphasis on what the `` right man '' means in the life of a girl ; for as a story , too , the book is unconvincing .

		`` A Daughter of the Morning '' must be set down as a `` fact story , '' good enough for those that like their sociology , as well as their advertising , in tract form , but not to be considered from the view - point of fiction .

		532 THE DIAL -LSB-
November 22	DATE	`` The Unknown Isle , '' by
Pierre de Coulevain	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- , is a reprint but none the less welcome for that .

		The isle is
England	LOCATION	unknown , temperamentally speaking , to the French .

		With a loose plot for a skeleton , the author displays the English in all their activities , displays and contrasts them with her countrymen .

		She is delightfully human and enough of a cos - mopolitan to set down the idiosyncrasies of both races with insight and humor .

		Of course , the need for racial exposition is not so great since the mingling of the armies of both countries on the battle field .

		What renders the book worthy of perusal , then , is not the perspicacity of its author 's views , but the disclosure of her unapproachable savoir-vivre .


Algernon Blackwood	PERSON	delights in making the line between man and animal or between man and some mystic spirit so thin that sometimes it vanishes entirely .

		Thus in `` Day and
Night Sto	ORGANIZATION	- ries '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- the first story shows us a man who is obsessed with the idea of flying , who is hawklike in look and action , who makes various attempts to fly and at last really seems to do so .

		For the unusual happenings in the stories of many writers there is a natural expla - nation , but for such events in Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	's tales there is ever only a supernatural , mystical reason .

		It is a note that few have the courage or the knowledge to strike , but it accounts in some measure for the attractiveness of his writing .

		Apart from the freshness of his theme , however , Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	is undeniably a master of style one not only rich and wonderful in itself , but also admirably adapted to his bizarre stories .

		`` The Quest of Ledgar Dunstan , '' by
Alfred Tresidder Sheppard	PERSON	-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is not what one would anticipate after reading `` The Rise of Ledgar Dunstan . ''

		The main theme of both books is
Antichrist	LOCATION	, who , it is affirmed , will be a slacker in the most vital duties of life .

		In the first book
Dunstan	ORGANIZATION	's interest in the subject is aroused and his progress in moral appreciations interestingly told .

		In the second book the author succeeds only in achieving prolixity .

		Here Dun - stan meets a character who introduces himself as
Antichrist	LOCATION	.

		Antichrist has , to use Mr.
Shep	PERSON	- pard 's figure of speech , used up all his `` peau de chagrin '' that is , lost his soul .

		According to the author , the soul is a finite , instead of an infi - nite quantity , and can really be lost bit by bit .

		Dunstan makes Antichrist finally recognize that there is an all-powerful God , but his religious theory is curiously garbled , for this recognition does not spell redemption as it does in so many modern creeds .

		Dunstan himself experiences an emotional conversion and marries the right woman ; then , apparently , his soul is saved for good and all .

		CASUAL , COMMENT THE ENGLISH REVIEWS HAVE BEEN KEPT in a flutter of late by the approaching publication of an alleged new play by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Realities '' was first described as a sort of continuation of `` Ghosts , '' but it now appears that this was a mistake , and that the unknown play was really written earlier .

		Mr.
Austin Fryers	PERSON	, whose identity seems to be rather cloudy , is in pos - session of the manuscript and has contemplated a stage production ; he explains that the play was given by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	to the late Mr.
Brokstaed	PERSON	, who was an intimate friend of the Norwegian playwright and often visited him .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's `` authorized '' English publisher , recently gave to the `` Times '' a postcard from
Sigurd Ibsen	PERSON	, denying that his father ever wrote such a play , together with copies of the correspondence in which he in - vited Mr.
Fryers	PERSON	to deliver for inspection the original manuscript .

		He appears to have been quite willing to publish the play if its authentic - ity could be established .

		Such is the present status of a most interesting literary mystery , which should not long remain mysterious if critical pretensions are not simply an empty flourish .

		In the meantime , the case has other aspects that are enlivening .

		Some of the re - viewers do not conceal their animus against the `` be whiskered little man '' of the North , whose influence was `` waning '' ; the impending publica - tion is frankly viewed as a threat rather than a promise .

		The mischief is the play may actually be genuine !

		Clearly the breed of emotional gentlemen who upheld the arms of
Clement Scott	PERSON	when he was vindicating the claims of virtue and decorum in terms that were , by the very necessity of the case , themselves indecorous , is not yet extinct .

		* FOREIGN MAILING PRIVILEGES have been re - stored to the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation , '' and the number now at hand only emphasizes the futility of the official ban .

		Nothing whatever has been gained by it .

		The `` Nation '' has made no concessions .

		It has neither altered its policy nor softened its speech .

		It takes the opportunity now offered to resume its advocacy abroad of a negotiated peace which will be genuinely constructive .

		That was really , in the opinion of the editors , the whole of its offending .

		There is nothing in the external situation to render such preaching less of an enormity now than it was six months ago ; yet the military censor has yielded , apparently with - out seeking to explain his changed position .

		From the point of view of policy the restoration of the `` Nation '' was required .

		Its disinterested criticism of Junkerism at home , as well as in
Germany	LOCATION	, can only make friends abroad for the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 533 British Empire .

		As a champion of fair play and an advocate of a rationally conceived interna - tional order , its influence is needed here .

		Its sup - pression was an act of superlative folly , especially since it happened to coincide roughly with the appearance of Lord Northcliffe among us .

		Was it really the official view that he would be a more acceptable representative of British opinion and purpose ?

		WE HOPE THAT IN MAKING CHRISTMAS SE - LECTIONS for their friends book-buyers will not forget the thousands of young men in the trenches abroad and those who fill our canton - ments at home .

		Boredom , we are told , is the re - lentless foe of the soldier , and it is driving many who as civilians had no fondness for reading to form reading habits .

		Librarians throughout the country have done their best to meet the new demands upon their resources , but they still need help .

		Something of what has already been ac - complished at
Camp Sherman	LOCATION	is revealed in a long report prepared by
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	, head of the library at
Chillicothe	LOCATION	, O. , who issues an urgent appeal for books and magazines , assur - ing us that no gifts that can be sent to the men are more needed .

		It is hardly necessary to add that the greatest variety of tastes will have to be satisfied and that it would be a mistake to select fiction alone .

		IN HIS SUGGESTIVE PAPER `` An Apology for Crudity , '' published in the last number of THE DIAL ,
Sherwood Anderson	PERSON	asks why it is that a man like Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	can not write in the spirit of the early Americans .

		Why ca n't he see the fun in life ?

		`` In the work of
Mark Twain	PERSON	there was something wholesome and sweet .

		Why can not the modern man also be wholesome and sweet ? ''

		His answer is , of course , that the work of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	is wholesome , because it is true to the life about him , and truth is always whole - some .

		But why the changed temper ?

		What does it signify ?

		Our humorists have been the most characteristic of our interpreters ; they love cant no more than Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	; and they have been even more pungent in dealing with hypocrisy and smugness .

		Yet they are never thought of as unwholesome or `` dangerous '' ; and they are quite the most popular of our writers .

		Why ?

		Because almost without exception they have been popular-minded ; neither more nor less philosoph - ical than the average man .

		They have not chal - lenged existing ideals or standards but only the amusing discrepancy between theory and prac - tice , and they have to that extent actually bols - tered up the ideals .

		As Mr.
Santayana	PERSON	puts it in `` The Genteel Tradition in American Philos - ophy , '' our humorists have got their effects pre - cisely by accepting the genteel tradition with the head after its hold on the heart had been re - laxed .

		`` So when
Mark Twain	PERSON	says , ' I was born of poor but dishonest parents , ' the humor depends on the parody of the genteel
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	convention that it is disreputable to be poor ; but to hint at the hollowness of it would not be amusing if it did not remain at bottom one 's habitual conviction . ''

		But with Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	that habitual conviction has been hope - lessly undermined , and the whole problem be - comes so complicated and disturbing as to call for something more challenging and subversive than humor .

		ALTOGETHER PLEASING TO THE EYE , though a little unwieldy to handle , is the second number of `` Form , '' the new English quarterly , which has just reached our desk .

		A journal devoted to art as well as to literature , `` Form '' has to accommodate itself to the reproduction of wood - cuts and lithographs that will not stand reduc - tion ; hence its formidable proportions .

		The verse in the present number is contributed by
W. H. Davies	PERSON	,
John Freeman	PERSON	,
Francis Burrows	PERSON	,
J. C. Squire	PERSON	,
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	, and
T. Sturge Moore	PERSON	.

		Imaginative prose is represented by happy selections from
L. Pearsall Smith	PERSON	's `` Trivia , '' which can now be had in book form in this country .

		Among the artists who con - tribute drawings and woodcuts are
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	,
A. O. Spare	PERSON	, and
T. Sturge Moore	PERSON	.

		THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES , one hears , are preparing to join the French in making them - selves attractive to American students after the war .

		In a worthy effort to divert the stream that used to flow to the German universities ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	are making changes in the curricula .

		Oxford , indeed , has even gone so far as to consider bestowing the Ph.D. de - gree a concession to American prepossessions of arresting magnitude .

		In some ways , however , it is regrettable that anything should be done to sanction the superstitious veneration in which those magic letters are currently held .

		As long as they are thought of as the sine qua non of academic advancement , it is hard to see how we can escape from the ineptitude and the extrava - gant silliness of the average doctor 's thesis in , say , English literature .

		Still , it is encouraging to remember that the English have always been among the keenest critics of such folly , and it is extremely unlikely that they will be inclined to insult their own intelligence by giving the doc - torate for studies in the use of the semicolon in Georgian poetry .

		JOHN LANE COMPANY ,
NEW YORK	LOCATION	BitiKKEii MKNTION The economic evolution of the last century pro- duced the law of employer 's liability as a develop - ment of that of master and servant ; but gradually it became apparent that injustice was being done to the laboring classes .

		Beginning in
Germany	LOCATION	, and now in most of the civilized nations , attempts have been made to remedy defects by enactments gen - erally known as workmen 's compensation acts .

		The principles are not as yet definitely determined , nor is there general agreement as to form and method .

		With each advance we find corporations or combinations willing to assume for the em - ployer the liability involved , either as a profitable business or as a means of equalizing the obliga - tions of society .

		The restriction of age excludes from the scope of the book some of the most picturesque campuses in the country , but the choice made by the author can hardly be ob - jected to .

		Cornell is the most westerly of the institutions visited , as it is the youngest of those that admit men .

		No women 's colleges are as yet quite venerable , but it seems natural enough that
Vassar	LOCATION	,
Smith	PERSON	, and
Wellesley	LOCATION	should take their places with
Harvard , Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and
Princeton	LOCATION	.

		The descriptions of buildings and of elms grow a trifle monotonous , if one reads the book in course , and will doubtless be the most enjoyable to the students and alumni of the institutions portrayed .

		There is more variety in the historical anecdotes of the different colleges , and in the glimpses of local college customs and traditions .

		Sixteen plates after drawings by
John Albert Seaford	PERSON	add much to the value of the volume , which may be described as just the sort of thing one would like to give to some alumnus or appreciative undergraduate of one of the institutions described .

		Prophetic emphasis was laid most largely , he thinks , on religion , but on religion in connection with the establishment of good order and harmony in human relations .

		The demonstration is made by a collation of source material and its general - ization into a `` social program , '' in simple , clear language , but with a too pedagogical dryness of manner .

		Mr.
Francis B. Reeves	PERSON	was the commissioner of the

Russia	LOCATION	Then and Now '' -LRB- Putnam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is a naive account of this mission .

		Except for purely superficial descrip - tions of the conditions of the peasants during those hard times , this account is almost wholly con - cerned with official receptions , attentions from titled Russians , and honorary memberships in clubs and uplift societies .

		These revelations of the author 's personality are supplemented by quotations from the commercial booklets of
R. Martens & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the
National City Bank	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Guaranty Trust Co.	ORGANIZATION	, from the `` National Geographic Magazine , '' the `` Continent , '' and the ``

NEW YORK	LOCATION	a matter of course , for a dissertation on
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	; but Mr.
Turner	PERSON	's supreme mistress of the epistolary art turns out to be Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	, nor are any apologies offered to the French woman , though a complimentary ref - erence to her in one of the other 's letters is quoted .

		The assertion in regard to
Byron	PERSON	's family affairs that `` no such interest has been manifested in the domestic infelicities of any man save Nelson '' leaves us wondering where
Thomas	PERSON	and
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	come in with respect to this prying curi - osity on the part of the great public Such chap - ters as `` A Plea for the Minor Poet , '' `` The Poetry of New Lands , '' and `` The Importance of the Right Word '' illustrate Mr.
Turner	PERSON	's fondness for thought and expression that lie off the main high - ways of literature .

		Something more than family genealogy and fam - ily history has found its way into the spacious volume written by Mr.
Arthur Robert Ingpen	PERSON	on `` An Ancient Family '' -LRB- Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- his own family of Ingpen .

		In tracing the
Saxon	PERSON	origin of the Ingpens he has been enticed into an inviting domain of history , that dealing with early social and economic conditions in
England	LOCATION	.

		He found himself inquiring , concerning his forefathers , `` how they were housed , clothed and fed ; what their daily occupations ; what their amusements ; what their vicissitudes in time of pestilence , civil war and dis - order ; and what became of the younger members of the family at a time when the profits from land were practically the sole sources of wealth , '' and so on in matters of curious detail not usually found in books of this kind .

		The work was evidently entered upon as a pastime , and not merely in the spirit of the professional genealogist .

		Hence its more warmly human appeal than that of the usual book of its class , though the appended wills and deeds and pedigrees have enough of dryness to suit the most severely exacting .

		Genealogists have a feast spread for them by Mr.
Hamon	PERSON	Le Strange in his substantial quarto devoted to `` Le Strange Records '' from

		It is `` a chronicle of the early Le

		As sources of information the rolls and charters in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	and the British Museum have been searched , and `` considerable use has been made of the family muniments pre - served at Hunstanton Hall . ''

		Nothing has been admitted to the book without rigorous proof of its historic accuracy , and thus the mixture of fact and fable not uncommon in family histories has been , as far as possible , avoided .

		Facsimile pages from many ancient documents are interspersed , giv - ing plenty of occupation to those who like to de - cipher the crabbed handwriting of the period .

		A full index of persons , one of places , and one of subjects close the book .

		`` We must begin at the very bottom , '' he declares , `` dealing with the solid earth and all its manifestations , and , step by step , pass upward , following all the demands of thought as well as the demands of our own nature . ''

		For `` thus and thus only , '' he continues , `` can we pass beyond the boundaries of sense to a transcendent world of thought and goodness and holiness . ''

		This might seem to be a bold attempt to bridge the impassable gap between matter and mind , but the whole argument , carefully followed , leaves no doubt of the author 's recognition of the difference in kind between the two , however baffling he may find their close interaction .

		Leading writers are freely quoted , and thus is fulfilled the purpose of the book , which is , in addition to that already indicated , `` to present some of the main problems of science , philosophy , and religion as these are dealt with by a number of the most prominent writers of our day . ''

		The Master of Balliol con - tributes a short commendatory foreword .

		`` The Human Side of Trees '' has been set forth with much literary art and no little imagination by Mr.
Royal Dixon	PERSON	and Mr.
Franklyn E. Fitch	PERSON	.

		We are asked to believe that `` trees possess certain mental and moral characteristics and the attributes of reason , memory , hope , language , love , and all forms of righteous ambition . ''

		Further , `` if man has a soul , so have trees , '' the authors dare to assert .

		To their sympathetic perception trees `` are beings which in a minor degree have all human pleasures and understandings , and ... in the future life they will very likely be compensated for their struggles and difficulties here in this world . ''

		After this it will surprise no one to find the succeeding chapters dealing with `` Trees That Build Cities , '' `` Trees with a Personality , '' `` Trees with a
College Education	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` Trees That Keep a Diary , '' `` Trees That Travel , '' `` Musical Trees , '' and even `` Religious Trees . ''

		A final word on `` Trees and Civilization '' closes the book .

		It contains much curious information , scientific and historic , and some that is neither , in a strict sense , but is none the less readable .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		I was glad to read in THE DIAL of
October 25	DATE	Mr. Street 's objection to Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	's recent review of
Alan Seeger	PERSON	.

		I was glad because the disagree - ment between Mr. Street and Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	raises an issue of considerable literary interest and one which fails consistently to receive the attention it should .

		Literary legends develop with all the rapidity and subtlety of scandal , and to treat them as holy is to invite the risk of becoming the dupe of sentimentalism .

		It was Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	's hardihood in looking a developing legend in the eye , which caused me to recognize in his review an unusual A Dividend in War Time for DIAL Subscribers When I purchased THE DIAL eighteen months ago , I believed there was in
America	LOCATION	a public which would support a progressive , independent journal of criticism .

		That assumption has been justified not only by the response of subscribers , but also by the splendid cooperation of the lead - ing thinkers and writers .

		The following letter from Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	is but one of many inspired by the new editorial policy of THB DIAL : `` Not only the
Middle West	LOCATION	but the country is to be congratulated on the development which is going on in THE DIAL .

		/ / is rapidly becoming a national influence , a journal to be reckoned with by those who think , especially because of its combination of honest informed book reviews with humane and pro- gressive social policies , and , not least , good ` writing , hard hitting , tolerant , straightforward writing proceeding from an imaginative vision '' Now that THE DIAL is established editorially , the next step in its career is the securing of a wider reading public .

		It would be comparatively easy to secure increased circulation by means of advertising , but I prefer to spend that money in further improving THE DIAL .

		Consequently I am ask - ing the cooperation of our readers in doubling our circulation before
January 1st	DATE	.

		Attached to this letter is a scheme whereby each DIAL sub - scriber may benefit not only THE DIAL but him - self in this cooperation .

		God knows 't is needed in these trying times .

		Mr. Street , however , finds that the reviewer `` failed utterly to catch the real value of the pub - lication . ''

		He intimates , moreover , that Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	misleads the readers of THE DIAL by taking unfair advantage of the reviewer 's privilege of quotation .

		These are not light accusations .

		As one who takes THE DIAL seriously , I felt im - pelled to satisfy myself regarding the reliability of the reviewer in question .

		Mr.
Kinnc	PERSON	's review emphasizes three points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the bulk of
Seeger	PERSON	's letters and diary is com - monplace ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that
Alan Seeger	PERSON	was narrow - minded in his attitude toward other points of view than his own ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- that , in spite of all this , there were `` purple patches '' of wisdom in the book .

		Mr.
Street	PERSON	's letter is not an examination of these points , but a declaration of his own convictions .

		With one exception he talks about matters the reviewer does not touch upon , and which in the light of the reviewer 's criticism are irrelevant .

		The one exception is found in the third paragraph of the letter : `` I do not agree with the reviewer , '' says Mr.
Street	PERSON	, `` that
Alan Seeger	PERSON	meant that we are all ` cowards , hypocrites and fools ' because we can not fight and must do our bit in ` second - best things . ' ''

		He did n't mean it !

		Oh , yes , he meant it .

		He not only said it in so many words in a poem which he knew would be published , he reiterated it in his prose .

		As I read the letters , that is
Alan Seeger	PERSON	.

		And I believe he would be proud to defend his position , were he alive .

		The intimation that Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	has quoted unfairly which is Mr.
Street	PERSON	's evidence for his contention is untrue to fact and can only find support in biased or careless interpretation .

		As I see it , the difference between Mr. Street and Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	is ultimate .

		They might argue with one another till the cows come home but they 'd go to bed without a change of sides .

		For the difference is the difference between a senti - mental and an intellectual type of mind .

		I can - not understand why the fact that
Alan Seeger	PERSON	was kind to his mother should influence Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	in attempting to arrive at a critical estimate of the poet 's literary contribution or philosophical outlook .

		Neither do I understand why , now that the poet `` has met the death of his dreams , now that he has disappeared at the pinnacle of his cherished career , '' the literary critic can not believe and should not remember the words of
Victor Chapman	PERSON	, quoted by Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	, that
Alan Seeger	PERSON	was `` an appalling wreck before the war . ''

		Such trying to forget and refusing to believe are the very essence of sentimentalism .

		Referring to the review I find that Mr.
Kinne	PERSON	deliberately refrains from putting a specific construction upon
Victor Chapman	PERSON	's words , but this evident endeavor to be fair , as well as the genuine appreciations expressed in the re - view , Mr. Street overlooked in spite of rereadings .

New York	LOCATION	The best way to give an idea of
McLandburgh Wilson	ORGANIZATION	's poems of
America	LOCATION	at war -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- is to present one of them for inspection and here it is : MOVING TIME Your Uncle
Sam	PERSON	is busy now , for moving time has come , He packs his good old uniform , his sabre and his drum ; He packs the family portraits that have hung upon the wall ,
George Washington	PERSON	and Lincoln , and his heroes , one and all .

		Quite certain rays of Liberty are needed every - where , He also packs his precious lamp with most uncom - mon care , And last he takes the family bird , the pet with eagle scream , And piles them all into the van and wallops up the team !

		Where is his new abiding place ?

		where will his home be made ?

		He goes into the biggest house in which he ever stayed , For when beside his Allies ' flags his standard is unfurled , He moves from out a continent and moves into a world .

		The prize of
$ 500	MONEY	offered by the Southern So - ciety of
New York	LOCATION	for the best literary work published in
1916	DATE	by a southern writer has been awarded to
Olive Tilford Dargan	PERSON	for her volume of sonnets `` The Cycle 's Rim . ''

		The judges in the contest , which was open to natives of sixteen states and to works of either prose or poetry , were
Talcott Williams	PERSON	, dean of the School of Journal - ism at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	;
Virginia Gildersleeve	LOCATION	, dean of
Barnard College	ORGANIZATION	; and
John H. Finley	PERSON	, state com - missioner of education in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Dar	PERSON	- gan was born in
Grayson County	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and went to the public schools in which her father and mother were continuously teachers , until she was ten years old .

		Then with her parents she went to the town of
Doniphan	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	, where she stayed for four years .

		At the age of fourteen she herself became a teacher in the backwoods of Ar - kansas , a region of hills and streams .

		Through these years she had always hoped for a college education , but when she became eighteen her mother died ; her father , now an invalid , returned to
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and her chance seemed lost .

		She was determined , however , and finally obtained a
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	scholarship , which took her to the Uni - versity of
Nashville	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		After further teaching and a year at Radcliffc in
1894	DATE	, study - ing English and philosophy , she worked as a stenographer in
Boston	LOCATION	and then married a young
South Carolinian	LOCATION	, a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	student whom she had met while at
Radcliffe	LOCATION	.

		She has since lived in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Her work includes three volumes of poetical dramas : `` The Mortal Gods and Other Dramas , '' `` Lords and Lovers and Other Dramas , '' and `` Semiramis and Other Dramas '' ; `` The Path Flower and Other Verses '' ; and the cycle of son - nets that won her the prize .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 551 IF YOU REALLY INTEND TO SUBSCRIBE IN CASE IT PLEASES YOU , SEND FOR A FREE SPECIMEN COPY OF The Unpopular Review In the brief period of its existence -LSB- it -RSB- has taken rank as the leading publication of criticism and brilliant comment on current affairs on either side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		From the Editor of the Providence Journal .

		We may say for the benefit of our readers outside of
New England	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	that there the literary judgments of
The Providence Journal	ORGANIZATION	command as much respect as those of the leading metropolitan dailies .

		To carry a copy ... is almost equivalent to wearing a badge of intelligence .

		From a circular issued from the retail department of the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's bookstore .

		The freshness of its point of view is invigorating .

		The crying need of the weary old world is to get away from conventional viewpoints , conventional morality and conventional taste .

		-LSB- We stand up for most of the `` conventional morality and conventional taste . ''

		But many a `` point of view '' from which they have hitherto been mapped seems to us no longer tenable , and we often try to base our surveys upon new ones .

		Editor . -RCB-

		I have read it through from cover to cover since the issuance of the first number ... easily the ablest review of a general nature we have in this country .

		From a
Judge of a State Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		Far and away the most stimulating appeal to the intellectuals that has yet been made by our periodical literature .

		I can imagine but one possible hindrance to your abundant success your falling into the snare that has been the ruin of all previous claims upon the illuminati , viz. : the notion that only agnostics are intellectual .

		From a Clergyman .

		-LSB- No danger !

		The number of clergy among our contributors and subscribers forefends that , let alone our own fervent believe in the essentials of religion .

		Editor .

		1 The most virile and interesting magazine that I have ever seen .

		It had the look of a good half hour morsel before bed-time and it postponed bed - time by just over three hours .

		It is pleasing indeed to find ... so apparent a desire to declare the truth and of necessity be named `` unpopular . ''

		The most delightful magazine I have yet seen ... something else must go : for I must have The Unpopular .

		The copy that I received had the most intelligent treatment of the suffrage question I have ever seen ... I would like all my fool sisters to be so enlightened .

		The most virile and interesting magazine that I have ever seen .

		JfortntgfJtlp journal of Hiterarp Criticism ,
Bfecussion	LOCATION	, anb information .

		Poetry of
Stefan George Although	PERSON	the doctrine of art for art 's sake is commonly supposed to be peculiarly French in its origin and in its practical manifestations , it has received a surpris - ing amount of theoretical support from the German philosophers , at least one of whom ,
Schelling	PERSON	, was largely instrumental in spreading it abroad .

		But there has always been until recently a certain hesi - tation on the part of German writers to show themselves whole-souled votaries of the idea , as if its reputed frivolity were repugnant to the high seriousness of the Teutonic mind with its strong didactic ten - dencies .

		It has remained for the present generation in
Germany	LOCATION	to produce a group of writers who for drastic theory and con - sistency of practice may be fitly compared with
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	or Oscar Wilde .

		When in the early nineties a coterie of young poets began circulating privately their ``
Blatter	PERSON	fur die Kunst , '' they were at first ignored as sterile dilettantes , and later , when their very persistency chal - lenged attention , decried as charlatans and decadents .

		Gradually , however , the work of
Stefan George	PERSON	has won its way into critical esteem , since he first consented in
1899	DATE	to address a wider public .

		It is true that his appeal has been limited , for he has deliberately restricted his audience by all manner of devices , even seeking to frighten off the casual or careless reader by the omission of capital letters and the arbitrary misuse of punctuation .

		This may seem to some like an intolerable pose , adopted pour epater le bourgeois , but if consistency is any test of sincerity , then
George	PERSON	is indubitably sincere .

		In his desire to protest against the commerciali - zation and vulgarization of literature , he has never made the slightest concession to the curiosity or taste of a public whose suffrage he does not solicit .

		Yet fame of an attenuated sort has come to him in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Abroad one seeks almost in vain for any recognition of him , though a recent voice -LRB-
Ludwig Lewisohn	PERSON	in `` The Spirit of Modern German Literature '' -RRB- has indeed proclaimed him to be at present `` the first lyrical poet in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The constant coupling of his name with that of
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	has perhaps been un - fortunate .

		The Catholic
Rhinelander	PERSON	and the Viennese Jew hold many a critical theory in common , but while the latter has become little more than a talented echo ,
George	PERSON	alone of all his group has shown genuine creative power and capacity for development .

		His output is not large .

		The fruit of twenty-five years of single - minded devotion to his art consists of six rather slender volumes , and it is significant that of these the last three contain his best work .

		The starting-point of these young innovators , who may be loosely called symbolists , was relentless opposition to naturalism .

		As a counterblast to the slogan of `` truth in art , ''
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	asserted truculently : `` Gedichte sind ge - wichtlose Gewebe aus Worten . ''

		George , with somewhat less the air of paradox , has proclaimed his ideal to be `` eine
Kunst	PERSON	frei von jedem
Dienst	PERSON	, eine
Kunst	PERSON	aus der Anschauungsfreude , aus
Rausch	PERSON	und Klang und
Sonne	PERSON	. ''

		A poem , in his opinion , should evoke and suggest , should hint a situation or delicately convey a mood , but should shun facts and logic and lessons on pain of foregoing its very nature .

		Above all he has aimed steadily at the creation of a new poetic style whose key - note is to be distinction .

		His characteristic mood is Olympian .

		He wants to be aus - tere and aloof , draping himself in his dignity as if he were a high priest .

		He refuses to sentimentalize , to coruscate , to write `` with a punch , '' or to make any other sort of meretricious appeal .

		Un - fortunately his inability to unbend or to take himself and his poetic mission lightly betrays a lack of humor which the reader may find grievous to bear .

		It is instructive to study
George	PERSON	's be - ginnings in the light of his subsequent 568 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	accomplishments .

		He has collected the early poems which he deems worthy of preservation in a volume called `` Die Fibel . ''

		These verses are competent but relatively undistinguished .

		The tone is adolescently melancholy ; love and death are the favorite themes , handled some - what in the traditional romantic fashion .

		Their most interesting feature is an occa - sional touch of decadence , which was to appear as sensational anti-moralism in the sequence of poems entitled `` Algabal . ''

		The hero of the latter is the notorious Roman emperor , Heliogabalus , whose ex - ploits
Gibbon	PERSON	has recorded with such unsparing detail .

		The lines which
George	PERSON	puts into the mouth of this imperial aesthete and pervert had a certain applica - tion to himself at that time :
Mein Garten	PERSON	bedarf nicht
Luft	PERSON	und nicht Warme ,
Der Garten	PERSON	, den ich mir selber gebaut , Und seiner
Vogel	PERSON	leblose Schwarme Haben noch nie einen Fruhling geschaut .

		In this connection it is significant of his literary affinities at that time , that he chose to translate
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Baudelaire	LOCATION	,
Verlaine	PERSON	, and
Mallarme	ORGANIZATION	.

		For - tunately this taint of unwholesomeness did not endure .

		Since `` Algabal '' he has pub - lished nothing that could incur the re - proach of perversity , and little that is even delicately depraved ; and when he resumed his work of translating a few years ago , it was put into German portions of the `` Divine Comedy . ''

		George 's poems are at the opposite pole from the simplicity , directness , and clear - cut situations of the folk song .

		His love lyrics deal not so much with individual episodes as with typical stages of experi - ence .

		It has even been surmised that friendship has played a greater part in his life than love ; but for this assumption there is no real warrant .

		What he seeks to do is not to transmit a feeling at white heat or to reproduce a situation still tremulous with life , but to pass his emo - tions through the alembic of reflection in order that the expression may be artistically purified . '

		Fiihlend iiber dem Gefiihle zu stehen '' is the way one of his critics has described his attitude ; and
George	PERSON	himself has asserted his ideal to be `` eine
Kunst	PERSON	iiber dem Leben , nachdem sie das Leben durchdrungen . ''

		To many readers his process of artistic clarification seems devitalizing .

		His poems appear cold , detached , impersonal .

		This objective mode of procedure has been made familiar by the Parnassian poets in
France	LOCATION	, but it falls distinctly out of the German tradition .

		Platen almost alone among German poets has been similarly reserved and restrained .

		Goethe , for all his aloofness , did at least lay bare his breast , and
Heine	PERSON	, with his reiterated `` lay of a broken heart , '' introduced into lyric poetry the note of aggressive self-revelation .

		But innate
Keuschheit der Seele	PERSON	prevents
George	PERSON	and his fellows from indulging in any such expansiveness : Wir werden nicht mehr starr und bleich Den fruheren Liebeshelden gleich , An Triibsal waren wir zu reich , Wir zucken leis und dulden weich .

		Sie hiessen tapfer , hiessen frei ,
Trotz	PERSON	ihrer
Lippen	PERSON	manchem
Schrei	LOCATION	; Wir litten lang und vielerlei , Doch schweigen miissen wir dabei .

		It is not surprising , therefore , that the public has been puzzled and frequently alienated , the more so since
George	PERSON	's con - densation of style and his studied avoid - ance of trite phrases tend to considerable obscurity .

		Still it would be a capital mis - take to suppose that behind the chiseled perfection of these verses there is no significant human experience .

		Occasionally a situation of tragic intensity is conveyed to the reader by subtle suggestion .

		It becomes almost an exercise in intuition to attempt to divine the circumstances which have given rise to the poem and to gauge the poignancy of the author 's feeling .

		George 's conception of love is neither wholly sacred nor wholly profane .

		It alternates curiously between the heathen Eros and the
Christian Caritas	ORGANIZATION	in a way which is characteristic of this incomplete pagan with his Catholic predilections .

		Perhaps the poet is aware that all his earthly amatory experiences are but fleet - ing symbols of an unrealizable love , a quest for what is forever beyond reach : Dcnn meine Liebe schlaft im Land der Strahlen .

		The case of his nature poems is simpler .

		There are no wild-woodland notes in his music .

		He sings by preference of tidy parks with neat paths , trimmed trees and benches beneath them , ponds with swans floating gracefully on their surfaces , glimpses of statuary in the boscage and

spring	DATE	is not accidental : there is little of the ver - nal impulse , the hope of quickening life , or the joy of youth , in this ripe and worldly wise poet .

		The following poem , much praised by his friend
Hofmannsthal	PERSON	, brings out the unsuspected beauties of a late autumn scene : Komm in den totgesagten Park und schau : Der
Schimmer	PERSON	ferner , lachelnder Gestade , Der reinen
Wolken unverhofftes Blau Erhellt	PERSON	die Weiher und die bunten Pfade .

		Dort nimm das tiefe
Gelb	PERSON	, das weiche
Grau	PERSON	,
Von Birken	PERSON	und von Buchs ; der Wind ist lau ; Die spaten
Rosen	PERSON	welkten noch nicht ganz ; Erlese , kiisse sie , und flicht den
Kranz	PERSON	.

		Vergiss auch diese letzten Astern nicht , Den Purpur um die
Ranken	PERSON	wilder Reben , Und auch was iibrig blieb von griinem
Leben	PERSON	,
Verwinde	PERSON	leicht im herbstlichen Gesicht .

		The unwonted simplicity and clearness of these lines are doubtless due to the fact that they are merely descriptive .

		In many other poems the sensuous impressions are secondary to the mood which they evoke , or rather it is the unity of man with the landscape which is brought out : Wir fiihlen dankbar wie zu leisem
Brausen Von Wipfeln Strahlenspuren	PERSON	auf uns tropfen , Und blicken nur und horchen wenn in Pausen Die reifen Fruchte auf den
Boden	PERSON	klopfen .

		There are occasional indications of an exotic longing , especially for the South , although
George	PERSON	does not exhibit to the full that
Italomania	LOCATION	which has character - ized so many German writers since the days of
Winckelmann	PERSON	.

		From a southern shore he writes : In dieser
Luft	PERSON	von Weihrauch und von
Rosen	PERSON	, Wo selbst der strenge Fiirst des Endes leicht , Als sei er nur der Spender von Almosen , Mit einem Lacheln durch die
Lande	PERSON	schleicht .

		George 's religiosity finds too constant expression in his works to be lightly dis - missed as the pantheistic prattle of the average minor poet .

		It is manifestly a vital part of his inner life , however diffi - cult it may be to find a formula for it .

		As a Rhinelander he is an heir of the oldest civilization in
Germany	LOCATION	with a deep back - ground of cultural tradition which would be rare in the more flatulent
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		As a Catholic he is mellow and wise with the garnered experience of
Mother Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		From certain poems in `` Der Teppich des Lebens '' one would think of him as sitting in his palace of art `` holding no form of creed , but contemplating all . ''

		Certain it is that his faith is not of the modern progressive sort ; yet it is by no means narrowly dogmatic .

		It is tolerant enough to include Pan and an occasional hint of Priapus , but it admits of no compromise with the gods of modern materialism .

		He has a proud consciousness of his spiritual vocation : Ich bin ein
Funke	PERSON	nur vom heiligen
Feuer	PERSON	, Ich bin ein Drohnen nur der heiligen Stimme .

		In one of his noblest poems , `` Litanei , '' he has given a moving expression of his soul 's search after God .

		The evident suggestions of Catholic ceremonial in these verses are echoed elsewhere , as in his description of the elevation of the host : So sinken wir als Glaubige zu
Grunde	ORGANIZATION	,
Verschmolzen	PERSON	mit der tausendkopfigen
Menge	PERSON	, Die schon wird wenn das
Wunder	PERSON	sie ergreift .

		More appealing to the generality of his readers is the expression of religious aspiration divorced from all confessional implications in the only lines from his poems which have become in any sense a familiar quotation : Nicht vor der eisigen
Firnen Drohendem Ratsel	ORGANIZATION	erschrick , Und zu den ernsten Gestirnen Hebe den suchenden Blick !

		In his so-called
Zeitgedichte George	PERSON	shows himself an uncompromising oppon - ent of the spirit of the present age with its materialistic greed , its craze for enjoy - ment , and its mental and moral distrac - tion .

		He has apparently no feeling for such virtues as the times may possess for example , the sharpening of the social conscience or our keener sense of spiritual genuineness .

		His little poem `` Hafenstadt und Mutterstadt '' is an apologue to show the futility of what men are pleased to call progress .

		The Mutterstadt , a spot of quiet beauty nestling in the hills , falls into decay , while the Hafenstadt , filled with the blatant ugliness of modern commer - cialism , flourishes apace .

		George 's scorn of the multitude , die Allzuvielen , is as sweeping as
Nietzsche 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pessimism in regard to contemporary conditions and 570 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	the aristocratic aloofness which are al - most inevitable concomitants of the doctrine of art for art 's sake are all - pervasive .

		He has succeeded in preserv - ing his detachment even in the present war and has resolutely refused to make his art serve the patriotic muse .

		But that his silence implies reprobation of Ger - many 's conduct , no man can say .

		He is merely au-dessus de la melee .

		It has seemed advisable to emphasize the content rather than the form or
Stefan George	PERSON	's poetry because of the persistent legend that he is obsessed by technique and is little better than a juggler of words .

		Formally , indeed , his verse is remarkable enough .

		It is doubtful whether any other German poet has equaled him in verbal skill or in the achievement of a harmony of sound that is at once so sumptuous and grave .

		His style is exceedingly compact , with an abundance of compound words and a frequent use of a genitive phrase in lieu of a whole clause .

		The numerous exple - tives with which layer German versifiers so often eke out their lines are rigidly eschewed by him .

		Metrically he is no great innovator , his favorite measure being a simple four-line stanza with mas - culine - ftid feminine rhymes alternating .

		His greatest virtuosity is shown in his use of rhymes , where he has revealed unsus - pected resources in the German language .

		`` Hat ein Kiinstler einmal zwei Worte miteinander gereimt , '' he has declared , `` so ist eigentlich das Spiel fur ihn ver - braucht , und er soil es nie oder selten wiederholen . ''

		That is , of course , a coun - sel of perfection which not even his dis - ciplined talent has been able to fulfil to the letter .

		But the combinations dear to the heart of the facile rhymester -LRB- for example , Herz-Schmerz , Brust-Lust , Liebe-Triebe -RRB- are totally absent from his writings .

		Alliteration and assonance are freely , almost lavishly , employed , though with more discrimination than
Swinburne	PERSON	was accustomed to show .

		One runs con - stantly across such lines as these : Ein Wind utnweht uns f ruhlingswcich ; Sengende Strahlen senken sich wieder ; Und
Luft	PERSON	und Land in lautrem
Golde	PERSON	schwammen .

		But
George	PERSON	is never content with mere sensuous appeal , as might be inferred from a superficial reading of his dictum that `` den wert der Dichtung entscheidet nicht der Sinn sondern die Form . ''

		Thought and expression are inseparably wedded in his ideal and in his practice .

		His service of beauty is not incompatible with ideas , convictions , or aspirations .

		Art for art 's sake , then , never degenerates into art for technique 's sake in the work of this austere poet whose lyrics are , nevertheless , per - haps the best example of that striving after perfection of form which is one of the most distinguishing marks of German literature during the
last quarter	DATE	of a century .

KILBORNE STEWART	PERSON	.

		The Structure of Lasting Peace III NATIONALITY AND THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF STATES The doctrine of sovereignty was a trans - fer of `` the divinity which hedgeth about a king '' from the king to the body-politic as such .

		It helped to protect states against the aggression of piratical dynasts , and peoples against the strengthening of their exploiters ' hands from without .

		Inter - fering in the internal affairs of a state is down in the books as the international crime : internal affairs , like the English - man 's home , were a government 's castle , from mediaeval times taboo against entry and search .

		None the less , instances of international entry and search count up heavily , sometimes with good excuse and benevolent motives , as in the case of the Hay note to
Rumania	LOCATION	or some aspects of the interference of the Powers in the Bal - kan embroilments ; mostly , however , on the pretence of guarding capital-investing `` nationals , '' or `` self-defence , or what not .

		They occur in states too weak to resist
China	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Morocco	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Serbia	LOCATION	.

		Not even
America	LOCATION	meddled with
Russia	LOCATION	's `` internal affairs , '' though there was better cause than even in the case of
Rumania	LOCATION	, and not even
Russia	LOCATION	with Aus - tria 's , though there was as good cause as in the case of
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		In point of fact , sovereignty undefended by force is empty politically , and where an economic relation exists between one state and another , a lie economically .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 571 Even with the maximum of political reality , sovereignty can not withstand the undermining effect of economic enterprise , particularly the enterprise of the modern industrial and commercial system .

		This system has automatically generated the economic interdependence of all mankind .

		Differences in basic natural resources give the inhabitants of some parts of the world natural monopoly of one or another raw material that can best be converted into a finished product in another part of the world .

		There exists in the economy of mankind a rough division of labor between the peoples of the earth , a division depend - ent on their resources and their abilities , but kept rudimentary , reduplicative , and wasteful because the community of interest which such a division implies is restricted by governmental policies of particularism , which are partly a survival in the medi - sevalism of the European dynastic systems , largely a traditional privilege of interest - and rent-receiving classes .

		The particu - larism of warfare has served only to exhibit more clearly how contrary it is to its own needs , how doubly dependent modern states are on each other at just those points where their independence is most vigorously flaunted .

		For example : Indispensable engines of war require rub - ber , sulphuric acid , nitrates , manganese .

		Rubber is to be had mostly from
Brazil	LOCATION	, the
East Indies	LOCATION	, the Straits Settlements ; sulphur , in commercial quantities , only in the
United States	LOCATION	, in
Japan	LOCATION	, in
Sicily	LOCATION	, and pyrites , from which it may be derived , largely in
Spain	LOCATION	; nitrates only in
Chile	LOCATION	; manganese only in
Russia	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and Bra - zil .

		The blockade which cuts
Germany	LOCATION	off from these things cuts her off from neces - saries of war , and from how many other necessaries , besides food , does it not cut her off !

		Her denial of international obli - gation can be made effective only through international obligation .

		Hence her de - mand for the `` freedom of the seas '' in wartime .

		Try as she will , she can not , in the nature of things , be a modern state and conduct a modern war , and be `` self-suffi - cient . ''

		Nor can any other state .

		This means that sea-rule is of paramount importance to all the states , for it is dominion of the trade-arteries , which are the life-arteries of the world , the greatest potentiality of victory in war and of aggrandizement in peace .

		This rule has been
England	LOCATION	's and it has been one of mag - nanimity and justice .

		But suppose that she had elected it should not be .

		Obviously , there is ground for con - sideration in the claim for `` freedom of the seas . ''

		The power and authority to police them ought not to rest in the interest or the whim of one state alone .

		Freedom of the seas is like freedom of the streets : it requires a traffic policeman and a sema - phore but the policeman must not be a law unto himself .

		Responsibility for the security of the international highways is international responsibility .

		Police power can assure guaranteed protection only when it is responsible to a democratically constituted international authority , under whose administration must come not only the ways upon the high seas , but terri - torially contiguous sea roads , like the Dar - danelles ,
Gibraltar	LOCATION	, the
Suez	ORGANIZATION	and the
Panama	LOCATION	canals , and the harbor outlets to these ways , like
Trieste	LOCATION	, for landlocked countries , like
Austria	LOCATION	and the , Balkan states -LRB- it must not be forgotten that the whole quarrel between
Serbia	LOCATION	and
Bulgaria	LOCATION	turned upon
Serbia	LOCATION	's demand of access to the sea -RRB- , and for ice-bound countries , like
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Restriction of access , discrimina - tion between states in the use of these ways , have defined interstate relationships and motivated policies of aggrandizement ending invariably in war .

		For access or control have meant exclusive sovereignty or sea power .

		Peace , of which the economic interdependence of nations is the backbone , can last only through the inter - national control of international highways and terminals which this interdependence implies .

		Freedom of the seas means this and nothing else .

		It means the divorce of sovereignty from sea power .

		Such a divorce would help little , how - ever , without the coordinate divorce of sovereignty from trade and industry .

		The liaison of these two maintains the tariff system and requires the flag to follow the dollar .

		In his `` New Freedom '' Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son has made a very clear statement of the evils worked by `` protection '' in this country : how it helps to arrest industrial progress , hinders invention , initiative , effi - ciency ; exploits workingmen and restrains 572 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	the right division of labor among the peoples of the world ; employs the profits won through the man power of this country for the exploitation of the resources and populations of other coun - tries .

		And what is true of republican
America	LOCATION	is far truer of dynastic
Germany	LOCATION	or
Austria	LOCATION	or
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The case for free trade need not be here recapitulated , nor the fallacies of protection .

		What is per - tinent is that protection makes for war .

		It seeks to create a monopoly of produc - tion or distribution which the modern economic system will not tolerate .

		With - out tariffs overproduction at home to undersell abroad , scrambling for exclusive possession of foreign markets so provoca - tive of competitive armament , the immoral division of `` backward '' countries into `` spheres of influence '' and `` protectorates '' all these , and the other devices of capi - talistic exploitation , would have had less chance to wreak the social and political evil they are guilty of .

		This evil rests , in principle , upon the use of the power and machinery of the commonwealth for the accumulation of private property by anti- social methods .

		Since the rise of modern industrial society capital has , to my knowl - edge , failed in one case only of exploitation of this rent-free privilege .

		This is the case of its attempt to use the blood and treasure of the
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	for the private benefit of American capi - talists in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's wise and firm course with regard to
Mexico	LOCATION	constitutes an absolute break with inter - national precedent .

		It warned foot-loose capital that it undertakes foreign adven - ture at its own risk , not the nation 's .

		It creates precedent for the universal aboli - tion of one constant source of international irritation .

		For it compels capitalistic competition in undeveloped lands to stay as competition between individuals , whether personal or corporate , instead of becoming war between the states whence the capital flows .

		Only a democratic victory can convert this precedent into a principle .

		States un - der dynastic rule , like
Germany	LOCATION	, or
Austria	LOCATION	, or
Japan	LOCATION	, or
Rumania	LOCATION	, confuse economic prosperity with personal possession .

		They are states in which landowners are mas - ters -LRB- the basis of the revolution in
Russia	LOCATION	and the heart of the revolutionary pro- gramme is land-reform -RRB- without restraint , and in which the personal rather than the social control of law and property sus - tains the medievalism of the society whose leader is an autocrat and whose govern - ment is a bureaucracy .

		The social ideal is feudal .

		Its influence renders nugatory the social character which private property in modern industrial society actually pos - sesses , because in such states ownership and political rule are vested in the same persons , and government needs no sanc - tion from the governed for its continuity .

		Because the feudal order in
Germany	LOCATION	is older and had the right of way , it is able to make a tool of the highly modern indus - trial order which interpenetrates it , and is in principle its enemy .

		From
1870	DATE	on , the whole or German society was transformed into an engine of war to be used in a programme of conquest and domination .

		This programme is necessary to the secur - ity or the ruling power , for its rule rests from its beginnings upon its agreement to protect its subjects against enemies in return for their subjection .

		And if there be no enemies , self-defence demands their creation .

		Thus the whole Prusso-German social system derives from the fiction , carefully nursed and tended , of perman - ent international rivalries and enmities .

		The dynasty 's control of education has made easy the manufacture and sustenance of a popular mood in harmony with dynas - tic interest .

		German political , economic , and social theory , German history and German theology and German metaphysics have all been made , by the use of govern - mental favor for academic place , to expound the dogma that international war - fare is the sine qua non of national prog - ress , that the fulfilment of `` the mission of
Germany	LOCATION	'' depends upon the sword .

		`` World power or downfall I '' Rule or ruin !

		Not nations , dynasties alone face the necessity of these alternatives , and the cry for `` a place in the sun , '' the concep - tion of `` Mittel-Europa , '' the horrible animus against
England	LOCATION	are items in the dynastic struggle for self-preservation .

		The national aid and comfort to the strug - gler is sovereignty .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 573 That the whole affair is a fiction , a somnambulism , any observer of the actual structure of the world 's economy must recognize .

		In that structure
Germany	LOCATION	had a distinguished and beneficent part .

		Dynastic pretensions had no share in this part .

		It was the fruit of the scientific assiduity , the conscientious workmanship , the regard for the customer , of the Ger - man manufacturer and merchant .

		These gave
Germany	LOCATION	an increasingly important `` place in the sun , '' spreading , by their excellence , not only the products of Ger - man technological superiority , but German `` Kultur , '' in
South America	LOCATION	, in the
Near East	LOCATION	, and the Far East , and in
Europe	LOCATION	and in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		They were wel - comed , too , as an enrichment of the lives of the peoples in those parts of the world , as a reinforcement in the cooperative enterprise of civilization .

		The dynasty demanded , however , instead of conquest by excellence , conquest by war possession and rule .

		`` That , '' it declares , `` can not be Germanism , which is not inherent in the German state and does not acknowledge the German ruler .

		The German state must hold dominion wherever there are men of German stock , and if other states and other stocks intervene , the German state must hold dominion over them . ''

		The consequences in German diplomatic and spy systems , military organization , and duplicity are notorious .

		Sovereignty , concentrated in a dynasty , is at once an international bully , a vicious economic pro- gramme in the shape of a tariff system , a perversion of industry from its proper function , and a trampling of weak peoples first through exploitation , then through conquest and repression .

		Exploitation consists mainly in the manipulation of the external conditions of the life of a people to their disadvantage .

		Exploitation is hindering their free use of roads , harbors , any means of communica - tion without which the development of their resources is useless ; it is appropria - tion of these resources or , where that is impolitic , discrimination against their de - velopment by means of a `` protective '' tariff .

		The second Balkan war turned on such limitations , as between
Serbia	LOCATION	and
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, and the Austro-Serb complica - tions which precipitated this civil war turned on restrictions as between Ser - bia and
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	.

		Without sov - ereignty , that is , exclusive possession , a state is , under ordinary conditions , shut off from economic growth .

		The alternative has ever been rule or ruin .

		In this respect , democratic states differ from dy - nastic ones only in degree .

		There is a maxim that capital knows no nationality , that it is international , using nations simply for the purpose of exploit - ing other nations .

		Whether this be so or not , labor consciously aspires to inter - nationality , and its aspiration is a reflex from the indisputable fact that in the economy of mankind the wealth of nations is international .

		As soon as this economy is freed from the repressive stress toward exclusive sovereignty , it must of its own weight and momentum , automatically , pro- long peace .

		For the economic enterprise is an instru - ment , not an end .

		It provides the matter of the body-politic , but not its mind .

		This mind is the social personality , the national - ity , of a human aggregate , the product of its generous and spontaneous energies , of its free self-expression its culture .

		In this a people 's personality lives and moves and has its being , not in the economic order .

		That is undoubtedly the founda - tion of our house of life , but we live not in , but on , the foundations .

		Those exist only for the sake of the superstructure , and the firmer the base , the freer and securer the movement of those who dwell upon it .

		An internationalized economic order is in - dispensable to the liberation of nationality .

		The claim to exclusive sovereignty in the economic world has led to repression in the cultural .

		Policies of Teutonification or Ottomanization or Magyarization or Russification applied by dynastic states to subject or conquered peoples were policies of murder of social personalities .

		They were guided by the belief that the repres - sion and replacement of one language and culture by another would lead to acquies - cence in foreign dominion , making foreign rule easier by forced abolition of its foreignness .

		Nothing could have been blinder .

		A social personality , a national - ity , resists murder as does an individual , 574 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	and is infinitely harder to kill .

		Exploita - tion and even slavery are tolerated , as the non-political and non-resistant Jewish nationality has tolerated them .

		But it is significant that it has clung to its cultural integrity and spiritually dominated its masters .

		So with all nationalities .

		Assault on spiritual values is met with immediate and powerful resistance : it is this assault that makes war between civilized peoples most of all inevitable .

		Historically the assault derives from a false equation which the necessities of dynastic survival in the modern world formulate .

		The political state , declares the equation , is identical with its economic interests and its economic interests with its nationality .

		Once more we have the dogma of exclusive sovereignty .

		Its falsity also in this form need not be argued .

		We may observe the precedent and example of its contradictory in the economic history of the `` sovereign states '' of the
United States of America	LOCATION	, a nation of local state govern - ments and diversified nationalities , freely associating as cultural groups , freely co - operating in the free trade of interstate commerce , its members citizens at once of the
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	and of the respective states .

		Time was when eco - nomic rivalry was as bitter between these states as between the European , and tariff wars and military conflict were not un - heard of .

		But our federal system has allowed the prosperity of each state to act , as in the course of nature it had to , as a direct function of the prosperity of its fellows .

		There is no silly talk about `` the balance of trade '' between states , and other incidents of bookkeeping .

		The ineluctable fact of the interdependence of the `` sovereign states '' is incorporated into , not opposed by , the laws of the states .

		International commerce is only interstate commerce writ large and the problems of its control and regulation are of the same kind .

		The ineluctable fact of the eco - nomic interdependence of mankind must be written into the laws of nations as it has been written into those of the states .

		Law must declare and reenforce the fact that the foundation of national prosperity is international comity .

		Law must pro- vide for equality of commercial oppor - tunity for equal access to undeveloped lands , to raw materials , to carriers , to har - bors , to markets .

		Law must provide for the freedom of the highways of the world to the peoples of the world .

		These are the economic implications of the `` princi - ple of nationality , '' and so the safeguards of lasting peace .

		Their attainment has for its first con - dition that there be banished from the council of nations any power whose exist - ence is identified in fact as well as in assumption with a programme of exclu - sive sovereignty .

		Such an identity exists in the case of dynastic governments of rule or ruin , so that President
Wilson	PERSON	's refusal to treat with the present German govern - ment is well-advised .

		But it must not be forgotten that there are others .

		Let no one regard the enactment and administration or such law as Utopian .

		Even realpolitiker , like Mr.
Root	PERSON	, and congenital tories , like Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, will admit that in our present alliance against the murderous German dynasty necessity has forced at terrible cost what intelli - gence could have achieved with ease .

		We of
America	LOCATION	and our allies are to-day avowedly what we have long been uncon - sciously , a cooperative economic commu - nity .

		We do maintain what is practically a free trade , we have pooled our carriers , we have internationalized the world 's highways , we are preventing profiteering in restraint of international trade .

		Our commerce with our allies has become a rudimentary interstate commerce .

		Our economic interests are socialized , and the socialization is in effect a limitation upon the sovereignty of each state in the alliance .

		At the same time the acknowledg - ment and recognition of the social person - alities , the nationalities within the alliance , is enhanced , even of
Australia	LOCATION	and Can - ada .

		That is what cooperation does .

		If it is an advantage for the wastage of war , what may it not mean for the use of peace I Its form and technique need only to be studied , perfected , and extended , to become the form and technique of the life of nations under the provisions of a demo - cratically established peace .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 575 Reading for Children We take it for granted that children will read .

		Reading is so important an instrument in present-day adjustment that we expect it of every person as a matter of course .

		We depend so much upon reading for our intercourse with others , with those who are separated from us in space or in time , that we are very apt to attribute to reading certain powers and virtues that really belong elsewhere , and we are apt to value reading as something having a virtue of its own .

		And thus we are in danger of overlooking the very ob - jects that reading is to serve .

		For the youngest readers the book may be a source of entertainment , since the story interest is prominent ; and reading becomes for many a form of passive in - dulgence and absorption that calls for little action or thinking .

		But while it is legiti - mate to use books , both for younger chil - dren and for older ones , as a form of entertainment , the danger suggested lies not in the books themselves , but in other elements of the child 's environment as the lack of stimulus or opportunity for in - teresting activities .

		The other purposes of reading can be more easily attained if the child early becomes familiar with the use of books ; and this is made possible if the association with reading is from the beginning a pleasant one .

		The story interest of the young child is used almost unconsciously the world over as a channel for stimulation and inspira - tion .

		The fairy and folk tales of all coun - tries satisfy the interest and at the same time suggest crude interpretations of na - ture and elemental aspirations , in keeping with the child 's mental and emotional de - velopment .

		They reach the child 's imagination at a time when he can easily project himself into the personality of the hero , and thus enrich his vicarious experi - ence in a large variety of relations and situations which he can appreciate .

		That the `` morals '' of many fairy and folk tales are at least dubious , is gener - ally recognized .

		They do indeed often teach the triumph of virtue , but quite as often the advantage of deceit and cun - ning .

		Or they teach that might makes right quite as often as the converse .

		Nev - ertheless , these primitive stories have their value , although they should not be ad - ministered in excessive quantities .

		Per - haps the best antidotes to the undesirable fairy tales are other fairy tales that is , tales from varied sources .

		The different manner and the contrasting mode of thought suggested by Hungarian and Irish tales , by Chinese and Danish tales , help to widen the outlook and the sympa - thies when a more restricted repertory is likely to fix prejudice and intolerance .

		The myths and hero tales stress courage and fidelity and self-confidence , and fur - nish a natural transition to the romance and chivalry of early adolescence .

		At every stage so far these stories give body to the common racial aspirations , they help to clarify certain types of ideals , and to interpret the familiar human relations .

		As they `` feed the imagination , '' they lay the foundation for the later appreciation of poetry .

		The personal interest that makes these earlier forms of literature so appealing to young children can be directed into history and biography .

		The value of the latter is commonly exaggerated on the assump - tion that they furnish important informa - tion .

		The chief value , at least so far as the development of ideals and standards is concerned , would seem to lie in their concreteness and reality rather than in the specific significance of the facts and events they teach .

		The drama and the best fic - tion give the child more valuable pictures of life than he is likely to get from his - tory and biography as they are ordinarily written .

		History and biography are needed to assure him that the truths of fiction are substantially representative .

		Like the `` unreal '' stories considered suitable for younger children , history and biography should teach about people and plots , about conflict of purposes and of ideals , about achievement and failure .

		And above all , in selecting books of this class , we must guard the child against books written to cultivate intolerance and chauvinism and bigotry .

		People and events should carry the reader beyond his 576 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	village and his neighbors , and bring him close to men and women of worth in all times and all places .

		The many and diverse appeals to the buyer of books for children tend to con - fusion , with the frequent result that recourse is had to the old and safe stand - ards of our own earlier years .

		We know that our reading did not hurt us , and as - sume that therefore it is harmless for the new generation .

		And it is true that the reprints of older juvenile literature repre - sent the survivors in a rather severe se - lective process .

		Yet in many respects the newer books written especially for chil - dren have decided advantages over their tried competitors holding over from the past .

		In the first place , the purposeful books of the past were written down to the chil - dren , for the most part diluted and simplified versions of adventure and mor - alities conceived essentially from the adult point of view .

		With our greatly extended knowledge of the child 's mind , the new juvenile literature is better adapted to reach the interest , the under - standing , and the emotions of the young reader .

		It is , so to speak , more `` effi - cient '' as a vehicle for transmitting ideas or moral impulses .

		In the second place , the external world of human relations has changed so rap - idly within the lifetime of the parents of the children that books which were ade - quate sources of information concerning foreign countries , how people live , indus - trial conditions , and so on , are no longer adequate except perhaps as `` historical '' documents .

		As sources of information , books of travel , books on man 's achieve - ments , even fiction , must be quite recent if the child is to get from them a reliable picture of the social world in which he lives .

		The books that relate the strug - gles and triumphs of the boy or girl who went to work at an early age and even - tually married the employer 's daughter -LRB- or son , as the case might be -RRB- no doubt did well enough in their day ; one could make a lengthy catalogue of their virtues .

		But there should be no place for these books in the hands of children to-day : for one thing , there are not enough sons and daughters of employers to go round .

		In the third place , much of youth 's read - ing is to meet the normal craving for a rationalized interpretation of nature 's mysteries ; and the older books necessarily overlooked the great discoveries in every department of science .

		There are com - paratively few children who will care to pursue science and nature studies inten - sively ; but every child should at least have the opportunity to have his questions answered in accordance with the best knowledge of our times .

		The newer books in this field are not only more valuable because of the more trustworthy informa - tion they contain ; but they are coming more and more to be characterized by a modern point of view .

		There is a peculiarly persistent Victor - ian affectation that there are some books that `` every child should know . ''

		This notion has its roots in the renaissance ; but it needs to have its branches pruned .

		Every child should know the world in which he lives as thoroughly as it lies in him to know it .

		This world includes tra - ditional lore and characters , `` classic '' tales and long-enduring , if not eternal , verities .

		It is well to assimilate a great deal of this intellectual background .

		But it is more urgent to learn the present world and the world in which he is going to live .

		Some children are inclined to organize their ideas on a basis of historical retrospect they ask , What came before that , and be - fore that ?

		Others , however , no less in - telligent and no less valuable as social assets , seem to be quite indifferent to what went before ; they are the pragmatists who ask , What of it ?

		and look to see what can be done here and now .

		Moreover , while the classics should be accessible to all , it is worse than useless to cultivate an affectation of appreciation for `` the best '' and it is desirable to cultivate the reali - zation that classics are always and every - where in the process of making .

		Guidance in reading is not a thing by itself .

		Like other efforts to direct chil - dren 's development , it must take into ac - count individual differences , capacities , and needs .

		Reading must reach the in -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 577 terests of the child as he is , not as we think he ought to be .

		And it must be opportune , not only from considerations of local and temporary conditions and events , but from the viewpoint of the child .

		Much thought has been given to building up a new literature for younger children .

		More needs just now to be given by parents and teachers to the in - troduction of the young reader to lit - erature intended primarily for adults .

		The transition from the reading of juven - iles to the reading of books intended primarily for adults is beset by special difficulties , like all other transitions in the child 's adjustment .

		Parents and teachers should face the situation with more assurance , however , than is com - mon. .

		We do not seem to hesitate about placing in the hands of young people the adult novels of a past generation those of
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Scott	PERSON	, or Victor Hugo .

		Neither should we fear to give them ac - cess to the good novels of contemporary writers .

		Mrs.
Fisher	PERSON	's `` The Bent Twig , ''
Ernest Poole	PERSON	's `` The Harbor , '' or
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	's `` Under Western Eyes , '' as beginners , may contain a great deal that is `` over the head '' of the boy or girl .

		But there is no harm in that , and in gen - eral we must recognize that a high-grade piece of fiction will contain more than most readers can immediately assimilate ; the young reader will get what he can , and he is likely to ignore what does not concern him .

		It is out of the question for any per - son to read everything that must be passed upon before being offered to children 's use .

		It is necessary to consult annotated lists of classified reading , made up by librarians or others interested primarily in selection , rather than by dealers or pub - lishers , who are interested primarily in marketing .

		And since it is possible to obtain competent counsel about particular books , the value and the character of chil - dren 's reading ought to rise about as fast as we care to give the problem our best thought .

		Louise de La
Valliere	PERSON	, the mistress of Louis XIV , ended her days , as everybody knows , in a Carmelite convent , where she died in
1710	DATE	at the age of 64 .

		Mile .

		Eve
Lavalliere	PERSON	, who is not yet 64 although she is a grandmother , seems to have been moved by the example of her celebrated namesake , for it has been an - nounced recently that she is about to leave the stage for the Carmelite order .

		She was inter - viewed in her apartment in the
Champs Ely	PERSON	- sees , stripped of its furniture , where the re - porters found her in the kitchen by the side of her truckle-bed , dressed in rough material and accompanied only by a faithful dog and an equally faithful and weeping maid .

		Mile .

		La - valliere informed the reporters that a country cure had led her to a state of grace during her last
summer	DATE	holiday ; `` if you only knew , '' she said , `` what happiness it is to have faith . ''

		This is , unfortunately , an age of skepticism and the project of the popular actress of the Varietes has been somewhat skeptically received in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In the `` Temps ''
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	has pointed out that , although the transition from the stage to the convent is not extraordinary , perhaps even quite natural , he cites the historic example of Thai 's , the doors of Carmelite convents are not open to anybody that chooses to walk in , and Mile .

		Lavalliere does not seem yet to have taken the necessary preliminary steps .

		He suggests that her decision is not perhaps final and , indeed , it is already rumored that she may shortly be seen again on a Parisian stage .

		When I last saw her , some little time before the war , she had the part of a boy of sixteen in
M. Nepoty	ORGANIZATION	's play , `` Les Petits , '' at the Theatre Antoine , and she both looked and played it to perfection .

		M.
Paul Geraldy	PERSON	's first play , `` Les Noces d'Ar - gent , '' has just been published by
Messieurs Cres	ORGANIZATION	in a volume at four francs .

		The reading of it has confirmed the impression that its first per - formance at the
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	made on me ; it is the best play that we have been given for a very long time and altogether a remarkable work which promises well for the dramatic fu - ture of its young author .

		Its theme is the tyr - anny of the family , especially in
France	LOCATION	, a tyranny arising from affection but no less dis - astrous on that account .

		We see the inevitable misunderstandings and estrangements between parents and children caused by the failure of the 578 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	former to understand that their offspring , at a certain age , have the right to direct their own lives .

		Perhaps the play would not be fully understood in
America	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	, where par - ents do not , as many do here , expect their chil - dren even when they are married and have set up homes of their own to live in their pockets , so to speak , and to ask their opinion on every occasion .

		But even in
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	there is often the failure of the older generation to understand that the younger is not necessarily wrong because it does not accept all the opinions and judgments of its elders .

		It is amusing to observe how often even men that have been counted as `` advanced '' and really were so up to a certain age , become at that age fixed in their opinions and accessible to no new ideas and are the most determined opponents of any views more advanced than their own .

		The conservatism of the middle-aged is one of the chief obstacles to the progress of the world .

		There are certain faults in
M. Geraldy	LOCATION	's play ; he sometimes forces the note .

		Thus , the parting of the daughter from her parents after her marriage at the end of the first act is not quite natural .

		Even a French jeune fille , who sometimes marries merely in order to get a little liberty , does not leave the home of her childhood without regret .

		The tyranny of the bourgeois French family is begin - ning to break down young girls , in particular , are acquiring more liberty and that detestable word `` convenable '' is losing its power but `` Les Noces d'Argent '' is still timely .

		A wholesome corrective to the indiscriminating abuse of the Russian Revolution , which has been too common here , will be found in
M. Charles Rivet	PERSON	's book , `` Le Dernier Romanoff '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	;
Perris	LOCATION	-RRB- .


M. Rivet	PERSON	, who was for a long time the
Petrograd	LOCATION	correspondent of the `` Temps , '' gives an account of the old regime which should convince the most conservative that any change must have been for the better .

		When one real - izes the appalling heritage of bankruptcy and universal disorganization that
Tsarism	PERSON	left to the revolution , one understands the present situation in
Russia	LOCATION	, which can never be put straight so long as the war lasts .

		Instead of condemning the Russians for wanting peace , we ought to sympathize with their tragic situation and admire their heroism in standing loyally by their Allies and refusing to accept the separate peace which they could have to-morrow on the most favorable terms .

		The Italian defeat has naturally renewed the pessimistic tendencies that American intervention in the war had dissipated .

		When
America	LOCATION	came in , a victory for the Central Empires seemed quite impossible , and now they have shown that they are still capable of inflicting a serious blow on the Allies .

		That does not mean that they will obtain the ultimate victory , but everybody here realizes how serious would be the conse - quences if the north of
Italy	LOCATION	were occupied by the enemy .

		It need not , of course , be assumed that that will happen ; we can still hope that the advance of the Germans and Austrian * will be checked , but opinion is prepared to face the worst , if it should come .

		Many people share the opinion of
M. Briand	PERSON	that it was a mistake to refuse consideration of the peace proposals made to him by
Germany	LOCATION	.

		If it be true , as
M. Briand	PERSON	says , that
Germany	LOCATION	was prepared to restore the complete independ - ence of
Belgium	LOCATION	, cede
Trieste	LOCATION	and the Tridentine to
Italy	LOCATION	, and even , on conditions , Alsace-Lor - raine to
France	LOCATION	, it might have been wiser to allow
M. Briand	PERSON	to go to
Switzerland	LOCATION	to meet Prince von Biilow , as he was invited to do .

		He would then have been able to ascertain whether the proposals were really serious and , if so , to obtain a definite and detailed programme to lay before the other Allies .

		It would be impossible to make peace at the expense of
Russia	LOCATION	, but the demands of
Germany	LOCATION	in regard to Russian ter - ritory might have been withdrawn in the course of negotiations .

		Evidently
Germany	LOCATION	will never make a peace proposal that the Allies can accept as it stands without discussion .

		The sole ques - tion is whether every proposal is to be refused at once without examination .


M. Briand	PERSON	con - siders that
M. Ribot	PERSON	put the matter in such a way to the British , Italian , and Russian govern - ments that a negative reply on their part was inevitable .

		The Chamber , at its secret session on
October 16	DATE	, seems to have taken
M. Briand	PERSON	's view , for
M. Ribot	PERSON	was obliged to retire from office in consequence of his conduct in the matter .

		The first proposals were made to
M. Briand	PERSON	through the intermediary of a distinguished Bel - gian , who has remained in his own country since the German occupation and was allowed to come to
France	LOCATION	through
Switzerland	LOCATION	to see
M. Briand	PERSON	.

		Both the Belgian and the Rumanian governments agreed with
M. Briand	PERSON	that the German proposals , without being acceptable as they stood , were a sufficient basis for negotia - tions .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 579 Internal politics are still in a disturbed con - dition , owing to the various politico-judicial `` af - fairs . ''

		M.
Leon Daudet	PERSON	's letter to the Presi - dent of the Republic accusing
M. Malvy	PERSON	, late minister of the interior , of treason , caused an immense sensation .

		The government , after hav - ing refrained from prosecuting
M. Daudet	PERSON	for calumnious denunciation , made the mistake of accusing the royalist league , the Action Fran - gaise , of which
M. Daudet	PERSON	is a leading member , of a plot against the Republic .

		After numerous police raids no conclusive evidence of a plot was discovered and the charge had to be abandoned .

Henry James	PERSON	and the Untold Story THE IVORY TOWER and THE SENSE OF THE PAST .

		By
Henry James	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ; each ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In these two posthumous fragments of
Henry James	PERSON	we find consummation without comple - tion consummation of the author as spectacle , as object of the appreciative regard , without com - pletion of either of his cherished pieces of ma - terial .

		It is not too much to say that the stroke which cuts these off , at the end of the first third or thereabout , has the undesigned yet singularly valuable effect of turning
Henry James	PERSON	himself into the hero , the very centre and fulcrum of interest , of either tale ;
Henry James	PERSON	being here the name for a particular kind of appreciation of life fused with a particular kind of fictional method .

		These two , the appreciation and the method become one , make up the whole of our later
Henry James	PERSON	not , one hastens to add , because he narrowed his appreciation to the con - fines of a narrow and special method , but be - cause he deepened and intensified his method until it included the sum of his appreciation of life .

		He became our one example of the per - fected identity of the man with the artist through the evolution of the artist , not through the devolution of the man .

		It is of this evolu - tion and this identity that we get , in `` The Ivory Tower '' and `` The Sense of the Past , '' the uniquely clinching evidence .

		Each of the tales breaks off but to leave us in possession of three - or four-score pages of dic - tated `` notes , '' wherein we see the author think - ing himself toward and into his subject , feeling his way about in it , studying it in every bear - ing and implication , recording and strengthening his possession of it , watching its possibilities more and more radiantly dawn for him .

		In these notes , never meant for print , we have our dis - covery and our compensating thrill .

		We must indeed do without the accustomed thrill : that of the
Henry James	PERSON	subject wrought through to the catching of every thread into its place in the pattern , until the whole becomes instantly accessible at one pounce of the reader 's atten - tion .

		But to have had that would have been to miss the excitement of this other triumph , the capture , not of
Henry James	PERSON	's subject , but of
Henry James	PERSON	himself in the act of capturing it .

		Elsewhere we behold his spectacle rtaking , in the measure of our responsiveness , his point of view 580 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	and his place , becoming in truth himself .

		Here we behold rather the beholder .

		We see his mind perform upon his material the very op - erations our minds would have to perform upon the finished story if it existed ; we trace his whole coherent series of guesses , anticipations , specula - tions , doubts , solutions ; we see him in short as an absorbed reader of the stories that were not yet written , precisely as we have ourselves been readers of the other stories , the ones that are written .

		Elsewhere , the
Henry James	PERSON	story gives itself up to the reader .

		Here , it is only to the author that it gives itself up ; and what the reader gets is the author himself .

		The prefaces to the
New York	LOCATION	edition give us a re - trospective account of how
Henry James	PERSON	told the story that can not be told ; they are jotted notes of how a done thing was done .

		But these newer and more astounding notes are prefaces in a much more elemental sense : prefaces , not to an edition , but to the very doing of a thing for - ever to remain undone .

		That , and the publication of both documents at once , constitutes their equality and their unity .

		There is no other equality ; and the circumstances in common between the two projects emphasize , as hardly anything else could , their differences in pretension , in design , in scope .

		`` The Ivory Tower , '' if a great thing , is great in the smallest ways associable with its author .

		A study essen - tially of money , of those who have it not and of those who have it thrust upon them , of the lengths to which some will go , and others will not , to get it or keep it , the story probes shrewdly into some aspects of our American social scene .

		But it belongs among such late and relatively little things as `` The Outcry '' and `` The Sacred Fount , '' without the beguiling farce of the one or the uniquely confessional purpose of the other .

		It confirms and ratifies , it annotates , it re - exhibits an artificer supremely concerned with the alternation and distribution of his points of view , passionately and gaily resolved `` to achieve the lucidity with the complexity '' ; but it changes or enlarges nothing .

		`` The Sense of the .

		Past , '' on the other hand , changes every - thing .

		It alters the shape , pushes out the bounds , of the whole
Henry James	PERSON	world , adds a sub - stantial figure to the sum of imaginings , achieve - ments , beauties , perfections .

		Fitly ,
James	PERSON	could turn back to it from his appreciation of
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	, at a time when `` The Ivory Tower '' had ceased to hold him .

		`` The Sense of the Past '' promised all the rich , full orchestral reso - nance of novels such as `` The Ambassadors '' and `` The Wings of the Dove '' ; yet , in its entire dissimilarity from anything else that even
James	PERSON	could have written , it is as isolated and self - sufficing as `` The Great Good Place '' or `` The Madonna of the Future '' or `` The Turn of the Screw . ''

		Not even its author had ever under - taken to add such warmth and spaciousness of treatment to such amazing virtuosity of design .

		It is easier on the whole to describe the design than the treatment , and by that law which makes it easier to describe a product of fancy than one of imagination .

		It is a trick of the fancy that
James	PERSON	practised upon
Ralph Pendrel	PERSON	, the `` first young man '' of `` The Sense of the Past . ''

		An oddly untraveled , unworldly young American man , author of `` An Essay in Aid of the Read - ing of History , '' in love with a notion of his own that the spirit of time past can be recovered as no one has yet had the fine sensibility to recover it , he tumbles through such an open trapdoor of the bygone as not his most extrava - gant moment could have dreamed the existence of .

		On the death of a distant English cousin he `` comes in for '' a house in
London	LOCATION	, `` some - thing strange and storied , ancient and alien . ''

		Hardly sooner has he taken his first preliminary peep at it than he exchanges identities with a young man of 1820 a young man in one of the portraits within the house .

		His `` sense of the past '' projects him , we are given to under - stand , into the period , the personal situation , the very love story , of that remote ancestral rel - ative , his other self of
1820	DATE	; which other self , a person with an exactly corresponding `` sense of the future , '' is left in turn to explore the strange delights of his future that is , the pres - ent out of which
Pendrel	ORGANIZATION	has just dropped .

		These paired situations , that of the modern young man fallen into the wrong century to take up in media * res the love story of his proto - type , carrying it forward with a vaguely sensed disquietude and `` malaise , '' and that of his shad - owy alter ego projected forward by a century into a modern and alien world what do they not mean , in possibilities , values , `` force and felicity , '' to
Henry James	PERSON	?

		They mean , of course , every - thing ; or at least they promise everything , and would as surely have meant it had he been given the time to make them do so .

		But , centrally and especially , they mean the general superiority and Tightness of the present as compared with
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 581 the past .

		This was
Henry James	PERSON	's faith , one deciphers , as well as his paradox .

		Loving old perfections as he did , he yet had the grace to see that only the lapse of time had made them old ; precisely in time lapsed is our modern advantage , our thing to value .

		It is only on the present that everything else comes to focus , only for it that everything was made .

		This , surely , is the mean - ing of
Pendrel	ORGANIZATION	's `` malaise '' as he falls in love with the wrong sister and tries to make himself believe that she is the right one ; this is the meaning of his instinctive cry at first sight of the right sister : '' ` Why she 's modern , modern ! ''

		The same meaning is wrought into
Pendrel	PERSON	's dim , groping sense of the chivalrous amenities and gentilities of modern intercourse , the like of which he looks for in vain in the hard and rather too grossly hearty Georgian social life ; it is wrought as well into the others ' blank fail - ure to make him out , their conclusion that what is really the stifled modern in him can only be a queer kind of transatlantic cleverness .

		And , most touchingly , it is suggested in the pained and protesting reappearances of
Ralph	PERSON	's alter ego , who , poor troubled ghost , is no more quite con - tent with his fulfilled dream of the future than is
Ralph	PERSON	with his of the past , and who must return to show a hurt face on the occasions of
Ralph	ORGANIZATION	's doing and feeling such things as no youth of
1820	DATE	could have done and felt .

		The chief of these `` deflections '' is
Ralph	PERSON	's ap - preciation of the right , the `` modern , '' sister , who makes him feel `` the beautiful pity of her divination '' of his malaise .

		To her , in what was evidently to have been a movingly climactic scene a faire ,
Ralph	PERSON	pours out everything that he means , everything that the author too means , about past and present .

		Even the denatured prose of the notes opens here immense perspectives of emotion , of effect , of truth : `` For it would seem to me kind of sublime that he now , at last now , opening up , opening out , everything that he has had before to keep back , tells her such things about those fruitions of the Future which have constituted his state , tells her of how poor a world she is stuck fast in compared with all the wonders and splendours that he is straining back to , and of which he now sees only the ripeness , richness , attraction and civilisation , the virtual perfection without a flaw , that she stands dazzled before it and can only be shut up in the heartbreak of remaining so far back behind it , so dismally and excludedly out of it , while he , with her assistance , shaking her off after he has , as it were , used her , wins his way back to it and out of her sight and sense for ever . ''

		There are more meanings here than can be convoyed into so narrow a harbor as this review .

		There is , for example , abundant suggestion of the way
Henry James	PERSON	valued the past that is , as something best worth knowing because to know it lends sense and direction to one 's love of the present , which must , out of dead things , faded beauties , livingly re-create itself .

		Here too is the disproof not indeed that we could not find it everywhere else of Miss
Rebecca West	PERSON	's the - ory of
Henry James	PERSON	's `` odd lack of the historic sense . ''

		`` He had , '' she writes , `` a tremendous sense of the thing that is and none at all of the thing that has been , and thus he was always being misled by such lovely shells of the past as
Hamp	PERSON	- ton Court into the belief that the past which inhabited them was as lovely . ''

		Other judg - ments , of the same critic and of others , are put out of countenance by this most challenging of the books that can never be written .

		But I brush aside a dozen such matters to end on a suggestion that in `` The Sense of the Past '' we have the rounding out and ultimate logic of the international novel as
Henry James	PERSON	created it .

		His one constant material formula was to study different , not necessarily opposed , types of breeding at their best that is , crystallized each in its best possible human products .

		That he does even in `` The Ivory Tower , '' where , al - though the characters are of American extraction , the hero 's attitude toward most things , and es - pecially toward money , is more of the Old World than of the New .

		He had done the same in such early novels as ``
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	'' and `` The American . ''

		Most often , his types of bestness cross oceans to produce their effects on each other ; sometimes they touch across gaps of time , as in `` The Aspern Papers , '' a drama of generations , epochs ; rarely , they overleap the very barriers of our common materiality , to live for a few breaths , as in `` The Great Good Place , '' for beauty or for terror that knows nothing of local habitations and names .

		In `` The Sense of the Past '' all three of these appeals are superposed and fused into one .

		Continents and capitals touch ; then interpenetrates with now ; and both space and time exist only as symbols , in the time - less and spaceless world of the story that can - not be told .

		582 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	A Defence of Idealism A DIFBNCE or IDEALISM .

		By
May Sinclair	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Philosophical literature is notoriously dry read - ing .

		We are accustomed to hold the subject responsible for the repellent style in which it appears , and are therefore always surprised to come upon a philosophical study which is under - standable without great effort .

		If , in addition , it sparkles with wit and good humor , as does
May Sinclair	DATE	's defence of philosophical idealism , we are as likely to condemn it as `` popular '' as to find it a rare achievement .

		It was like a woman to come to the defence of the under dog .

		Every dog has his day even in philosophy , and philosophical idealism had a long day .

		Indeed , it is difficult to tell , accord - ing to the author , whether the evident twilight of idealism follows a sunset or precedes a sun - rise .

		`` There is a certain embarrassment , '' she writes , `` in coming forward with an
Apology for Idealistic Monism	ORGANIZATION	at the present moment .

		You can not be quite sure whether you are put - ting in an appearance too late or much too early . ''

		Of one thing , however , we may be sure , she thinks , that idealistic monism , if dead , will be born again .

		It will rise again because it lives on in the heart of the very system that for the time being may have superseded it .

		It has been so over and over again since philosophic speculation began in the ancient East , and the future will be like the past .

		`` Pragmatic Hu - manism and Vitalism are going from us in the flower , you may say , of their youth . ''

		The contest even now is between realism and ideal - ism .

		And the author believes `` that some day -LRB- which may be as distant as you please -RRB- the New Realism will grow old and die , and the New Idealism will be born again . ''

		The argument of the book is the old one that all paths lead to the Absolute .

		Start out in ex - perience anywhere and there is but one resting - place for the spirit that seeks an explanation .

		At first sight pluralistic philosophies seem to have all the advantage in appealing to facts , but this is the superficial aspect of things ; even a little thought always discloses the unity behind and within the multiplicity .

		In a chapter on `` The Pan-psychism of
Samuel Butler	PERSON	'' we are shown that one indestructible primal energy per - sists through all the fluctuations of the psyche .

		A chapter on `` Some Ultimate Questions of Psy - chology '' contends that our conscious life has a unity which it could not have if there were no self unaffected by the changes characteristic of mental life .

		So , too , we read again , there is unity behind the phenomena of nature .

		`` The law of conservation of energy is nothing if not a confession that , as far as the physical world goes , incorrigible multiplicity and difference do not obtain . ''

		Mysticism , realism , pragmatism , vitalism all are compelled to contribute to the force of the argument .

		One can not say that the logic is always sound .

		One can not agree , for example , that since science recognizes the ultimate constitution of matter to be energy , and since it is agreed that the so-called material qualities are not found in it , we may conclude that this energy is spiritual , and that following the path of physics we arrive inevitably at an absolute experience as the final reality .

		No ; not always sound , but always keen , vigorous , lively , readable .

		It is doubtful , however , whether the book will please the idealists unless the idealistic tem - perament has recently become much less dog - matic as the result of successful attacks upon the idealistic position .

		Dogmatism is , at all events , quite foreign to
May Sinclair	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		She aims at a tentative solution .

		It is not , and it can not be , a question of certainty .

		No reasonable person demands certainty at this time of day .

		The utmost he is entitled to demand is a certain balance of probabilities .

		Perhaps not even that .

		Perhaps only here a balance and there a chance , and there , again , an off-chance , a bare possibility .

		The book is obviously an attempt to ascertain what exactly the various philosophical systems are driving at when reduced to the simplest terms and stated in clear English .

		It would be rash to say that she succeeds or that anyone could succeed in doing this .

		`` A Defence of Idealism '' does , however , present in clear , readable fashion what one clever writer after a careful examina - tion believes to be the strong and the weak points of the competing philosophies of our day , and as such is a suggestive book for the thought - ful layman and the student of philosophy who has not offered his soul as a sacrifice to his system .

		That she finds all philosophies com - pelled at last to admit a unity in things , and that this proves to her satisfaction that some form of idealism the philosophy of unity is on the whole the most acceptable , serves only to give her presentation an artistic completeness and to put before the reader a well-rounded argu - ment for a philosophical creed with which an educated person may be supposed to be at least acquainted .

		In view of what has happened , there is deep irony in the fact that a considerable section of the Polish people should only a few years ago have looked forward to a world war with a feeling of grim satisfaction .

		The sense of ruin was so keen , and the plight of the people under Russian and German rule was so pitiable , that patriots were ready to welcome a general inter - national conflagration as the last hope of a re - vived nationality .

		Save in the event of a wiping of the slate by war for a remaking of the map and a redistribution of political power , the Polish question seemed buried forever .

		In
1912	DATE	representatives of all the independence parties of Russian , Prussian , and Austrian
Poland	LOCATION	actually met and formed a committee charged with the task of drawing up a plan of procedure when the crash should come , and making mili - tary preparations for the expected contingency .

		The decision was , in the event of a war which should find
Russia	LOCATION	on one side and
Austria	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	on the other , to throw support to Aus - tria .

		Bitter hatred of

Austria	LOCATION	had dealt with the Poles most leniently ; Russian oppression extended over eighty per cent of the ancient Polish republic ; it was expected that
Russia	LOCATION	would be hopelessly beaten ; and a federal union of a reconstituted Polish state with
Austria	LOCATION	and
Hungary	LOCATION	seemed the most desirable arrangement short of complete independence .

		The storm broke before even the Poles ex - pected it ; and never was there greater disillu - sionment .

		Instead of finding themselves in a position to .

		act with deliberation and turn the situation to their own advantage , the unhappy people saw their portion of
Europe	LOCATION	become im - mediately one of the principal theatres of the war , where whole nations met in a terrible death grapple .

		From Galicia to the Dwina the coun - try now lies one vast scroll of horror .

		Further - more , two million Poles of military age were drafted into the armies of the three contending powers and lined up on opposite sides of the battle field , brother against brother ; so that to the devastation wrought by pillage , hunger , ex - posure , and disease has been added that of fratri - cidal war .

		Through the fearful cloud of disaster that has settled upon the unhappy people only one ray of sunshine has broken .

		In No - vember ,
1916	DATE	, the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	announced their readiness to recognize an independent king - dom of
Poland	LOCATION	, and subsequently the Russian revolutionary provisional government took a sim - ilar step .

		But as yet these declarations are hardly worth the paper on which they are writ - ten , and the fate of what remains of the Polish people is still in the lap of the gods .

		The story of
Poland	LOCATION	has been told for English readers many times , but in view of the startling chapter which is being added to it before our very eyes much interest attaches to Mr.
Lewin	PERSON	- ski-Corwin 's recent and up-to-date volume .

		In some 600 pages Polish political development is sketched from prehistoric times to the events of the present year .

		The earlier portions of the volume possess no special distinction .

		They suf - fer by the exclusion of economic , social , and cul - tural matters , and will be found drier reading , and no more authoritative , than two or three single-volume histories which have been available for a decade or more .

		The last two chapters , however , dealing with `` constitutional
Russia	LOCATION	and the Poles '' and `` the Polish question and the Great War , '' have decided value , not alone be - cause they bring the story up to date , but because they show an unusually keen insight into the perplexities of the contemporary Polish problem .

		It is the author 's opinion that this problem has never before `` been so near its full and satisfac - tory solution '' ; the necessary and sufficient guar - antee of such a solution he finds in President
Wilson	PERSON	's affirmation before the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	,
January 22 , 1917	DATE	, that he took it for granted that `` states - men everywhere are agreed that there should be a united , independent , and autonomous
Poland	LOCATION	. ''

		In his interesting essay on the future of
Poland	LOCATION	Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	attributes the promises of both the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	to sheer expediency , and argues that the decisive success of either group of belligerents in a short war would have meant for the Poles `` merely the passing from
Scylla	LOCATION	to Charybdis . ''

		He shows how incom - plete and provisional are the arrangements that have been made for the reconstituted Polish Kingdom , and advises the Poles to hold fast for the time being to their several allegiances , in the expectation that the self-respect of the Entente 584 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	Allies will never tolerate putting back `` under Russian slavery '' those who are loyal to
Russia	LOCATION	during this trial , and that , after what has hap - pened in
Ireland	LOCATION	, the English people can not hold against the
Poles of Galicia	ORGANIZATION	and Posnania the fact that they remained loyal , for the dura - tion of the war , to
Austria	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	shares Mr.
Lewinski-Corwin	PERSON	's opinion that the only rational and enduring solu - tion of the Polish question is an independent
Poland	LOCATION	, a nation which shall be in no way sub - ject to either
Russia	LOCATION	or
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But he wisely warns against the temptation to press territorial demands too far .

		Polish enthusiasts loudly pro- claim their purpose to bring together again all the lands that are `` historically '' Polish , without regard to whether these lands are now predom - inantly Polish or capable of developing real eco - nomic and political solidarity .

		Even if the Poles were in a position to determine the matter single - handed , they would be making a great mistake in saddling themselves at the outset with a group of irredentist controversies .

		`` No cataclysm of defeat , '' the writer properly says , `` whichever way the war turns , is going the compel
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	to give up
Silesia	LOCATION	, the Prussian Baltic coast line ,
Lithuania	LOCATION	, and
Podolia	LOCATION	, and it is doubtful if the Poles can make good their claims to the eastern portions of Galicia . ''

		On ethnographic and economic grounds , Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	would include in a future kingdom of
Poland	LOCATION	about two-thirds of German Posnania , the Russian kingdom of
Poland	LOCATION	-LRB- including Khelm -RRB- , and
Galicia	LOCATION	, excluding the eastern re - gion known as
Red Ruthenia	ORGANIZATION	.

		That a
Poland	LOCATION	thus constituted would rapidly `` become the sev - enth ` great power * of
Europe	LOCATION	'' we may readily believe ; although Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	's estimate of the service to be rendered by such a nation as a buffer state will not instantly carry conviction .

		Of the three or four miscellaneous essays which complete Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	's volume , one pleads for the internationalization of
Constan	LOCATION	- tinople and its appurtenant European lands , an - other urges the formation of Syrian and Armenian states as a partial solution of the prob - lem of
Asiatic Turkey	ORGANIZATION	, and a third advises a policy of `` hands-off '' in the
Balkans	LOCATION	.

		The author writes from long and intimate knowledge of eastern European politics , and his suggestions are worthy of the earnest attention of statesmen and diplomats .

		A Frigid Introduction to
Strauss RICHARD STRAUSS	PERSON	, THE MAN AND His WORKS .

		By
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	.

		With an
Appreciation of Strauss	ORGANIZATION	by
Percy Grainger	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		This is a useful survey of the external facts touching the life and musical compositions of
Richard Strauss	PERSON	.

		It is also , as the writer seemed to be very eager it should be , a reasonably en - tertaining volume , liberally besprinkled , as it is , with anecdotal matter and journalistic chit-chat .

		But it does not , on the whole , suggest that it has been a labor of love .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	makes it abundantly clear in the course of his remarks that his reason for writing the book was rather the fact that
Strauss	PERSON	is considered one of the greatest , if not the greatest , of living composers than that he himself considers him to be such .

		And the general tone of Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's book is blase , some - times yawningly so .

		His own spontaneous reactions to
Strauss	PERSON	are so consistently unsympa - thetic that he evidently fears at times to create in the reader an impression of unreasoning preju - dice ; he therefore protects himself by calling on copious testimony from other writers .

		`` You Straussianer just fight it out among yourselves , '' he seems to say , and steps back with a shrug of the shoulders .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's lack of sympathy is only partly due to
Strauss	PERSON	's obvious shortcomings his crass realism of conception , his lack of a distinguished melodic vein , his needlessly complicated orches - trations , his frequent want of restraint and ten - dency to lapse into sheer vulgarity .

		We could hardly expect Mr.
Finck	PERSON	to forgive
Strauss	PERSON	these sins .

		In one of the most charming essays on Chopin that I have seen he has implied how much he understands and values the jeweled and the chastened in art , how ardently he loves the limpid flow of perfect melody and the delicious echo of subtle and softly pedaled harmonies .

		But melody and the glow of harmonic sequence , pre - cious as these are , are not the whole of music .

		The more massive qualities exhibited by
Strauss	PERSON	at his best the power to fill a large canvas with color and movement , the titanic artistic unity and inner coherence attained through poly - phonic mastery , and , above all , the will and power to give concrete musical expression to large thoughts and unbridled passions , to the Rabelais and to the madman both that are latent in all of us these are not to be lightly ignored .

		Here precisely it is that Mr.
Finck	PERSON	seems not quite adequate to his task .

		He has evidently
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 585 little genuine love for polyphony as such , for the interweaving of independently moving melo - dic lines .

		That the polyphonic technique has frequently degenerated into mechanical virtu - osity need not be denied .

		It is doubtful , for all that , whether the history of music records any means of expression more virile and resourceful than the free polyphony of modern music .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	is also doubtful , it would seem , of the legitimateness of such wealth of expression in pure tone as
Strauss	ORGANIZATION	gives us .

		He may be right , but only one prepared to meet
Strauss	PERSON	at least half way in his artistic presuppositions is gen - uinely qualified to interpret him to us .

		That is why Mr.
Ernest Newman	PERSON	's far shorter study of
Strauss	PERSON	seems so much more vital ; the few pages that
Romain Holland	PERSON	devotes to
Strauss	PERSON	in his `` Musiciens d'Aujourdhui '' also reveal a deeper understanding of the musical personality of this composer .

		Underneath all Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's hesitations and shrinkings in the presence of
Strauss	PERSON	's tone poems and operas , may we not discern a more funda - mental clash of temperaments , the refined irri - tation of the cultivated Sybarite who looks on at the capers of a healthy barbarian , a spirit at - tuned to Tennysonian felicities subjected to the uncouth liberties of a Walt Whitman ?

		Some - thing of the kind is conveyed by
Percy Grainger	PERSON	in the following words , taken from his inter - esting introductory essay :
Strauss	PERSON	is not a musician 's musician like
Bach	PERSON	,
Mozart	PERSON	,
Schubert	LOCATION	,
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	, or
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	, capable of turning out flawless gems of artistic subtlety and per - fection , but rather is he a great cosmic soul of the
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	,
Edgar Lee	PERSON	Masters caliber : full of dross , but equally full of godhead ; lacking refinement , but not the supremer attributes ; and uniquely able to roll forth some great uplifting message after gigantic preliminaries of boredom and inconsequentialness .

		-LRB- Do Schubert and
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	quite belong to the first list ?

		Do Goethe and
Milton	PERSON	feel quite at ease with their neighbors in the second ? -RRB-

		It is the `` dross , '' the `` lack of refinement , '' and the `` gi - gantic preliminaries of boredom '' that too fatally affect Mr.
Finck	PERSON	; the `` godhead '' and `` supremer attributes '' seem altogether lost in the scramble .

		In the section devoted to `` Program Music '' Mr.
Finck	PERSON	has a splendid opportunity to analyze the psychology and aesthetics and trace the de - velopment of one of the most interesting musical phenomena of the last hundred years .

		I can not find that he has made very serious use of the opportunity .

		The externality that characterizes his account of
Strauss	PERSON	's career and his descrip - tion of the musical compositions themselves is in evidence in this section as well .

		The inevitable anecdotes , random remarks on various speci - mens of programme music -LRB-
MacDowell	ORGANIZATION	's piano - forte sketches come in for warm appreciation -RRB- , a determined and gallant attempt to convince us that the symphonic poem has reached its artistic culmination in
Liszt	LOCATION	, and divers evidences of
Strauss	PERSON	's inferiority to his Hungarian precursor fill up space that one would have liked to see devoted to the rationale of the programme move - ment and to the varying ideals that have ani - mated its representatives .

		We are not given even a serviceable notion of the nature of
Strauss	PERSON	's aesthetic procedure , of the manner in which he aims to reconcile the conflicting demands of literary conception and musical treatment , of the symbolic significance of leading motive , instrumental individualization , and polyphony .

		And what of the evolution of musical form in the compositions of
Strauss	LOCATION	, the acknowl - edged master of form ?

		In brief , we nowhere feel that we are being brought to a realization of the nuclear conceptions of
Strauss	PERSON	the artist .

		How then can the reader justly estimate the place to be assigned
Richard Strauss	PERSON	in the his - tory of programme music , whether his tone poems represent a logical and healthy development of ideas that owe their most authoritative formula - tion to
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	and Liszt or , as Mr.
Finck	PERSON	would have it , mark the degeneration of the programme tendency ?

		Be that as it may , there is little doubt that for the present programme music has reached its apogee .

		Signs of revolt have been in evi - dence for some time ; the cumbrous literary con - structions that were meant to give form to elaborate tonal creations seem to crumble of their own weight .

		It is probable that the program - mists have attempted too much , that they have tried to get as much service out of
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	as out of a willing dray-horse .

		The future alone can tell whether they have indeed attempted the impossible or have merely sought the arduous conquest with means too coarse and untried , have mistaken a Rosinante for the real
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Meanwhile , a clear swing back to the absolutists ,
Brahms	PERSON	notwithstanding , is a sheer impossibility .

		However music may tend to be chastened of its luxuriance of symbol , the spell of fancy and mood that the romanticists and programmists have cast over it will not disappear .

		Self-determina - 586 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	tion of form and emotional expression if these alone remain , their attainment by way of the perhaps circuitous route of the programmists will have justified the Liszts and Strausses .

		Yet all the while I find myself seriously dis - trusting the psychological validity of the current classification of composers into absolutists and programmists or impressionists .

		To an altogether unwarrantable extent we have been taking mu - sical artists at their own valuation , at the sur - face value of their titles and programmatic analyses .

		Is it not possible , nay likely , that an appalling proportion of the musical `` programmes '' authorized by composers are afterthoughts de - signed , consciously or unconsciously , to lure the public , always an essentially unmusical body ?

		Or to give an external conceptual frame , of sub - jective associative value , to a lyric impulse that has already untranslatably expressed itself in tone ?

		We know that
Schumann	PERSON	gave titles to his pieces after he had composed them ; the con - ceptual label , in other words , was probably more a flourish of the pen , a Finis , than a genuine aesthetic stimulus .

		The wayward whimsy or burning passion was there from the beginning , but it needed no other than purely musical ex - pression .

		May not even some of our impres - sionists ,
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	among them , entertain a fun - damentally identical attitude toward their ma - terial ?

		Is there not the least shade of hypocrisy in these pagodas and goldfish and engulfed cathe - drals and moons descending on temples that were ?

		Strange , otherwise , that we seem to breathe a larger air and to feel the tow of a mightier current in the music itself than in the bric-a-brac world its titles introduce us to .

		Con - versely , there is little reason to doubt that a great deal of absolute music , so-called , has been wrought out of conceptions and emotions that were all but ready to burst into impassioned speech .

		What are some of those curious recita - tivo passages in the Beethoven sonatas , glades in the wood , but tortured questionings and striv - ings bound in musical constraint ?

		Before we can profoundly approach the psychology of pro- gramme music , there is much underbrush to be cleared away .

		We must know better than we do how the artist conceives and works and care less how he labels .

		Perhaps it is well that ar - tists tell us little , but we can often guess back of their paraphernalia of labels if we will but hearken to the music .

		The little theatre is not an end in itself , but a means to an end .

		Its influence upon both stage - craft and playwriting must be sought not di - rectly , but indirectly ; and yet its influence is greater than any of its accomplishments .

		What the little theatre does counts for less than what it prompts others to do .

		It is as a school for future American dramatists that the little-the - atre movement has literary significance .

		And there is great need for such a practical training-school .

		It is a truism that the the - atrical business puts a premium on experience in play-making .

		The American public is notori - ously conservative in its dramatic tastes , and play-production in
America	LOCATION	is very costly .

		Every instinct of the commercial manager shrinks from the new dramatist or the play with new dramatic ideas .

		Both have been welcomed by the little theatres .

		This gives a special interest to the new American one-act plays .

		Some of them we find are plays of real value ; all of them we must search scrupulously for promises of bigger work to come .

		Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	is one of our most experienced makers of short plays .

		He began to write them before there were any little theatres , and he has profited more than any other American play - wright by little-theatre production of his work .

		Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	has had his training , but , as yet , he shows no desire to be more than a clever writer of timely , well-constructed `` one acters , '' a sort of
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	of the little theatre .

		His very success is the measure of our disappointment .

		No American dramatist handles clever dialogue and tense action more effectively than he does , and his insight into character is incomparably keener than that of the writers of our Broadway suc - cesses .

		His new volume shows growth in Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	, especially in his understanding of the springs of human emotion .

		Of the new series the title play , a fine and effective use of the legend of the angels at the battle of the Marne , is the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 587 best , but he almost duplicates the success of this difficult piece of work in his German version of a similar theme , `` Valkyrie . ''

		Taken together these are the finest dramas the war has inspired in
America	LOCATION	.

		The three remaining plays are in his familiar realistic style , but none are so good as `` Dawn '' or `` According to
Darwin	PERSON	. ''

		`` Moth - ers of Men '' is a fine theme marred by careless characterization ; the thesis of `` those who do not understand the war '' is overdone in the Russian peasants in `` Pawns '' ; `` In the Ravine '' is a capital bit of dramatic journalism , but no more .

		This last is sure to be popular with little-theatre producers , but in each of these three realistic sketches there is that same ultra-time - liness , that Sunday-supplement appeal to to-day 's interest , that has inspired our seasonal succession of crook plays , children 's home comedies , and trench melodramas .

		Next to their obsession of timeliness our pop - ular playwrights have suffered most from mis - taking clap-trap for constructive action .

		The strict limitations of the short play force a dram - atist to learn technique , and the value of such a training is emphasized by the good construction of the three one-act plays that were first pro- duced by the
Washington	LOCATION	Square Players .

		There are , however , other promising qualities in these plays .

		`` Another Way Out '' reveals
Lawrence Langner	PERSON	as a young man of wit and good sense , an adroit writer , a shrewd observer .

		In this play he has achieved the almost-impossible , a shock - ingly moral burlesque in English , a play with a violently risque situation without any nastiness .

		Mr.
Langner	PERSON	has qualifications to make him a keen dramatic satirist .

		`` Trifles '' is a well-con - sidered and finely executed study of the dreary life of a farm wife , quite the best thing on this distinctively American theme done by an Amer - ican dramatist .

		It shows
Susan Glaspell	PERSON	to be a careful analyst of feminine character with the ability quickly and surely to interpret her studies in dramatic form .

		One can not doubt that she can do a lifelike portrait on a larger can - vas .

		When I saw the
Washington Square Play	LOCATION	- ers in
Bosworth Crocker	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Last Straw , '' I was not convinced that the heckling of the neighbors over his accidental killing of a stray cat would drive
Friedrich Bauer	PERSON	to commit sui - side , and a careful reading of the play does not remove this impression .

		Mr.
Crocker	PERSON	deliber - ately tried to make good his thesis of the force of public opinion by means of extremely trivial incidents compressed into one short act .

		He only just failed in this ambitious task , but the fine courage to come to grips with difficult dra - matic problems is not a fault .

		As in the work of the two other
Washington Square	LOCATION	playwrights , there is a promise for the future in his work .

		The promise in the plays of
Harriet Holmes Haslett	PERSON	is not so clearly spoken .

		Her people are types rather than individuals ; her plots are more commonplace ; her action is too often switched by mere chance ; her thought is less ma - ture .

		She has , however , dexterity in dialogue and has learned to manipulate stage business .

		A couple of her plays notably `` Modern Men - age '' and `` When Love is Blind '' should at - tract the attention of little-theatre producers .

		These authors , whose one-act plays we have been considering , are doing work typical of a number of young American playwrights who are at school in the little theatres .

Philip Moeller	PERSON	,
Mary MacMillan	PERSON	,
Alice Gerstenberg	PERSON	,
Edward Massey	PERSON	, and
Stuart Walker	PERSON	, to name but a few that come readily to mind , are all promising scholars .

		Already two have been graduated from one-act pieces to long plays that have been pro- duced by commercial managers ; others are sure to follow them .

		Already and this is significant , though till now the plays have come from abroad there is an increasing tendency on the part of the little theatres themselves to stage long plays .

		These are steps forward , for however important the influence of the little theatre , the stage is for all the populace , not the intelligentsia alone ; however perfect the one-act play , great drama furnishes a full evening 's entertainment .

		King Coal KING COAL .

		By
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	.

		-LRB- The Mac - millan Co. ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The novel - reader who chances to appreciate a really novel design in a work of fiction will like `` King Coal '' both for its originality and its independence .

		A story of the oppressive law - lessness of American democracy , the book will have , for everyone interested in that great sub - ject , the suspense of `` a march in the ranks , hard-prest , and the road unknown . ''

		To have made this theme , which is , in the re - viewer 's opinion , the most important internal 588 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	question before our country , the subject of a novel , is in itself a first-rate stroke of originality .

		It may be objected that the legitimate field of the novel is not the presentation of a great social theme , but individual human characterization .

		But if `` King Coal '' must be said to be almost destitute of the faculty of individual human char - acterization , it has nevertheless a species of `` hu - man interest '' impossible for any other prose form to convey .

		This interest is the fascination of learning from page to page what will happen next about the law-breaking oppressions charac - terizing the unorganized American coal-mining camps which are the scene of the hero 's adven - tures .

		What happens to him as an individual is comparatively unimportant to you except as it affects his achievement for the progress of the `` sober-suited freedom , '' the clear ideal of human order and liberty , whose presence is the distinc - tion of the book .

		The son of a coal magnate , a young college graduate , engaged to a standardized magazine - fiction debutante ,
Hal Warner	PERSON	goes to work as a miner , `` for the experience , '' on a coal property in the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		He wishes to learn for himself the truth of what has been said about the western coal camps .

		In his revolt at learn - ing authentically of their tyrannies , he proceeds from a considerable conservatism , along the trail of an unavailing attempt to secure enforcement of the law against the anarchies of the coal com - pany , until he comes out on the road of union - organization .

		On this trail and this road he forms the acquaintance of the daughter of a miner ,
Mary Burke	PERSON	, `` a Celtic Madonna , '' less markedly unlife - like than the debutante , but not for me exactly real .

		The author tries to persuade us that the fact that the hero loves both Mary and
Jessie	PERSON	-LRB- the debutante -RRB- is a matter of some importance in his career .

		But I can not care whether it is Mary or
Jessie	PERSON	that he prefers , or bring myself to believe that this preference is of the least signifi - cance either to
Hal Warner	PERSON	or to his author , scarcely to
Jessie	PERSON	or Mary .

		It is a mere minority report brought in to comply with the Rules of Order for the conduct of novels .

		Interesting and stirring as an active committee man , as one bewildered in a dual love ,
Hal Warner	PERSON	is of a dreadful dreariness .

		You long to hurry him on his way through his mechanical and argumenta - tive love scenes , and off to the more subtly under - stood and impassioned concerns of his excellent committee meetings .

		But in spite of the strange unlifelikeness of
Mary and Jessie	PERSON	, and of all the wealthy sur - rounding her , there is in the description of the hero 's adventures of sentiment with women an individual tone of frankness and decency , an adult and responsible tone , which is both socially superior and independent .

		In his sympathetic and sincere pictures of workmen 's families , ren - dered with no `` intimist '' talent , but with an excellent solid grasp of economic and industrial fortunes , Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	excels .

		The Italian Minettis , the Raffertys , the Burkes , the
Welsh Davids	PERSON	, the rank and file of the hero 's mining - town acquaintance , are all admirably identified , without dialectic exaggerations , all real and interesting .

		The mine disaster is a wonderful and moving panorama ; and the whole tale of
Hal	PERSON	's attempts to strike some spark of justice from the con - stituted authorities is capital .

		When some of the more conservative of our envoys returned from
Russia	LOCATION	the other day , and told us that there had been less violence in the whole course of the Russian Revolution than we experience in this country in a single week , they brought home to us a much-needed truth concerning our barbarity .

		The most signal achievement of `` King Coal '' is the impression it leaves of our wretched social irresponsibility , our American cowardice in facing gross disorders and human cruelties inside our own nation .

		What is to be done about our gross dis - orders and human cruelties then ?

		The mortal fortunes of the book end in a vista , with the hero 's advance down a discouraging and apparently endless road , which still leads ahead .

		This open ending appears to me significantly true to nature and history .

		The philosophy of the book , however , seems to end in the postscript , with a predetermined sign - post in the form of a statement that `` citizens and workers ... will find that they have neither peace nor freedom , until they have abolished the system of production for profit . ''

		Maybe this abolition will bring peace and freedom .

		But its interpolation here appears sudden , illogical , and unrelated .

		As though we had been told that all these difficulties we have read about would be removed if we would encourage the acquisition of land for public playgrounds , or would work for single tax , or were advised to find general direc - tions for the advance of all civilization on any other good , sound plank removed from any other excellent social platform .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 589 To a mere middle-class believer in our almost untried and varied experiment in democracy this socialistic statement closes over the book 's horizon with the effect of a limitation , remote but dark - ening .

		It may serve to indicate what is indeed for me the limitation of the book its tendency to predetermination , its lack of curiosity and interest in keen ascertainments and differentia - tions , its apparent belief in formulas .

		Thus one early perceives that the poor of the volume are predestined to possess extraordinary mental and moral superiorities ; and those of better financial fortunes , a striking mental and moral flaccidity .

		As in the theory of
Ernest Pontifex	PERSON	in `` The Way of All Flesh , '' `` the poor are all , lovely . ''

		Scarcely any of the low-minded are to be dis - cerned among them ; and among those below a certain grade of income violence is virtually un - known or always restrained .

		On the other hand , with the exception of
Hal	PERSON	, all the citizens above a certain grade of income are presented with anatomies and human natural histories no more convincing than those of the millionaires in clothes covered with dollar signs in the cartoons .

		The employers present a solid front of low - mindedness and bullying brainlessness .

		Just as to the narrow Edward all miners are agitators , and as in Zola 's consoling and agreeable `` L'CEuvre , '' such artists as are not realists or impressionists are boldly represented as physically ill-favored or degenerate , so the entire army of employers appearing in `` King Coal '' is composed of the frivolous , the dishonest , and the murder - ous .

		While the scope of the book is specifically limited to the unorganized field , yet , by inference , the coal-operators who have kept organization pacts at heavy financial sacrifices for a generation , and all employers , indeed , are lumped together in one indistinguishable mass with those who have stuffed ballot-boxes and entrained machine - guns against their compatriots .

		The author 's socialism would have been more persuasive if his characters had been conceived somewhat more in the spirit of granting them equal opportunities .

		If , as
George Meredith	PERSON	tells us , `` the soul 's one road is forwards , '' it must appear that all exaggeration of class prejudices against the light of truth is but a darkening and a delaying on the way .

		Yet when this is said , the novel remains an interesting and valuable record of the adven - ture of a soul on that forward road of justice which leads around the world and into a future unknown .

		The war books that are flooding in upon us should , in one respect , give hope to the peace - lovers who are almost ready to despair of the world 's regeneration ; for they shatter the great illusion that to live in the midst of hardship and horror , with death constantly at one 's shoulder , necessarily does things to one 's soul .

		`` Men come out of it changed , '' the idealists say .

		But , as a matter of fact , nine-tenths of the men who go into battle , as nine-tenths of the war books bear witness , are men of normal , not over - refined sensibilities , who , on the surface at least , accept war and its horrors as all in the day 's work , and will come home , if they are fortunate , to take up their tasks where they left off , ap - parently in the same manner as before .

		Only those born with the capacity for profound spirit - ual reactions get profound spiritual reactions out of war .

		Many grow and many are stunted ; but only a few reach the heights and depths .

		And that , perhaps , is lucky .

		All of which is by way of saying that the reader need look for nothing more or less than journalistic reports of occurrences in `` At the Front in a Flivver '' and `` With Cavalry in the Great War . ''

		The former book , a diary kept for the writer 's family , is the more freshly writ - ten of the two .

		The most interesting features of the latter are its explanations of the causes of events that are now history .

		Though neither book can be classed with the best popular writ - ings on the war
Guy Empey	ORGANIZATION	's famous volume and the writings of
Captain Beith	LOCATION	and
James Norman Hall	PERSON	they have , of course , as almost all war books have , a documental value for the reader who is interested in life `` over there . ''

		The purpose of `` How to Live at the Front , '' as its title indicates , is different from that of most war books .

		The volume is intended for the information , not of those who are to stay at home , but for those who are going into the trenches .

		It should prove to be of genuine value to nine out of ten of the men who are serving with our
Expeditionary Forces	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		Writ - ten without pretension , it is reminiscent of the matter-of-fact advice of an elder brother who has seen the world to a younger brother who has not .

		With not the least suggestion of cant , it presents some aids to an understanding of Eng - lish and French idiosyncrasies , the need for dis - cipline , ways and means of adjustment to the 590 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	inconveniences of trench life , the signs by which the growing curse of
Europe	LOCATION	, the prostitute , may be recognized and avoided , a man 's own war - troubled soul .

		It is not a book that goes to the roots of things , or tries to .

		It is just a healthy - minded , simple , religious man 's wholesome reac - tion to the by-products of war .

		As such , it is likely to prove a prop to many a boy ready to go to pieces under the burden of the unforeseen and the unexpected .

		THE DWELLING HOUSES OF
CHARLESTON	LOCATION	,
SOUTH CAROLINA	LOCATION	.

		By
Alice R. Hugher Smith	PERSON	and
D. E. Hugher Smith	PERSON	.

		Lippin - cott ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		Any work is important which essays to pre - serve a record historical , descriptive , graphic , photographic of our fast vanishing Colonial architecture , for that architecture constitutes the only unified and dignified manifestation of the building impulse which our young civilization has to show .

		In this sense , at least , the `` Dwelling Houses of
Charleston	LOCATION	'' is important , for it presents , in sufficient fulness of detail , a phase of the
Georg	PERSON	- ian mode translated to our shores with interest - ing variations developed from the social and climatic conditions of the little old proud south - ern capital by the sea .

		The book has evidently been compiled with care , it contains drawings and documents of great interest , yet somehow it conveys a sense of opportunities unfulfilled , of curiosities unrewarded .

		This is because it is not so intelligent and authoritative architecturally as it is historically .

		However valuable it may be to the student of Colonial history , however treasured it may become to the First Families of
Charleston	LOCATION	, it offers scant fare to one interested in our architectural beginnings .

		No critical estimate , no discrimi - nating valuation , no tracing of development , has been attempted : one is left to glean what one can from a few measured drawings , a somewhat larger number of photographic half-tones , and a superabundance of rather messy pencil sketches which are quite worthless from any other stand - point than the vaguely picturesque .

		Here , one feels , is a great deal of good archi - tectural material indifferently presented .

		Aside from the seven pages of drawings of ironwork , which are indeed precious , and a few mantels and stairways , the book contains little to entitle it to a place on the shelves of a purely architec - tural library .

		The southern Colonial work follows its Eng - lish prototypes more slavishly in the matter of detail than does that of
New England	LOCATION	.

		There is little of the freedom , lightness , grace , which makes the entrances of old Salem so attractive , conveying the sense that these builders bettered their instruction as was indeed the case .

		On the other hand , the southern mansions exhibit , in general , a finer sense of composition and mass .

		Their amplitude and solidity , their cool , high porticoes , their many and massive chimneys , contribute to an effect of large means , abundant leisure , and rich , ripe social life , compared with which the Puritanism of
New England	LOCATION	, as expressed in even her best houses , seems some - what hard and cold and thin .

		The particular features of the
Charleston	LOCATION	houses which differentiate them most , and call for special comment , are their two-storied porti - coes a difficult thing to treat , as every architect knows , and here superbly handled ; their garden walls and fences pierced by truly noble gates , of a highly localized type ; and their iron balconies , which savor more of Latin than of Anglo-Saxon origin , yet have a certain note of primness quite different from the loose luxuriance of
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The vicissitudes of civil war and the ebbing tide of commerce have contributed to isolate and preserve in these old houses a record of that moment in our past which expresses itself in beauty .

		Since then the idea of power has obsessed us , and it has written itself in ugliness over all the land .

		Is it too much to hope that after the world has been made safe for democracy , we may set ourselves the task of translating power into beauty ?

		Every record , like this one , of the old urbanity , will then possess an interest and a value far greater than any interest or value we can assign to it to-day .

		THE SUPERNATURAL IN MODERN ENG - LISH FICTION .

		By
Dorothy Scarborough	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		If industry is a virtue , the author of `` The Supernatural in Modern English Fiction '' should find a ready welcome to the `` best families '' in the society of heaven .

		Dr.
Scarborough	PERSON	, if a cursory counting of her index is any estimate of her reading in preparing this book , has no less than
1200	DATE	titles to her credit .

		Everything from
Hamlet	LOCATION	to
O. Henry	PERSON	, from
Walpole	LOCATION	's `` The Castle of
Otranto	LOCATION	'' to Patience Worth 's literature via the ouija board , from the sublimity of
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	's tragic situation to the ridiculousness of
Frank Stockton	PERSON	's `` The Transferred Ghost '' has been read , summarized , card-indexed , and then strung together .

		Page after page of condensed ghost - plot is spread before the awed and stupefied reader .

		There is no comment to speak of , no relieving humor , only plots , plots , plots of ghost stories .

		The volume might act as a guide to a class of light -LRB- or heavy ? -RRB-

		literature : look up the plot of any ghost story written in the
last 1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 591 150 years -LRB- and a few before -RRB- , decide whether or not you 'd like the tale , and so choose your story .

		Dr.
Scarborough	PERSON	seems to be the victim of an idee fixe ; she must have devoted years and years to taking notes on every phase of the supernat - ural in fiction .

		Ghosts are classified under every conceivable category .

		There are ghosts that wear clothes , and , though few , there are ghosts that have been known to appear nude ; there are dis - membered ghosts , crippled ghosts , and mutilated ghosts ; there are ghosts that carry their heads in their hands , and ghosts which , like certain people , lose their heads .

		Ghosts are as a rule well behaved and , until recently , serious and grave .

		They are however in contemporary lit - erature beginning to be frivolous and inclined to superficiality .

		Dr.
Scarborough	PERSON	has attempted to deal at least by way of mention with every ghost manifestation in literature , and her volume is testimony to her sense of thoroughness .

		If any proof of the supernatural in literature is needed , it is found in the amount of reading and cata - loguing she herself has done .

		It must be a relief to have the thing off her mind , but the reviewer can not quash a feeling of pity for the hypo - thetical reader who will not have the relief of writing a review of the book .

		THE FUTURE OF
CONSTANTINOPLE	LOCATION	.

		By
Leonard S. Woolf	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		`` Constantinople and the narrow straits upon which it stands , '' says Mr.
Woolf	PERSON	, `` have occa - sioned the world more trouble , have cost human - ity more in blood and suffering during the last five hundred years , than any other single spot upon the earth ... It is not improbable that when
Europe	LOCATION	in her last ditch has fought the last battle of the Great War , we shall find that what we have again been fighting about is really Con - stantinople . ''

		In his little book Mr.
Woolf	PERSON	makes analysis of the reasons why the Turkish capital has been so productive of international unrest , and brings forward interesting proposals looking to the removal of these causes .

		His main contention is that , having vainly sought for three or four hundred years to solve the eastern ques - tion through arrangements which leave
Constan	PERSON	- tinople under the domination of a single state , to be used by that state exclusively in its own interests , the world should take advantage of the forthcoming reorganization of
Europe	LOCATION	to follow out the suggestion of
Sir Edward Pears	ORGANIZATION	and oth - ers that the city , the straits , and a narrow strip of territory on either side of them be internation - alized .

		This would mean the removal of the Turkish capital to Asiatic soil and the setting up in the vacated city of an international organ of govern - ment charged with the maintenance of law and order and the administration of such rules for times of both peace and war as the nations might prescribe .

		A good precedent is found in the inter - nationalization of the Danube under the treaty of
1856	DATE	, and it is urged that by the proposed arrangement no nation would lose any vital and legitimate interest .

		The governing commission should be wholly disinterested , and might very well consist of three members one from Den - mark , one from
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and one from the
United States	LOCATION	chosen by the signatory powers from lists of five nominated by these several nations .

		Mr.
Woolf	PERSON	feels that the finality of the present war will depend in no small degree on the decision concerning
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		If this strategic spot is neutralized , every nation will be protected from aggression ; if left in the hands of any single state , half of the world must always be in fear of aggression .

		There is much to bear out this contention ; although one can not repress the feeling that the author undervalues the diffi - culty of carrying out his plan .

		JAPAN DAY BY DAY .

		By
Edward S. Morse	PERSON	.

		2 vols .


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 8	MONEY	.

		The country life of the Japanese people as it was , and still is to-day in many localities un - spoiled by town and factory , is recorded in Jap - anesque sketches and running text in Professor
Morse	PERSON	's latest and most extensive work on the Land of the Rising Sun .

		The author was pro- fessor of zoology in the New Imperial Univer - sity of
Tokyo	LOCATION	during a very interesting period in the early years of the transformation of
Japan	LOCATION	and witnessed some of the throes of the struggle of occidental and oriental ideals from the van - tage-point of a government official , with an out - look from the capital city .

		It was , however , the daily life of the people , their quaint and curious and clever ways and devices , so differ - ent from our own , and their social customs and industrial methods which most interested him .

		Above all , the life of the country , the town , the fisherman 's village , and the contacts with the rural population along footpath and mountain trail attract him more than the court or the places of trade .

		In the course of his scientific explorations at the seaside and among the an - cient shell mounds , the author had exceptional opportunities to learn at first hand the thou - sand-and-one little customs of these ever-interest - ing and courteous people .

		The book is a narra - tive abstracted from a daily journal .

		It is full of digressions into matters of arts and crafts , industry , agriculture , home and social customs , the sights and sounds of the road and of the crowded street , everything in fact from an earth - quake and a picturesque Japanese fire to street 592 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	signs and festivals , the rearing of crickets , and the training of birds .

		The numerous sketches which are distributed throughout the book are crude but reveal with great fidelity familiar and characteristic Japanese scenes and many a quaint or pleasing glimpse of Japanese life and artistry .

		A COUNTRY CHILD .

		By
Grant Shower	ORGANIZATION	- man .

		Century ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		Never have the sights and sounds , the tastes and smells and tactile sensations of the farm been more realistically presented than in this book .

		Like `` A Country Chronicle , '' which preceded it , this story is told in the first person and repro - duces in the vividest of colors certain scenes and incidents of the author 's boyhood .

		Professor
Showerman	PERSON	is the son of a
Wisconsin	LOCATION	farmer who was one of the pioneer settlers in the
Badger State	LOCATION	; but he has chosen literature rather than agriculture as a calling , probably enjoying the rude farm life better in the imaginative retro - spect than he would in the present reality .

		At any rate , he makes it enjoyable to his readers .

		Here is a bit of homely realism -LRB- the men have just come in to dinner from the field -RRB- : `` My father goes to the sink and washes .

		The others stand near the geraniums until he gets through , and then they wash , too .

		They take water out of the rain-water pail with the dipper , and when they are through they go to the woodshed door with the wash dish and throw the water out .

		Christian makes a great noise blowing and snuf - fing when he is at the sink . ''

		Everything is told in the `` historical present , '' and in the short sen - tences and breathless style of a small boy eager to pour out his information to the first listener .

		Whether in real life he would always have re - lated these momentous happenings in the present tense is doubtful ; but then , in real life he never could have written them out with such an artful imitation of artlessness ; so we yield at the start the whole question of strict verisimilitude .

		A score or more of line drawings by Mr.
George Wright	PERSON	catch in a happy manner the spirit of the narrative .

		OLD SEAPORT TOWNS OF THE SOUTH .

		By
Mildred Cram	PERSON	.

		With drawings by
Allan C. Cram	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		For three years the American traveller has been shut out of the play places of
Europe	LOCATION	, unless he wishes to drive an ambulance or engage in some form of relief work .

		Those who still wish to travel must find new lands , and in consequence
America	LOCATION	is being discovered by its own people .

		The experiences and discoveries of one pair of explorers brother and sister are here related in sprightly detail , and the account is dressed by the publishers in the best product of the printing press .

		It was a case of seeing the South in six weeks or less time , but our travellers managed to `` take in '' fourteen towns of the South At - lantic seaboard and the
Gulf Coast	ORGANIZATION	, beginning with
Baltimore	LOCATION	and stopping at
Galveston	LOCATION	.

		What they found and saw we knew about before , but it is always interesting to observe the reactions of others when they are introduced to a new and strange environment .

		In the
Florida	LOCATION	towns and in
New Orleans	LOCATION	Miss Cram really saw some - thing that most travellers miss that the foreign element is largely Greek in
Florida	LOCATION	, and Italian and Spanish , not predominantly French , in
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Of all the towns visited she is com - pletely satisfied only with
Charleston	LOCATION	, Mobile , and
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and with the unprogressive characteristics of these .

		She makes it plain that the winter is not the best time to see the South , for then it is at its grayest .

		But who wants to go there when the thermometer is above ninety ?

		The historical facts woven into the narrative are at times somewhat mixed ; but the book , as a whole , though unsubstantial and inconsequential , is an interesting and honest account of a new experience , and that is all that can be expected of such publications .

		A HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR .

		Vol .

		II .

		The British Campaign in
France	LOCATION	and Flan - ders ,
1915	DATE	.

		By Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	,
Doran	PERSON	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		This is an important book .

		It bears evidence of much research and has an authoritative tone .

		So far as is possible at this stage , it is real his - tory .

		The author has been at pains to study out the records of the British units in the san - guinary fighting of that terrible period which has been well named the `` year of equilibrium . ''

		The book includes the first detailed description of the second battle of
Ypres	LOCATION	and the great battle of Loos .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	is a true Briton .

		He distrib - utes his praise generously among English ,
Cana	LOCATION	- dians , and Anzacs .

		He sets the crown on regiment after regiment and makes many a refer - ence to the heroic acts of individual officers and men .

		At the same time the power of the enemy is not minimized .

		Throughout the volume one can feel the force and skill of the German units , to which the author gives full credit .

		The effect of the book , in spite of its judicial tone , is depressing .

		The task of the British army in this year seems insuperable as the author unfolds history , and the huge losses , though not described in a gruesome manner , leave the reader with visions of carnage that he can not forget .

		Even the superhuman bravery of British civilian troops as they charge in the face of a fire meas - uring six shells to their one , can not down that terrible image of slaughter .

		Such a work will be
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 593 read with more interest in
England	LOCATION	than in
America	LOCATION	.

		The evolutions of the
Durham Light Infantry	ORGANIZATION	and the
First Royal Irish	ORGANIZATION	will naturally appeal more to those who know them than to us who do not .

		But the book as a whole leaves a powerful impression hardly to be obtained from any other work thus far published .

		The style is easy and clear , the movement well sustained , and there are many stirring descriptions of desperate deeds and unfaltering courage .

		INTERIORA RERUM , or The Inside of Things .

		By
Quivis	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		These meditations , `` de omnibus rebus ct qui - busdam aliis , '' as one might almost characterize them , have to do with certain less familiar aspects of earth and sky , heaven and hell , man and woman , religion and philosophy , literature and art , and almost everything else imaginable .

		They are , in short , delightfully discursive and also thoughtful and penetrating , with a pith and brevity that never fail to save from weariness and often leave a desire for more .

		Here , as a sample , is a pertinent and seasonable reflection : `` It is a standing marvel to men what women will endure , and apparently can endure with impunity , at the dictates of fashion .

		They will wear clothes in cold weather which would cause the death of a man similarly clad . ''

		Woman , with her demonstrated constitution of iron , rep - resents no weaker sex to this author .

		His little book , of whose authorship we know only that it is written by `` whomsoever you will , '' and dealing as it does with `` the inside of things , '' or `` subjects which , as a rule , we refrain from discussing , '' has piquancy and suggestiveness .

		EARLY
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	.

		By
H. M. Lip	PERSON	- pincott .

		Lippincott ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		This is a beautiful piece of book-making .

		The edition is limited and the type already distrib - uted ; hence , if one desires a copy , no time must be lost in making application to the publishers .

		From the quality of the paper , the character of the printing , and the superb illustrations , it may be guessed that the price will be high .

		Now , what of the book itself ?

		There have been other histories of
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia , notably
Scharf	PERSON	's valuable work published in
1884	DATE	, and the leading men of the city have figured in our national biography from the be - ginning .

		But this book endeavors to name and describe all the leading characters and the various social , financial , and patriotic organizations , giving portraits and reproductions of people and places , buildings and bridges and parks , in such a way as to offend none and please all , at least all whose names and interests are included .

		It is a sort of book of heraldry for all the sub - stantial and socially fit of the present day .

		If you are a Philadelphian and have ancestors who counted in the city of
Franklin	LOCATION	, this book will give you name , business , and standing .

		Of course , such a work can not be critical .

		The founders of the
Bank of North America	ORGANIZATION	, of the first insurance company , of the university , were all engaged in work that produced good results and perhaps some bad results as well .

		But there is no word of explanation why , for example , the legislature of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	can - celled the charter of the great bank or why all the directors then set themselves the task of get - ting a new federal government and a charter from that government under which they could continue their business .

		Nor is it stated that nearly all the influential bankers got into the federal convention and there favored , and secured the adoption of , constitutional clauses which would protect charters and contracts against mere state intervention .

		But , as has been said , this sort of explanation was not a part of the author 's purpose and consequently some excel - lent opportunities have been overlooked .

		FOUR ESSAYS .

		By
Murray Anthony Potter	ORGANIZATION	.


Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		There are two distinctly different , and per - haps opposed , reactions possible to these essays of Mr.
Potter	PERSON	's : that of the scholar , and that of the layman .

		The scholar will , no doubt , be interested in Mr.
Potter	PERSON	's knowledge of the the - ories concerning
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's life the existence or non-existence of a flesh and blood
Laura	PERSON	, the interpretation of the sonnets and other works as autobiographical or not ; and he will be still more interested in Mr.
Potter	PERSON	's attitude toward these problems and his conclusions .

		The layman will wish to get from the essays a living knowledge of Petrarch the author , Petrarch the man , and Petrarch the critic and reader .

		To the layman it would seem that both may be comfortably satisfied ; the essays are suffi - ciently bristly with scholars ' names , their hypoth - eses , and their controversies , to suggest that no one but a
Dryasdust	ORGANIZATION	will be disappointed .

		And the layman finds Petrarch living and ap - pealing in spite of the foreign matter .

		Petrarch turns out to have been a human being and not an excuse for a Ph. D. thesis .

		He was egotisti - cal , but he was so much like the average man as to be ludicrously conceited ; he had no more idea of the relative merit and value of his various works , as expressions of the human soul , than have a great many of his well-meaning students .

		He loved and hated madly , and the fact that he never considered the sonnets to
Laura	LOCATION	as a passport to immortality is the strongest proof of their autobiographical importance .

		He wrote 594 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	intensely personal , self-satisfied letters to inti - mate friends ; he often thought he knew it all ; and he disliked having to acknowledge that he was wrong .

		But , and here his greatness glows through , he would do so if the evidence was convincing .

		It appears that he was jealous of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and that he thought the latter pandered to public taste , contrived for fame , writing poetry in the vernacular !

		Altogether Mr. Pot - ter 's essays , the outcome of a life 's study , breathe a contemporaneousness satisfying to the uniniti - ated .

		BALFOUR ,
VIVIANI	PERSON	AND JOFFRE .

		Edited by
Francis W. Halsey	PERSON	.


Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` You have kept your ancient traditions ; your past glory is ever present in your hearts , you have love , and affection , and admiration for civilization and humanity .

		You have an idealism which floats above your flag , and that idealism you place above your material interests '' these words , spoken by
M. Viviani	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	, might serve as an epitome of the book , ``
Balfour	LOCATION	,
Viviani	PERSON	and Joffre . ''

		Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	's collection of the speeches of the commissioners is a useful work of reference rather than a readable book , for one must grant that the average of eloquence , despite the frequent `` lift '' in
M. Viviani	PERSON	's addresses , is low , while the passages that are insignificant and that duplicate one another are very numerous indeed .

		Possibly the main reason for the rela - tive mediocrity of these speeches is the nature of the task confronting the commissioners .

		So much at least is certain : they were not here to make memorable orations .

		The editor has linked the speeches with narrative and descriptive comment drawn chiefly from the newspapers of the day and reproducing the hectic exuberance of the daily press comment not without its value when one considers how fast the contemporary news - papers decay physically .

		RICHARD CUMBERLAND : His LIFE AND DRAMATIC WORKS .

		By
Stanley Thomas Williams	PERSON	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The activities of
Richard Cumberland	LOCATION	were many .

		He was at one time private secretary to Lord
Halifax	LOCATION	; at another time he was entrusted , with disastrous results to himself , with an ambas - sadorship to
Spain	LOCATION	; and sooner or later he tried his hand at nearly all kinds of writing .

		He wrote essays , an epic poem , novels imitative of Fielding , numerous plays , and a volume of memoirs which , though intended only as a pot - boiler , has become his best-known work .

		The plays gave him his chief contemporary fame .

		They are of varied types .

		He early struck his right vein , the sentimental comedy ; virtue in dis - tress transformed by a theatrical coup into virtue triumphant was exactly to his liking .

		More - over , as a grandson of
Richard Bentley	PERSON	, a Cam - bridge graduate , and a man of social standing , he brought to the composition of this kind of drama certain qualities which
Hugh Kelly	PERSON	and other rivals lacked .

		Of these qualities the power to write well-bred and graceful dialogue \ vas foremost .

		But the feverish ambition of Cum - berland drove him to undertake operas , adapta - tions , tragedies , and what not , and sometimes to filch from other writers .

		And just as he frit - tered away his strength in hopeless undertakings , so did he by his exacting temperament alienate people who had been useful to him .

		He was in some ways really noble , yet querulous , sensitive , irritable , vain .

		He quarreled openly or was seri - ously at outs with
Garrick	PERSON	,
Sheridan	PERSON	,
Fanny Burney	PERSON	,
Walpole	LOCATION	, and nearly everybody else .

		Sheridan pilloried him in `` The Critic , '' as Sir Fretful Plagiary .

		With
Boswell	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	,
John	PERSON	- son , and Romney , however , he remained on good terms .

		Though reduced to poverty and disap - pointment , he lived well into the nineteenth cen - tury and became a friend of
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	.

		Just before the dawn of the century , his powers in sentimental comedy revived , and `` The Jew '' and `` The Wheel of Fortune '' of this period fairly matched `` The West Indian '' at the beginning of the seventies .

		Dr.
Williams	PERSON	has done his work thoroughly and given us a useful volume .

		BRITAIN IN ARMS -LRB- L'Effort Britannique -RRB- .

		By
Jules Destree	PERSON	.

		With a preface by
Georges Clemen	PERSON	< ; eau .

		Translated by
J. Lewis	PERSON
May	DATE	.

		Lane ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In
1915	DATE	, when
Italy	LOCATION	was wavering between war and continued neutrality , the Belgian jour - nalist
Jules Destree	PERSON	visited the kingdom , explained with new force the position which his own country occupied in the struggle , and wielded strong influence in behalf of the event - ual declaration of hostilities .

		Finding later that the great effort which
England	LOCATION	was making wa < imperfectly understood south of the Alps , he wrote a book in Italian , telling something of that effort .

		The work was shortly brought out in French , and now it appears in English , under the less colorful title , ``
Britain	LOCATION	in
Anns	PERSON	. ''

		The book , by the author 's confession , was hurriedly written ; it is propagandist ; but its laudable object is to fortify international confidence as `` a preparation for the better days to come '' ; and it makes inspir - ing reading .

		In his opening chapter M. Destree tells , from the documents , the now familiar story of
Great Britain	LOCATION	's labors for peace during the `` Twelve Days , '' and shows that the country , despite its utter lack of preparation , was compelled to take
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 595 up arms not only by deep considerations of honor , but in defence of vital interests .

		The nation 's effort is then described under three main heads : naval , military , and financial .

		Naval effort is discussed in such a manner as to show mainly two things the tremendous effect of the bot - tling up of the German fleet and the reasons why the British fleet does not force the latter to fight by invading the harbors and waters in which it lies hiding .

		The evolution of the `` contemptible little army , '' through the anxious days of the volun - teer system and of the installation of conscrip - tion , into the splendid fighting forces of Sir
Douglas Haig	PERSON	, is forcefully related .

		And the country 's financial expedients and sacrifices are adequately sketched .

		A final chapter emphasizes , with copious citations of incident and quotations from statesmen of the day ,
Britain	LOCATION	's benevolent purposes in the war and her determination to prosecute the struggle to a successful end .

		The country is not likely to move quickly enough to suit Gallic impatience .

		She seems painfully slow to understand a situation and to make up her mind .

		But for these very reasons , when her mind is once made up , her steadfastness can be relied upon as can that of few other nations .

		`` We may make mistakes , '' says
Lloyd George	PERSON	, `` but we do not give in . ''

		In the knowledge of this fact , concludes
M. Destree	PERSON	,
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and their co-belligerents may , and do , find deep consolation in their darkest hours .

		THE POEMS OF
EDGAR ALLAN POE	PERSON	.

		Ed - ited by
Killis Campbell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ginn ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		One need not accept all Professor Camp - bell 's judgments in detail to pronounce this new edition of the `` Poems '' the most important con - tribution to Poe scholarship that has appeared for some years .

		Perhaps the greatest merit of the book is its sobriety and sanity a trait that will be best appreciated by those who have had most to do with other discussions of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor has made wise use of his predecessors , to whom he punctiliously acknowledges his indebt - edness , but he has adopted none of their preju - dices and pet theories , and more strangely he seems to have few pet theories of his own .

		The brief sketch of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's life is as nearly free from a priori assumptions and as nearly judicial as a biography of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	well can be .

		In the section of `` The Canon of Poe 's Poems '' Professor Camp - bell treats a subject on which he has made valu - able researches ; and his brief comments on the poems doubtfully attributed to Poe are admir - able .

		Other sections of the introduction that are of especial value are those on `` Poe 's Pas - sion for Revising His Text '' and `` Poe 's In - debtedness to Other Poets . ''

		The former contains acute comments on the merits and demerits of many of the changes , and the reasons that in - duced Poe to make them .

		The resume of opin - ion in `` The Clash of the Critics with Respect to Poe 's Poems , '' though brief , is excellently pre - sented .

		In the body of the book the variorum forms of the text are placed at the bottom of each page , and are more conveniently arranged than in
Harrison	LOCATION	's
Virginia	LOCATION	edition .

		They also include a few readings unknown to
Harrison	PERSON	, among them those of the `` Richmond Examiner '' proof sheets .

		The notes , like the introduction , are sensible , terse , and inclusive .

		The appendix contains collations of the editions of the poems published in the author 's lifetime , and his pref - aces and prefatory notices .

		The frontispiece , a reproduction of a cut from ``
Graham	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine '' based on a painting by
A. C. Smith	PERSON	, is interesting , but is hardly the portrait to choose if but one is to be given .

		THE OLD WORLD THROUGH OLD EYES .

		Three Years in
Oriental Lands	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Mary S. Ware	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		It is for the entertainment of her grandchil - dren , Mrs.
Ware	PERSON	tells us , that she has collected and published her travel letters covering the three years from
August , 1912	DATE	to
July , 1915	DATE	, and every cent of profit from the sale of the book is to go to French hospitals during the war and to blinded French soldiers afterward , should there be any profits accruing when the war closes .

		A courageous and independent tourist , despite her years , Mrs.
Ware	PERSON	went around the world unaccompanied , visiting
Honolulu	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Siam	LOCATION	,
Sumatra	LOCATION	,
Java	LOCATION	,
the Philippines	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and other eastern lands .

		She returned by way of
Italy	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and of course has much to say about the war in her later letters .

		A chance re - mark from a German fellow-traveller eighteen months before the fatal
August , 1914	DATE	, is sig - nificant in the light of subsequent events .

		`` The gentleman said the Kaiser believed himself Em - peror by divine right , was a romanticist in politics , and he , the speaker , was afraid the country would go to ruin under this intolerable regime . ''

		Not confining herself to the usual themes of travel narratives , the writer shows an interest in colonization problems and the govern - ment of primitive peoples by the more advanced nations .

		Four native courts of
India	LOCATION	received her as a guest , and she had interviews with vari - ous rulers and chieftains .

		She is evidently a woman of strong character and trained intellect as well as large heart , and her book has more of character and individuality than would be found in most collections of family letters from abroad .


5 %	PERCENT	THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE .

		Its Past Record , Present Condition , and Po - tential Relation to the New World Era .

		By
Daniel C. Roper	PERSON	.


Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Roper	PERSON	, who writes with the authority of four years ' experience as first assistant postmaster general -LRB- 1913-16 -RRB- , opens his introduction with the assertion that `` the mightiest implement of human democracy is postal service '' just as a writer on universal suffrage might , naturally enough , begin with declaring the mightiest imple - ment of human democracy to be the ballot , or a writer on education might plausibly maintain this mightiest implement to be the public-school sys - tem .

		What the mightiest implement of animal democracy or of vegetable democracy is , we are not told by Mr.
Roper	PERSON	.

		His enthusiasm for his subject promises a good book , and the promise is fulfilled .

		Especially interesting are the chapters on the workings of the various departments of our postal service , as also the account of certain significant differences between our own system and those of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		A chapter entitled `` Postal Perspective '' presents a suggestive vista of pos - sible future developments in our post-office de - partment .

		Mr.
Roper	PERSON	believes that `` the parcel post undoubtedly has already had some effect on the cost of living , '' by bringing farm produce more directly to the table , `` and is destined to exercise more . ''

		But the hoped-for results in this particular have by no means been realized , and are not yet in sight .

		INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY .

		By
Emory S. Bogardus	PERSON	.


University of Southern Cali	ORGANIZATION	- fornia Press ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		To understand society is to know the factors which bring people together in human associa - tion .

		Such is the underlying idea of this latest contribution to social analysis .

		Professor Bo - gardus , however , is not content merely with a static view of the social world .

		Desiring to know under what conditions we can promote social progress , he presents the fundamentals of sociology from the standpoint of the various in - fluences in particular the geographic , biological , hygienic , recreational , economic , political , aes - thetic , intellectual , ethical , and associational fac - tors operating upon man in his collective life .

		In many respects this viewpoint reflects the teachings of Professor Small .

		The advantage of Professor
Bogardus	PERSON	's method is that it brings to bear in a simple , elementary way a great mass of pertinent facts regarding the community as - pects of health , recreation , industry , the home , the state , and man 's various other social-contact interests , which must be understood if one is to live intelligently in his world .

		NOTES ox NEW FICTION This second novel of ``
Henry Handel Rich	PERSON	- ardson , '' `` The Fortunes of
Richard Mahoney	PERSON	'' -LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , has been so warmly admired that one is surprised to find it so much a mere work - manlike , conventional effort , with an aggressively mid-Victorian hero .

		What are we to think of this young Irish medical student , turned adventurer and shopkeeper in the Australian gold fields , to whom crises bring `` the difficulty of recon - ciling the divine benevolence with a cruel deed , the falling back once more on the trite admis - sion of man 's impotence '' ?

		Or who asks ques - tions like these , `` Was it straining a point to see in the whole affair the workings of a Power outside himself ? ''

		How are we to enjoy a hero who , in contemplating a beautiful young mother and child , thinks , `` No place this for the scoffer !

		Were they not in the presence of one of life 's sublimest mysteries that of motherhood ! ''

		and on thrilling at the idea of `` little
Polly	PERSON	as the mother of his children '' decides that after all `` there was a design in creation '' ?

		So
Tenny	PERSON	- sonian a young man is a little difficult to assimi -
late to-day	DATE	, particularly when we are given such gestures as his admiration for `` the splendid vital - ity of the most popular cleric in the diocese of
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		No sickbed was too remote for him to reach , no sinner sunk too low to be helped to his feet . ''

		Yes , ``
Henry Handel Richardson	PERSON	, '' who is said to have written a remarkable novel about the German music-student world , actually says such things about
Richard Mahoney	PERSON	.

		Moreover , bored with his storekeeping in crude
Ballarat	ORGANIZATION	, the hero marries as pure and virtuous and inno - cent and docile a maiden as ever charmed a mid - Victorian reader .

		To her `` his lightest wish was a command , '' and their lives are arranged by him according to the divine plan of masculine supremacy .

		He says to her things like this , `` I trust my little woman will never put such a ridiculous object on her head , '' with reference to a flouncy hat with which a neighboring vulgar female had falsely adorned herself .

		When a light-headed protege makes love to
Polly	LOCATION	,
Richard	PERSON	has all the correct and outraged reactions of the man of property .

		When he begins to find life stagnant in
Australia	LOCATION	and thinks of setting out uncharted to begin life again at home , it is the Deity and not at all Polly whom he consults .

		As a picture of the commonplace colonialism of the fatuously masterful young Englishman , who veils his egoism in noble emotions and religious cant , the book would be fairly signifi - cant .

		As a satire , in historical perspective , on the pedestrian soul of the mid-Victorian young gentle - man , it would be fairly amusing .

		But its author is not satirical .

		She endows
Richard Mahoney	PERSON	1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 597 with no qualities above middle-class mediocrity , and then treats him rather lovingly and seriously .

		There are in the book admirable descriptions of the rough pioneer life .

		But the naive middle - class saturation of her own attitude , without irony or lift , keeps the book as a whole distinctly below the level of literary art .

		There seems to be a kind of tempo or rhythm - of - the - whole in books , just as there is , more dis - tinctly , in plays and music .

		Sometimes the tempo synchronizes very nicely with the mental pulse of the reader sometimes it syncopates .

		This reader , at least , and
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	's `` No. 13 Rue du Bon Diable '' -LRB-
Houghton Mif	ORGANIZATION	- flin ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- form an admirable example of syn - chronization .

		The reader felt no desire to race ahead of the book , nor did the book incline to pass the reader on the track .

		Which is saying much for a detective story .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's detective story is unusual in many ways .

		There are actually human char - acters in it , and a swiftly woven texture of mo - tives , and charming bits of color , local and otherwise ; a love story that is not sentimental ; and most unusual of all , a murder committed be - fore our very eyes so that we know from the beginning who the murderer is , and are able to follow with appreciation , and no less intensity of interest , the work of a French detective whose success is based on neither luck nor cocaine nor marvelous scientific machinery .

		A display of knowledge on matters typo - graphic is a vanity peculiar , let us hope , to a strictly past generation of reviewers , but it is not out of place to state that in the make-up of the present volume there is displayed a feeling for the quality of the text that is seldom found in any but the more expensive books .

		The type , binding , preliminary pages , even the margins and running heads , are characteristic of the better class of French novels , and American novels of twenty years ago .

		There is perhaps no one in spirit land who would find so cordial a hearing as
Mark Twain	PERSON	, if he were to send a message back to us .

		But the
Mark Twain	PERSON	of ``
Jap Herron	PERSON	, '' the novel written from the ouija board -LRB-
Mitchell Kenner	PERSON	- ley ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is not the real
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		He is a pitiful shade , yearning ineffectually toward a lost earth .

		If one accepts the book as his , it discredits both his memory and the future life .

		If one does n't , the presumably sincere ladies who operated the ouija board are cast under a shadow .

		There is , indeed , just enough circumstantial evi - dence to arouse the horrible suspicion that per - haps
Mark Twain	PERSON	did come back to write the book .

		There are
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	mannerisms in ``
Jap Herron	LOCATION	'' ; there is an occasional glint of what might be called
Mark Twain	PERSON	humor ; there is a hero who is an emasculate echo of Tom Saw - yer and `` Huck ''
Finn	PERSON	.

		But one need not take the revelations of the ouija board at their face value .

		By seeking an explanation of the way in which the book came into being in the sub - conscious rather than the superconscious , one avoids making any charges of duplicity , the mem - ory of `` our ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	is left unspotted , and `` Jap Herron '' is transformed from a maudlin imitation into a study in psychology .

		In `` Conquest '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- Olive Wadsley utilizes much of a previously employed plot .

		She substitutes a
Paris	LOCATION	street gamin for the
London	LOCATION	waif-heroine , moving him from
Paris	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	instead of vice versa , and other - wise reverses scenes , situations , and characters of her `` Possession '' in a rather obvious fashion .

		The corresponding figures in the two books progress along parallel routes to equidistant ter - mini , and the journeys make very pleasant read - ing .

		There are good bits of characterization in `` Conquest , '' and an authentic air of sophistica - tion and interest regarding prize-fights and sporting-events surprising in the work of a woman author even a British one .

		What we call `` good taste '' is the most un - justly belittled of the virtues .

		We speak of it usually as of a superficial attribute , when , as a matter of fact , it is probably as potent at the roots of things as any other moral force .

		It is not exaggeration to say that the French con - ception of what constitutes good taste might have saved the Germans from committing many atrocities in war and in peace , just as it might save many of our lesser novelists from utter banality .

		On the basis of this one book , `` The Man Who Killed '' -LRB- Brentano ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- ,
Claude Farrere	PERSON	must be classed among the lesser novel - ists , but he must be classed , none the less , as a writer of some ditinction .

		The tale he tells is a rather fantastic and melodramatic story of modern Constantinople that might easily have become garish in less skilful hands .

		But
M. Farrere	PERSON	has what so many of our contemporary writers lack intellectual sophistication and good taste .

		Dramatic reserve , intelligent characteriza - tion , and an exotic background , painted with beauty and understanding , make a strange tale plausible and worth the reading .

		`` The Optimist , '' by
Susan Taber	PERSON	-LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.30	MONEY	-RRB- , is the title of the first of a group of gen - uine short stories .

		The author has remarkable ability in setting forth the meaningful episodes in her characters ' lives .

		In her economical use of material , too , she is skilful , giving in consid - erably less than the usual space illuminating glimpses into the past and clever characteriza - tions besides .

		For instance , the Optimist explains to her vagabond husband that she is an optimist
$ 98	MONEY	THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	because , after the suffering she has endured through him , anything is tolerable a new way of arriving at a philosophical attitude .

		Many of the stories are brightened by humor and all are fresh .

		Mary
Roberts Rinehart	PERSON	has adopted the pseudo-historical form in writing her latest novel , `` Long Live the King '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		It is staged in two European countries and deals lightly with the problems of monarchy versus revolutionary democracy , while telling the story of a young crown prince to whom an Amer - ican scenic railway and the companionship of the proprietor 's small son appealed more than his own proper business of being taught how to govern .

		The author has never failed to construct a plausible , well-built tale , but she has put no more significance into this than into her previous work .

		It is amusing enough in contents and more than American in style .

		In `` A Castle to Let , '' by Mrs.
Baillie Rey	PERSON	- nolds -LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , the ingredients are Tran - sylvania , which Mrs.
Thurlow	PERSON	thinks is one of the
United States	LOCATION	; an old castle with numberless secret passages and one locked door as enticing as the one in Blue Beard ; susceptible princes ; one lost heir , in the guise of a servant ; one smoking dragon ; and an English heiress who rents the castle and thus acquires mysteries with - out end .

		It is a book , that is to say , entirely of incident a thriller for the movie-minded .

		The good detective story is never out of style , but `` The Dream Doctor , '' by
Arthur B. Reeve	PERSON	-LRB- Harper ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , and `` The
London	LOCATION	Nights of Belsize , '' by
Vernon Rendall	PERSON	-LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , are even better than good , for they are different .

		The detective-story enthusiast probably knows that
Craig Kennedy	PERSON	,
Arthur B. Reeve	PERSON	's hero , in - variably finds the solution of every mystery by means of his scientific apparatus : telephones with power to reproduce more than the voice , cam - eras with certain new powers , and machines to detect the criminal .

		The mechanical devices would be useless , however , without
Kennedy	PERSON	's shrewd detective instincts .

		Very different are the methods of Belsize , rich and eccentric , find - ing adventure in
London	LOCATION	.

		His only aids to un - raveling mysteries are various Chinese axioms , such as `` Patience and a mulberry leaf will make a silk gown . ''

		A good part of the tales is persi - flage , indicated amply by titles like `` Feeding the Makers of Statistics '' or `` The Lost Scholar . ''

		In one entitled `` Belsize as a Commentator :
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, '' the amateur detective casts aspersions on
Holmes	PERSON	's knowledge of Thucydides and of Greek .

		In short he intimates that the whole was a puzzle devised by
Watson	PERSON	to keep the famous detective amused .

		CASUAL COMMENT NOON ,
OCTOBER 31 , 1917	DATE	marked 400 years since
Martin Luther	ORGANIZATION	nailed on the door of the Schlosskirche at
Wittenberg	LOCATION	his twenty-five Latin theses , from which the
Protestant Reformation	ORGANIZATION	is conveniently dated .

		For the sectaries who think this act liberated them from intolerable shackles the man who did it can not help acquir - ing the heroic , semi-divine attributes which the mythus-making mechanism generates everywhere , upon
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Washington	LOCATION	and Lincoln , no less than upon
Paul	PERSON	and
Augustine	PERSON	and Luther .

		In sharp contrast with the inflation worked auto - matically among the sectaries is the bearishness of Catholic writers on the Reformation .

		The latter can not help regarding him as a stubborn , rebellious priest , ignorant , bumptious , dogmatic , and in sharp need of discipline .

		A disinterested estimate , such as a person might make who had no stake in the quarrel between Protestantism and Catholicism , does not exist .

		Protestant estimates , moreover , exhibit a sharper partisan - ship than Catholic , because they are infected by the superlatives of German Wissenschajt , which has been moved by national vanity to start its modern national Pantheon with Luther .

		To the Germans Luther is a German first and a
Chris	PERSON	- tian and a thinker afterward , and being German is de facto supreme .

		And for the rest of the Protestant world the forty-year-old habit of tak - ing Germans at their own scholarly valuation is hard to break .

		Yet an educated Chinaman or Hindu , looking upon Luther and his work with a sympathetic but disinterested eye , would find him on the whole a man of rather cheap mind and no great dignity of character .

		He would find the Reformation , so far as Luther was in - volved in it , determined far more by dynastic and military considerations than religious ones .

		He would find Luther uttering in his own life and policy all that the modern mind finds most intolerable in Catholicism .

		Between that and Lutheranism he would find no intellectual , only a political , difference a decision of the issue between
Guelph	LOCATION	and Ghibelline in favor of the secular authority .

		He would see the really religious reformation of Catholicism among the followers of
Calvin and Zwingli	PERSON	, and surveying the two centuries which followed Luther 's act , he might readily wonder whether that dance to death was worth the fiddler 's price .

		For what Catholics are apt to regard as Luther 's pig - headedness galvanized into new life a moribund system whose dogmas and symbols were fast be - coming merely a hieroglyph and language for any ideas a man might choose to entertain .

		Mm within the church , even the successor of Peter himself , were free-thinking , secularizing powers ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 599 little concerned about salvation in a next world , and much about the art of life in this .

		Author - ity was giving way to tolerance , theology to humanism .

		If the church was corrupt , it was also urbane , and the corruption showed itself moreover as the soil of a healthy secular freedom .

		Luther 's rather trivial theses were the starting - points of a series of events which made dogma once more momentous .

		They generated a coun - ter-reformation against reformation , Jesuitism against Puritanism .

		And for this , which our Chinese or Hindu historian would recognize as the outcome of an avoidable initial accident , mankind has paid a terrible price in treasure , life , happiness , and freedom .

		It may be that the
Providence	LOCATION	that shapes our ends so shapes them that nothing worth winning can be other - wise won .

		figure became infinitely flexible .

		But this was an enervation of the artistic effect , because a violation of an inherently inflexible material .

		It was taking the backbone out of sculpture .

		Yet
Rodin	PERSON	was steadily pushing beyond the boundaries of marble into the realm of color - suggestion , from the plastic to the pictorial , with a growing impatience of the resistance of his medium .

		Pencil and water-color were his escape from it .

		It is in his drawings that
Rodin	PERSON	more completely reveals his intimate approach to form in movement .

		For the fluidity of line and wash permitted of his instantaneous tracing of the inner reflection of the parade of moving structure as it passed before him .

		They possess conse - quently all the magic of the spontaneous , and that perfect justification of the means in the end which his over-refined statuary lacks .

		ONLY TO THOSE UPON WHOM HE EXERTED a personal influence can the death of
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	have meant much .

		For to most of them the vigorous and kindly personality was as great a need as their own adulation .

		To many of them his guidance and inspiration must have been of genuine positive value .

		But though he was changing to the last , he will be remembered and reckoned by works long since completed , in their way already classic .

		In fact , his death has eliminated all extra-artistic bias from the ap - praisal of his work .

		His eloquence , his unction , his oracular pronouncements about art will for a long time prejudice the judges of his work , but to the rest of the cultivated world he will be an artist of amazing originality , fluid and abundant , thoughtful without profundity , ro - mantic without passion .

		He is most profound and passionate when under the spell of
Michel	PERSON	- angelo .

		The mention of this influence needs no apology , for though it is a historical common - place , it is far more fundamental than is com - monly supposed .

		Ever since the turbulent public appearance of the Bronze Age , in
1877	DATE	,
Rodin	PERSON	manifested that whether his plastic conceptions ultimately derived from specific works of
Michel	PERSON	- angelo or not , he was haunted by his movement .

		What he learned from the Louvre Slaves , the St.
Matthew	PERSON	, the
Medici Chapel	ORGANIZATION	in
Florence	LOCATION	, the
Jeremiah	LOCATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	, carried him beyond these in the same direction .

		It was a type of move - ment which began with the great master and which had in his hands become a mode of ex - pressing the will and the instincts in blind , weltering labor and strife , while the physiog - nomy was to remain at least in highly respect - able art the agent of more mechanical , knowable , superficial psychology .

		Rodin 's ex - ploitation of symbolic movement led him to relax the laws of twisting and bending until the CERTAIN EDITORS OF POPULAR MAGAZINES have decided tentatively at least that a short story to be commercially acceptable need not be 8000 words , or even 6000 words , in length .

		It may be
2000	DATE	, presumably , or even 1500 , and still escape being negligible .

		Emphatically , this is a step in the right direction .

		It disposes of at least one sort of standardization , and that by no means the least annoying to the serious work - man who thinks of his subject as bearing some definite relation to its development .

		Will the mere shortening of fiction automatically improve its quality ?

		Only indirectly , probably , though the omission of banal chatter put in to extend the areas `` next to reading matter , '' will be at least a negative gain .


Stevenson	PERSON	, to be sure , used to argue with great eloquence that he could pro- duce masterpieces with a pruning-knif e ; but he was only thoughtlessly reflecting the traditional French superstition , and confessing that he was never embarrassed by any exuberance of the cre - ative imagination .

		Masterpieces , alas , are not to be had so cheaply .

		They are produced not by leaving things out , but by putting the right things in .

		The short stories of Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	are long , but they are never too long ; they are just long enough to contain all that he has found it worth while to say about his theme .

		Neither are the short stories of
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	too short .

		His emotions exhausted themselves rapidly because they were obvious emotions and easily shared .

		He understood his talent perfectly , and it was not simple laziness that led him to do his trick with the swiftness of a juggler and ring down the curtain on a smile or a sigh .

		Such a gift as his can not adjust itself readily to the require - ments of 8000 words , and to maintain such a standard places a serious handicap on men whose work is done in the spirit of the artist .

		600 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 6	DATE	CHRISTMAS LUST OF SELECTED JUVENILE L.ITERATUKE Many of the sensations and conceptions of child - hood reach far into the future to motivate the re - actions and attitudes of middle age .

		The memory of the first book echoes sensitively in the mind after a lifetime of hardier experience .

		It is an earnest of the pervasive influence of the original images , now generating ceaselessly , though invisibly , in the deep subconscious ; and some psychologist may hereafter point to a disquisition on the ramifications of the first `` Mother Goose . ''

		Whether it is better that children should imbibe fairy-tale conceptions of life or better that they should imbibe the truth about things as they are , however unlovely some things as they are may be , depends , of course , on whether that early innocent faith in the beauty and goodness of the world engendered by pretty fairy tales and other candied fiction , hinders or helps adjustment to the world as it is , hinders or helps the movement to make the world what it ought to be .

		For ourself , we should place
Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	's `` Girls and Boys '' in the hands of every child ; for he tells his stories with a heart for the truth of life and a pity that some things should be true forces both for life as it ought to be .

		Disillusionment at twenty has loosed more misanthropy on the world than can ever be laid at the door of bitter fact from the cradle up .

		With a view to helping in the choice of books for children , THE DIAL presents herewith a selective list , compiled by Miss
May Massee	PERSON	, editor of the `` Book - list , '' which is published by the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rodin To the Frenchman of to-day
Rodin	PERSON	has already become a legend .

		He was one of the artists of the last century the greater part of whose life was a protest against the stubborn conventionalism of his time .

		Culture had become manifold and con - fused and every artist of originality had to interpret himself through commentaries written round his work , or to approve him - self through friends , to a public whose con - cern was with the conservation of tradi - tion in the midst of swift-dissolving changes .

		The artist 's success depended upon his eloquence as an apologist , and
Rodin	PERSON	was the type of artist-rhetorician whose words were set down by his disciples with the glowing ardor of a Gospel .

		The patient and somewhat pathetic protest of his genuine gifts against the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	and the Academies threw the glamour of vic - torious martyrdom over him , and the ami - able and rude distinctions of his person - ality afforded much swinging of censers to unemployed and adventurous enthusiasms .

		Titian had his
Dolce	ORGANIZATION	,
Michelangelo	PERSON	his Condivi and
Vasari	PERSON	, but
Rodin	PERSON	had his Mirbeaux , his Mauclairs , his
Brownells	PERSON	, his Kahns , his Cladels , and a galaxy of other devotees whose books are monu - ments to indiscriminate and sometimes heroic championship .

		They are , with few exceptions , of no critical value whatever , and concern themselves largely with biographical details and conversational expansions -LRB- which occurred with odd fre - quency -RRB- of the master on artistic matters .

		But the knowledge of an artist 's life or his views , as of his wardrobe , is utterly impertinent to the rendering of fair judg - ment about his work .

		The only thing that can really matter about him is not what he thinks , still less what he says about his art , but only what he achieves within the possibilities and the despotic limitations of his material .

		But
Rodin	PERSON	's thought was irrepressibly fluid and abundant , and overflowed the bronze and the marble .

		That is why it drifted into studio-talk , and through his acolytes into books .

		The appeal of his sculpture is largely in this `` overflow , '' in the immaterial extensions of the visible object , in its inextricably poetic content , and in those evasive characters which the medium evades but which lurk in the shadow , in the line , and in the delicately modulated surfaces .

		For
Rodin	PERSON	, as for all serious art , sculp - ture began with the human form , and with the nude as its essential and most signifi - cant manifestation .

		But the nude held for him also certain adventitious and con - ventional `` over-meanings '' which tended towards an ecstatic eroticism .

		He brought it within poignant range of our aesthetic sensibilities by a kind of refined natural - ism .

		In fact , he got to know the model so intimately that he came at last to regard his work as a continuation of outer appear - ance as it passed through his mind and out of it .

		But it was necessary to be naturalistic in order to make the nude as ductile and variable in its expression as feeling itself .

		He threw himself upon it and tormented it into cowering servility .

		It became a medium for the expression of the soul in ecstatic stillness in the dreaming Caryatid of the
Luxembourg	LOCATION	, and of the soul in ecstatic passion in the female figure of `` L'Invocation , '' whose outcry almost rends the spotless marble .

		The rest of his work groups itself about one or the other of these two works .

		He passed in the course of his development from what is organic and fundamental in form towards increased suggestion .

		Had he continued on the path he struck in the marvelous cadence and firm structure of `` L'Homme qui marche , '' and in the movement of the strained waking body of `` L'Age d'airain , '' 624 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	he would have been the greatest sculptor since
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	.

		But he abandoned the organic male structure for the artistically less significant female figure , because of its richness of sensuous and sensual suggestion .

		The controlling passion seems to be greater fluidity at all costs .

		He came to luxuriate in intricate groups of interfluent figures .

		We see them extravagantly tumbled together , rolling , writhing doubled upon each other , or in the free boundless move - ment of flight .

		To secure emotional expression
Rodin	PERSON	availed himself of every kind of move - ment both of muscle and structure , of body and feature .

		Yet movement was with him predominantly symbolic ; not concerted or controlled , but pushed out from within without rational intervention .

		Symbolism was a habit of mind with
Rodin	PERSON	, and he is full of yet another kind profounder and more deliberate the symbolism of form growing out of the stubborn stone , and regarded perhaps in its ultimate sugges - tion as the type and culmination of cosmic evolution , part of that dumb process that pushes all living things up towards the earth 's surface .

		As his ideas develop his groups become richer in arrangement .

		But the effect of bodily action is relieved by abstract move - ment .

		The planes flow over modulated surfaces from light to shadow attended by the flight of line , and our imagination gathering impetus at every moment flows and flies with them .

		And while plane and line sweep our vision into the depth of a group , they tempt us to walk round it .

		Rodin by inducing the spectator to do this definitely extended the effect of sculpture ; for though sculpture had been plunfacial ever since the Greeks , never before had it been approachable from so many different points .

		Each one reveals a fresh view and each view flows into another , like the progressive stages of a symphony .

		The effect is orchestral , and like music ,
Rodin	PERSON	's art is essentially evocative , not topical , and works upon us through its moods rather than through its subject .

		The form was thus far become an infinitely subtle medium , capable of response to all nuances of feeling and of emotion .

		But to the form as instrument of expression , he - added the superficial qualities of texture and temperature .

		The figure ceases to be a plastic abstraction and becomes vital .

		The material , now turned to flesh , is quick , fiery , and vibrant , and so exquisitely sen - sitive are the surfaces that they would seem smoothed and modulated for percep - tions much finer than our own .

		These sensuous refinements , proper rather to painting than to sculpture , while commu - nicating a direct element of life to the stone , bring with them an elaborate sys - tem of color and chiaroscuro .

		In places the material has been left unwrought to extend -LRB- especially in marble -RRB- the range of textural contrasts immeasurably and to carry the effect of color values as far as possible .

		Here the purely .

		sensuous effects of touch of which I spoke fuse with the immaterial play of caressing light and shade and the sense of the medium sinks definitely in a manifold of adventitious and delightful refinements .

		The peculiar aesthetic of
Rodin	PERSON	's over - refined and overestimated work derives from secondary qualities of art , not from monumentality but from daintiness , not from organic movement but from mobil - ity , not from sense-filling mass but from sensibility .

		Its ideal is not , as in the great arts of the past , perfect coherence ; it embodies rather the cult of the exquisite .

		Nor is the substance of his work , however winning it may be , profound and exalted .

		At its centre lies the overpowering mys - tery of sex , and his frail , ecstatic figures of youth are a sort of efflorescence of the sexual principle .

		The motif is traceable , whatever the professed subject , to a capri - cious and poetic eroticism which gently agonizes the instincts with fruitless yearn - ings .

		Yet
Rodin	PERSON	's deficiencies are French and traditional .

		Though we find in his work none of the architectural qualities of the greatest sculpture the upward thrust of life within the downward thrust of mat - ter ; though he attenuated his superficial ef - fects to a point of immaterial refinement ; though his theme is not conventionally noble , now and again his creations carry us out of the fever into a world of pure Deautv -
RICHARD OFFNER	PERSON	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 625 Idealism in the New French Theatre Several years ago the present writer , in revolt against our commercial theatre , its degradation of the drama and the art of the actor , printed , by way of protest , a little analogy .

		Suppose , the question was put , that a symphony orchestra were sub - jected to the same disintegrating forces as the theatrical company of to-day , that the first violin were a `` star , '' with all the other members of the orchestra -LRB- includ - ing the conductor -RRB- subordinated , not even to his instrument , but to the exploitation of his or her fascinating personality .

		Or suppose that the orchestra , in the interests of commerce , were obliged to play , all over the country , a single composition -LRB- and that an inferior one -RRB- throughout an entire season .

		What , then , would become of the orchestra , the individual players , and music ?

		Reversing the analogy , sup - pose that a company of actors were unified , like an orchestra , with each dramatic instrument subordinate to the whole , and under the leadership of a powerful , sincere directing intelligence , playing the master - works of drama precisely as the symphony orchestra performs the music of the world .

		What , then , would be the result ?

		It is this question which
Jacques Copeau	PERSON	and the company of players from the Theatre du
Vieux Colombier	PERSON	, of
Paris	LOCATION	, have estab - lished themselves in
New York	LOCATION	to answer ; for above all other radical dramatic re - formers , they have taken such an organi - zation as their ideal .

		Their special mission to this country is to present French drama , classic , romantic , and modern ; but their original intention , before the war , had no nationalistic limitations .

		It was to present drama , native and foreign , ancient and modern , in the service of art .

		The Theatre du
Vieux Colombier	PERSON	takes its interesting name from the old street in the
Latin Quarter	DATE	on which it was located `` the street of the old pigeon-house . ''

		The little theatre was not an isolated undertaking , but an outgrowth from the most remarkable literary movement in
France	LOCATION	during the decade before the war , a movement which culminated in `` La Nouvelle Revue Franchise . ''

		Jacques Copeau was its editor-in-chief .

		Among the contributors were such widely differ - ent and intensely modern writers as
Emil Verhaeren	PERSON	,
Paul Claudel	PERSON	,
Andre Gide	PERSON	, and the
Comtesse de Noailles	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pre - siding genius of the editorial sanctum was Dostoevsky .

		A passion for beauty and justice in expression , sincerity and courage in ideas animated the young writers of the staff .

		They exalted the work of
Charles	LOCATION	-
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	.

		As editors and publish - ers , they were radical and constructive .

		And finally , in
1913	DATE	, they founded the Theatre du
Vieux Colombier	PERSON	.

		The inspiration for the little theatre , however , was not of such recent date .

		It was the outcome of many years of critical study and discussion .


Jacques Copeau	PERSON	was a fighting dramatic critic long before he became an actor and manager .

		The Vieux-Colombier was founded , as one of its supporters has said , with something better than a new-born enthusiasm , `` with the firm conviction of its artistic necessity and the knowledge , or prevision , of every difficulty to be encountered . ''

		It did not undertake to revolutionize either society or the drama , and it did not profess to know anything about the `` drama of the future . ''

		Its passionate concern was with the present .

		The theatre , said
M. Copeau	PERSON	, must be `` renovated '' from the founda - tion up .

		The Vieux-Colombier was announced , then , simply as an experiment in `` dramatic renovation . ''

		The little group of artists encountered all the usual discouragements of innova - tors , skepticism , remonstrances , and gen - eral lack of confidence .

		But they were strong in their indignant revolt against the commercial desecration of the great social art of the theatre and in their com - pelling purpose not merely to arraign and condemn , but to start a theatre in oppo - sition .

		M. Copeau has accused the commercial theatre of alienating , in its dishonesty and viciousness , not only the intelligent and cultivated public , but the highest dramatic talent of author and actor , which has found refuge in other professions to the 626 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	incalculable loss of the drama .

		And the talent which remains , he contends , has been hurt and deformed .

		He found it necessary to `` renormalize '' the actors who came to him from the ranks of `` profes - sionals . ''

		During one
summer	DATE	the sum - mer of
1913	DATE	they all worked together in the country , professionals and non-pro - fessionals , their only theatre a barn , far from the artificialities of the
Paris	LOCATION	stage , studying without haste and without weari - ness , in the revealing light of day , the inner realities of the drama .

		Slowly , the professional actors freed themselves from their `` deformities '' and the `` stiff joints '' of specialization , and became supple and ` responsive again true dramatic instru - ments , like the talented young people and children whom
M. Copeau	PERSON	likes to study and to teach .

		In a single season of three hundred per - formances the Theatre du
Vieux Colom	ORGANIZATION	- bier passed far beyond the stage of experimentation and became a vitally important part of the cultural life of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The public , to whom the commer - cial theatre was distasteful , rallied to its support .

		For the Vieux-Colombier had arrived just in time , as
Andre Gide	PERSON	pointed out , to reconcile that public with the stage .

		Then came the war , and for a time the Theatre du
Vieux Colombier	PERSON	appeared to be completely destroyed .

		The men of the company were either mobilized or volun - teered for the army .

		The doors of the little theatre were closed .

		But the dra - matic genius of its founder could not be crushed , and
a year later	DATE	M. Copeau be - gan his work of reorganization .

		Following a preliminary visit to this country last
spring	DATE	, he has succeeded in transporting the entire company to
New York	LOCATION	, where the Theatre du
Vieux Colombier	PERSON	now stands , near by , but a little aside from , the theatrical market-place , a rebuke and an inspiration .

		The theatre opened its doors with a performance of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's `` Les Fourbe - ries de Scapin . ''

		The comedy was pre - ceded by a prologue , `` L'lmpromptu du Vieux-Colombier '' -LRB- in the manner of I ` lmpromptu de
Versailles	LOCATION	-RRB- , and followed by the ceremony of crowning a bust of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, the Spirit of Comedy of all ages rendering homage to the French comic genius .

		But what most excited and held the attention was the intense , highly pitched , and original performance of `` Les Fourberies de Scapin . ''

		In the production of the classics , the Vieux-Colombier aims to be neither `` traditional '' -LRB- which is another name for laziness , according to M. Copeau -RRB- nor presumptuously original .

		It desires only the originality which comes from a pro- found knowledge and interpretation of the text .

		`` Nous nous efforcerons de nous remettre en etat de sensibilite . ''

		Little im - portance is given to stage decoration and accessories .

		M. Copeau does not quite agree with
Paul Claudel	PERSON	that the theatre should be only a few boards thrown across two trestles , but he denies the im - portance of all `` machinerie . ''

		Moliere , particularly , is played without decoration or atmosphere and in a reduced space .

		The action of the comedies is lost ,
M. Copeau	PERSON	maintains , on the large modern stage .

		Moliere designed the action with elaborate care , to fit the requirements of a very small platform .

		To produce him in any other way , to enlarge or modern - ize the scene , is to divorce text and action , and spoil Moliere .


M. Copeau	PERSON	has modeled his stage for the production and not for the destruction of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		The principal action takes place on a small cubic platform in the centre of the main stage , with steps on four sides .

		There is an apron , or fore - stage , which is frequently used ; and diag - onal side-walls , next the proscenium , to the right and the left , contain doors with steps .

		A great variety of entrances , exits , and groupings is thus made possible , and extraordinarily close , rapid action .


Jacques Copeau	PERSON	and his company are a true orchestra of dramatic instruments , playing with astonishing spontaneity and rhythm .

		They do not make Moliere `` real - istic . ''

		Yet they are very natural .

		By a joyous kind of dramatic exaggeration , they attain what a French critic has termed `` lyrisme du naturel . ''

		They reveal Moliere not only as a great comic writer but as an `` artiste de la scene . ''

WELLINGTON	LOCATION	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 627 The Structure of Lasting Teace IV NATIONALITY , CITIZENSHIP , AND THE EUROPEAN STATE SYSTEM When , a year or two ago , President
Wilson	PERSON	uttered his historic reproach of the `` hyphenated American , '' he brought for an instant into the foreground of public opinion a little-considered quality of the existence of men which is basic to the solution of all problems of their relation - ships .

		Hyphenation is not political merely , it pervades the whole of life , increasing proportionately as civilization advances .

		Fundamentally it designates union and correlation , not separation , nor division .

		Every man is a hyphenate .

		Every man is the centre of an aggregate of relation - ships , which are normally cooperative and frequently conflicting .

		Every man 's life is a constant compromise and choosing between alternatives so incompatible that all may not be completely satisfied at the same time .

		No man is , or can be , ex - clusively one thing and no other : son and husband , industrial baron and
Chris	PERSON	- tian , trust magnate and patriot , German and American , pacifist and munitions - maker , breadwinner and conscript , church member and citizen a man may normally be all these at the same time and suddenly find himself confronted with the ineluctable necessity of choosing between one and another .

		Each implies reciprocal rights and duties , each makes insistent and clam - orous claims .

		Which shall be granted , which denied , instinct , tradition , habit , fear , imitation , standards of class and rank determine far more than intelligence .

		Yet at no point than in such choices is intelli - gence more needful or significant .

		What is important about the hyphena - tion of mankind is the classes into which it divides .

		Men are hyphenated by nature and by art .

		The relationships involved in the former are congenital and inalienable , internal to a man 's character and coincident with his existence .

		The relation - ships involved in the latter are acquired or assured ; external to a man 's character and existence , alienable , and not indis - pensable .

		Nationality is a hyphenation belonging to the nature of things ; vocation , religion , citizenship are hyphenations created in the process of history .

		Men are born Irish or Jew or Chinese , and their association with men similarly born is involuntary and spontaneous .

		Men be - come farmers or carpenters or physicians , Christians or Mohammedans or Judaists or Buddhists , citizens of
Russia	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, and their association with men similarly preoccupied is voluntary and directive , governed by considerations of advantage and the forces of circumstance .

		These associations men pass into and out of at need , or pleasure , or both .

		The others they can not but remain in until they die .

		It is for the sake of those others , indeed , that vocation and religion and the state arose ; to liberate their powers and to elaborate the idiom of their existence .

		Much of the trouble of civilized society derives from the fact that these artificial associations have overturned what they should have sustained , that they have changed from tools of living into purposes of life , that they have become idols .

		This is to-day even truer of economic and political associations than it was in the Middle Ages of the religious associa - tion they have replaced .

		Capital and
the State	ORGANIZATION	are the idols of modernity , and the two are , as we have seen , so inter - penetrated that the worship of the one implies the worship of the other , even in democratically constituted states .

		I do not mean by this to deny that the economic order is at the foundation of civilized society .

		I mean merely to assert again the always obvious and always ignored truism that the economic order presupposes a community not economic which it serves , and that modernity 's elaboration of it inconceivably beyond the effective gratifi - cation of human needs is unnecessary , and indeed inimical , to the free life of man - kind .

		In so far as this civil war which German dynastic interest has thrust upon the world seeks justification from the equating of economic advantage and polit - ical sovereignty with nationality , it seeks justification from a lie .

		In fact , the whole modern system of economic rivalries , sup - posedly inevitable under the `` law of diminishing returns , '' is due to the mis - appropriation of economic endeavor to 628 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	dynastic and capitalistic uses , to the mili - tarist requirement of a `` self-sufficient '' state .

		Just and free conditions of economic endeavor break this law .

		As
Simon Patten	PERSON	has shown , variation of uses and extension of consumability not only keep returns at par or increase them ; they also multiply the `` division of labor '' and so generate cooperative interdependence .

		The com - petitive politico-economic system , with its tariffs and other dishonesties , rests upon sameness of economic enterprise ; the greater the differentiation , the less the rivalry .

		The unnecessary existence of rivalry is a perversion of function in state and indus - try .

		These , it must be remembered , are tools , not ends .

		To use them democrati - cally is to use them in behalf of the free - ing and enhancement of inward and spontaneous differences , not their repres - sion .

		The most we can mean by law and justice and equality of opportunity is such an arrangement of the material upon which human life nourishes itself as will permit and extend the freest development , expres - sion , and interplay of human individuali - ties .

		Upon those and upon those alone are the essences of civilization and culture grounded and grown .

		And in those , nationalities interpenetrate and support each other .

		National genius requires an international soil and sustenance : the music , literature , painting , sculpture , and philosophies of peoples , their religions , and even their preeminent sciences are the most precious , the most excellent , the best known , and most honored , and yet the most intimate and national of their achieve - ments , and their substance and source are the most wide-ranging and diversified .

		For these , things of the spirit , protection is destruction ; free-trade , strength .

		Eng - lish
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is nourished upon the Italian Renaissance ; German Goethe -LRB- he avows it vehemently , again and again -RRB- , upon English Shakespeare .

		Each is the declared national superlative of national - ity and each is superlatively hyphenated .

		The supremacies of the other institutions of national culture are similarly inter - national .

		Indeed , culture , of both the nation and the individual , is hyphenation .

		That is why the highest excellences are achieved by the more democratic peoples or the more democratic times , or both fifth century
Athens	LOCATION	,
Augustan Rome	PERSON	, the city-states of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	,
England	LOCATION	from the
eighteenth century	DATE	on ,
France	LOCATION	in the
nineteenth century	DATE	,
Germany	LOCATION	from the birth to the death of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		For democracy , more basically than anything else , is hyphenation .

		Since the one and only thing democracy can mean is the sym - pathetic understanding of the other fellow , with his different origin , nature , back - ground , and outlook , and the free and cooperative recognition of his right to be and to thrive .

		Democracy , like human - ism , is the mind 's reverence of , and the heart 's sympathy for , individuality , and individuality never occurs except in nationalate form .

		Men are always Eng - lishmen , or Chinamen , or Frenchmen , or Germans , and so on ; they are never merely men .

		Nationalities are the roots , and national cultures the fruits , of trees of human life whose soils are the economic and political systems that feed or starve them .

		These systems are not inherent parts of the nature of nationalities ; they can be and are artificially altered without hurt to men .

		Nationalities can not be .

		What I am trying to say is this : the politico-economic establishments are need - ful guarantees and conditions of national - ity , but not its constituents .

		Democratic progress in such establishments would pro- vide for nationality the same fortune as is religion 's .

		In the record of civilization religion is the first free manifestation of nationality .

		The cities and states of antiq - uity are distinguished primarily by their cults and their patron divinities , and the divinities have a direct or indirect ances - tral connection with their worshippers
Athene	PERSON	for
Athens	LOCATION	, Phoebus for
Sparta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Jehovah for
Jerusalem	LOCATION	.

		In the Middle Ages , cities and states are distinguished by their patron-saints St.
George	PERSON	for Eng - land ,
St. Denis	LOCATION	for
France	LOCATION	: Catholicism did not mean universality of cult ; it meant a local and national and vocational particu - larism , with a general mythology and theology for background .

		Religious im - perialism , for which Catholicism is a euphemistic synonym , is the attempt t. > compel universal conformity in religious
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 629 matters .

		The history of that attempt is the darkest in the whole dark record of mankind from the torture and slaughter of heretics within the church , the exter - mination of Lollards and Hussites and other dissidents , the persecution of Jews , the assault upon Mohammedans , to the terrible religious wars of the Reformation .

		Its modern parallel is
Germany	LOCATION	's treat - ment of her victims .

		The establishment of tolerance was the establishment of democ - racy in the sphere of religion , the applica - tion of the principle of `` live and let live '' to associations whose differentiae were varying declarations about the unseen and its bearing upon the destiny of man .

		How deep the roots of such associations lie may be gathered from the fact that so vehement an Americanist as Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt is still a member of the Dutch Re - formed Church .

		In this respect , as in many others , this ex-president , quite like other men , is still a hyphenate , and it is , on the whole , the irrelevance of this form of hyphenation to the actualities of his life that keeps it from creating a momentous option for him .

		And for all men , in our Christian civilization , save , perhaps , those who are Catholics , and owe allegiance to the pope .

		For with Protestantism there began a secularization of the world which more and more drove the religious con - cern from the centre to the periphery of human interest .

		Under the new and growing conditions of tolerance and free - dom sects multiplied , yet no one was the worse .

		The secular mood simply changed the role of religion back from an idol of life into a tool of living .

		Its connection with the state was severed and the power by means of which it was compelled to struggle for existence altered from physi - cal force to moral excellence .

		The place left vacant by religion was filled by nationality .

		Nationality is the secular aspect of the same self-conscious pride of social personality of which religion is the first utterance .

		In back - ward and mediaeval states the two still interpenetrate and imply each other ; their criteria are doctrines of especial considera - tion from divinity and a special predesti - nate service to execute on its behalf :
Germany	LOCATION	, we are instructed , is a chosen people with a mission , boasting a state - religion beside which dissident sects are at a disadvantage .

		Free states , on the con - trary , have no room for either doctrine .

		They have permitted the sinister connec - tion of state and church to fall into desuetude , or have violently severed it , or have taken measures to prevent its aris - ing .

		Now underneath nationality , as underneath the religions of antiquity , there lies an actual or hypothetical consan - guinity of the individuals nationally asso - ciated , a hereditary inward similarity whose outward manifestation is the com - munity and culture of the associates .

		Clearly , the connection between political establishment and nationality is as un - necessary and monitory as that between state and church .

		The present civil war is the price mankind is paying for the modern error even as it paid for the mediaeval error .

		How little necessary the connection is between nationality and the state the history of nationalism itself shows , no less than the actual organization of various states
Switzerland	LOCATION	with her French and Italians and Germans ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	with her English and Welsh and Scotch and Irish ,
Belgium	LOCATION	with her Wal - loons and
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	with all the nationalities of the world associated in the common American citizenship .

		Nationality , in a word , is as inde - pendent of citizenship as religion .

		A citi - zen is associated with his fellows in a state , for political purposes .

		These pur - poses are to guarantee to individuals and to groups , as our Declaration of Inde - pendence asserts , life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .

		Disentanglement of the state from religion has made it the guarantor of religious freedom .

		The next step in the liberation of mankind must be to detach it completely and everywhere from nationality that it may become the guarantor of national freedom , enfranchis - ing the inner life of nationalities for crea - tion and self-expression in the world of culture as it does sects in the realm of religion .

		That this is more and more the case in countries with free and responsible institutions need not be argued .

		But if peace is to become lasting , it must be made everywhere and equally the case .

		630 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	And there 's the rub .

		Even in the
United States	LOCATION	, in the very face of the facts of the daily life , men labor under the super - stition of the identity of nationality with citizenship , and the fanatical devotion to nationality among the Jugo-Slavs , the Irish , the Poles , the Lithuanians , to say nothing of the Germans , is certain , if peace be not made on the basis of an absolute divorce between citizenship and nationality , to maintain the war-creating system of inter - national disorganization .

		Democracy , on which peace ultimately depends , demands this divorce .

		Without it , the German con - ception of the state , particularly effective for wartimes , is bound to prevail .

		Accord - ing to this conception the state is the be-all and end-all of existence , greater than society and inclusive of it .

		Neither individuals nor groups have being or significance outside the state .

		They exist by its sufferance and live for its service .

		It is the
Sole Individual	ORGANIZATION	, the great Whole , the synthesis and fulfilment of all human associations , antedating and superseding them , prior in existence and in right .

		Pre - cisely opposite is the democratic view .

		Democratic states are pluralistic .

		For democracy , political association is not primary , but secondary ; not the synthesis of other associations , but one type added to the others , and maintained only so long as it effects the special purpose for which it was created .

		Its authority rests upon the `` consent of the governed , '' is never absolute , never infallible .

		There is appeal from it , even , as
John Locke	PERSON	says , `` to heaven . ''

		He means that the right to rebel against bad government is inalienable , that the people are the sovereign , and all the people .

		When , therefore , states have failed , they have done so invariably because the power of government has been used by and for a part , against the whole of a people : in autocracies and oligarchies , by minorities against majorities ; in democracies , by majorities against minorities .

		In this way the function of government , which is like that of the traffic police , so to keep the ways of life open that each traveller may have equal opportunity with his fellows to journey unhampered to his goal , becomes perverted and the law substitutes favorit - ism for equity .

		Of the `` law of nations '' this has been particularly true .

		The sys - tem of state sovereignties is answerable for all the forms of imperialism that derive from nationalistic aggression Germanification ,
Magyarization	LOCATION	,
Otto	PERSON	- manization , and so on , with all such programmes imply in the economic and political orders .

		Unless an international is substituted for this national system , the world will never be safe for democracy .

		To speak of a few cases in
Europe	LOCATION	alone , there are Magyar and German minorities in
Bohemia	LOCATION	and in the Austrian territory claimed by
Rumania	LOCATION	, just as there is a great Slavic majority in the Hungarian dominion ; two-thirds of the
Macedonia	LOCATION	claimed by
Serbia	LOCATION	is inhabited by men of Bulgarian nationality ;
Alsace	LOCATION	is largely German ; a third of
Poland	LOCATION	is Jewish .

		A settlement according to `` the principle of nationality '' which would effect only a change in hegemony would have
Europe	LOCATION	at war again in less than a generation .

		Minorities must be safeguarded even as majorities must be freed if peace is to last , and minorities can not be safeguarded without international guarantees that will once and for all divorce citizenship from nationality .

		Of course , such guarantees would constitute a comprehensive easement on the European system of state sovereign - ties and would require an elaborate ma - chinery to make them effective .

		To One in the Trenches I have dreamed vaguely of a flaming light Growing somehow within the clash of things ; I have hoped wanly that the sodden night Presaged a sunrise and the rush of wings .

		Is there such spirit born of raining lead , Such bloom of beauty from the shattered dead ?

		You who have known war 's maiming , iron clutch , Have breathed the wind of battle-breasting fire , Is there a chastening vigor in the touch The writhing flesh , the stench of bloody mire ?

		Does there some rapture which pale peace with - stood Cry through the tumult that the earth is good ?

London	LOCATION	-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		When I said in my last letter that I would return to
Edward Thomas	PERSON	on the publication of his poems , I did not know that the book was almost ready .

		It is now out and lies before me as I write .

		It is a very remarkable collection .

		We have chastised ourselves enough recently with the reflection that we do not recognize our poets until they are dead ; and this thought is especially painful when they have given their lives for us in the war .

		It is some comfort , there - fore , to be able to say in the case of Thomas that the fault was his , not ours , though there is no doubt that we should have committed the fault if he had given us an opportunity .

		His poetry is a phenomenon as singular , in its own way , as that of Mr.
A. E. Housman	PERSON	, on whom I have a word to say later .

		Thomas wrote no verse between quite early life and the middle thirties .

		Then , in
1913	DATE	, he began to pour out a great number of queer , rather fierce , very intense poems , disconcerting in content and form , and unlike anything ever written by anyone else .

		I have been told that the poetry of Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	gave him his first impulse ; and that may be so , though the impulse never became an influence .

		However it may be ,
Thomas	PERSON	continued to write verses during the last four years of his life ; and when he was killed in
April	DATE	on the first day of the battle for the
Vimy Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, he left a con - siderable number of pieces behind him .

		The first of these -LRB- sixteen or so of them -RRB- had been pub - lished only a few weeks before in an `` Annual of New Poetry '' over the signature `` Edward Eastaway '' ; and the literary public had not bestirred itself sufficiently to take any interest in them , when suddenly it heard that the author was
Thomas	PERSON	and that he was dead .

		This volume now follows and there is , I am given to under - stand , another yet to come .

		I suggested in my last letter that
Thomas	PERSON	was a disillusioned and somewhat embittered man .

		He spent the best of his youth over critical essays and books of literary travel which , though he did them as well as he could , that is to say , very well indeed , were not meant for permanence and will not be permanent .

		His was the minor tragedy of a man who , consenting to write for the market , was kept on the very margin of popularity by an uncompromising conscience and insisted on putting his best work into books for which , in themselves , he cared very little .

		The tone of his poetry conveys the impression that he felt that the gift for it had come to him too late .

		The poems deal throughout with the things which , as I suppose , made life endurable to him ; but they alternate between the feeling that the loveliness of these things can only increase his own discontent and the other feeling that they are at best only attempts to hide the misery of life .

		It is as though he treated this stubborn and late-won talent with a certain dis - dain , holding it less in awe because it had come after the time to give him pleasure .

		And in his seeming indifference , he handles verse brusquely and carelessly and so gets out of it , again and again , effects of rhythm and description novel and marvelously penetrating .

		He writes of practically nothing but the country and he describes the country as it has never been described before .

		He is not a poet of white , woolly sheep , flowering hawthorn hedges , and the orange-colored harvest moon .

		He prefers to write about faggots of wood , dusty nettles or mud ; and he gets his color-effect out of the opening of a pile of swedes .

		It is hard to choose out of the sixty odd pieces one or two that will exactly show his qualities .

		Here is one : There they stand , on their ends , the fifty faggots That once were underwood of hazel and ash In
Jenny Pinks	PERSON	's Copse .

		Now , by the hedge Close packed , they make a thicket fancy alone Can creep through with the mouse and wren .

		Next Spring A blackbird or a robin will nest there , Accustomed to them , thinking they will remain Whatever is for ever to a bird : This Spring it is too late ; the swift has come .

		'T was a hot day for carrying them up : Better they will never warm me , though they must Light several
Winters	ORGANIZATION	' fires .

		Before they are done The war will have ended , many other things Have ended , maybe , that I can no more Foresee or more control than robin and wren .

		Here the mind has turned from the contempla - tion of an object with a succession of little , queer , involuntary thoughts ; and the poet has surprised each of them and brought each alive into his verse .

		In another poem , which I will quote , he captures not the reflection but the moment of seeing , the very moment itself : Yes .

		I remember Adlestrop The name , because one afternoon Of heat the express-train drew up there Unwontedly .

		It was late
June	DATE	.

		The steam hissed .

		Someone cleared his throat .

		No one left and no one came On the bare platform .

		What I saw Was Adlestrop only the name And willows , willow-herb , and grass , And meadowsweet , and haycocks dry , No whit less still and lonely fair Than the high cloudlets in the sky 632 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	And for that minute a blackbird tang Close by , and round biro , mistier , Farther and farther , all the birds Of
Oxfordshire	LOCATION	and
Gloucestershire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thomas was not perhaps , probably never would have been , a great poet ; but he was a poet exquisitely true and exquisitely individual .

		I have no doubt that Professor
A. E. Housman	PERSON	and his one book , `` A Shropshire Lad , '' are names to conjure with in
America	LOCATION	, at least among a small circle of readers .

		His admirers there will be able to understand the thrill which certain Englishmen felt when they saw that signature under eight lines of verse in the `` Times '' on the third anniversary of the climax of the first Battle of
Ypres	LOCATION	.

		There is no doubt that some of us did feel a thrill .

		For Professor
Housman	PERSON	pub - lished his one book , which contains sixty-three poems , twenty-one years ago and , except for one or two comic pieces , the unbendings of a classical scholar , and one poem which had pretty obviously been rejected from his book , he has maintained a complete silence ever since .

		And his book is very important in the history of modern English poetry .

		It has certain qualities which are entirely his own , and which he has not communicated , a sort of deep gloom , which is fresh instead of clammy , as though it were the shade of a very thick wood in early
summer	DATE	, and a sardonic , despairing humor , fierce , bitter , and destructive pleasantry at the expense of life .

		But it has also an extraordinary clearness of technique and economy of phrase , and these qualities have made a deep mark on subsequent English verse .

		The influence of the book has been subtle and sub - terranean , but I think that when we come to see our epoch in perspective , it will be easily dis - tinguished .

		And the latest crop of young war poets shows that it is as effective as ever .

		But the prestige of the book has undoubtedly been enhanced by its author 's uncanny silence , to explain which many theories have been in - vented .

		It has been deduced most plausibly from the contempt for life shown in his book that the author simply thought more composition not worth his while .

		But there is a disparity between the poet and his poems which has made deeper the general perplexity .

		When he first came to
Cambridge	LOCATION	as regius professor of Latin , the
Dons of Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, of which college he had been made a fellow , got out their copies of the `` Shrop - shire Lad '' with that confused noise which passes for a buzz of excitement in our universities .

		They read with attention and gathered a general impression of seduction , desertion , murder , sui - cide , and execution by hanging .

		They then went to dine in hall and saw a rather small , rather round man , with a beaming expression and a good appetite .

		They returned in silence to their rooms and read again , receiving the same impres - sion , mitigated only by an occasional suggestion of premature but natural death .

		They have not solved the mystery yet ; nor has anyone else .

		But this sort of thing explains the reputation that Professor
Housman	PERSON	enjoys .

		His poem in the `` Times '' was an epitaph on the original
British Expeditionary Force	ORGANIZATION	and , though it was supremely well-turned the author could no doubt have turned it as well in Latin it was hardly so good as the weakest thing in the `` Shropshire Lad . ''

		But it caused a thrill in a greater number of readers than I , fearing to be thought foolish , should care to guess at .

		Two books of that sort which approaches with a noise like a train coming through a tunnel are out and are keeping the omniscient reviewers mightily busy .

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	's `` Recollections '' are less stiff and inhuman than I expected they would be , but they contain precisely the number of revelations that I anticipated that is to say .

		none at all .

		The book is a monument of the later Victorian age of the agnostic Liberalism which died very hard but is now quite dead .

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	, who shook his head sadly over the extravagances of
Rousseau	LOCATION	, is more at home with
G. H. Lewes	PERSON	,
Spencer	PERSON	, and Mill ; and , while one is under the spell , one almost believes that these were great men of the very first order .

		But the spell vanishes and the belief with it .

		Some day some impressionistic historian , of a type yet to be evolved , working from documents and writ - ing with a touch of dry satire , will compose the perfect history of nineteenth-century
England	LOCATION	.

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	's `` Recollections '' will be a most useful part of his material .

		The other book of this sort is Sir
Sidney Col	PERSON	- vin 's new life of
Keats	PERSON	, a marvelous production which , in five hundred and fifty large , closely printed pages , relates fully everything that is known of the poet and renders any other biog - raphy impossible , perhaps forever .

		Sir
Sidney	PERSON	has little new material but he writes with genial - ity and a very genuine love for his subject .

		His criticism is not enterprising but it is very sound and very full .

		His book has , in short , German thoroughness without German absurdity ; it i ^ the sort of book that I should like someone to write about Goethe .

		And it almost encourages
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 633 the idea that our learned men think English poetry a matter of living importance .

		I made a mistake in an earlier letter for which I must apologize .

		Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	's new volume of poems , which has now been published in
Ireland	LOCATION	in a limited and expensive edition , is not called `` Per Arnica Silentia Lunae '' -LRB- which is another book -RRB- but `` The Wild Swans at Coole . ''

		These poems are very good but very eerie , and the impression that their author is no human child , but a changeling , gains ground .

		It is something of a surprise and a good deal of a relief to pick up a volume of poetry these days that does not `` interpret '' the war .

		One gets a bit wearied of old rhetoric and ante-bellum platitudes refurbished with post-Kipling metres and a few martial metaphors .

		One turns to such a volume as Vachel Lindsay 's latest with anticipation and reads it with something like disappointment .

		For , after a colorful and en - ticing opening , we are plunged into two whole sections of pedestrian poetry about ``
Mark Twain	PERSON	and
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , '' and `` Where is the Real Non-Resistant '' ; about Kerensky and
Jane	PERSON	Ad - dams and
Bryan	PERSON	and `` our mother Pocahontas '' and similarly timely personages .

		All these may be imbued with the poetic stuff , but in reducing them to rhyme , the result is anything but poetry .

		Nor is the verse materially strengthened by Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's mental attitude .

		We see him wavering between a frank horror of all wars and a hesitant justification of this particular one .

		This inse - curity of intellectual base recalls how anxious a position Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	maintained in his previ - ous volumes ; how hazardously he balanced him - self in a devotion to a liberal socialism on one hand and a strict prohibition on the other .

		A pagan by intention and a puritan by intuition .

		Pulled one way , as a poet , by the imperious de - mands of beauty , and another way , as a propa - gandist , by the moral dictates of the uplift crusade , he shows a vacillation , almost pathetic , between a universal compulsion and , to be literal , local option .

		Any admirer of Lindsay will ob - serve with distrust this growing insistence on the sermonizing feature of his work .

		The preacher seems to be in the ascendancy , the Chau - tauquan threatens to dominate the artist .

		In `` General Booth Enters into Heaven , '' `` The Congo , '' `` The Eagle that is Forgotten , '' `` Sun - shine , '' `` The Leaden Eyed , '' there was a strange - ly successful mingling of these two forces ; the blend of poetry and pamphleteering became pow - erful and persuasive .

		But in the present volume , it is somewhat disturbing to witness Lindsay hitching his clipped
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	in front of the meet - ing-house and mounting the worn-out steps to deliver himself of such orotund banalities as : Would that the lying rulers of the world Were brought to block for tyrannies abhorred .

		Would that the sword of
Cromwell	PERSON	and the Lord , The sword of
Joshua	PERSON	and
Gideon	PERSON	, Hewed hip and thigh the hosts of Midian .

		God send that ironside ere tomorrow 's sun ; Let
Gabriel	PERSON	and
Michael	PERSON	with him ride .

		God send the Regicide .

		or the still flatter wordiness of : When
Bryan	PERSON	speaks , the sky is ours , The wheat , the forests , and the flowers .

		And who is here to say us nay ?

		Fled are the ancient tyrant powers .

		When
Bryan	PERSON	speaks , then I rejoice .

		His is the strange composite voice Of many million singing souls Who make world-brotherhood their choice !

		It is a relief to turn from these , skipping over such matters as the attempt to make jingles -LRB- such as `` Niagara '' -RRB- look like war poems , and pass to a poem like `` The Ghosts of the
Buffa	LOCATION	- loes . ''

		Here
Lindsay	PERSON	's native fancy is given free swing ; he carries the reader on a midnight scamper with nothing more purposeful than the driving power of imagination .

		Or examine `` The Prairie Battlements . ''

		Here again
Lindsay	PERSON	is not trying to prove anything or convince anyone ; he is concerned only with trying to snare a glim - mering and elusive beauty .

		No village improve - ment societies will embroider it on their banners ; no anti-vice crusades will take it up as a slogan ; and yet I like to feel that the real Lindsay is in these unofficial and merely beautiful poems .

		Witness these lines , a part of `` The Broncho That Would Not Be Broken . ''

		The grasshoppers cheered .

		`` Keep whirling , '' they said .

		The insolent sparrows called from the shed `` If men will not laugh , make them wish they were dead . ''

		But arch were your thoughts , all malice displacing , Though the horse-killers came , with snake-whips advancing .

		You bantered and cantered away your last chance .

		And they scourged you , with Hell in their speech and their faces , O broncho that would not be broken of dancing .

		o.U THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	`` Nobody cares for you , '' rattled the crows , As you dragged the whole reaper , next day , down the rows .

		The three mules held back , yet you danced on your toes .

		You pulled like a racer , and kept the mules chasing .

		You tangled the harness with bright eyes side - glancing , While the drunk driver bled you a pole for a lance And the giant mules bit at you keeping their places .

		O broncho that would not be broken of dancing ... It is easy to turn the entire poem into a piece of pretty symbolism .

		The little colt-broncho is the artist or possibly he is beauty or joy ; the crows are the inevitable and discouraging critics ; the drunk driver and the mules are the forces that try to make art a utilitarian affair and break it to harness , and so on and so on .

		The charm of such a poem , however , is in nothing so intellec - tual .

		It is in the homely fantasy , the natural extravagance that is so native to
Lindsay	PERSON	and which he communicates so individually .

		I call attention again to the title poem that opens the volume with its subdued and varying chant ; to the amazing ``
John Brown	PERSON	, '' which begins with a childlike catalogue and runs through negro pomposity to a picturesque and powerful close ; to ``
Simon Legree	PERSON	, '' possibly the richest and raciest piece in the collection , with its fallacious moral and its rollicking high spirits .

		It is this last quality that keeps one from becoming per - turbed by
Lindsay	PERSON	's growing churchliness .

		It is the whimsical buoyancy , the side
spring	DATE	, the gay appraisal of loveliness that keeps Lindsay the mis - sionary from superseding Lindsay the minstrel .

		His morals may tame the man ; they will never be able to keep a bit and bridle on his magic .


Ezra Pound	ORGANIZATION	's volume is a far more puzzling affair .

		Its range and variety are its most out - standing quality and its chief defect .

		The vol - ume seems a catch-all for Pound 's slightest utterance .

		Poems in the imagist manner , lugu - brious cantos in a Sordello form , arrangements in the vorticist vein , epigrams from the Greek , Lalage and other ladies from the Latin , para - phrases from the German , scraps from the early Anglo-Saxon , snatches from the Spanish , idioms from the Italian , water-colors from the Chinese , echoes from
Provence	LOCATION	one gets nothing so much as a confused jumble and smattering of erudi - tion .

		The effect is less that of the man of the world than the man about literature .

		All is carefully noted , collected , tagged , and set down .

		Nothing is too inconsequential or unworthy of inclusion .

		It is all here ; even the absurd apos - trophe to
Swinburne	PERSON	-LRB- `` Salve Pontifex '' -RRB- and the inane , schoolboy burlesque of `` Summer is icumen in . ''

		What makes this lust for print the more puzzling is the fact that Mr.
Pound	PERSON	has not only a critical but a selective gift .

		In fact the latter concentrative quality -LRB- as is proved by the transcriptions of
Fenollosa	PERSON	's notes , `` Ca - thay '' -RRB- is his most salient trait .

		What then will even his youngest disciple say to the awkward and malformed versions of the eight
Heine	PERSON	poems that read like so many humorless parodies , the paper-motto silliness of such a couplet as : THE NEW CAKE or SOAP Lp , how it glistens in the sun Like the cheek of a
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	.

		and `` Papyrus , '' which I quote in its entirety : PAPYRUS Spring ... Too long ... Gongula ... White paper is evidently not so precious as the publishers would have us believe .

		This overmastering desire to exhibit every triviality , to let not one bad joke blush unseen , spoils many a bright page and most of the vol - ume .

		Pound chatters on , and his wandering loquacity dulls the edge of a really keen irony .

		-LRB- A badly mixed metaphor , no doubt , but one direct from the barber 's chair . -RRB-

		The patient reader will find and delight in such sharp per - formances as `` Phasellus Ille , '' ``
New York	LOCATION	, '' `` Arides , '' `` Portrait D'Une Femme , '' `` The So - cial Order , '' `` Salutation , '' and `` Commission , '' where cold irony gives way to a hot anger .

		I quote the first few lines : Go , my songs , to the lonely and the unsatisfied ; Go also to the nerve-wracked , go to the enslaved-by - convention , Bear to them my contempt for their oppressors .

		Go , as a great wave of cool water , Bear my contempt of the oppressors .

		Speak against unconscious oppression , Speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative , Speak against bonds .

		Any lover of aesthetics will also find much to admire in the subtleties of light , shadow , move - ment and what is naively called `` atmosphere '' in such brief pictures as `` Albatre , '' `` Fish , '' `` The Encounter , '' the `` Fan-Piece for Her Imperial Lord '' -LRB- an excellent example of condensation from an original many times as long -RRB- , `` The Coming of War '' and this IN A STATION OF THE METRO The apparition of these faces in the crowd ; Petals on a wet , black bough .

		But `` Lustra '' is something more than a hap - hazard and too inclusive collection ; it is the rec - ord of a retreat , a gradual withdrawal from life .

		In the early days when Pound first moved his physical lar and his aesthetic penates to Lon -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 635 don , he gave promise of achieving a personal utterance to match a decided personality .

		In many of the early poems , such as `` Pierre Vidal Old , '' `` Ballad of Gloom , '' and the exquisite `` Greek Epigram '' -LRB- all originally in `` Personae '' and `` Exultations '' -RRB- , the influence of
Browning	PERSON	and
Bertran de Born	ORGANIZATION	was unmistakable .

		But it was not overmastering , and it was confidently expected that a few years would bring Pound to a more striking and less scholastic habit of mind .

		The first part of this expectation was fulfilled , but , strangely enough , it only placed an emphasis on his inverted scholasticism .

		Pound , it became evident , was no pioneer , no intrepid traveller ; he was always an exponent of `` move - ments , '' a schoolman , alternating between an in - curably romantic veneration of the past and an even more cloistral aversion to the crowd .

		Now it is classicism that he embraces , now imagism , now a furtive effort to look at the violence of life in the terms of vorticism always the con - tact with the actual world is feared .

		More and more he shrinks back into literature .

		And so in `` Lustra , '' we find him established .

		He has become a connoisseur of the curious ; a haunter of old bookstalls ; a formalist arguing in a musty and deserted classroom .

		The library is his ivory tower , and he has locked himself in .

		Once in a while he opens a window and hears people laugh - ing and brawling in the street .

		But he listens only for a moment .

		The window is slammed , the curtains are drawn , the perfumed candles lit and he is back again , picking his way through literatures , amassing technicalities and dreaming of himself in his favorite role the pedagogue in power , the pundit on parade .

		The sum total of all this is staggering , the net result infinitesimal .

		Pound has gone on , collecting cultures , and all they have yielded him is an accent , an atti - tude .

		He poses before the mirror of his art and drapes himself in a coat of many colors that he has taken , patch by patch , from other and more authentic designers .

		He has really little to say , but he says it in a manner that gives his words a superficial significance .

		It is not so much the phrase as the gesture that accompanies it that is distinguished and arresting .

		It is this gesture that explains and identifies Pound .

		Some of his followers who are not so well known have sur - passed him in his own metiers : the
Aldingtons	PERSON	are far more Hellenic and chiseled than he ;
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	has a much lighter touch in recording the ironies and overtones of conversation ;
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	is a more successful experimenter in the clash of colors ;
Maxwell Bodenheim	ORGANIZATION	has a more delicate and dextrous imagination and a far greater feeling for words but Pound tri - umphs in the gesture .

		He puts up his hand , his fingers become nimble , his eyebrows go up and what , when spoken , is tawdry and trivial , be - comes glamorous with a possible mystery .

		This is his power .

		The escape into literature is com - plete ; the poetry is mostly dumb show , but he can still simulate life .

		He is
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's super-marionette and his art is poetry in pan - tomime .

		To what extent can true psychologic insight , not consciously determined by objective experi - ence , be credited to the literary artist ?

		Is there such a thing as an intuition or instinct of psychic verity anticipating , nay transcending , the more laborious constructions of the systematic psy - chologist ?

		And has the latter nothing but admiration and envy for the great artist 's un - guided , yet infallible , unravelings of the mys - teries of the human soul ?

		Perhaps .

		At least we may grant without fear of contradiction that modern psychology might rest content with the assurance of but half the grasp of mental phe - nomena that the great army of Shakespearean interpreters have , at one time and place or another , ascribed to their liege lord .

		And how does it stand with psychoanalysis ?

		Have the not altogether self-evident psychic mechanisms that
Freud	PERSON	has disinterred for us ever been anticipated in toto in a work of fiction ?

		It is not a question of whether this or that isolated bit of psychoan - alytic theory finds its parallel or confirmation in literature , such convergences of thought may be instanced by the hundred , but of whether there are to be found anywhere a literary plot and an underlying psychological analysis that are com - parable to a typical psychoanalytic clinical picture .

		The latest addition of Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their rapidly growing library of psy - choanalytic literature undertakes to answer this question .

		It consists of two parts : a short novel , or Novelle , by the prolific German writer Wil - helm
Jensen	PERSON	, entitled `` Gradiva , a Pompeiian Fancy '' ; and a Freudian interpretation of this work of fiction , `` Delusion and Dream in
Jen	LOCATION	- 636 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	sen 's Gradfoa '' The intrinsic literary merit of `` Gradiva '' hardly concerns us , except in so far as it puts us in an initially responsive or begrudg - ing mood when confronted by the succeeding commentary .

		The translator , as usual in these
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	translations from the German , has done her best to create a haze of literalness separating us from too close intellect - ual contact with the writer , yet I doubt whether even the best type of rendering would have altogether made credible
Freud	PERSON	's own estimate of the aesthetic value of the story .

		It has the same heavy combination of sentimental fancy and rather coarse jocularity that , in such tales as `` Die Nonna '' and `` Hoher als die Kirche , '' was served up to us in high-school days .

		The `` fancy '' wings its flight in comfortable view of German Gemutlichkeit .

		It is with somewhat of a shock that we learn that the
Gustav Freitag-Paul Heyse	PERSON	type of sentimentality was still flourishing in
Germany	LOCATION	in
1903	DATE	; presumably its germs are still intact .

		Of the jocular note running through
Jensen	PERSON	's fantasia Freud seems a bit oblivious , perhaps because there are weightier matters in hand .

		And yet , that
Freud	PERSON	's sense of humor is not altogether in abeyance and that he is aware of the smallness of the step that separates inter - pretative acuity from flight iness is shown by the final remark with which he calls a halt to his own resourcefulness : `` But we must stop or we may forget that
Hanold	PERSON	and
Gradiva	PERSON	are only creatures of our author . ''

		All psychoanalysts who are capable of making reservations should thank Freud for this sly dig in his own ribs .

		Let all this not obscure the fact that
Freud	ORGANIZATION	makes a case , and indeed a very plausible and sharp-witted one .

		Aside from certain short - comings , psychoanalytically considered , of
Jensen	PERSON	himself , and aside from a few cases of rather evident overdoing it on
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's part , the accord of `` Gradiva '' with psychoanalytic requirements is remarkable enough , however one chooses to explain it , and this despite the obvious fact that the suggestion of anything like psychological plausibility was far from
Jensen	PERSON	's conscious mind .

		That
Jensen	PERSON	intended to move almost entirely in the realm of pure fancy is indicated by two or three of his assumptions , assumptions credible only in a fantasia .

		The reader of the novel must take for granted , without motivation , the com - plete identity in appearance and manner of walk - ing of
Zoe Bertgang	PERSON	, the long-forgotten childhood playmate of Hanold , the archaeologist , and of Gradiva of the bas-relief dug up at
Pompeii	LOCATION	; the meeting of
Zoe and Hanold	PERSON	, who are next - door neighbors in a German town , in
Pompeii	LOCATION	itself ; and the fact of
Hanold	ORGANIZATION	's strange forget - fulness .

		The nucleus of the tale is the abnormal interest that Hanold takes in the bas-relief , more particularly in
Gradiva	LOCATION	's very peculiar trick of lifting the foot in walking .

		Psychoanalytically , this interest , which leads to fancies of a delusive nature , is interpretable as a substitutivc form of expression of the sexual instinct , all direct and normal manifestations of which have been denied an outlet by the conscious self .

		The reason for the repression , however , is not evident , for
Hanold	ORGANIZATION	's intensive preoccupation with classical archaeology is , at best , but an occasion or shaping circumstance , not a sufficient cause .

		At least so psychoanalysis ;
Jensen	PERSON	may have other ideas of what constitutes causality in a fantasia .

		As the only sexually utilizable material antedating the repression is
Hanold	LOCATION	's childish relations to
Zoe	PERSON	, now `` remembered '' only by the unconscious , it is natural that the dammed instinct should feed on a representation linked , via this unconscious memory , with his childish past .

		We have , there - fore , in
Hanold	LOCATION	's infatuation with the bas-relief a typical example of the unconscious infantile fixation which is so frequently at the back of neurotic phenomena .

		His delusional fancies are , in effect , a compromise formation induced by two conflicting volitional streams , the sexual impulse and the repressive force ; they `` satisfy '' the former through the power of an unconscious series of associations , the latter by guaranteeing a flight from sexual reality .

		The psychoanalytic com - plexion of
Jensen	PERSON	's `` Gradiva '' extends far beyond this delusional nucleus to a considerable number of details .

		Emotional transference , rationaliza - tion of motive , unconscious symbolization of desire , regression to infantile experiences all these familiar aspects of Freudian thinking find , or seem to find , frequent illustration in the novel .

		The very name
Gradiva	PERSON	, `` splendid in walking , '' which has been bestowed by Hanold on the girl of the bas-relief , turns out to be , as
Jensen	PERSON	him - self points out , but the Latinized equivalent of the living girl 's surname ,
Bertgang	LOCATION	; that
Hanold	ORGANIZATION	fancies something Hellenic in the features of the Pompeiian girl is a distorted reflex of the uncon - sciously remembered name Zoe ; his sudden departure for
Pompeii	LOCATION	, apparently a poorly mo - tivated caprice , is plausibly explained by Freud it symbolizing both his desire for Zoe-Gradiva -LRB- consciously rationalized as an absurd quest of
Gradiva	ORGANIZATION	's peculiar footprints in the lava of Pom -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 637 peii -RRB- and his unconscious fear of
Zoe	PERSON	, the work of the repression .

		To at least some extent
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's detailed analyses of two of the dreams introduced by
Jensen	PERSON	carry conviction , but only to some extent .

		The treatment of the `` latent content '' of the dreams is less plausible than the analysis of the delusions .

		This is precisely as it should be , for the chances of constructing dreams possessing psychological verisimilitude are not very high .

		Finally , the cure of Hanold 's delu - sions effected by Zoe may be described as an abridged replica of the Freudian psychotherapy .

		What are we to make of it all ?


Jensen	PERSON	him - self `` testily '' denied all knowledge of psycho - analysis .

		Are we then , with
Freud	PERSON	, driven to ascribe to
Jensen	PERSON	a high degree of instinctive psychological insight , an artist 's intuition that more than makes up for ignorance of psycho - logical theory ?

		In view of the very moderate artistic ability displayed by
Jensen	PERSON	and the ob - vious lack of deep earnestness in his treatment of the plot , one hesitates to commit himself to
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's thesis .

		We might be less disinclined to follow
Freud	PERSON	if the author of `` Gradiva '' were a Shakespeare , a
Balzac	LOCATION	, or a Dostoevsky .

		Per - haps we are unfair to
Jensen	PERSON	.

		An unprejudiced survey of his other works might bring convic - tion .

		Yet would it , after all , be rash to seek a less ambitious explanation in what the ethnolo - gists term `` cultural convergence '' ?


Jensen	PERSON	might have started with the purely mechanical idea of tying an arbitrarily interrupted past to a sentimental present and have hit upon the device of unconscious sous-entendus as a convenient means .

		This would be tantamount to an uncon - scious aping of the psychoanalytic procedure .

		It would also explain
Jensen	PERSON	's failure to motivate what
Freud	ORGANIZATION	interprets as a repression .

		Or , still more plausibly , a modicum of psychological in - sight , say into the facts of unconscious memory , may have been helped out by such a mechanical device as is here suggested .

		However we decide as to the psychoanalytic credentials of
Wilhelm Jensen	PERSON	, we may accept
Freud	PERSON	's study as a sugar-coated introduction to the subject of psychoanalysis itself .

		As such it may have its uses .

		A scientific confirmation of Freudian psychology it can hardly claim to be .

		While it does not seem to the reviewer to repre - sent a full day 's work in the psychoanalytic work - shop , it is too good a thing to be dismissed as the vagary of an off day .

		May not Freud have taken a half-holiday when he wrote it ?

		HISTORY OF

		The war began in southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	; its principal cause was the Mittel-Europa project of
Germany	LOCATION	, looking to the bridging of the
Balkans	LOCATION	and the
Bosphorus	LOCATION	with a German-controlled political and economic empire ; and while the ulti - mate military decision will undoubtedly be reached on the soil of
France	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	, or Ger - many , many of the major problems of the paci - fication will centre about the future of the lands of the east and south .

		Prominent among these problems will be the restoration and indemnifi - cation of Servia .

		Strong interest will attach also to the fate of the loose-jointed , sorely beset dual monarchy ,
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, its boundary changes , its political reconstruction -LRB- whether complete dissolution , fuller federalization , or closer consolidation -RRB- , and its economic ruin or possible rehabilitation .

		In his `` Austria-Hungary : The Polyglot Em - pire '' Mr.
Wolf von Schierbrand	PERSON	, traveller and journalist , has written a popular account of the Austro-Hungarian peoples , their racial difficulties , political life , economic problems , and war con - ditions , which , although on the whole less useful than
Geoffrey Drage	PERSON	's well-known ``
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	, '' has the advantage of being consider - ably more recent and more readable .

		The author lived in
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	from
1912	DATE	until
1917	DATE	.

		He strongly disclaims the intention to write `` a mere war book . ''

		Yet more than a third of his chapters deal specifically with the state of the country during the war , and the chief value of his work lies in the fact that it furnishes almost the only intimate account that we have of what has been going on in the
Hapsburg	LOCATION	dominions since the war began .

		All the world knows that the crux of the Aus tro-Hungarian situation is , and has always been , the interrelations of the empire-kingdom 's multi - fold racial groups .

		After fairly well outlining the elements in this problem , Mr.
von Schier	PERSON	- brand discusses with some deftness the problem 's inherent difficulty , and goes on to consider the possible lines of its solution .

		He shows that the American `` melting-pot '' theory has no applica - tion in the dual monarchy , mainly for the reason that all the bitterly contending racial elements Germans , Poles , Czechs , Ruthenians ,
Magyars	ORGANIZATION	, 638 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	Slovaks , Serbs , Italians , and what not claim their dwelling places as their ancestral homes , look upon their neighbors as intruders and foes , cling tenaciously to their cultural inheritances , and regard any union with their rivals as ulti - mately desirable only if they themselves are left in a position to rule .

		The view is taken that the present war will make it necessary to `` cut the Gordian knot '' ; although we are also told that , without the war , matters could not long have gone as they were .

		Assuming that it is forever impossible to weld the polyglot populations of the monarchy into a compact state , the author contends that the only feasible course , if the Hapsburg dominions are not to dissolve utterly , is to grant to every impor - tant racial group the essentials of self-govern - ment .

		He describes the plan of the late Archduke
Francis Ferdinand	PERSON	to supersede the Aus - gleich with an instrument reorganizing the dominions on a triple instead of a dual basis , with
Austria	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	, and a Jugoslav -LRB- South Slav -RRB- union as distinct political entities ; and he shows that this interesting plan would have fallen quite short of its object , not only because of the hostility of the Hungarians , but because such other reforms as were to have gone with it would still have left under the Emperor 's sway a dozen discontented nationalities .

		The Arch - duke 's scheme did not go far enough .

		`` The only radical remedy for the ills which race strife has bred in
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	is self-government for each and every part of the whole .

		The ideal must , in fact , be the establishment of something like a
United States of Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, only more so .

		That is , the self-government in each state of this prospective federation must be , to accomplish all that is desired , more complete than it is in its American prototype .

		Common ties must be confined to a very few . ''

		That there are tremendous obstacles to such a readjustment is freely admitted .

		But the author feels certain that between it and the utter disso - lution of the monarchy there will be , after the war , no middle ground , and he ventures the pre - diction that `` probably the means will be found . ''

		It may be added that in his speech opening the Reichsrath last
May	DATE	the young successor of
Francis Joseph	PERSON	pointed the way to a constitu - tional reorganization based on greatly increased autonomy for the `` kingdoms and lands '' of the monarchy .

		Mr.
von Schierbrand	PERSON	makes the common mis - take of supposing that foot-notes and bibliograph - ical lists frighten away the `` general '' reader ; they do so only if the subject treated or the man - ner of treatment is itself dull .

		The present vol - ume would gain greatly by being to some extent documented .

		Important information is given and interesting judgments are passed with no citation of sources , authorities , or other means of corroboration ; so that while the book as a whole carries weight as the work of a competent and sympathetic observer , it lacks the value for the scholar and publicist which one would sup - pose it might readily have been given .

		A book of very different type is Mr.
Temper	PERSON	- ley 's `` History of
Serbia	LOCATION	. ''

		Its author is known as a tireless explorer of the diplomatic collections of the
British Record Office	ORGANIZATION	, and as the writer of more than one scholarly volume on modern international relations .

		Begun as a history of
Serbia	LOCATION	from the revival of her independence in the nineteenth century to the Balkan war of
1912	DATE	, the present work has broadened into a his - tory reaching backward to the first coming of the Southern Slavs into their Danubian and Bal - kan habitats .

		It closes with the events of
1910	DATE	.

		The book bristles with evidence of painstaking research ; it is well documented ; and it contains a select bibliography of very satisfactory propor - tions .

		The writing of Balkan history is a task calling for peculiar talents .

		The sources are plentiful , yet fragmentary and conflicting .

		Fundamentals are exceptionally difficult to hew from labyrinths of detail .

		Above all , it is hard not to be influ - enced by the susceptibilities and prejudices of the numerous rival nationalities .

		In the
Balkans	LOCATION	, it has been well said , history is a sort of padtk warfare in which every native scholar is a gen - eral .

		Mr.
Temperley	PERSON	has overcome these difficulties with notable success .

		He has the advantage which falls to the onlooker as against the par - ticipant .

		He is a master of sound historical criti - cism .

		And he has simplified his problem by tracing the fortunes of a single branch of the
South Slavic	LOCATION	race , rather than trying to write a composite history .

		Similar treatment of the Bos - nians , the Serbo-Croats , the Slovenes , and other South Slav peoples would make for clearness of comprehension by the outside world .

		In the light of the author 's conclusions , the tragedy of
Serbia	LOCATION	under Austro-Hungarian con - quest takes on added color .

		`` If there ever is a Southern Slav federation , '' he affirms , `` it will be because of the kingdom of
Serbia	LOCATION	, which h , ^
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 639 held up the same kind of hope and example of unity to the Southern Slavs that the kingdom of
Piedmont	LOCATION	did to the Southern Italians .

		The history of the Serbian race in
Montenegro	LOCATION	and
Serbia	LOCATION	is therefore the most important , because these lands are the core of that rugged stock which has preserved or achieved freedom , and thus become a hope and a beacon to the Slavs enslaved under rulers or imprisoned in other lands . ''

		This judgment is the more impressive by reason of the fact that throughout his narra - tive the author makes no attempt to obscure the weaknesses and faults of the Serbs , and especially of their ruling dynasties .

		Greek Vases DOURIS AND THE PAINTERS OF GREEK VASES .

		EUTHYMIDES AND His FELLOWS .

		By
Joseph Clark Hoppin	PERSON	.

Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 4	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The average museum visitor , in his wander - ings through the galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	and Amer - ica , usually passes by with but a swift glance the cases of black and red Greek pottery , thus unwittingly depriving himself of a pleasure afforded by the works of but few periods in the history of art .

		For the value of the study of Greek vases , battered and fragmentary though their condition frequently is , lies in the fact , first , that they afford us an amazing revelation of Greek life .

		Second , they yield a unique pleasure to the mind sensitive to certain aesthetic qualities to balance and exquisite adaptation of figures to space , to the grace of curved lines , the swiftness and firmness of straight ; and this , too , notwithstanding the fact that the painters were probably mere craftsmen .

		Third , to the person gifted with imagination , they offer a conception , vague though it may be , of the general character and development of Greek drawing and painting , a lost art , now known only through meagre literary references .

		Of interest to those who have already acquired a love for the Greek vase , as well as to those who may desire to gain an understanding of the craft , is the publication of three volumes which will help to fill the need for books on this sub - ject in English .

		Two have already appeared Miss
Bettina Kahnweiler	PERSON	's translation of
M. Pottier	PERSON	's `` Douris et Les Peintres des Vases Grecs , '' and Mr.
Hoppin	PERSON	's `` Euthymides and his Fellows '' ; while the third , Mr.
J. D. Beaz	PERSON	- ley 's `` Attic Red Figured Vases in American Museums , '' is announced by the
Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press as a forthcoming work .

		And it is of peculiar advantage that the first two , at least , treat of the subject at the most inspiring point in its evolution , when , for naivete , freshness of imagination , and the ethical quality of its strug - gle to solve problems inherent in the developing technique of drawing , it is comparable with the art of the fifteenth century in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		For the layman , no book can serve better as an introduction to the subject than that of
M. Pottier	PERSON	.

		This first-rate authority on Greek vases , abandoning technicalities and moot ques - tions , has brought all his learning to a simple and sympathetic exposition of the subject , not for the professional archaeologist , as he says in his opening sentences , but for the reading public .

		His monograph is now made more accessible through
Miss Kahnweiler	PERSON	's translation , to which has been added a preface by Miss
Jane Ellen Harrison	PERSON	, on the relation of Greek vase-painting to Greek literature and mythology .

		Twenty - five illustrations , some in color , accompany the text .

		In his first chapter
M. Pottier	PERSON	briefly dis - cusses the importance of the study of Greek vases as a means of dimly discerning the nature of the pictorial art of classic
Greece	LOCATION	, and states as his reason for selecting
Douris	PERSON	as a typical exponent of the craft , first , the fact that this painter is representative of the culmination of the manufacture of Greek pottery ; and second , that to him can be attributed the largest number of vases bearing the name of the painter .

		In the next three chapters , the author tells of the social conditions of the vase-painter , gives a glimpse into a factory in the
Kerameikos	LOCATION	, touches upon the great pottery industry in
Athens	LOCATION	, and suggests how these skilled craftsmen must have been keenly sensitive to the works of art by which they were surrounded ; describes the workshop and tools ; and follows step by step the technical process of the production of a piece of red - figured work .

		In the remaining chapters the author dis - cusses the vases of
Douris	PERSON	, dividing them , accord - ing to the content of the painting , into three groups : mythological , martial , and genre , for the last of which
Douris	PERSON	showed a decided pref - erence , introducing us to many an interesting everyday scene of contemporary Athenian life .

		In conclusion the writer summarizes in a peculiarly happy way the historic and aesthetic THE DIAL -LSB- Decemhr value of his painter .

		In fact , the chief value of the book is the charm that results from the warmly appreciative and sympathetic attitude of M. Pettier toward his subject .

		The translator , however , could have rendered the volume more valuable to the student , had she added , in footnotes , the results of late criti - cism , which , for instance , accredits
Douris	PERSON	with more work than the twenty-eight pieces men - tioned by
M. Pettier	PERSON	.

		A different aim is found in Mr.
Hoppin	PERSON	's monograph , which is a scholarly and more techni - cal presentation of the works of a small , but closely allied , group led by the painter
Euthym	PERSON	- ides .

		The writer arranges his material in the form of a catalogue raisonne of the signed works , each accompanied by a detailed description , a bibliography , and , wherein lies the unusual value of this work , an illustration of every vase dis - cussed , many of superior quality , as they are reproduced from the Furtwangler-Reichhold plates .

		He then effects his reconstruction from the following data : -LRB- a -RRB- signatures and inscrip - tions ; -LRB- b -RRB- use of kalos names ; -LRB- c -RRB- relation to the other artists of the period ; -LRB- d -RRB- style and technical details .

		His deductions are that histor - ically Euthymides was active in the early part of the fifth century , had some connection with the black-figured work , and with
Andokides	PERSON	and his group , and was a contemporary and rival of
Euphronius	LOCATION	.

		Artistically he possessed a well - defined style a fact which has been established by a morphological study of the figures and a re - duction of them to geometric formulae .

		On the hypothesis of this reconstruction , by the comparative method , Mr.
Hoppin	PERSON	attributes to Euthymides ten unsigned vases , arranging his data in the same catalogue form as in the case of the signed works .

		By a like study of four vases of unquestioned signature , the writer determines the historical place and style of
Phintias	LOCATION	, whom he considers an intimate associate , if not actual partner , of Euthymides .

		Finally he discusses the more shadowy personalities of Kleophrades and
Hypsis	PERSON	, the former , because of his relation , at the beginning of his career , to
Euthymides	LOCATION	, as a probable pupil ; and the latter , because of his strong Euthymides characteristics .

		Students of the history of art will value Mr.
Hoppin	PERSON	's monograph not only for its reconstruc - tions , but also for its exposition of a method , logical and scholarly .

		Another `` Apologia '' A SPDUTUAL PILGRIMAGE .

		By
R. J. Campbell	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
D. Applcton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- This book belongs to the type of intimate literature represented earlier by
Newman	PERSON	's `` Apo - logia '' and in our own day by the autobiograph - ical confessions of Benson and
Tyrrell	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` It is best to tell the whole story of my religious life and to let it speak for itself , '' says Mr.
Camp	PERSON	- bell .

		`` Most of the arguments on both sides are already outworn , ... I have therefore confined myself to describing step by step the road by which I came to the position I occupy today . ''

		The vogue of such religious autobiography is great , and it is significant .

		Abstract theology may be alien to our generation ; philosophical dis - cussion always appeals to limited groups .

		But the modern world is hungry for records of expe - rience , and the welcome accorded them shows that men are still intensely conscious that they are `` pilgrims of eternity , '' and crave fellowship and guidance on the journey .

		Fellowship rather than guidance is to be found in Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's book .

		The secret of the au - thor 's power over vast audiences is not hard to discover .

		Such sympathetic eagerness and sweet - ness of nature are assets in the pulpit and will always win the world .

		The delightful account of the boyhood in
Ulster	LOCATION	is full of beauty and humor , and incidentally throws much light on the present psychology of Irish affairs .

		The lov - ing and reverent discipleship toward Dean Pagct and other friends , the pleasure in great books , for
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	has been a wide if not a deep reader , the authentic note of spiritual experi - ence , are charming traits traits of a man so lovable that his unknown hearers or readers feel at once a personal bond established .

		But these very traits are those of the fellow - traveller rather than the leader .

		The book has high representative value ; one finds in it a reflec - tion of many characteristic phases in the religious experience of
England	LOCATION	and , in a measure , of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope during the
last quarter-century	DATE	.

		One does not find in it an original contribution to
Chris	PERSON	- tian thought .

		There is nothing to compare , for instance , with the great concluding chapter of the `` Apologia '' for depth and fervor of thought , or for power of expression .

		Yet change of faith .

		in the cases of both
Newman	PERSON	and
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, sprang really , not out of thought , but out of per - sonality .

		Intellectual as well as spiritual travail preceded Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's sincere and deliberate
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 641 conversion from non-conformity to Anglicanism .

		But those to whom news of that conversion came as a surprise will learn now that it was inevita - ble .


Newman	PERSON	, as a little boy , for some myste - rious reason drew rosaries in his schoolbooks and crossed himself in the dark .

		So
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, in conservative Presbyterian Ulster , where Orange - men abounded and contempt for Catholic Ire - land dominated emotion , tells us : `` I remember making for myself an Oratory in a remote cor - ner of our woods , and carving a rude crucifix for it as well as erecting a rough stone altar .

		Why I did this I can not imagine , as I am sure I never saw anything of the kind anywhere else at that time . ''

		These things have to be , and it is a foolish soul that fights against the call from a region below reason .

		Presently we are at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and the author has to record the spell cast over him by the holy lives of the priests with whom he was there in contact , and by the lofty beauty and mystic im - plications of Catholic life and worship .

		The forces which withheld him at that time from the Anglican priesthood were partly an honorable loyalty to his Presbyterian forbears , and a recog - nition of the work of the
Spirit	ORGANIZATION	within them , partly a liberalism which questioned `` the author - ity on which we accepted Christian doctrine '' and shrank half consciously from dogmatic de - mands .

		He felt that High Anglicanism led straight to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Also , he was `` in the mood for sacrifice , '' and `` would rather work with those who had not social recognition than with those who had . ''

		Admirable objections , yet all the time the spell was at work .

		`` The two sources of my spiritual life are the Ulster Pres - byterianism of my childhood , and the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Catholicism of my Oxford days .

		To the latter , humanly speaking , I owe my soul . ''

		Anyone reading the record of those years , though aware that it may be somewhat colored by feelings of a later date , would be certain that in the end nostalgia of the Altar , as
Tyrrell	ORGANIZATION	used to put it , would lead the wanderer home .

		But the home-coming was by a roundabout path , and in describing it the book treats of nearly all the forces which have swayed modern religious minds .

		Chapter VI , on `` The Labor Movement , '' is interesting in its record of a growing social radicalism , and noteworthy for the gentleness with which its advanced positions are maintained .

		But the dramatic centre of the book is in the controversy gathering around the New Theology , and in the progress of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's mind before and after .

		That work , written under the temporary influence of a Modernist
Christol	PERSON	- ogy , monistic to the verge of Pantheism , called forth , among other comment , a reply from Camp - bell 's honored leader of old at
Oxford , Bishop Gore	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rare phenomenon !

		The author was con - vinced by the refutation , or at least was driven back to former types of faith , which in the end re - sumed their hold .

		A man who can be brought round to his opponent 's point of view by that op - ponent 's attack on him is a real Christian ; and the fine humility , as well as the impressionable quality of mind which gives book and man their charm , is peculiarly evident at this point .

		The whole discussion of modern Christology , moreover , of the `` Christ-Myth '' theory and the Apocalyptic conception of Christianity , is lucid and valuable to the reader least versed in theological meth - ods ; nor does the discussion lose cogency from the ardent devotional tone which pervades it .

		To be religious , Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	keenly says some - where in his book , is a gift of nature ; to be spiritually minded is the work of grace , and comes after long effort only .

		This book is the self-revelation of a spiritually minded man who knows whereof he speaks .

		Perhaps Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's sanguine temper over - estimates the degree to which the modernist Christology is now discredited ; but he is not alone in reaction from it .

		Younger non-con - formists of distinction , as for example Dr. Or - chard in his brilliant `` Necessity of Christ , '' are also feeling their way back to faith in the his - torical and supernatural basis of Christianity , as well as toward a Sacramental and Catholic philosophy .

		Once more the ancient sanctities have been attacked by the tumultuous roar and rush of an incoming tide ; and again as the waves recede they stand firm as rocks above the welter .

		In the course of geologic periods , waves wear rocks away ; but the Rock of Ages shows no change as yet to mortal vision .

		Bishop Gore pointed out to
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	that much which repelled him in current Protestant orthodoxy was equally repellent to the Catholic genius : and insistence that the mystic Christ and the Jesus of history are one , led him back into the Catholic fold .

		`` It was the Christ of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	that stood forth from the newer criticism of the gospel sources , not the Christ of liberal Protestantism . ''

		Very gently , with true loving-kindness toward all ,
Campbell	PERSON	returned to his old home .

		Has he reached the end of his journey ?

		Every reader asks the question .

		He 642 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	explains that he has carefully studied and re - jected the claims of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		But a temperament like his rarely reaches a passive goal .

		Mean - time , wherever he may find himself , his power to contribute to the larger Christian unity which begins to seem more than a dream is in many ways unique .

		His treatment of the vexed ques - tion of Reordination is especially cogent and timely ; the direct and practical experience of varied religious types , the respect for all , the lofty view of the Whole Body , the
Sacra	LOCATION	- mental philosophy , above all the personal piety breathing through every page , equip him to render greater services to his generation in the future than in the past .

		His autobiography , so typical in its very weaknesses , may not give much satisfaction to minds ready to penetrate new regions ; but it does better .

		It is the reve - lation of a true Christian , unspoiled by popu - larity , humble , consecrate , and never disobedient to his heavenly vision .

		From the point of view of the possessing classes , the Industrial Revolution in
England	LOCATION	meant the dawn of modern greatness , the con - quest of nature by man 's inventive skill , the en - dowment of society with a wealth of commodities and services .

		From the point of view of the worker who produced these commodities , the In - dustrial Revolution was a cruel and shameless exploitation of the mass of a race by the classes holding economic and political power .

		The modern social historian is far more interested in this latter point of view than in the former , and presses insistently on these sorest spots of English civilization .

		Never has the story been told with such masterly precision or with such illuminating reference to the original sources of the time as in this book by the
Hammonds	PERSON	.

		It is not a large book , but the perspective and proportion are so perfect that the life of a whole era , analyzed searchingly and profoundly , passes before your eyes as you read .

		The book is virtually a study in the technique of class-manipulation .

		Not only are events and conflicts studied , but the whole intellectual and spiritual background of this class struggle as events were reflected in it is presented .

		This is `` social '' psychology as an intellectual fine art .

		We see not only the cruelly ingenious union of capitalism and government for the purpose of keeping the working classes in servitude , but we see the philosophy by which capitalists and poli - ticians rationalized their crude will-to-power into attitudes that satisfied them as necessary .

		The
Hammonds	PERSON	have used their material with the utmost skill to show us the intellectual structure of this terrible civilization .

		In their early chap - ters , `` The New Power , '' `` The New Town , '' `` The New Discipline , '' they show the inexor - able hemming in of the workers by the new capitalism .

		In the later chapters on `` The Mind of the Rich , '' `` The Conscience of the Rich , '' `` The Defences of the Poor , '' `` The Mind of the Poor , '' `` The Ambitions of the Poor , '' the authors analyze the states of mind , religious , political , predatory , that accompanied the new subjugation and the reactions against it .

		In their feeling for class attitudes , for the rational - izations that accompany the economic war , for the sinister manipulation of government by cap - ital , the
Hammonds	PERSON	have an intellectual tool which should be in the hands of every one who tries to write of this modern industrial era .

		And they have produced a book which can fairly be called a model of method and perspective .

		The writers are filled with the need of or - ganizing a society in which `` all men and women have an equal and recognized share . ''

		The age they describe , which still lives on in our
Ameri	LOCATION	- can industrial civilization , thought of industry only `` as offering rapid and tempting prizes to the spirit of gain which was regarded as the great motive power of human progress . ''

		The workingmen leaders who were right then , and are right now , saw that `` if life was to be en - riched by the new industry , machinery must be made subordinate to the men who used it . ''

		The struggle to effect that subordination has still after a century scarcely got beyond the first skir - mishes .

		This book reflects the revolutionizing of economic thought ; it insists that
England	LOCATION	and the other industrial nations by inference shall no longer be `` two nations , '' divided by a bitter class struggle , but a genuine common - wealth in which machinery becomes the servant of life and not its master .

		`` The Town La - bourer '' should be read for its constant play of suggest iveness upon our modern situation , and the stern questions its material puts to us of how much our ruling classes know of liberty to - da > -

evening	TIME	, was kept from the novel-reader 's delicate sensibilities .

		One somehow received the impression from one 's youthful reading that the people in novels rarely had to work .

		They did work , it is true ; but the hero always dressed for dinner , and he could be had for a love scene in a shadowy pergola at any hour of the day .

		Even when his work and its influence were the theme , the spiritual situation was more likely to be presented than the weariness of the hours from morning till lunch and from one o'clock till five .

		English and continental literature still make one think of the dominant leisure classes , though they may be felt only through their pressure on the laboring man .

		America is the workaday nation of the world , garish , loud , and unrefined .

		There are almost as many million - aires in the
United States	LOCATION	as the Russian peasant believes there are , but it is doubtful whether there are many who do not spend a great part of their days at a desk .

		And whether judged fairly or not , the millionaire is notoriously bo - vine as regards the `` finer shades . ''

		The work of making millions has completely coarsened him .

		The three black
Pennys	PERSON	are three men of one family , separated by generations but bound by a strain of melancholy , `` black blood , '' which gives them the appellation .

		All three are in - heritors of the Penny iron mills and wealth .

		This offers what seems to be , and is , a typically American background ; but the characters are in it and not of it .


Gilbert Penny	PERSON	, the founder of the iron business and the only one who gives his life in true American fashion to its develop - ment , is merely the father of the first of the three `` black ''
Pennys	PERSON	.

		His successors are all men of complete leisure , of genuine culture and wealth , free to do as they please and breathe an atmosphere of aristocracy decidedly European .

		All the men and women of the story , indeed , are possessed of a refinement that reminds one of the people who interested
Henry James	PERSON	.

		The iron mills pound , flame , and roar outside , al - ways outside , for they are never allowed to come into the drawing-room .

		It is , so to speak , in drawing-rooms , softly lighted and faultlessly furnished , that all three stories take place .

		This is the impression of the whole work .

		The au - thor himself writes with a subtlety and a sensi - tive penetration that are the fruits of careful reading , if not study , of English and French models .

		There are none of the bold , bald ob - servations of a Spoon River historian .

		So much , then , as a friendly attempt to rid Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	's novel of a complimentary ad - vertisement which it can not fairly be asked to live up to .

		To say that it is not American , is not to derogate the novel .

		The publisher , you know , may have meant by `` American , '' a novel written by an American and printed in this country !

		Obviously , the adjectives `` splendid '' and `` un - successful '' were chosen with care .

		It is un - successful , first of all , because it is not a unit .

		It is divided into three parts that are three stories .

		In spite of a liberal and often tiresome , though always skilful , use of the mechanics of genealogy and inheritance , the reader is wholly unconvinced that these men and their stories are in any way related .

		Why the author is not successful , despite his clever use of genealogical connectives , is too subtle and complex a subject to be dealt with in anything less than an essay .

		One is generously tempted to excuse him on the grounds that he has attempted one of the most difficult feats in fiction , until one remembers the impressiveness of `` The Way of All Flesh . ''

		When the first part of the book has been finished , and a brilliant piece of work it is , the disappoint - ment at discovering that one is to know no more of
Howat Penny	ORGANIZATION	and
Ludowika	LOCATION	, that one has finished a short story , is so discouraging that patience must be coaxed to return .

		Jasper Pen - ny 's story follows , and it has a hard time indeed making a place for itself in the mind of the reader who has become fond of
Howat	LOCATION	,
Ludo	PERSON	- wika , and the whole first Penny family .

		But it finally does so , because of the author 's vivid presentation of human psychology .

		At this stage , in fact , forgiveness is the feeling one has , until the same experience must be gone through again with the third story .

		It is too much .

		One de - termines to tell everyone , including the author , that this is not a novel , but three short stories .

		644 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	Contributing also to the ultimate failure of the work as a novel is a smaller flaw , a flaw , however , that is cumulative in its effect upon the reader who likes Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	's people .

		This flaw has been mentioned .

		The characters move in the setting as though it were a mere stage back-drop .

		It might even be said that they move hither and thither through it with no more effect upon themselves than if it were air and mist .

		At first the reader 's feeling is too vague to be called even a suspicion .

		Little by little he finds that these people really live in an abstract world , that they could be taken from their setting without changing their fates in the least .

		Not one of the Penny men is really affected by the iron mills ; the wealth that affects them comes from the mills , but the money might have been inherited from perfect strangers and their stories would have been the same .

		This independence of the atmosphere of the surround - ings extends even to the weather .

		The moods , the thoughts , the spirits of the various char - acters are in no way changed by those minute influences which make up so large a part of the mosaic of life .

		Memories of the exquisite blend - ing of man and nature by such men as Mere - dith , Maupassant , and Flaubert flood into the reviewer 's mind .

		The virtue of the book is its psychology , its delineation of the minds and souls of these peo - ple .

		For this it deserves the adjective `` splen - did . ''

		And lest the reader of the review be un - desirably biased by a comparison of the space devoted to praise and blame , let me say un - equivocally that the book is worth reading .

		One hands it on immediately to one 's best friend , and gives the friend full permission to do the same .

		Every person in the book lives , lives in his or her small time with an attraction not incom - parable to that of some of the great characters in fiction .

		At times you forget the words and paper , you sympathize to the point of embarrass - ment .

		This is no small accomplishment for a writer , and it is Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	's .

		There are flaws , but one of them is not false or super - ficial psychology .

		You are surprised not by what the people say , but by the fact that they say just what they should say .

		They react in normal , vivid , vital ways .

		In the world of fiction-pup - pets such individuals stand out with all the at - traction of personalities .

		It is because his people are so `` splendid '' that one must call the novel unsuccessful .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS ARIZONA THE WONDERLAND .

		By
George Wharton James	PERSON	.

		Page ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.


Arizona	LOCATION	's signal claim to publicity has rested these many years solely on the Grand Canyon .

		We learn from the book before us that it can boast of other wonders of nature .


George Wharton James	PERSON	's self-imposed , and not altogether unsuccessful , task is to establish the truth of his statement that `` With but one exception the ocean
Arizona	LOCATION	has everything that has rendered
California	LOCATION	so world-famed , with the addition of many scenic , geologic , ethnologic , and archeologic features that
California	LOCATION	does not possess . ''

		It would seem that Mr.
James	PERSON	knows his
Arizona	LOCATION	as well as the
California	LOCATION	of which he has written so much , for in defence of his enthusiasm he says : `` Of course I shall be accused of ` fine writ - ing . '

		I always am , by men who have not seen what I am writing about .

		How foolish for those who know not to criticize the endeavors of those who do . ''

		Too bulky for a guide book , too discursive for quick reference , the work nevertheless makes pleasant and often informative reading .

		After `` Glimpses of the Land , '' in which the reader is taken in imagination on a sketchy trip over the whole state , the remainder of the book satisfies the curiosity thus aroused by developing more inten - sively the subjects enumerated .

		Of especial inter - est are the facts relating to the various tribes of Indians , among whom the author has spent much time , studying their ceremonies , their ways of living , and their histories .

		He concludes that the ancient cliff-dwellers are to be identified with the present-day Pueblo Indians .

		We learn of the existence of ruins that do not come within the ken of any but the specialist ; one of them ,
Betatakin	LOCATION	, with
Nonnezoshie	PERSON	, a great natural arch rising above it , was seen for the first time by a white man in
1909	DATE	.

		In the
White Mountains	ORGANIZATION	, the author says , new dwellings are often brought to light , and there are still many that have yet to be discovered .

		The industrial and intellectual phases of
Ari	PERSON	- zona life are also recorded , so that the book is comprehensive in its scope .

		It is likewise a well - furnished volume , illustrated with a dozen color - plates besides many other pictures and a map .

		POLITICS AND PERSON Ai.rriES .

		By the Right Hon.
G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		The book itself is thoroughly engaging .

		It is one of those comfortable books which one can take up at odd moments with the assurance that they will prove good moments a book genial without loss of seriousness , thoughtful without being profound , and -LRB- grateful virtue -RRB- contempo - rary without being harrowing .

		The politics that
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 645 Mr.
Russell	PERSON	is concerned with is current English politics , the personalities are mostly present-day political personalities both judged from the van - tage of a man read in history and reared in the society of the high Victorians .

		Everywhere the author is sure-tempered ; everywhere he is shrewd and humane ; everywhere he sees Britishly .

		His analysis of the duties of representatives , where conscience and constituency are at odds -LRB- `` M. P. or Delegate ? '' -RRB-

		; his reasoned assertion of the political influence of the British monarch -LRB- `` The Whigs and the Constitution '' -RRB- ; his characteriza - tion of
John Bull	PERSON	as a type that is passing -LRB- `` John Bull in
Ireland	LOCATION	'' -RRB- these are samples of topics that exact attention ; and with them such judg - ments as , `` England remains the most religious country in
Europe	LOCATION	'' ; `` the true
spring	DATE	of oratory is the old Holy Well of Romance '' said , con - cerning `` Demagogues , '' with
Lloyd George	PERSON	in the category ; or , `` the pitifullest and meanest outcry which can be uttered is the outcry of the well-to-do classes against expenditure on the instruction of the poor . ''

		But , after all , it is not the book , it is the author that stirs the imagination .

		Is he , as a type , doomed to pass along with old
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	?

		The propertied Liberal , political both by nature and opportunity ; the aristocrat , unostentatious but family-conscious ; the Oxford man , who moves in the classics without apparatus and remembers
Jowett	PERSON	; the churchman , familiar with the prob - lems of the mind and capable of setting his own intelligent appraisal upon the thing we call sci - ence -LRB- `` The Dark Side of Science '' -RRB- combine such qualities with humor and humanity , honor and chivalry , all sanely proportioned , and you will limn such a portrait as Mr.
Russell	PERSON	all unconsciously draws of himself in his essays , rich in reminiscence but awake to the present hour .

		No one need expect to find in `` Politics and Per - sonalities '' solutions for the great political prob - lems of the near future , nor are they likely to be solved by men of its author 's type : the times are cataclysmic , and experience cast in Victorian moulds can not be their measure .

		But it is not the least poignant of our qualms to fear lest the cataclysm shall have swept from the future the possibility of perpetuating this same fine type of the political man .

		DAYS OF DESTINY .

		By
R. Gorell Barnes	PERSON	.

		Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Another book of war verse comes from a young author , now member of the
Rifle Brigade	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is written by following , unconsciously perhaps , the familiar patterns .

		In ordinary orderly metrical rhymes the writer celebrates `` The Path of Hon - our , '' `` The Cliffs of
England	LOCATION	, '' `` The Fall of
Namur	LOCATION	. ''

		The verse is neither beautiful nor poor ; it is merely commonplace .

		There are no arresting visions , no thrilling beauties , no stirring agonies .

		It is true that the finest poetry in the world deals with the oldest things in the world .

		The dreadfulness of war , the dearness of home , the glory of a goal seen through a mist of blood and tears , these are close enough to men 's hearts to be at the root of poetry .

		But neither good subject-matter nor the will to self-expression , alone or together , can create art .

		And that inti - mate wedding of the sensitive and the communi - cative which results in fine art can occur even when the form is as old as iambic tetrameter .

		For all this versifier 's sentiments , he has no pas - sions .

		He expresses in traditional way tradi - tional feelings .

		His is neither the wilfulness of original emotion nor the unique significance of an original manner .

		Indeed , he lacks even the tradition of his tradition : the note of
Tenny	ORGANIZATION	- sonian lyrism .

		LETTERS ABOUT SHELLEY .

		Interchanged by Three Friends
Edward Dowden	PERSON	,
Rich	PERSON	- ard
Garnett	PERSON	, and
William Michael Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Edited , with an Introduction , by
R. S. Gar	PERSON	- nett .

		Doran ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		`` Writing maketh an exact man , '' says
Bacon	PERSON	.

		Behind any good biography or any carefully established text is hidden an amount of labor on minutiae that is both amazing and depressing .

		Yet this scholarly research need not be dryasdust ; it may be accompanied by noble enthusiasm and the spirit of unselfish sacrifice .

		Both the toil and the generosity of scholars are illustrated in the volume which Mr.
R. S. Garnett	PERSON	has edited .

		The book is valuable , besides , to lovers of Shelley .

		It comprises the greater part of the correspond - ence of three notable authorities on the poet , pre - sents their discussions in detail from
1869	DATE	to
1906	DATE	, and reflects the broad-minded interest of each in literature and life in general .

		Of the three ,
Richard Garnett	PERSON	was first to win recog - nition as an authority on
Shelley	PERSON	.

		He hoped some day to write the poet 's biography ; but crowded with duties at the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	, and drawn by the force of circumstances into other literary undertakings , he never found the neces - sary leisure .

		To him
Rossetti	PERSON	, himself become known for painstaking research , presently applied for assistance in a memoir .

		So unstinted was the response that a firm friendship between the two men resulted .

		After a time
Rossetti	PERSON	called Gar - nett 's attention to `` a Whitman enthusiast
Edward Dowden	PERSON	. ''

		Before long
Dowden	PERSON	in turn was studying
Shelley	PERSON	and corresponding with
Garnett	PERSON	about a multitude of details .

		Sir
Percy Shelley	PERSON	, now hopeless of securing
Garnett	PERSON	's serv - ices , invited
Dowden	PERSON	to write the official biogra - phy .

		The invitation was accepted ; still more rigorous investigation was made necessary , and an intensified correspondence between
Dowden	ORGANIZATION	646 THE DIAL -LSB-
December 20	DATE	and
Garnett	PERSON	was begun .

		The letters of this period are the most valuable of the collection .

		They offer no sweeping revelations about
Shelley	PERSON	, for the sufficient reason that their discoveries have already been embodied in published works .

		But their arguments pro and con and their numerous citations of elusive evidence make them useful for reference .

		The most important general fact to be elicited from them is that of
Dowden	PERSON	's independence of the poet 's family .

		It has been supposed that he deferred too much to Sir
Percy Shelley	PERSON	.

		These letters show clearly that he fol - lowed his own opinion in essentials , though at times he softened mere expressions , and was always open to suggestions from the magnani - mous
Garnett	PERSON	.

		THE PACIFIC OCEAN IN HISTORY .

		Edited by
H. Morse Stephens	PERSON	and

		Macmillan ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		Among the meetings held at the
Panama	LOCATION	-
Pacific International Exposition	ORGANIZATION	in
San Francisco	LOCATION	in
1915	DATE	was that of the
Panama Pacific Histori	LOCATION	- cal
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		This volume , `` The Pacific Ocean in History , '' contains a record of that congress , and in title indicates the scope of the historical interests represented .

		Edited by
H. Morse Stephens	PERSON	and
Herbert E. Bolton	PERSON	, the work is assured the careful attention of scholars , par - ticularly when each finds included under the comprehensive but vague appellation papers in his own special field .

		There are twenty-four papers upon subjects more or less remotely connected with the `` Pacific Ocean Area . ''

		They are divided into six sections , -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` The
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	and their History as a Part of the History of the
Pacific Ocean Area	LOCATION	, '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` The Northwest - ern States ,
British Columbia	LOCATION	, and

California	LOCATION	, '' -LRB- 5 -RRB- ``
New Mexico	LOCATION	and
Arizona	LOCATION	, '' and -LRB- 6 -RRB- ``
Japan	LOCATION	and
Australasia	LOCATION	. ''

		Indicative of the range of the papers read in these sections may be cited `` The Western Ocean as a Deter - minant in
Oregon	LOCATION	History , '' `` British Influence in
Mexico	LOCATION	, 1822-26 , '' `` French Intrusions in
New Mexico	LOCATION	,
1749	DATE	, '' and ``
Japan	LOCATION	's Early Attempts to Establish Commercial Relations with
Mexico	LOCATION	. ''

		Ten of the papers are by representatives of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	, and fourteen are in the field of Spanish-American history .

		The volume is largely a
University of California	ORGANIZATION	product , the result of the combined energies of Professor
Stephens	PERSON	in his managerial capacity and of Pro- fessor
Bolton	PERSON	in his remarkably productive sem - inary .

		Much of the book is not of interest to the layman .

		But this is not true of the opening ad - dress of Professor
Stephens	PERSON	, in which he dis - courses upon the conflict of
European Nations	ORGANIZATION	in the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		His wide view of international re - lations of the past four hundred years may well enlarge the horizon of many a casual reader .

		A brief but careful survey of
California	LOCATION	history down to 1850 is included , and
Horace Davis	PERSON	contributes a paper on the `` Home Guard '' of
1861	DATE	.

		THE
CAMBRIDGE	LOCATION	HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE .

		Vol .

		I. Edited by
William Peterfield Trent	PERSON	,
John Erskine	PERSON	,
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	, and
Carl Van Doren	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		This work , the first volume of which is just issued , purposes doing for American literature in three volumes what the
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature has done for the older coun - try in fourteen .

		The editors believe that to write the intellectual history of
America	LOCATION	from the mod - ern aesthetic standpoint would be to miss precisely what makes it significant among modern liter - atures .

		A people that devoted its main energies to exploration , settlement , labor for sustenance , religion , and statecraft had no time and no disposition to pursue art for art 's sake .

		Yet conditions which operated unfavorably for the development of poetry and fiction were `` no seri - ous handicap to the production of a prose com - petently recording their practical activities and expressing their moral , religious , and political ideas . ''

		This view once adopted , the work of
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	is indeed worth more than some imitative didactic poem in heroic couplets , and `` The Federalist '' of more account than con - temporary attempts at novel-writing .

		The pres - ent volume , therefore , is largely taken up by the theologians and political writers of the eighteenth century though there is an opening chapter on early travellers and explorers .

		This part of the volume has also a fine , upstanding chapter on
Franklin	PERSON	, by Professor
Sherman	PERSON	, of Urbnm .

		Later on , due attention is bestowed upon Irving .

		Cooper ,
Bryant	PERSON	, and
Emerson	PERSON	, the latter section being handled by
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	.

		A chapter on transcendentalism , introducing this , is by Pro- fessor
Goddard	PERSON	, of
Swarthmore College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is one of the best pieces of work in the volume , but its title , curiously enough , is omitted from the table of contents .

		There are also pages on the early essayists , dramatists , poets , and historians who were , of course , mostly imitative echoes from the days of Queen
Anne	PERSON	.

		Of the 584 pages of the volume , 200 are taken up by a laborious bibliography .

		Now that the foundations of the history are laid , perhaps the superstructure will exhibit a lighter and more attractive aspect .

		One would welcome a smaller measure of compilation and a larger manifesta - tion of the critical and the appreciatory .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 647 ox NEW FICTION The republf cation of Mr.
E. W. Howe	PERSON	's `` Story of a Country Town '' -LRB- Harper ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- will call the attention of many people perhaps for the first time to what is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable novels ever written in this country .

		Composed thirty-five years ago , in the spare moments of a lonely Kansas editor 's life , the book has had a continuous circulation , though with a curiously submerged reputation .

		It somehow never got itself into the canon of American classics , to which it so rightfully be - longs .

		Perhaps this is because it defies all the laws of what is generally supposed to be congenial to the American imagination .

		It is austere and slightly ironic in tone ; it pictures a stagnant and more or less defeated pioneer count ^ side ; it has no trace of moralism ; and it is distinctly pessi - mistic in its outlook .

		There is nowhere the popular American theme of redemption .

		The incredibly pathetic and tragic story of
Jo Ewing	PERSON	moves to its dramatic close without the allevia - tion of sentimentality .

		There is about the book a good deal of the remorseless fate that we feel in the `` Spoon River Anthology . ''

		This young novelist pierced through the layers of optimism and mawkishness that popular writers are apt to smother American life in , and told the cold and arid truth about his environment as he saw it .

		It is a realism colored by a pale romantic glow , and by a singularly sustained mood of resignation .

		This story suggests nothing but itself .

		The names of some of the characters suggest an allegorical intention , but the allegory is not insistent .

		The plot has an intensity of feeling and an almost classic contour that one associates with no other American novel .

		The style is extraordinarily simple , flowing , and vigor - ous , perfectly adapted to the primitive emotional life and relations it describes .

		The touching naivete of the narration brings out all of these qualities .

		There is hardly anything about the book that is not an anomaly .

		Strangest of all perhaps is the fact that the story was much appreciated by the American reviewers when it came out , and the first edition , as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	reports in his preface , was sold out in the very community where the story was produced and about which it was written .

		Its renaissance now is a fortunate event .

		The sentimentality in which the novelist clothes the woman who has broken convention is nowadays as conventionally inevitable as the actual attitude toward her in real life .


Emerson Hough	PERSON	in `` The Broken Gate '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- does not deviate from that narrow path of fictional possibility .

		The mother of
Don Lane	PERSON	, instead of leaving the town where she was known , bravely lived there , as a milliner , for twenty years , while she supported the son she had sent away from her .

		It is a fine opportunity for pathos , and the author may be counted on to make the most of it .

		In `` The Youth Plupy , or The Lad with a Downy Chin '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- ,
Henry A. Shute	PERSON	records the further adventures , chiefly amatory , of the hero-author of `` The Real Diary of a Real Boy . ''

		Whether considered as a study of adolescence , as a story about boys for grown-ups , as a book of delicious humor , or as so much additional information about that com - pellingly interesting lad ,
Plupy	LOCATION	, this episodical narrative , which reaches its climax in a pair of good old-fashioned fist-fights , is capital reading first-class for the fag-end of a weary day .

		`` The Love Letters of St. John '' -LRB-
Kennerley	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , forty-seven in number , subjectively re - late the suppositive love story of the Apostle
John and Antione	PERSON	, one of the Greek hetaerae .

		The burden of St.
John	PERSON	's communications is that `` the Word that he spake unto us , the God that he showed and declared unto us , is only Love .

		There is no other power and this is the life of every living thing .

		It is the Word that was made flesh and dwelt among us .

		It is the bread of life , the only door into the
Sheepfold	LOCATION	, the only rock on which to build , the only way of salvation for the world ... ''
Antione	PERSON	's replies sigh for the vanished `` fragrance of that wondrous hour '' of love .

		Obviously , the Apostle is constantly talking about the love that is of the Father , while
Antione	PERSON	speaks of love only in terms of the flesh .

		It is not surprising , there - fore , that the liaison ends in tragedy , which John attempts to ameliorate by sardonically assuring
Xenia	LOCATION	, the love-child of
Antione	PERSON	and a former paramour , that `` greater love hath no man than this , that he lay down his life for those who are only his friends . ''

		The follower of Dionysus will find little in the volume to take seriously .

		The obvious and the sentimental are well dis - guised in `` The Inner Door , '' by
Alan Sullivan	PERSON	-LRB- Century ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The sincerity of the author is one factor in the disguise , his fair characteriza - tion and his utilization of the subjects of the day are others .

		They are likely to carry the reader along on a high tide of interested accep - tance .

		But if one considers his story carefully , the fact becomes clear that he has presented only the more obvious questions in the conflict between labor and capital , the more obvious conflict be - tween real and fancied romance in the heart of his hero , and that he has thrown about them a sentimental glamour that no amount of force - ful writing can conceal .

		The book is a good example of the so-called better type of American novel with which the general reading public is wont to satisfy itself .

		648 THE DIAL -LSB- Decembr CASUAL .

		COMMENT THOSE WHO READ ONLY THE HEADLINES AND THE EDITORIAL COMMENT in the daily press must have got a singularly inadequate notion of the President 's message to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		As usual , the editors took considerable pains to veil as far as possible Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's incorrigible idealism , which they appear to regard as an inexplicable bias to be tolerated rather than a programme to be adopted .

		In particular , they fear anything like a candid and specific statement of what we expect to win by the war , and the whole of the Presi - dent 's clear and frank sketching of our construc - tive purpose was generally ignored as irrelevant and premature if not visionary and that , too , in spite of his home thrust about
Russia	LOCATION	, whose present plight is a standing reproach to Allied statesmanship .

		What could more convincingly show the costliness of an evasive and doubtful attitude to the fundamental issues of the war than the loss of
Russia	LOCATION	's effective cooperation and the alienation of her sympathy ?

		If suspicion could have been allayed by plain speech and a policy outlined that was untainted by self-seeking and purely nationalistic ambitions , the President believes that the present chaos might have been averted .

		At least there was a chance , of which a flexible statesmanship , awake to the strategic value of candor in dealing with democratic masses , would have hastened to avail itself .

		The President 's stressing of this point and his feeling that , in spite of the apathy of the press , he has the support of plain men in his hopes for a peace based on give and take , a peace which can not be established without concessions on the part of the victors as well as the vanquished , show once more his gift for interpreting the real national will .

		IN CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES , for more centuries than it is heartening to count , the barometer of social liberalism has been the position of the Jews .

		The treatment of this people has become the gauge of social progress since the exclusion of Jews from the common life of
Europe	LOCATION	in the fourth century .

		Step by step they have gained entrance again into the comity of nations , and their advance has kept pace with the growth of freedom among the Christian peoples themselves .

		The test of the French Revolution 's `` rights of man '' was the rights of the individual Jew ; and in the last century western
Europe	LOCATION	has gradually met and passed the test .

		The test of the Russian revolution will be in a measure the same .

		If it is passed , the individual Jew will practically every - where be a citizen .

		Above individual rights , however , stand national rights .

		International democracy , the rights of nations great or small , can be , perhaps must be , measured by the recogni - tion bestowed on the Jewish nation .

		It is , there - fore , a source of gratification to all liberals that the British government has pledged its support to the `` establishment in Palestine of a national homeland for the Jewish people . ''

		After two thousand years of exile not only from his own land but from the community of nations as well .

		the Jew is given the encouragement of recogni - tion .

		The sincerity of liberalism is certified .

		The world could reap no greater reward for granting the Jew opportunity to develop his culture freely than the gift of that culture itself .

		In this serv - ice lies the responsibility of the Jewish people , in
Palestine	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		THE `` CASE '' OF NIETZSCHE continues to oc - cupy the
Paris	LOCATION	reviews .

		Obviously , it would be naive to link him with
Bernhardi	PERSON	,
Treitschke	PERSON	, and the other howling dervishes of the ``
Deutsch	PERSON	- land iiber Alles '' cult .

		He shared their hopes no more than their illusions as to the German mis - sion ; on the contrary ' , he was a `` good European , '' who saw in that nevrose nationale which fas - tened itself on his countrymen after the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian War only the sacrifice of the German mind to the
German Empire	ORGANIZATION	and the impending death of culture .

		Nothing more easily reused his fury than the religion of nationalism .

		For the petty state system which has to plant itself `` between two hatreds '' to keep from collapsing , he had nothing but scorn , and he was filled with the holy rage of the philosopher in the presence of all the fatuities and follies that accompanied the growth of the national vanity in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Small danger of his mistaking the joyous Junkers for Overmen .

		There is , in fact , an exquisite irony in the fact that the writings of this fas - tidious and perverse solitary should have played their part in helping to spread a culture which he loathed as the very negation of spiritual values , as something heavy and uninspired , a grotesque mingling of tasteless borrowings and bungling imitation .

		He prided himself most on remaining an alien among the German people and carrying his admirations elsewhere chiefly to
France	LOCATION	.

		He even turned the Germans he admired into foreigners in order to admire them comfortably .


Wagner	PERSON	is a case in point ; Wag - ner the `` opposite and the incarnate contradic - tion of all ` German virtues . ' ''

		In the French he saw the only modern people who had pro- duced a genuine culture , and in the last book he wrote he was betrayed into ludicrous excesses of praise for the French genius .

		These , to be sure , were the lengthening shadows of the sunset ; but they were extensions rather than deflections of his lifelong bias , which showed a constantly growing exasperation with the German mind and a derisive amusement at the antics of the `` poor
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 649 bear '' attempting to dance to the tune of civiliza - tion .

		The French are certainly right to feel that they can not afford to throw
Nietzsche	PERSON	over ; he is the most fanatical modern spokesman for their culture .

		And as for the Germans , if they are able to read a flattering account of their national aspirations into the works of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, then
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is right in his valuation of the German mind .

		SINCE THE EFFORTS OF THE ENERGETIC MR. HEARST to make literature hum among us have been crowned with complete success , what could be more remarkable than the humility with which he views his triumphs ?

		He gives no evi - dence of elation , much less of surprise .

		His formula for success is simplicity itself , as he admits in the case of one of his most popular magazines .

		It is to establish an honorable monop - oly of `` the luminous figure of every man or woman in the world who has attained the apex of artistic achievement ... The singers and the poets and the philosophers , the dreamers and the doers who have reached the mountain height .

		The goodly company of rare spirits whom all the world recognizes for their rarity . ''

		To make the best also the most popular is a prob - lem that has worried sociologists , but it does not worry Mr.
Hearst	PERSON	.

		His simple , democratic faith allows him to reverse the formula and establish popularity as the true criterion of the best .

		THE FEAR OF LIBRARIES is becoming one of the commonest forms of modern neurosis .

		Even casual readers are likely to have a touch of it , though it may amount to nothing more than an occasional shudder in the presence of mountain - ous heaps of books which they have never read and never hope to read .

		After wandering for half an hour among the stacks , they will be seized by paralysis of the will and rush into the open air to escape the necessity of making a choice .

		But the chief sufferer is the specialist , since he is constantly browbeaten not by books alone , but by magazines and reviews as well .

		His learning may be prodigious ; he may have ab - sorbed whole libraries ; but if he has missed the newest pamphlet or overlooked the latest book - review , he is no longer abreast of his subject .

		It is a fear capable of robbing him of all courage and peace of mind , and the resulting irritation is likely to disturb the peace of his family .

		The re - volt of the futurists and the vorticists is partly an attempt to escape from the neurosis of libraries and museums and to vindicate the right to life and the pursuit of happiness of even an ignorant ego .

		It is a reaching out for liberty , and however grotesque the means may seem , the impulse itself is sacred .
